AB  - Abstract Background: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively determine the clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT). Methods: Six cases of prenatal SCT were identified from January 1985 until August 2005. A retrospective review of case-notes and pathological reports was carried out. Clinical data during the perinatal period, operative findings, postoperative complications and follow up were evaluated in the patients with prenatally diagnosed SCT. Results: SCT presented as type I in two neonates and type III in four between 22 and 33?weeks? gestation. Fetal intervention was not performed for any fetus. Five of six were delivered by cesarean section and the other was delivered vaginally due to small tumor size. Patients were born at between 29 and 39?weeks? gestation and weighed from 1840 to 3500?g. All patients with type III SCT presented with related diseases, including bilateral hydronephrosis, neurological deficit of the communicating peroneal nerve such as paralytic talipes equines, bladder or bowel dysfunction, high-output cardiac failure, or fetal hydrops in one of a set of fraternal twins. A baby with high-output cardiac failure and fetal hydrops underwent urgent cesarean section at 29?weeks? gestation and died 8?days after birth despite intensive care due to multi-organ failure. In five cases, surgery was successful with good outcomes maintained at follow-up of between 8?months and 14?years. Conclusions: Detailed ultrasound should be performed to rule out associated anomalies, and determine the presence or absence of hydrops in prenatally diagnosed SCT. Fetal hydrops, orthopedic impairment such as lower extremity weakness and swelling, and urinary incontinence are important clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed SCT. In particular, the present study indicated that the association of a fraternal twin and fetal hydrops makes it very difficult to treat SCT perinatally.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - Periodontitis in cats infrequently leads to facial abscess development but should always be considered as an underlying cause of this common problem. Without removal of the underlying cause of an abscess it will probably reoccur as soon as antibiotic or anti-inflammatory treatment ends. For this reason, it is important to identify dental disease as a possible underlying cause of these abscesses. This case demonstrates very effectively that an accurate diagnosis and the formulation of an effective treatment plan would be impossible without the use of intraoral radiography. The fact that no effective decisions about diagnosis and treatment of tooth resorption are possible without the use of radiography is underlined by this case.

AB  - Abstract Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - This study was performed primarily to clarify whether pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection is possible using postmortem imaging (PMI), and whether this is worthwhile. A total of 33 cadavers that underwent systematic anatomical dissection at our medical school also underwent PMI. Fixative solution was injected into the corpus 3?4 days after death. PMI was then performed using an 8-slice multi-detector CT scanner 3 months before dissection. Before dissection, a conference was held to discuss the findings of the PMI. First, two radiologists read the postmortem images without any medical information and deduced the immediate cause of death. Then, the anatomy instructor revealed the medical information available. Based on this information, the radiologist, anatomy instructor, and pathologists suggested candidate sampling sites for pathological examination. On the last day of the dissection period, the pathologists resected the sample tissues and processed them for pathological examination. In 12 of 33 cases, the presumed causes of death could be determined based on PMI alone, and revision of the cause of death described in the death certificate was considered in five (15.2%) cases, based on PMI and pathological analysis. This article presents a novel method of pathological analysis of cadavers for anatomical dissection using PMI without disturbing the anatomy education of medical students.

AB  - Abstract Many studies on stem cell plasticity are challenging the concept that stem cells contain an intrinsically predefined, unidirectional differentiation program. This means that the developmental fate of a stem cell is dependent on the general potential of the cell (pre-determined stem cell fate) as well as on microenvironmental cues, such as stimuli from growth factors (stem cell niche). Here, we reviewed reports that examined the hepatocyte differentiation ability of stem cells from two different sources: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. All of those stem cells revealed the ability to give rise to hepatocyte-like cells using different induction strategies. However, it is still not clear which of those stem cells would be the best source for hepatocyte replacement or which would be the best protocol. We herein present the current knowledge regarding available protocols and factors used in order to obtain functional hepatocytes from stem cells.

AB  - Aim To estimate changes in home participation among critically ill children in the first 6 months after discharge from a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and to explore the effect of child, service, and environmental factors on change in home participation. Method This was a prospective bi-center, longitudinal cohort study. Caregivers of 180 children, aged 1 to 17 years, who were admitted into the PICU for at least 48 hours were included. Patient-reported outcomes were used to capture caregivers? perspectives of their child's participation and environmental supports for participation in home activities. Data were collected at enrollment, and 3 and 6 months after discharge. Results There were no significant changes in home participation frequency or involvement, but involvement rates across time were moderated by functional status. Age significantly predicted participation frequency. Pre-PICU functional status and capabilities were significant predictors of participation frequency and involvement, and home environmental support significantly predicted home involvement. Interpretation Results suggest relatively stable participation trajectories in the 6 months after PICU admission. Children with abnormal baseline function experienced a greater increase in home involvement after PICU. Rehabilitation interventions targeting functional capabilities and home environment may be viable approaches during the early phase of recovery. Environmental interventions may be more time-efficient after PICU stay and merit further study. What this paper adds Children's pre-pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) functional status and capabilities impact their participation after critical illness. Children's trajectories of home involvement may differ over time based on their pre-PICU functional status. Caregiver perceptions of environmental support impact a child's home involvement after discharge from a PICU.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration is common among men who use substances. Substance use is a contributing factor for IPV perpetration. This cross-sectional study determined lifetime prevalence and factors associated with ever perpetrating IPV by men receiving substance use treatment in Brazil (n?=?281) and England (n?=?223). Design and Methods IPV, adverse childhood experiences, attitudes towards gender relations and roles, current health state, substance use, depressive symptoms and anger expression were assessed. Logistic regression determined factors associated with ever perpetrating any (emotional, physical and/or sexual) IPV. Multinomial logistic regression determined factors associated with ever perpetrating different types of IPV. Results 74.6% (373/500) reported ever perpetrating IPV: 16.5% (82/498) emotional IPV only, 46.4% (231/498) physical IPV (with/without emotional IPV) and 11.6% (58/498) sexual IPV (with/without emotional and/or physical IPV). Higher anger expression, higher depressive symptoms, fighting physically with another man in the past year (Brazil only), experiencing a greater number of adverse childhood experiences and a higher hazardous drinking score (England only) predicted ever perpetrating IPV. Compared to never perpetrating any IPV, anger expression was associated with emotional and physical IPV perpetration; fighting physically with another man in the past year was associated with physical IPV perpetration and experiencing a greater number of adverse childhood experiences and a higher hazardous drinking score were associated with both physical and sexual IPV perpetration. Discussion and Conclusions Integrated interventions that address IPV and substance use delivered in substance use treatment could improve outcomes for perpetrators and victims.[Gilchrist G, Radcliffe P, Noto AR, d'Oliveira AFPL.

AB  - Introduction Viscosupplementation can improve function in haemophilia patients. Viscosupplementation results can be improved by prior joint lavage and triamcinolone administration. Aim To objectively assess whether viscosupplementation and associated triamcinolone use in patients with severe haemophilic arthropathy following joint lavage improves force and balance and reduces bleeding events. Methods Fourteen patients with haemophilic knee arthritis with and without the involvement of other joints underwent joint lavage and subsequent injections of Hylan G-F20 and triamcinolone into all affected joints. Patients were evaluated with NeuroCom? force and balance platforms using the step-up-and-over task (STP), sit-to-stand test (STS), one-leg stance (UNI) and weight-bearing squat (WBS) at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Bleeding events in the year prior to and the year after the procedure were analysed. Results Sixteen knees, 15 ankles, eight elbows and one shoulder were treated. The STP results indicated improvements in the lift-up indices (right leg) at all time points evaluated (P = 0.03). The STS results revealed coupled improvement in weight transfer and the rising index for up to a year (P = 0.02). Balance (UNI) with eyes open or closed improved in all evaluations. The WBS results revealed improvements at all degrees of flexion (0, P = 0.003; 30°, P = 0.001; 60°, P < 0.001 and 90°, P < 0.001). The numbers of total and traumatic bleeding events were reduced (P = 0.04). Conclusion Joint lavage followed by injections of triamcinolone and Hylan G-F20 improved balance, function and bleeding events in severe haemophilic arthropathy patients.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Clinical and point-of-care disease diagnostics promise to play an important role in personalized medicine, new approaches to global health, and health monitoring. Emerging instrument platforms based on lab-on-a-chip technology can confer perfomance advantages successfully exploited in electrophoresis and electrochromatography to affinity-based electrokinetic separations. This review surveys lab-on-a-chip diagnostic developments in affinity-based electokinetic separations for quantitation of proteins, integration of preparatory functions needed for subsequent analysis of diverse biological samples, and initial forays into multiplexed analyses. The technologies detailed here underpin new clinical and point-of-care diagnostic strategies. The techniques and devices promise to advance translation of until now laborabory-based sample preparation and analytical assays to near-patient settings.
