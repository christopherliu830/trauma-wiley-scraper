AB  - Abstract The pelvis of the infant and child has different anatomic relationships than the adolescent or adult pelvis, and the knowledge of congenital anomalies of the rectum and bladder can assist in treating the primary neoplasms of the pelvis. The most common neoplasms are rhabdomyosarcomas of the bladder, prostate, and vagina; sacrococcygeal teratoma; and the germ cell tumors, including teratomas, endodermal sinus tumors, and the choriocarcinomas. Rapidly improving chemotherapy for all of these lesions has resulted in a changed role for the surgeon. Less radical resection of these tumors is being performed whereas it is necessary to have more precise histologic and genetic identification of the tumor and the specific anatomic location and extent of the tumor in the pelvis. Survival for all types of childhood pelvic neoplasms has improved dramatically under the influence of the combined children's cancer study groups, which have been functioning for the last 20 years. Because of the complexities of diagnosis and treatment of these pelvic neoplasms in childhood and because the survival rates have dramatically improved with the most current therapy, these children should be cared for in a children's center that is part of the major children's cancer study groups.

AB  - The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that sorafenib-related dermatologic adverse events (AEs) as an early biomarker can predict the long-term outcomes following the combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib (TACE-S). The intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received either TACE-S or TACE-alone treatment were consecutively included into analysis. In the TACE-S group, patients with?≥?grade 2 dermatologic AEs within the first month of sorafenib initiation were defined as responders; whereas those with?<?grade 2 were defined as nonresponders. In the TACE-S group, the median overall survival (OS) of the responders was significantly longer than that of nonresponders (28.9 months vs. 16.8 months, respectively; p?=?0.004). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that nonresponders were significantly associated with an increased risk of death compared with responders (HR?=?1.9; 95% confidence Interval-CI: 1.3?2.7; p?=?0.001). The survival analysis showed that the median OS was 27.9 months (95% CI: 25.0?30.8) among responders treated with TACE-S vs.18.3 months (95% CI: 14.5?22.1) among those who received TACE-alone (p?=?0.046). The median time to progression was 13.1 months (95% CI: 4.4?21.8) in the TACE-S group, a duration that was significantly longer than that in the TACE-alone group [5 months (95% CI: 6.4?13.3), p?=?0.014]. This study demonstrated that sorafenib-related dermatologic AEs are clinical biomarkers to identify responders from all of the patients for TACE-S therapy. Sorafenib-related dermatologic AEs, clinical biomarkers, can predict the efficacy of TACE-S in future randomized controlled trials.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 362?373. Abstract The normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPC) has been shown to exhibit a diverse range of biological activities. Several recent studies highlighted potential involvement of PrPC in embryogenesis or in regulating stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. In the current study, we employed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) for assessing the potential role of prion protein in early human development. Here, we showed that treatment of hESCs with full-length recombinant PrP folded into an α-helical conformation similar to that of PrPC delayed the spontaneous differentiation of hESCs and helped to maintain their high proliferation activity during spontaneous differentiation. Considering that administration of α-rPrP was also found to down-regulate the expression of endogenous PrPC, the effects of α-rPrP were likely to be indirect, i.e. executed by endogenous PrPC. Together with previous observations, these work support the hypothesis that PrPC is involved in regulating self-renewal/differentiation status of stem cells including hESCs.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.
