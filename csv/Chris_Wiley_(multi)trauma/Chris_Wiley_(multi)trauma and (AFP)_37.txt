AB  - Summary The main objective of antenatal care is to support the woman through pregnancy and to monitor the health and well-being of the woman and fetus. It is important to recognise that depression, anxiety and stress during pregnancy are at least as common as an altered emotional state during the puerperium. Blood tests in pregnancy fall into two main categories, diagnostic and screening. Any degree of bleeding in pregnancy is not normal and needs urgent attention in order to identify and manage the cause. The potential for new life begins at fertilisation and culminates with the birth of the baby. Diagnosis of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) places women in a higher risk category, requiring care from a multidisciplinary team. Pregnancy poses a significant immunological challenge to the mother's immune system. Minor disorders of pregnancy are rarely life threatening but can be the cause of discomfort and distress for many women.

AB  - Abstract Motivation Reform coalitions represent a potential means for donors to support macro-political reform in developing countries, enabling them to avoid the limitations of micro-political or public sector reform where appropriate circumstances exist. Donor support for reform coalitions, however, is difficult to engineer and fraught with political risk, including the risk of partisan taint. Purpose This article therefore explores the efforts of Australian Aid and the World Bank to promote reform coalitions and constituencies in the Philippines during the Presidency of Benigno S. Aquino III (2010-2016) and to institutionalise the reform agenda of his administration. Approach and Methods It draws on a range of sources including programme design documents, mid-term & end-of-term reviews, and contextual policy documents. It also draws on economic and governance data sets to explore relevant correlations Findings It finds that second-generation reform coalitions brought together stakeholders from government, the private sector and civil society and promoted both economic and other reforms. These donor strategies arguably failed, however, with the election of Rodrigo Duterte in May 2016, a President critical of Aquino?s record of office and ostensibly committed to reverse-engineering many of the Aquino administration?s positive achievements. The article critiques a governance-centric explanatory chain of causation and proposes an expanded politics-centric chain. Policy Implications In conceptual terms, planning of reform coalition activities must better account for dominant coalitions and the political settlements which they underpin and must set out explicit theories of change, specifying distinct political pathways to change. In operational terms, donors must work to avoid traditional 'transactional' relationships in favour of more innovative 'transformative' ones and must balance 'strategic opportunism' with strategic retreat and adaptation where necessary.

AB  - Four autopsy cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with kuru-like plaques are presented. The plaques are widely distributed throughout the brain and their morphology seems to be very similar, if not identical, to kuru plaques. The histological and ultrastructural features of the plaques are described, compared with kuru plaques and senile plaques. The comparison between Japanese CJD with kuru-like plaques and similar cases in foreign countries and their nosological problem are discussed.
