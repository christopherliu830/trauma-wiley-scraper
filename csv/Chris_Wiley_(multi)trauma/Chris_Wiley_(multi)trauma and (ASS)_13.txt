AB  - Abstract Title.? Short- and long-term impact of critical illness on relatives: literature review. Aim.? This paper is a report of a literature review undertaken to identify the short- and long-term impact of critical illness on relatives. Background.? Patients in intensive care can experience physical and psychological consequences, and their relatives may also experience such effects. Although it is recognized that relatives have specific needs, it is not clear whether these needs are always met and whether further support is required, particularly after intensive care. Data sources.? The following databases were searched for the period 1950?2007: Medline, British Nursing Index and Archive, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMB Reviews ? Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials. Search methods.? Search terms focused on adult relatives of critically ill adult patients during and after intensive care. Recurrent topics were categorized to structure the review, i.e. ?relatives needs?, ?meeting relatives? needs?, ?interventions?, ?satisfaction?, ?psychological outcomes? and ?coping?. Results.? Studies have mainly identified relatives? immediate needs using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. There are few studies of interventions to meet relatives? needs and the short- and long-term effects of critical illness on relatives. Conclusion.? Despite widespread use of the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory, factors such as local or cultural differences may influence relatives? needs. Relatives may also have unidentified needs, and these needs should be explored. Limited research has been carried out into interventions to meet relatives? needs and the effects of critical illness on their well-being, yet some relatives may experience negative psychological consequences far beyond the acute phase of the illness.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in cDNA microarray technology have made it possible to analyze expression of several thousand genes at the same time. Using this technique, gene expression in human astrocytes cultured from glaucomatous and normal optic nerve heads (ONH) was compared. One hundred-fifty genes were differentially expressed more than 5-fold in glaucomatous cell cultures compared with normal. These genes are involved in a number of biological processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion and proliferation, ECM synthesis, and degradation. Confirmation of differential gene expression was performed by quantitative RT-PCR. Western blots and immunohistochemistry demonstrated gene products in cell cultures or in human ONH tissues. Proliferation, adhesion and migration assays tested physiological responses suggested by differential gene expression. Our study suggests that cultured glaucomatous ONH astrocytes retain in culture many phenotypic characteristics that may be relevant to their role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and, in general to reactive astrocytes in the CNS. Potential applications of these data include the identification and characterization of signaling pathways involved in astrocyte function, studies of the role of steroid-metabolizing enzymes in the glaucomatous ONH, and further exploration of the role of selected identified genes in experimental animal and in vitro models of glaucoma.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.
