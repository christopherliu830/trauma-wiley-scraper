AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the clinical and epidemiological features of an outbreak of a viral infection affecting humans and horses. SettingStables in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane. SubjectsAffected horses and humans, and at-risk human contacts. Results: A pregnant mare died two days after arrival from a paddock elsewhere in Brisbane. Eight to 11 days later, illness (depression, anorexia, fever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal discharge) was reported among 17 other horses from the same or an adjoining stable. Fourteen horses died or were put down. Five and six days after the index mare's death, a stable-hand and then a horse trainer, both of whom had had close contact with the sick mare's mucous secretions, developed influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand recovered but the trainer developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis, and died from a cardiac arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A morbillivirus cultured from his kidney was identical to one isolated from the lungs of five affected horses. The two affected humans and eight other horses were seropositive for the infection, which was reproduced in healthy horses following challenge by spleen/lung homogenates from infected horses. There was no serological evidence of infection in 157 humans who had had contact with the stables or the sick horses or humans. ConclusionsA previously undescribed morbillivirus infected a probable 21 horses and two humans; one human and 14 horses died. That no further cases were detected among humans suggests that the virus was of low infectivity. The source of infection remains undetermined.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

AB  - The synthesis of factors that monitor the expression of the Thy-l cell surface component by marker-negative precursor cells requires an intact left cerebral cortex, whereas the activity of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, an immunopotentiator that increases this synthesis, seems to require an intact right neocortex. These results suggest a role for the cerebral cortex in the coordinated interregulation of lymphocyte subclasses. The finding extends previous information suggesting relationships between the central nervous system and the T-cell arm of the immune system.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the principle clinical features of the peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG), and to recognise clinical features of PGCG that are poorly defined. DESIGN: We reviewed retrospectivety 77 cases of PGCG from 62 patients, from our files with respect to incidence, sex, patient age, race, clinical symptoms and signs, radio-graphic features and recurrence following excision. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results were largety in agreement with previous reports, although there is wide variation in the results published between series. In addition, some clinical features of PGCG are poorly defined. Little is known about the retative incidences of PGCG and central giant cell granuloma. An association between PGCG and tooth loss may exist, but is poorly defined, and not all PGCG that involve edentulous areas follow recent tooth loss. Information about PGCG recurrence after excision is limited, and does not necessarily follow incomplete excision. Despite the large number of reported cases of PGCG, clarification of some clinical features is required, and may hetp formulation and interpretation of future laboratory-based research into this poorly understood lesion.
