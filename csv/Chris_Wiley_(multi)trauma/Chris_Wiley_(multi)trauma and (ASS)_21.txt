AB  - Asthma has generally been thought to result from exposure to allergens in infancy leading to atopy, and eventually to airway hyperresponsiveness. There is now evidence that implicates absence of childhood infections as a factor in development of asthma. Childhood infections seem to be important in normal maturation of the immune system, with asthma a manifestation of a persistent ?immature? immune system.

AB  - Abstract Advances in preoperative care, surgical techniques and technologies have enabled surgeons to achieve primary closure in a high percentage of surgical procedures. However, often, underlying patient comorbidities in addition to surgical-related factors make the management of surgical wounds primary closure challenging because of the higher risk of developing complications. To date, extensive evidence exists, which demonstrate the benefits of negative pressure dressing in the treatment of open wounds; recently, Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (INPWT) technology as delivered by Prevena? (KCI USA, Inc., San Antonio, TX) and Pico (Smith & Nephew Inc, Andover, MA) systems has been the focus of a new investigation on possible prophylactic measures to prevent complications via application immediately after surgery in high-risk, clean, closed surgical incisions. A systematic review was performed to evaluate INPWT's effect on surgical sites healing by primary intention. The primary outcomes of interest are an understanding of INPWT functioning and mechanisms of action, extrapolated from animal and biomedical engineering studies and incidence of complications (infection, dehiscence, seroma, hematoma, skin and fat necrosis, skin and fascial dehiscence or blistering) and other variables influenced by applying INPWT (re-operation and re-hospitalization rates, time to dry wound, cost saving) extrapolated from human studies. A search was conducted for published articles in various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus Database from 2006 to March 2014. Supplemental searches were performed using reference lists and conference proceedings. Studies selection was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and data extraction regarding study quality, model investigated, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and type of surgery, and the outcomes were applied to all the articles included. 1 biomedical engineering study, 2 animal studies, 15 human studies for a total of 6 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective cohort studies, 7 retrospective analyses, were included. Human studies investigated the outcomes of 1042 incisions on 1003 patients. The literature shows a decrease in the incidence of infection, sero-haematoma formation and on the re-operation rates when using INPWT. Lower level of evidence was found on dehiscence, decreased in some studies, and was inconsistent to make a conclusion. Because of limited studies, it is difficult to make any assertions on the other variables, suggesting a requirement for further studies for proper recommendations on INPWT.

AB  - Abstract Managing pain in horses afflicted by laminitis is often a great challenge because it is the dreadful suffering of the animals that frequently forces the veterinarian to end the battle with this disease. This chapter highlights the mechanisms likely involved in generating and amplifying nociception in laminitis, thereby creating a state of maladaptive pain that is greatly resistant to conventional anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Based on this information, the concept of a multimodal approach to analgesia in the horse with laminitis is presented and targets for drug treatment are discussed. The chapter also discusses anti-hyperalgesic pain therapeutics, anti-neuropathic pain therapeutics, and loco-regional anesthesia. Pain therapy in acute and chronic laminitis has largely been based on the proposed etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, and consisted predominantly of NSAID administration. Three different pharmacological classes of drugs are commonly administered systemically to treat pain in horses affected with laminitis: NSAIDs, opioids, and lidocaine.

AB  - Feigning a psychiatric or neurological disorder may be an attractive strategy to obtain all sorts of privileges or disability benefits. In the criminal arena, feigning memory loss for a crime (crime-related amnesia) may be a way for defendants to gain sympathy or to promote a diminished capacity defence. Although crime-related amnesia may, under some circumstances, be genuine, in many cases it is more likely to be malingered. Malingered memory problems are a subtle form of deception and what is true for deceptive behaviour in general is also true for malingering memory loss: on the basis of clinical intuition alone, it is difficult to detect. Fortunately, there are methods and tools to evaluate the authenticity of memory problems. It is important that forensic and clinical psychologists familiarize themselves with these techniques.
