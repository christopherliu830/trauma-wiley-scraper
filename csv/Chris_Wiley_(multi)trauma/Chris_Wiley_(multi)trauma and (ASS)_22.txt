AB  - Abstract Managing pain in horses afflicted by laminitis is often a great challenge because it is the dreadful suffering of the animals that frequently forces the veterinarian to end the battle with this disease. This chapter highlights the mechanisms likely involved in generating and amplifying nociception in laminitis, thereby creating a state of maladaptive pain that is greatly resistant to conventional anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Based on this information, the concept of a multimodal approach to analgesia in the horse with laminitis is presented and targets for drug treatment are discussed. The chapter also discusses anti-hyperalgesic pain therapeutics, anti-neuropathic pain therapeutics, and loco-regional anesthesia. Pain therapy in acute and chronic laminitis has largely been based on the proposed etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, and consisted predominantly of NSAID administration. Three different pharmacological classes of drugs are commonly administered systemically to treat pain in horses affected with laminitis: NSAIDs, opioids, and lidocaine.

AB  - Feigning a psychiatric or neurological disorder may be an attractive strategy to obtain all sorts of privileges or disability benefits. In the criminal arena, feigning memory loss for a crime (crime-related amnesia) may be a way for defendants to gain sympathy or to promote a diminished capacity defence. Although crime-related amnesia may, under some circumstances, be genuine, in many cases it is more likely to be malingered. Malingered memory problems are a subtle form of deception and what is true for deceptive behaviour in general is also true for malingering memory loss: on the basis of clinical intuition alone, it is difficult to detect. Fortunately, there are methods and tools to evaluate the authenticity of memory problems. It is important that forensic and clinical psychologists familiarize themselves with these techniques.

AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.
