AB  - Summary Toxic, nutritional and metabolic derangements can cause damage to the nervous system by a variety of mechanisms and lead to a wide spectrum of characteristic neurological disorders. This chapter includes a review of the effects of accidental and deliberate exposure to industrial and environmental toxins and drugs of addiction including alcohol. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) occurs in the liver and ovaries of puffer fish, toad fish and some types of crabs. Exposure to radiation occurs naturally but this is low intensity and carries few risks. Direct high pressure injury to the CNS leads to a progressive rest or intention tremor, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia and transient cognitive and memory disturbance. Alcohol abuse is extremely common and is associated with important cultural, economic and environmental influences and consequences. The chapter presents neurological disease seen in adult patients with inherited disorders of metabolism. It discusses the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, investigation and management of adult onset leukodystrophy.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is escalating as a global epidemic, and so far, there is neither cure nor treatment to alter its progression. The most important feature of the disease is neuronal death and loss of cognitive functions, caused probably from several pathological processes in the brain. The main neuropathological features of AD are widely described as amyloid beta (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the aggregated protein tau, which contribute to the disease. Nevertheless, AD brains suffer from a variety of alterations in function, such as energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic activity. The latest decades have seen an explosion of genes and molecules that can be employed as targets aiming to improve brain physiology, which can result in preventive strategies for AD. Moreover, therapeutics using these targets can help AD brains to sustain function during the development of AD pathology. Here, we review broadly recent information for potential targets that can modify AD through diverse pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches including gene therapy. We propose that AD could be tackled not only using combination therapies including A? and tau, but also considering insulin and cholesterol metabolism, vascular function, synaptic plasticity, epigenetics, neurovascular junction and blood?brain barrier targets that have been studied recently. We also make a case for the role of gut microbiota in AD. Our hope is to promote the continuing research of diverse targets affecting AD and promote diverse targeting as a near-future strategy.

AB  - Abstract We analyzed the role of reproductive factors on the risk of endometrial cancer using data from a case-control study conducted in Italy. Cases were 752 women with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer <75 years of age. Controls were 2,606 patients <75 years of age admitted for acute, non-gynecological non-hormone-related, non-neoplastic conditions to the same network of hospitals where cases had been identified. In comparison with nulliparae, the risk of endometrial cancer tended to be lower in parous women, and the estimated multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7, respectively, for women reporting 1, 2 and 3 or more births (?12 trend 10.21). In comparison with women reporting no induced abortion, the ORs of endometrial cancer were 0.6 in women reporting 1 and 0.4 in those reporting 2 or more induced abortions. When considering parous women only, in comparison with women reporting their last birth 20 years before or longer, the ORs of endometrial cancer were 0.6 in those reporting their last birth 10?19 years before and 0.3 in those reporting their last birth <10 years before. Our results confirm and further quantify a protective role of pregnancy on the risk of endometrial cancer and provide insights on the time-risk relationship between pregnancy and cancer of corpus uteri.

AB  - Abstract The ability of Homo sapiens to kill prey at a distance is arguably one of the catalysts for our current ecological dominance. Many researchers have suggested its origins lie in the African Middle Stone Age or the European Middle Palaeolithic (?300-30 thousand years ago), but the perishable components of armatures rarely preserve. Most research on this subject therefore emphasises analysis of armature tip size, shape, and diagnostic impacts or residues. Other lines of evidence have included human skeletal anatomy or analyses of the species composition of faunal assemblages. Projectile Impact Marks (PIMs) on archaeofaunal remains offer an ideal complement to this work, but their potential has been restricted mainly to the later Eurasian zooarchaeological record. A review of current evidence and approaches shows that systematic PIM research could add much to our understanding of early projectile technology, especially in Africa.
