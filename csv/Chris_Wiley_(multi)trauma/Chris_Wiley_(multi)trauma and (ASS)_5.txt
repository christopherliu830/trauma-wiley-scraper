AB  - Summary.? Fibrinogen, a hexameric glycoprotein encoded by three genes ?FGA, FGB, FGG? clustered on chromosome 4q is involved in the final steps of coagulation as a precursor of fibrin monomers required for the formation of the haemostatic plug. Inherited disorders of fibrinogen abnormalities are rare and not as well clinically characterized as some other inherited bleeding disorders. To characterize the clinical manifestations, molecular defects and treatment modalities of these rare disorders, a Medline search from January 1966 to September 2007 for these disorders reported in large studies and registries was undertaken. Inherited fibrinogen disorders can manifest as quantitative defects (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia) or qualitative defects (dysfibrinogenemia). Quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies may result from mutations affecting fibrinogen synthesis, or processing while qualitative defects are caused by mutations causing abnormal polymerization, defective cross-linking or defective assembly of the fibrinolytic system. Clinical manifestations vary from being asymptomatic to developing catastrophic life-threatening bleeds or thromboembolic events. Management of bleeds includes use of purified plasma-derived concentrates, cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma. Use of some of these products carries risks of viral transmission, antibody development and thromboembolic events. Establishment of registries in Iran, Italy and North America has fostered a better understanding of these disorders with an attempt to explore molecular defects. Rare Bleeding Disorder Registries developed through the United States and international efforts hopefully will encourage development and licensure of safer, effective products.

AB  - Summary Haemophilia is an inherited disorder of clotting factor deficiencies resulting in musculoskeletal bleeding, including haemarthroses, leading to orthopaedic complications. The pathogenesis of haemophilic joint arthropathy continues to be explored and there is evidence to suggest that iron, cytokines, and neo angiogenesis can initiate synovial and early cartilage damage resulting in molecular changes and the perpetuation of a chronic inflammatory state. This joint arthropathy has long term consequences for bone health resulting in chronic pain and quality of life issues in the individual with haemophilia. Haemarthroses can be prevented by the administration of clotting factor concentrates (prophylaxis). However, high costs and the need for venous access devices in younger children continue to complicate recommendations for universal prophylaxis. In patients who fail or refuse prophylaxis, procedures, such as synovectomy and arthroplasty, can provide relief from repeated haemarthroses. The optimal timing of these, however, is not well defined. Prevention of joint arthropathy needs to focus on prevention of haemarthroses through prophylaxis, identifying early joint disease through the optimal use of cost effective imaging modalities and the validation of serological markers of joint arthropathy. Screening for effects on bone health and optimal management of pain to improve quality of life are, likewise, important issues.

AB  - Seglem, K. B., Oppedal, B. & Raeder, S. (2011). Predictors of depressive symptoms among resettled unaccompanied refugee minors. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 52, 457?464. This study investigated the level and predictors of depressive symptoms among unaccompanied refugee minors after resettlement in Norway. Participants (N?=?414) were resettled in 26 municipalities from all regions of the country. The average length of resettlement time was 3.4?years. They originated from 33 different countries, mainly Afghanistan (n?=?116), Somalia (n?=?74), Sri Lanka (n?=?41) and Iraq (n?=?43). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire administered in groups. Findings show that unaccompanied minors are a high-risk group for mental health problems also after resettlement in a new country. A multilevel model predicting depressive symptoms from individual and contextual demographic factors indicated that, controlling for post-traumatic stress, females had more symptoms than males and Somalis had fewer symptoms than participants from other countries. Variation in symptom levels as a function of gender and ethnic background indicates that some groups may have inherent protective or vulnerability factors that need to be further studied to understand differences in psychosocial adaptation among unaccompanied minors. Further, findings imply that researchers, policy makers and mental health care workers need to expand their attention beyond the first phases of arrival of unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee minors to the continuing experience of mental health problems after resettlement.

AB  - Objectives??? To evaluate the feasibility and safety of head-neck cooling in conscious normal volunteers (10) and patients with medically refractory epilepsy (5) without causing shivering. Patients and methods??? We used a non-invasive head-neck cooling system (CoolSystems Inc., Lincoln, CA, USA). The tympanic temperature (TT) and intestinal temperature (IT) were measured as two measurements of ?core temperature? (CT), and multi-site external temperatures, several physiologic variables and EEG were monitored. Seizure counts over 4-week precooling, treatment and follow-up phases were compared. Results??? All 15 participants completed all the cooling sessions without significant complaints. At the end of 60?min of cooling, scalp temperature fell on average by 12.2°C (P?<?0.001), TT by 1.67°C (P?<?0.001), and IT by 0.12°C (P?=?NS). Average weekly seizure frequency decreased from 2.7 to 1.7 events per patient per week (MANOVA: P?<?0.05). Conclusions??? Non-invasive head-neck cooling is safe and well-tolerated. Initial pilot data in patients suggest that additional therapeutic studies are warranted.

AB  - Summary Septic shock is characterized by an inability of the host to maintain vascular integrity and fluid homeostasis, resulting in inadequate tissue oxygenation and circulatory failure. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) describes a generalized inflammatory response of the host to a variety of insults. SIRS is considered a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. Disruption of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is a well-recognized component of septic shock. The clinical spectrum of sepsis depends primarily on the host response to infection rather than the severity of the infection itself. The pregnant host may be different from the traditional septic shock host in ways other than the difference in microbiologic pathogens involved. Physiologic adaptations to pregnancy designed to promote favorable maternal and fetal outcome occur in almost every organ system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 50 percent of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - Abstract In OA chondrocytes, there is diminished mitochondrial production of ATP and diminished extracellular adenosine resulting in diminished adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) stimulation and altered chondrocyte homeostasis which contributes to the pathogenesis of OA. We tested the hypothesis that A2AR stimulation maintains or enhances mitochondrial function in chondrocytes. The effect of A2AR signaling on mitochondrial health and function was determined in primary murine chondrocytes, a human chondrocytic cell line (T/C-28a2), primary human chondrocytes, and a murine model of OA by transmission electron microscopy analysis, mitochondrial stress testing, confocal live imaging for mitochondrial inner membrane polarity, and immunohistochemistry. In primary murine chondrocytes from A2AR?/? null mice, which develop spontaneous OA by 16 weeks, there is mitochondrial swelling, dysfunction, and reduced mitochondrial content with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden and diminished mitophagy, as compared to chondrocytes from WT animals. IL-1-stimulated T/C-28a2 cells treated with an A2AR agonist had reduced ROS burden with increased mitochondrial dynamic stability and function, findings which were recapitulated in primary human chondrocytes. In an obesity-induced OA mouse model, there was a marked increase in mitochondrial oxidized material which was markedly improved after intraarticular injections of liposomal A2AR agonist. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that A2AR ligation is mitoprotective in OA.

AB  - SUMMARY 1 I employ cancer in a broad sense to cover all products of malignant neoplasia? carcinomas, sarcomas, leukaemias and ascites tumours?and tumour to cover all autonomous neoplasms. 2 Cancer is not a biological entity, but an assemblage of many distinct diseases (malignant tumours) which share the following symptoms: (a) replication of abnormal tissue type, but often with change towards greater malignancy; (b) non-limited proliferation; (c) some degree of histological and physiological dedifferentiation; (d) partial or often complete lack of organization; (c) invasiveness, often accompanied by metastasis. 3 Neoplasia also includes the development of benign tumours, which exhibit symptoms (a)-(d) above, and have therefore acquired autonomy. 4 Neoplasia does not involve an abnormal form of tissue differentiation, but a characteristic deviation of metabolism which may affect any type of tissue. Tumours retain the specific determination of the tissues from which they arise, though in hypoplastic manifestation. Tumorigenic metabolic deviation proceeds by a series of individual chance (mutational) events, instead of by a continuous (statistical) process affecting all cells simultaneously as in normal differentiation. 5 All autonomous neoplasms can be regarded as the equivalents of new biological species. 6 Though the tumours of lower vertebrates, invertebrates and plants often differ in various ways from those of mammals and birds, there is no reason for regarding them as irrelevant to the human cancer problem. They are autonomous and often malignant neoplasms, and have sometimes been experimentally induced. 7 Neoplastic tumours, whether spontaneous (in nature) (S), experimentally induced (E), or genetically induced (G), have been recorded in the following groups of organisms: 8 The ?cancer spectrum? may differ markedly in different groups, species and breeds. 9 High cancer-proneness exists in some animal species (e.g. dogs, mice, budgerigars, domestic fowls, poecilid and cyprinodont fish) and breeds (retrievers, grey horses, some domesticated goldfish), and low cancer-proneness in others (guinea-pigs, rabbits, pigs, primates; Pekinese, chows). 10 Thyroid tumours develop frequently in salmonids and some other fish in water of low oxygen content. Their invasiveness is usually not an effect of malignancy, but of the absence of a capsule in the fish thyroid. 11 Attention is drawn to the favourable material for cancer research provided by regions of high localized growth rate (horns, horn cores, antlers, etc.), growth gradients (crustacean appendages and abdomina, molluscan mantle edges, etc.), endocrine-dependent growth and regression (fowl-combs, larval and metamorphosing Amphibia, stick insects, etc.), nerve-dependent differentiation (Orthoptera), regenerating limbs (Amphibia, Crustacea, stick* insects, etc.), late-fertilized Amphibian eggs, graft-tolerant sites (cheek pouches of hamster), crown-gall tumours and other plant galls, and toadstools. 12 The rate of development of spontaneous and induced tumours is related to size of species. Further investigation is needed to determine (a) if this holds also for size of breed, (b) if it is related to rate of development to maturity, or to length of life. 13 Crown-gall tumours in plants are initiated by a bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which induces an irreversible alteration in the plant's tissue leading to high heteroauxin production and unorganized tumorous growth. Plant tissues cultivated for long periods on media of high auxin content acquire many properties of crown-gall tumour tissue. Desoxyribonucleic acid extracts from A. tumefaciens can transform other species of bacteria so that they induce tumours. 14 Virus tumours in plants are induced by a combination of a specific virus and traumatic injury. 15 Some tumours are determined genetically, with high or complete penetrance, either as a result of gross genetic imbalance in species crosses (Nicotiana, Platy-poecilus, Pygdera), or of chromosomal imbalance (extra B-chromosomes in Sorghum pollen-grain tumours) or of single genes or systems of genes (Drosophila larval melanotic tumours, melanomas in grey horses, human xeroderma pigmentosum, tumour incidence in monozygotic twins, some mammary cancers and leukaemias in mice). 16 The incidence (penetrance) of genetic tumours may vary markedly with diet and other environmental conditions (notably in Drosophila), with stage of development (all Drosophila tumours regress at metamorphosis), and with genetic background (notably in different inbred mouse strains, which show marked differences of proneness to various tumours). Some single genes affect cancer-proneness, e.g. yellow in mice increases the incidence of lung cancer, and the A blood-group allele in man that of gastric cancer. 17 Specific, subspecific and breed differences in cancer spectrum or particular cancer-proneness must have a genetic basis; human ?racial? differences may do so, but may be determined by environment or habits. 18 The incidence of some mammary cancers in mice depends on a combination of genetic factors with a virus transmitted in the milk. Incidence is mediated through the timing of the endocrine-dependent mammary cycle, high incidence occurring in strains where local areas of proliferation persist after the rest of the gland is in regression. 19 Histocompatibility genes determine susceptibility to tumour transplantation, but have no relation to genetic cancer-proneness. 20 The study of ascites tumours has revealed a wide genetic variance in the cell populations of tumours, due to polyploidy, aneuploidy, structural changes (notably translocations) and gene mutations. The tumour is propagated mainly through a ?germplasm? of modal'stem cells?, the remaining more extreme variants constituting its non-transmitted ?soma?. In changed conditions, selection may operate to alter the profile (idiogram) of the variance, with the establishment of a new mode and set of stem cells (e.g. hypertetraploid in place of hyperdiploid). Major physiological adaptation of the entire cell population is not operative. Immunoselection results in new aneuploid modes with loss of antigenic properties. In other conditions, selection of other mutants may result in higher proliferation rate or invasiveness. Inbred mouse strains may change their general or particular cancer-proneness, as a result of deliberate or unconscious selection. Thus, though the abnormal ploidies and structural changes often seen in tumours are certainly not the primary cause of tumorigenesis but secondary effects of it, they may provide the basis for further genetic evolution of the tumour. 21 The apparent lack of any marked ?heredity? of cancer in man and wild animal species is due to (a) the multiplicity of types of cancer, and (b) the genetic heterogeneity of natural populations. Whenever inbreeding is practised, breeds or strains with particular degrees of genetic proneness to particular cancers will be established. The high variance of human populations in genetic cancer-proneness accounts for the fact that very high incidence of known occupational, environmental or habitudi-nal cancer will only occur with very prolonged and very intense exposure to the carcinogen. Lesser degrees of exposure will result only in a moderate incidence, which yet may be causally significant, as with the increase of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking. 22 Evolutionary selection may affect the manifestation and incidence of cancers in various ways. It may operate (a) to produce a relative immunity to tumorigenesis in tissues especially subject to environmental insults, e.g. the nasal mucosa; (b) to defer the onset of reasonably common cancers, such as most carcinomas, to post-reproductive ages; this will not be possible with rare cancers such as most sarcomas, or with cancers with very early onset, such as the leukaemias of childhood, or xeroderma pigmentosum; in this latter case selection has produced an alternative mode of palliation, by imposing recessiveness on the deleterious effects of the gene responsible. Cancers are also subject to a general orthoselective pressure in favour of higher proliferation rate and greater invasiveness.
