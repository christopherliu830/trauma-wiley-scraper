AB  - Abstract A case-control study of 374 patients with primary epithelial cancers of the oral cavity, oro- and hypopharynx, and larynx is reported, the controls being patients with selected other cancers, matched for age and sex. Of all eligible patients, 93 % were interviewed. Increased risks were seen with alcohol consumption and, less strongly, with smoking, which for all sites could be adequately fitted by either a multiplicative or an additive model. However, the site-specific relationships were different, alcohol consumption being significantly associated only with oral cavity, pharyngeal and extrinsic laryngeal tumours, and smoking only with intrinsic laryngeal tumours. Increased risks were associated with low socio-economic status, the unmarried state, and poor dental care. No significant associations were seen with specific occupational exposures.

AB  - Abstract The Scientific Opinion on the welfare of animals during transport reviewed the most recent scientific information concerning the main farm species. New scientific evidence and consequent conclusions and recommendations were arranged following the structure of Annex I of EC Regulation 1/2005 . On fitness for transport, recommendations for cattle and poultry were focused on repeated humane handling and careful inspection prior to transport. On the means of transport, use of partitions in horse transport, compulsory fasting of pigs with provision of water at stops, and temperature limits for poultry were major recommendations. Maintaining stability of animal groups was recommended as good practice, with special emphasis on the need to avoid mixing unfamiliar pigs or goats. On watering and feeding intervals, journey times and resting periods, journey duration should not exceed 12 hours for horses and 29 hours for cattle. Horses should be supplied with water one hour before and one hour after transport, and for cattle there should be a 24 hour recovery period with access to food and water. For rabbits, time spent inside the containers during lairage should be considered journey time. Space allowance for horses should be given in terms of kg/m2 instead of m2/animal. For cattle and sheep, it is recommended that space allowances should be calculated according to an allometric equation relating size to body weight. Limits for stocking densities of broilers in containers should be related to thermal conditions. On the navigation systems, temperature monitoring systems should be incorporated. Minimum standards should be established regarding data type to be recorded, the system and the on-board architecture. Recommendations for further research focused on the thermal limits and regulation for poultry and rabbits, the effects of ventilation on pigs, space allowance for rabbits, newly hatched chicks and pigs, optimal journey times for horses, pigs and calves.

AB  - Abstract Rapid growth in demand and altered professional roles have produced changes in the delivery of genetic services over the past decade, but these have not been rigorously evaluated because of the paucity of appropriate audit tools. The aim of this study was to use clients' accounts and factor analysis to develop a robust assessment and audit tool. Qualitative data abstracted from several published studies were used to generate a number of statements related to outcomes of genetic services. A total of 57 statements were incorporated into a questionnaire. The questionnaire was mailed to clients of the Wales genetic service (n?=?133) who had completed their episode of care. Respondents were asked to rank each statement on a seven-point Likert type scale. Responses were subjected to factor analysis. A total of 97 anonymized responses were received (73% response rate). Six main factors were found to contribute to the outcome of the service from the client's perspective. These were labeled (i) enhanced understanding, (ii) positive psychological change, (iii) respect for autonomy, (iv) adaptation, (v) disequilibirium, and (vi) value of contact. The audit tool has now been refined for use in evaluating genetic services. Questions are included to investigate the six outcome areas shown to be relevant from the client's perspective. Data from the next phase of the study will be analyzed to validate the tool for use in both clinical audit and research contexts. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
