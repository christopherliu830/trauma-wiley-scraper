AB  - Abstract We recently documented the progressive nature of mitochondrial dysfunction over 24 hr after contusion spinal cord injury (SCI), but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. We investigated the effects of targeting two distinct possible mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction by using the mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) or the nitroxide antioxidant Tempol after contusion SCI in rats. A novel aspect of this study was that all assessments were made in both synaptosomal (neuronal)- and nonsynaptosomal (glial and neuronal soma)-derived mitochondria 24 hr after injury. Mitochondrial uncouplers target Ca2+ cycling and subsequent reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria after injury. When 2,4-DNP was injected 15 and 30 min after injury, mitochondrial function was preserved in both populations compared with vehicle-treated rats, whereas 1 hr postinjury treatment was ineffective. Conversely, targeting peroxynitrite with Tempol failed to maintain normal bioenergetics in synaptic mitochondria, but was effective in nonsynaptic mitochondria when administered 15 min after injury. When administered at 15 and 30 min after injury, increased hydroxynonenal, 3-NT, and protein carbonyl levels were significantly reduced by 2,4-DNP, whereas Tempol only reduced 3-NT and protein carbonyls after SCI. Despite such antioxidant effects, only 2,4-DNP was effective in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating that mitochondrial Ca2+ overload may be the key mechanism involved in acute mitochondrial damage after SCI. Collectively, our observations demonstrate the significant role that mitochondrial dysfunction plays in SCI neuropathology. Moreover, they indicate that combinatorial therapeutic approaches targeting different populations of mitochondria holds great potential in fostering neuroprotection after acute SCI. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the experience in basic and advanced clinical procedures of recently graduated medical students and to identify deficiencies in procedural skills training. Design: An anonymous, voluntary, questionnaire-based survey. Setting: The 13 hospitals in the State of Victoria that employ their own interns. Subjects: New interns, immediately before starting their intern year in 1996. Results: One hundred and seventy-four interns participated. They reported that they had had few opportunities to practise some procedures during their medical courses. By their own report, 3% had never sutured a patient, 10% had never drawn blood gases, 16% had never applied a limb plaster, 18% had never inserted a catheter and 37% had never intubated a patient. Twenty-nine per cent perceived their proficiency in basic procedural skills to be inadequate and 43% perceived their training in basic skills to have been inadequate. Except for intravenous cannulation, there was a significant association (P<0.01) between the number of procedures performed and perceived proficiency in that procedure. The new interns reported that they had been taught mainly by residents and registrars in the emergency department. ?Doctors performing most procedures? and ?limited access to patients? were considered the main obstacles to procedural training. Fewer than 50% of interns had spent extra time improving their procedural skills. Conclusion: Undergraduate training in procedural skills in Victoria is inadequate. Comprehensive training programs appear to be lacking and clinical schools have few techniques for quality assurance. Recommendation: Victorian clinical schools need to review their procedural skills training programs.

AB  - Abstract Bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of pulp and periapical diseases. The primary aim of endodontic treatment is to remove as many bacteria as possible from the root canal system and then to create an environment in which any remaining organisms cannot survive. This can only be achieved through the use of a combination of aseptic treatment techniques, chemomechanical preparation of the root canal, antimicrobial irrigating solutions and intracanal medicaments. The choice of which intracanal medicament to use is dependent on having an accurate diagnosis of the condition being treated, as well as a thorough knowledge of the type of organisms likely to be involved and their mechanisms of growth and survival. Since the disease is likely to have been caused by the presence of bacteria within the root canal, the use of an antimicrobial agent is essential. Many medicaments have been used in an attempt to achieve the above aims but no single preparation has been found to be completely predictable or effective. Commonly used medicaments include calcium hydroxide, antibiotics, non-phenolic biocides, phenolic biocides and iodine compounds. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and further research is required to determine which is best suited for root canal infections.
