AB  - Objectives: To assess the experience in basic and advanced clinical procedures of recently graduated medical students and to identify deficiencies in procedural skills training. Design: An anonymous, voluntary, questionnaire-based survey. Setting: The 13 hospitals in the State of Victoria that employ their own interns. Subjects: New interns, immediately before starting their intern year in 1996. Results: One hundred and seventy-four interns participated. They reported that they had had few opportunities to practise some procedures during their medical courses. By their own report, 3% had never sutured a patient, 10% had never drawn blood gases, 16% had never applied a limb plaster, 18% had never inserted a catheter and 37% had never intubated a patient. Twenty-nine per cent perceived their proficiency in basic procedural skills to be inadequate and 43% perceived their training in basic skills to have been inadequate. Except for intravenous cannulation, there was a significant association (P<0.01) between the number of procedures performed and perceived proficiency in that procedure. The new interns reported that they had been taught mainly by residents and registrars in the emergency department. ?Doctors performing most procedures? and ?limited access to patients? were considered the main obstacles to procedural training. Fewer than 50% of interns had spent extra time improving their procedural skills. Conclusion: Undergraduate training in procedural skills in Victoria is inadequate. Comprehensive training programs appear to be lacking and clinical schools have few techniques for quality assurance. Recommendation: Victorian clinical schools need to review their procedural skills training programs.

AB  - Abstract Children rarely disclose sexual abuse. Hence, studies of children's abuse experiences are relatively rare. This paper reports on a qualitative analysis of 2986 cases of self-disclosure of sexual abuse from children, aged 5?18 years, who contacted ChildLine Scotland, a free, confidential telephone counselling service. Children discussed their feelings regarding the abuse, the impact of abuse on their health and well-being, sources of support, disclosure, coping strategies, the context in which abuse occurs and the various ways in which they were groomed or their compliance in abuse was gained. Children's narratives contained detailed contextual information on their experiences of sexual abuse, perpetrators of sexual abuse and the circumstances in which sexual abuse occurs. The way in which children communicated about sexual abuse was found to differ quite considerably, and the terminology they employed was often markedly different from adult constructs. Nonetheless, children of all ages were able to describe their experiences and their feelings around the abuse in considerable detail. This study provides a rare insight into children's accounts of sexual abuse. The findings illustrate the profound impact that sexual abuse has on the lives of children and their understandings of the circumstances in which abuse occurs.
