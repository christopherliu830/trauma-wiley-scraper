AB  - Summary We begin to explore the first best practice area by identifying the principles of problem framing: assessing, prioritizing, framing, conceptualizing, and validating ideas that help us articulate the problem or question. In practical terms, this best practice area includes how to take in and prioritize requests, articulate the problem in ways that people understand, capture, and document requirements, and assess potential factors. We will outline what we mean by problem framing and place this in context to the scientific method. Using this as a starting point, we cover the process of problem definition, emphasizing its importance as the foundation for solving any problem. Here we discuss the types of questions that are addressed in analytics, including solving a problem, supporting a narrative, understanding a phenomenon, or discovering something new. We continue with a discussion of root-cause analysis and why it is important in analytics to utilize divergent thinking when considering why an issue exists. The best practice of problem framing is core to what we call hypothesis generation. That is, the process of ideation that considers the types of relationships that might exist between constructs under investigation. Again, a divergent thinking process, the goal of hypothesis generation is to brainstorm potential relationships in the form of theories that inform our understanding. Next, we begin to formulate our theories into the fundamental question that needs answering. As part of question design, we construct our problem statement table in a way that everyone understands. Finally, we discuss the importance of giving a problem its just due through business case prioritization. That is, we look at the factors that help us determine where this issue falls in the grand scheme of other things that could be done. Problem framing is the foundation of all of analytics, for if we cannot clarify a problem and articulate it in such a way that leads to a shared understanding of its significance, then we fall short of leading analytics change.

AB  - Abstract The results of the treatment of 43 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (PML) are reported: 27 were treated initially with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), whereas 16 were treated with conventional chemotherapy. All patients received myelosuppressive chemotherapy after the initial treatment. Respectively, the complete remission rate was 92% and 37% (P < 0.01), the 5-day mortality rate was 0% and 44% (P < 0.001), and the 28-day mortality rate was 4% and 44% (P < 0.001). The median disease-free survival was 12 and 1 months (P < 0.01), whereas the 12-month disease-free survival was 50% and 13% (P < 0.01) and the 36-month disease-free survival was 41% and 9% (P < 0.01). Thirteen of the patients treated with ATRA were given the treatment fully as outpatients. ATRA given as initial therapy decreased significantly early mortality in promyelocytic leukemia patients; because some promyelocytic leukemia patients given ATRA as initial therapy can be treated as outpatients, the costs of this treatment modality may be diminished.

AB  - Abstract Evidence has accrued to show that autonomic and adrenocortical systems act in coordination to facilitate responses to environmental opportunities and threats. In the current study, we used cluster analysis to examine whether individual differences in patterns of joint baseline activity among the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are associated with parent-reported temperamental positive and negative affectivity in 36-month old children. The resulting clusters corresponded to the sensitive, buffered, and vigilant patterns as predicted by the adaptive calibration model of stress responsivity (Del Giudice et al., 2011) and included a novel pattern. Cluster memberships predicted differences in overall negative affectivity and its subscales, but no associations were found with positive affectivity. These results provide evidence that the joint activity of physiological systems at rest may underlie temperamental differences in negative affect.
