AB  - The 32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Australasian Social Psychologists was held between April 24 and 27 2003 at the Swiss Grand Hotel on beautiful Bondi Beach, Sydney. The conference was enormously successful, with a record number of presenters and attendees. The conference Abstracts presented here highlight the diversity and excitement of our field. Australasian social psychologists are making groundbreaking contributions in a variety of areas, from evolutionary psychology, social cognition, groups, attitudes, prejudice, the self, close relationships, emotion and motivation, to health, applied psychology, and critical psychology. As always, the SASP conference offered an excellent showcase of the fascinating theoretical issues and research interests that our members pursue. We would like to thank the following sponsors for their support of the conference: Macquarie University, the Macquarie University Division of Linguistics and Psychology, and the Department of Psychology; the Australian Psychological Society; Blackwell Publishing; Guilford Publications; MacMillan Publishers; Pearson Education; Psychology Press; Sage Publications; Astam Books; Footprint Books; Empirisoft; and VR Solutions. Finally, we would like to thank Cassie Govan for her enthusiastic commitment to the conference, and for her hard work in every phase of its organisation.

AB  - The objective of Aquarius project was to test the applicability of a food chain analysis on Atlantic salmon farmed in Norway to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and drivers of change for the identification of emerging risks. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted complemented with expert views collected by on-line questionnaires and in-depth interviews. This review provided an overview of the various stages in the supply chain from farm to consumer and the identification of i) existing and emerging human and animal health hazards, ii) vulnerabilities, iii) control measures, iv) drivers of change, and v) related indicators. Next step in the study was to i) complement the list of vulnerabilities followed by a prioritisation using focus group discussions and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method and ii) link drivers of change acting upon the (prioritised) vulnerabilities and identification of associated indicators and data sources by means of a Delphi method. Based on the experiences obtained with the different methodologies during this project, the Aquarius team considers literature review, and a direct face-to-face interaction with experts (in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and FMEA in a workshop setting) as being most effective regarding output and effort. The comprehensive information collected formed the basis for the methodology to baseline key indicators of the selected vulnerabilities. The methodology proposed comprised a Bayesian Network (BN) that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change to the prioritised vulnerabilities and was demonstrated for salmon health. A Decision Support System (DSS) with such BN integrated was designed. The current BN and DSS could flag an increased exposure of known hazards that may occur due to changes in indicators but new hazards are not identified. The proposed methodology could be used instead to show trends in vulnerabilities, indicators, increased exposure of known hazards and for scenario studies.

AB  - Aims:? Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder manifesting with heterogeneous symptom clusters and clinical presentations. The deficit syndrome is the condition defined by the existence of primarily negative symptoms, and patients with the deficit syndrome differ from non-deficit patients on measures of brain structure and function. In the current study, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated the frontotemporal connectivity that is hypothesized to differ between deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. The patients had deficit (n?=?11) or non-deficit (n?=?18) schizophrenia and they were evaluated clinically with the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Diffusion-based images were obtained with a 1.5T Siemens Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine and analyses were carried out with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Library Software ? Diffusion tool box software. Results:? The fractional anisotropy values in the left uncinate fasciculus of schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome were lower than those of non-deficit patients and the controls. There were no differences between non-deficit schizophrenia patients and controls. Conclusion:? These findings provide evidence of left uncinate fasciculus damage resulting in disrupted communication between orbitofrontal prefrontal areas and temporal areas in deficit schizophrenia patients.
