AB  - Summary The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was introduced as a stage in the Global Deterioration Scale to describe the progression from normal aging to dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. The potential clinical and demographic risk factors for developing AD at an earlier age of onset identified over the last three decades include depression, female gender, low levels of education, smaller head circumference, and family history of Down's syndrome. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a progressive dementia syndrome that is usually associated with parkinsonism and typically dominated by attentional, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction and relatively preserved memory. Vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, prion diseases, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are also discussed in the chapter.

AB  - AbstractThis paper takes up a theoretical and empirical investigation of how two community-based projects for young women both create safety from community and domestic violence but how, in the process, discourses of multicultural inclusion define one site, and racist discourses of exclusion float through the other site. By relying on two intensive qualitative case studies of community-based organizations for girls, one exclusively White and working class and the other expressly multicultural and antiracist, we try to identify those structures and practices that support feminist, but inadvertently racist, work and those structures and practices that enable, at once, feminist and antiracist consciousness and praxis.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the differences between a co-produced experimental mental health centre and traditional day centres. For this purpose, we used a collaborative and mixed-method approach in two complementary studies: (i) a quantitative cross-sectional study designed to compare users' hospitalization rates and their use of psychiatric medications and (ii) a qualitative study designed to explore and document the experienced differences between co-produced and traditional services. In the quantitative cross-sectional study, surveys were administered to 37 users of one co-produced mental health service and to 40 users of traditional mental health services. A negative binomial regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships between predictors and users' hospitalization rates. After adjusting for the potential confounders, users of the co-produced centre reported a 63.2% reduced rate of hospitalizations compared with users of traditional mental health services (P = 0.002). Furthermore, 39% of users of the co-produced centre reported a reduction or even withdrawal from psychiatric medications against 22% of the comparison group (P = 0.036). In the qualitative study, six main differences emerged from a thematic analysis of a large user-led focus group. In the participants' experiences, the co-produced service focused on (i) parity and respectful relationships, (ii) people's strengths, (iii) freedom, (iv) psychological continuity, (v) social inclusion, and (vi) recovery orientation. Our research provides empirical evidence concerning the ?preventive aspect? of co-produced mental health services. Additionally, new insights into how different stakeholders, particularly users of co-produced mental health services, experience the differences between co-produced and traditional mental health services are provided.

AB  - Abstract Background?This is a companion paper to our earlier review of psychological treatments for people with personality disorder that examined the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Here, we report on the evidence of pharmacological treatments from RCTs for people with personality disorder. As in the previous report, this paper incorporates information from an earlier review that examined the evidence to 2002, and extends it to December 2006. As in the previous paper, this review restricts itself to the findings from RCTs, and excludes evidence from other study designs; however, details of these other studies will be posted in the National Personality Disorder Institute Website (http://www.pdinstitute.org.uk). Aim?This study aimed to examine the evidence from RCTs to justify intervening with pharmacological treatments in people with personality disorder. Method?Fifteen electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO) were searched to the end of December 2006 for any RCT of a pharmacological intervention for participants meeting DSM or ICD criteria for personality disorder. Outcomes were grouped using a similar symptomological categorization to that suggested by Soloff in 1998. Results?This methodology identified 35 trials for inclusion. The main positive findings were those favouring the use of anticonvulsants to reduce aggression, and of anti-psychotics to reduce cognitive perceptual and mental state disturbance. However, there were major methodological deficiencies in the trial designs, including small numbers of participants and limited duration of treatment and follow-up. Conclusion?This review identifies a very limited evidence base to justify intervening with drugs in this group. Reasons why this should be so are examined that relate to fundamentally differing conceptualizations of how any intervention might impact in an individual with personality disorder.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The impact of penile blood supply on erectile function was recognized some 500 years ago. At the turn of the 20th century first results of penile venous ligation were published and in 1973 the first surgical attempts to restore penile arterial inflow were undertaken. Numerous techniques were published in the meantime, but inclusion criteria, patient selection, and success evaluation differed extremely between study groups. Aim.? To develop evidence-based standard operating procedures (SOPs) for vascular surgery in erectile dysfunction, based on recent state of the art consensus reports and recently published articles in peer-reviewed journals. Methods.? Based on the recent publication of the consensus process during the 2009 International Consultation on Sexual Medicine in Paris, recommendations are derived for diagnosis and surgical treatment of vascular erectile dysfunction. In addition several recent publications in this field not mentioned in the consensus statements are included in the discussion. Main Outcome Measure.? The Oxford system of evidence-based review was systematically applied. Due to the generally low level of evidence in this field expert opinions were accepted, if published after a well-defined consensus process in peer-reviewed journals. Results.? Referring to penile revascularization it may be concluded, that in the face of missing randomized trials, only recommendations grade D may be given: this kind of surgery may be offered to men less than 55 years, who are nonsmokers, nondiabetic, and demonstrate isolated arterial stenoses in the absence of generalized vascular disease. The evidence level for recommendations concerning penile venous ligations may be even lower. Too many unsolved controversies exist and universal diagnostic criteria for patient selection as well as operative technique selection have not been unequivocally established. This kind of surgery is still considered investigational but may be offered in special situations on an individualized basis in an investigational or research setting after obtaining written consent, using both pre- and postoperatively validated measuring instruments of success evaluation. Conclusions.? SOPs for penile revascularization procedures can be developed, concerning a highly selected patient group with isolated arterial stenoses. Based on the available data it is not yet possible to define SOPs for surgical treatment of corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction. Sohn M, Hatzinger M, Goldstein I, and Krishnamurti S.
