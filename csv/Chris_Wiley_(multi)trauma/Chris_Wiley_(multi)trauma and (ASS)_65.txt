AB  - Forty-eight chronically (>3 months) ?-receptor-blocked patients with ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension were studied on 49 occasions after random distribution to a 4-day, gradual preoperative withdrawal (n = 26) or a continuation (n = 23) of ?-receptor blockers. The patients were scheduled for either a cholecystectomy (n = 28) or a carotid thrombendarterectomy (n = 21) under neurolept anaesthesia. Three patients were excluded from the randomized part of the study due to complications (tachycardia, hypertension, severe angina) after therapy withdrawal. In subgroups, central haemodynamics (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 6, continued n = 8) and creatinine-kinase B (?-receptor blockers withdrawn n = 9, continued n= 11) were studied. Withdrawal of ?-receptor blockers was associated with high heart rates, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and a hyperkinetic circulation during pain stimuli. Significantly more postoperative ECG changes (p<0.02) indicative of myocardial ischaemia were found than in ?-receptor blocked patients. These patients had low heart rates but also pronounced increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, which in single patients could be associated with myocardial damage. These results imply that ?-receptor blockers should be continued before surgery and that a concomitant vasodilatatory therapy is likely to avoid the drawbacks of an increased cardiac afterload.

AB  - Material from the psychoanalytic psychotherapy of a patient with breast cancer demonstrates the emergence of constructive meaning in areas of psychological experience burdened by conflicts regarding the dimension of time and faith. During analytic work, the spontaneous appearance of religious metaphors revealed deeper layers of memory where time, faith, language, and the sense of being listened to once interacted in ways whose significance could be conceptualized, with the help of the countertransference, as a rediscovery of a hearing breast, or even a sacred hearing breast. Implications for the psychoanalysis of religious experience are discussed.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this article is to review the available literature on the intersections of religion and migration with reference to African refugees and migrants. I draw primarily on works that have emerged in the last decade to address both the under-explored role of religion in the lives of African refugees and migrants and the active role they play in shaping the religious landscape in their migratory contexts and in their countries of origin. Published research on religion and African migration varies in scope, ranging from rich descriptions of the religious beliefs and practices of refugees in rural camps in Africa to analyzes of the impact of religion on the realities of settlement faced by African migrants in urban cities in Europe. Other works investigate processes of societal change resulting from the intersection of religion and African migration, while others examine how religious institutions that have come into being to deal with the spiritual and socio-economic and political needs of African refugees and migrants and their efforts to maintain contact with people in their homeland. I argue that future research could benefit from moving beyond individual case studies that reflect particular disciplinary perspectives to more comparative and intra-disciplinary analyzes of migrant identities and experiences. Such studies have the potential to inform about conceptual and experiential differences of being an African migrant and alternately, what it entails to be European or American in the age of globalization.
