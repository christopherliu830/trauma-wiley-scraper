AB  - Abstract HTR2C is one of the most relevant and investigated serotonin receptors. Its role in important brain structures such as the midbrain, the lateral septal complex, the hypothalamus, the olfactory bulb, the pons, the choroid plexus, the nucleus pallidus, the striatum and the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens and the anterior cingulated gyrus candidate it as a promising target for genetic association studies. The biological relevance of these brain structures is reviewed by way of the focus on HTR2C activity, with a special attention paid to psychiatric disorders. Evidence from the genetic association studies that dealt with HTR2C is reviewed and discussed alongside the findings derived from the neuronatmic investigations. The reasons for the discrepancies between these two sets of reports are discussed. As a result, HTR2C is shown to play a pivotal role in many different psychiatric behaviors or psychiatric related disrupted molecular balances, nevertheless, genetic association studies brought inconsistent results so far. The most replicated association involve the feeding behavior and antipsychotic induced side effects, both weight gain and motor related: Cys23Ser (rs6318) and ?759C/T (rs3813929) report the most consistent results. The lack of association found in other independent studies dampens the clinical impact of these reports. Here, we report a possible explanation for discrepant findings that is poorly or not at all usually considered, that is that HTR2C may exert different or even opposite activities in the brain depending on the structure analyzed and that mRNA editing activity may compensate possible genetically controlled functional effects. The incomplete coverage of the HTR2C variants is proposed as the best cost-benefit ratio bias to fix. The evidence of brain area specific HTR2C mRNA editing opens a debate about how the brain can differently modulate stress events, and process antidepressant treatments, in different brain areas. The mRNA editing activity on HTR2C may play a major role for the negative association results. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract All organisms contain thousands of proteins and peptides in their body fluids. A deeper insight into the functional relevance of these polypeptides under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions and the discovery of specific peptide biomarkers would greatly enhance both diagnosis and therapy of specific diseases. Proteomic methods can provide means to accomplish this grand medical vision. In this review, we will focus on the potential use of proteome analysis for clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis and assessment of response to therapy. We focus on CE coupled with MS (CE-MS) and review in detail different aspects of CE-MS coupling and the results obtained using CE-MS analysis of clinically relevant samples. We also discuss clinical applications of the technology for the diagnosis of renal diseases, urogenital cancer, and arteriosclerosis as well as monitoring the responses to therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Successful identification of skeletonized remains often relies upon DNA analyses, frequently focusing on the mid-diaphysis of weight-bearing long bones. This study explored intra-bone DNA variability using bovine and porcine femora, along with calcanei and tali. DNA from fresh and short-term environmentally exposed bone was extracted utilizing demineralization and standard lysis buffer protocols, and DNA quantity and quality were measured. Overall, femoral epiphyses, metaphyses, and the tarsals had more nuclear and mitochondrial DNA than did the femoral diaphyses. DNA loss was much more rapid in buried bones than in surface exposed bones, while DNA quality differed based on environment, but not bone region/element. The demineralization protocol generated more DNA in some bone regions, while the standard lysis was more effective in others, and neither significantly affected DNA quality. Taken together, these findings reinforce the importance of considering inter- and intra-bone heterogeneity when sampling skeletal material for forensic DNA-based identifications.

AB  - Abstract Using the 1993 South Africa Integrated Household Survey, this paper studies the effect that mother's education through the knowledge channel has on children's health using height for age Z-scores as health measure. Under a two-stage least square methodology we find that an increase in 4 years on mother's education (approximately 1 standard deviation) will lead to an increase of 0.6 standard deviations on her child's height for age Z-score. We also find, as the medical literature suggests, support for the hypothesis that mother's education is more important for children older than 24 months of age.

AB  - Abstract Resilience research involves the study of processes predicting better-than-expected adjustment following exposure to adversity, with the central goal of informing effective interventions. This chapter presents a review of accumulated research findings on salient risk-modifiers across the realms of family, community, and individual characteristics. Cumulatively, findings highlight the power of proximal relationships, particularly with primary caregivers in the family, and with teachers, mentors, and peers in the community. Forces inimical to psychological and physical survival (such as maltreatment and violence) are much more powerful than positive influences (such as affection or support). Children's own ?protective attributes? such as self-efficacy are themselves continually shaped by salient socializing influences. Future research aimed at fostering childhood resilience?and future interventions?must prioritize attention to risk-modifiers that are broadly deterministic (with large effect sizes, and generative of other assets); to gender-specific patterns; and to developmental contexts (mores, needs, and existing resources). Understanding the processes underlying salutary salient relationships, and systematically harnessing these in large-scale, community-based interventions, is the best hope in maximizing the yield of science on resilience in childhood, adolescence, and subsequently in development.
