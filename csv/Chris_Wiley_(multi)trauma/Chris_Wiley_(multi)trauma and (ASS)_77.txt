AB  - Summary This chapter describes parasites of the digestive system, respiratory system, liver, pancreas, circulatory system, nervous system, reproductive/urogenital system, locomotory system, connective tissue, and the integument of dogs and cats. Two species of the genus Mammomonogamus, which is closely related to Syngamus, are parasitic in the nasal cavities of cats. Infections are usually asymptomatic but affected animals may sneeze and have a nasal discharge due to irritation of the nasal mucosa. Adult worms are red in colour, 1-2 cm long and permanently joined in copula. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and the finding of eggs in the faeces or adult worms on postmortem. The presence of eggs in faeces or sputum and a nasal discharge are indicative of infection. On fox-rearing farms, care should be taken to ensure that runs are created in areas where the soil is dry and free-draining.

AB  - Abstract The history of the black German minority, now estimated at around 500,000, goes back several centuries. It is only since the twentieth century, however, that Germans of African descent have been perceived as a group. This did not lead to their recognition as a national minority, but rather, from the 1910s to the 1960s, they were defined as a collective threat to Germany's racial and cultural ?purity?. When a sense of identity emerged among Afro-Germans themselves in the 1980s, the majority population continued to deny the existence of ethnic diversity within German society. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Afro-Germans seemingly suddenly appeared as a new, ?hip? minority. This appearance was largely focused on the immense public success of the Hip Hop collective ?Brothers Keepers?, conceived as an anti-racist, explicitly Afro-German intervention into German debates around national identity and racist violence. This article explains the success of ?Brothers Keepers? by contextualising it within the tradition of two decades of Afro- German feminist activism and the transnational Hip Hop movement of European youth of colour.

AB  - This article traces the gender dimensions of Zionist nation building by examining literary texts written in the first three decades of the twentieth century. It offers a gender-oriented analysis of a range of canonic and marginal literary texts and their historical contexts, and pays special attention to the ways in which literary production in general, and in Hebrew in particular, became an essential component in the effort to create an image of a ?New Hebrew Man?. This highly gendered image was a central foundation of the Zionist project of nation building in Europe, and in the Jewish community in Palestine. Hebrew poems, stories and novels produced and sustained the symbolic economy of gender of the Zionist cultural project. At the same time, I argue that some Hebrew writers resisted the overt and implicit ideological demands of this project by calling attention to the internal contradictions inherent in the feminine figuration of the nation and the attempts to transform Jewish masculinity.
