AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the political-economy of knowledge production in the continent has led African anthropologists to critically evaluate canonical expectations of the discipline such as long-term fieldwork, co-research, and forms of public engagement. It traces the historical arc of changing working conditions for scholars trained in anthropology who have been nationals of African countries and worked in national or local institutions in post-colonial Africa. The chapter briefly attends to the colonial period and the first two decades that followed independence. It highlights some of the key questions and concerns that were raised by African anthropologists, and in particular how they sought to exorcize the ideological and ethnocentric biases of a discipline that had reached its maturity in the colonial context and, in part, contributed to it. The chapter establishes the state of play that served as the point of departure for what has transpired during the ?era of aid?.

AB  - Summary All children with speech sound disorders (SSD) require ?special consideration??, but there are certain clients and client-groups that warrant extra special consideration. In this chapter, issues that manifest clinically for these individuals and groups and their families are examined. The topics are: children at the point of initial referral and their parents' perceptions of SSD and its impact; children with co-occurring speech and language disorders; families, children and counselling; children with craniofacial anomalies, and velopharyngeal dysfunction; children who have been internationally adopted; and children with SSD who are multilingual. Then, the chapter discusses children acquiring speech in languages other than English; reflecting upon issues around children with speech impairments in culturally and linguistically diverse settings in the non-industrialised world. Finally, the chapter discusses children who have speech and literacy difficulties. Factors involved in humanitarian outreach in serving speech-impaired infants, children and youth in the majority world, are also presented.

AB  - Abstract A risk ranking process identified Salmonella spp. and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) as current high-priority biological hazards for meat inspection of bovine animals. As these hazards are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system for the farm-to-chilled carcass continuum using a risk-based approach was proposed. Key elements of the system are risk-categorisation of slaughter animals for high-priority biological hazards based on improved food chain information, as well as risk-categorisation of slaughterhouses according to their capability to control those hazards. Omission of palpation and incision during post-mortem inspection for animals subjected to routine slaughter may decrease spreading and cross-contamination with the high-priority biological hazards. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern; all other substances were ranked as of medium or lower concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account the completeness and quality of the food chain information supplied and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated to include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control programmes, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for bovine tuberculosis and would have a negative impact on the overall surveillance system especially in officially tuberculosis free countries. The detection effectiveness for bovine cysticercosis, already low with the current meat inspection system, would result in a further decrease, if palpation and incision are removed. Extended use of food chain information could compensate for some, but not all, the information on animal health and welfare lost if only visual post-mortem inspection is applied.

AB  - Abstract Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme converting arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandins, is the key player in neuroinflammation. It has been long thought that the COX-2-mediated neuronal injury/degeneration is attributed to the increased production of AA-derived prostaglandins. Recent studies show that endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a natural substrate for COX-2, and it can be oxygenated by COX-2 to form prostaglandin glyceryl esters. In this study, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 glyceryl ester (PGE2-G), a major COX-2 oxidative metabolite of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, enhanced hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission indicated by the increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents, and induced neuronal injury/death revealed by the terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining and caspase 3 activation. The actions of PGE2-G are not mediated via a cannabinoid receptor 1, but mediated through ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IP3, and NF-?B signal transduction pathways. In addition, the PGE2-G-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by blockade of the NMDA receptors. Our results suggest that the COX-2 oxidative metabolism of endocannabinoids is an important mechanism contributing to the inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.
