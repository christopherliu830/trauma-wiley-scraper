AB  - Summary The authors report the ultrasonographic evolution of the Achilles tendon healing process following a percutaneous tenorraphy technique. Thirty-eight patients affected with subcutaneous ruptures of the Achilles tendon underwent percutaneous tenorraphy and were followed-up with clinical examination and submitted to ultrasound study 5, 24 and 48?weeks after surgery. Ultrasound aids the clinical diagnosis especially when the diagnosis is doubtful (i.e. in presence of partial tears, observed in three cases) and in assessing the level of the rupture. Soon after surgery an increase of the diameter of the ruptured tendon was observed in comparison with uninjured tendon. One?year postoperatively, the repaired tendon gradually decreased in thickness, even if the orientation of tendon fascicles was still not properly organized. In conclusion, ultrasonography confirmed its value as a diagnostic and prognostic instrument indicating the severity of the lesion and to evaluate the opposition of the tendon stumps and the tendon healing process also in this percutaneous tenorraphy.

AB  - Summary The chapter describes various forms of expressive and creative interventions designed to facilitate expression, reduce anxiety and distress, and promote positive feelings and experiences in pediatric oncology patients. The major focus is on the uses of fantasy and imagination, the various forms of art therapy, including those based on the visual arts, bibliotherapy, writing, drama, cinema and video, clowning, humor, music, singing, dance and movements, pets and fun. Each intervention is presented with examples of characteristic means, objectives, and outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that the hydatid parasite infecting macropods and dingoes in Queensland is a sylvatic strain of Echinococcus granulosus, distinct from the domestic strain which produces cysts in sheep and humans. Design: Molecular biological techniques were used to compare DNA isolated from hydatid cysts from humans, local macropods and sheep from New South Wales and the United Kingdom, as well as from adult tapeworms in dingoes. Setting: The human cysts were surgically resected from two patients seen with hydati- dosis in Brisbane teaching hospitals over a one-year period. Neither patient had had previous contact with sheep farms. Macropods and dingoes were shot randomly in the localities where the patients presumably acquired their infections. Sheep liver cysts were obtained from abattoirs. Methodology: Studies comprised extraction of DNA from cysts, digestion by a series of restriction endonucleases, slab gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and then hybridisation with defined DNA probes. Polymerase chain reaction, in combination with direct DNA sequencing, was used to compare DNA from cysts and adult worms from dingoes. Results: The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of DNA from all cysts and a defined mitochondrial DNA sequence from all sources were indistinguishable. This finding is significant as both techniques can clearly distinguish between genetically distinct, well characterised strains of E. granulosus. Conclusions: Hydatid cysts are prevalent in some macropod populations and adult worms are common in dingoes. Since there are relatively few sheep-rearing areas in Queensland, contact with wild animals may be the main source of human hydatid infection in this State. The strain of E. granulosus in both patients was genetically indistinguishable from that found in macropods, dingoes and sheep from New South Wales and the United Kingdom. This strongly suggests that the domestic strain of E. granulosus, or a form very close genetically, freely infects Australian wildlife, and argues against the existence of a distinct sylvatic strain. The implications for public health are considerable.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the techniques and methods for processing whole blood (WB) collections into components to help ensure the product is suitable for storage and transfusion, thus minimizing the risk to recipients. It discusses the quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) of the blood product and equipment are essential parts of blood processing. The chapter focuses on the component separation of WB, note that while apheresis can be used to separate components at the point of bleeding, this is not a realistic process in most veterinary practices. The optimal centrifuge speed for blood product processing depends on several factors. These include centrifuge specifications such as rotor size, but also the sedimentation characteristics of the desired blood components. QC and QA are the processes required to ascertain that all elements concerning the production and storage of manufactured goods, in this case blood products, are achieving expected specifications.
