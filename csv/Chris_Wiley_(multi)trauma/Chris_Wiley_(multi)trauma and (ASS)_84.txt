AB  - Abstract Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) have been used in the treatment of complications of portal hypertension. TIPS is used for the control of acute variceal bleeding and for the prevention of vericeal rebleeding when pharmacologic therapy and endoscopic therapy have failed. Patients with refractory ascites with adequate hepatic reserve and renal function who fail to respond to large volume paracentesis may be reasonable candidates for TIPS. Promising indications for TIPS are Budd-Chiari syndrome uncontrolled by medical therapy, severe portal hypertensive gastropathy, refractory hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS cannot be recommended for preoperative portal decompression solely to facilitate liver transplantation. Special care should be taken to insure proper placement of the stent to avoid increasing the technical difficulty of the transplantation procedure. The major limiting factors for TIPS success are shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Because shunt stenosis is the most important cause of recurrent complications of portal hypertension, a surveillance program to monitor shunt patency is mandatory. The MELD score may be useful in predicting post-TIPS survival, and also in counseling patients and their families.

AB  - Abstract The current study examined the interpersonal model of binge eating, which posits that interpersonal problems lead to negative affect, which results in binge eating, over the course of two psychotherapy treatments (interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy) in 162 adults with binge-eating disorder. A series of longitudinal simple mediation analyses preliminarily showed that treatment addresses the mechanisms of the interpersonal model of binge eating as theoretically proposed in predicting reductions in binge eating, the primary dependent variable, and the secondary dependent variables including global eating disorder psychopathology, shape concern, and weight concern, but not reductions in restraint or eating concern. Moderated mediation analyses did not fully support treatment differences, as changes in the mechanisms of the interpersonal model occurred in both treatments and suggest both treatments addressed negative affect and interpersonal precipitants of eating disorder symptomatology. Future research should replicate this study using variables that do not overlap in time to investigate causation of the model, and more generally, further examine theoretical treatment models and treatment mediators as this research could help improve efficacy of treatment for binge-eating disorder.

AB  - Abstract Council Directive 2007/43/EC on the protection of chickens kept for meat production requires Member States to submit to the Commission the results of a data collection of welfare indicators in broiler slaughterhouses. The Commission prepared a draft document for a harmonised data collection system of welfare indicators in broiler slaughterhouses for a one-year period and requested EFSA to assess whether the sample size chosen in the document would be sufficient to achieve the objectives of the data collection. The structure of the population as well as possible stratification factors influence the sampling protocol of a data collection. In this case, the sampling should occur in each Member State at three levels: i) at slaughterhouses; ii) at flocks within each sampled slaughterhouse and iii) at broilers and feet within each sampled flock. Based on the methodological approach developed for this mandate, the assessment shows that for 15 MS, 1% of the total number of flocks slaughtered in one year is not a sufficient sample to assess 1% prevalence of the given conditions. For 3 MS, 1% sample is sufficient depending on the combination number of flocks and broilers/feet chosen. For 1 MS, when any combination is used, 1% of flocks slaughtered is a sufficient sample to assess prevalence of 1%. A general approach for designing and ensuring representativeness of sampling plans in MS was proposed. The recommended sampling scheme better fitting for this data collection is a three stage sampling scheme, where the selection of the unit at each level could be based on established criteria. Finally, in the case an EU harmonised data collection is implemented in the future, it is recommended to submit the collected data in a harmonised way through the EFSA Data Collection Framework. This report proposes a possible data model for the submission of the data.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive impairment is a prevalent problem among the homeless and seems related to more psychosocial problems. However, little is known about the care needs of the subgroup of homeless people with an intellectual disability compared to those without an intellectual disability and how their care needs develop over time. This study explores self-reported care needs within a broad range of life domains among Dutch homeless people with and without a suspected intellectual disability to gain insight into the transition of self-reported care needs from baseline to follow-up in both subgroups. This longitudinal study is part of a cohort study among homeless people who had been accepted for an individual programme plan in four major Dutch cities. The initial cohort consisted of 513 participants who were interviewed in 2011. At 1.5-year follow-up, 336 participants (65.5%) were also interviewed and screened for intellectual disability. Of these participants, 31% (95% CI 26.2?36.1) had a suspected intellectual disability. For both groups, between baseline and follow-up, the number of ?unmet care needs? decreased significantly and the number of ?no care needs? increased significantly, while at follow-up, participants with a suspected intellectual disability reported ?no care needs? on significantly fewer life domains than those without a suspected intellectual disability (mean numbers 16.4 vs. 17.5). Between baseline and follow-up, ?met care needs? decreased significantly on housing for both groups, and increased on finances and dental care for participants with a suspected intellectual disability. At follow-up, participants with a suspected intellectual disability more often preferred housing support available by appointment than those without a suspected intellectual disability. These findings suggest that homeless people who had been accepted for an individual programme plan with a suspected intellectual disability have care needs for a longer period of time than those without a suspected intellectual disability. Providing care to homeless people with a suspected intellectual disability might require ongoing care and support, also after exiting homelessness. Support services should take this into account when considering their care provision and planning of services.

AB  - An account is given of the pathology and incidence of spontaneous arterial disease occurring in a series of about 2000 vertebrates, the majority of which died in captivity from natural causes. The personal observations are integrated with a fairly detailed review of the literature. Vascular lesions have been described in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Particular attention is given in this paper to the comparative pathology of degenerative arterial disease and, more especially, atherosclerosis. Minor degrees of lipid infiltration of the arterial wall are seen commonly in many avian and mammalian orders, but more advanced atheromatous plaques occur frequently only in some avian orders and man. Atheroma has been observed occasionally in sub-human primates and ungulates. Focal degeneration and calcification of the arterial media constitute the major arterial lesion in ungulates and marsupials; parasitic arteritides are seen principally in carnivores, equines and, possibly, reptiles. Arterial thrombosis in animals is usually secondary to local physical injury or infection; occlusive atherothrombosis is extremely rare in all animals. A hypothesis is presented on the histogenesis of atherosclerosis as it occurs in animals. It is concluded that the condition is a multifactorial disease. The role of dietary and other factors which may play a part in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is discussed. Age is the only factor shown to be fairly directly related to atherosclerosis, but the almost complete absence of lesions in some comparatively old animals emphasizes that atheroma is not an inevitable accompaniment of senescence. The morphological pattern of arterial disease would appear to be similar in free-living and captive animals; and though increasing age and the conditions of captivity may potentiate lesions, it would seem likely that the primary causes of arterial disease are operative in natural, quasi-natural or captive environments.
