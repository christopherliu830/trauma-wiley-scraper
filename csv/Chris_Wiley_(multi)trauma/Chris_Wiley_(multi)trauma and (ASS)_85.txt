AB  - One of the possible complications of implant treatment is the occurrence of an implant fracture. Metal fatigue and biomechanical overload seem to be the most common causes of fractured implants. This study evaluated 4 implants (3 hollow cylinders and 1 hollow screw) which fractured after a mean loading period of 2.8 years. All implants had a 4 mm diameter and had been inserted in a posterior location. In 3 cases parafunctional habits were present. In all cases a vertical resorption of the peri-implant bone was present. The endosseous portion of the implant presented always a very high bone-implant contact percentage. Scanning electron microscopic examination showed that at least one of the implant holes was involved in the fracture line; no porosities or material defects were observed on the fractured surface of the implant. In hollow implants the holes could represent a site of less resistance. J Periodontol 1998;69:185?189.
