AB  - Summary Parasitic zoonoses belong to the most important human diseases worldwide. They are caused by protozoa, helminths [trematodes (flukes), cestodes (tapeworms), and nematodes (round worms)], Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), pentastomids (tongue worms), and arthropods. The last of these plays an additional role as a transmitter of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths.
