AB  - Summary This chapter provides the readers with what it believes to be ecojust alternatives to neoliberalism-influenced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education projects. In doing so, it seems to have attended different ontological, epistemological, and axiological perspectives on STEM education. The chapter suggests that reformers launch a program of counter-hegemonic globalization that, rather than ?re-inventing the wheel?, ?capitalizes? on many existing actants in capitalist networks, including, among many, electronic social networks, educational entities, and transnational agencies. One approach to school science that prioritizes social justice and environmental sustainability is the STEPWISE program. The chapter presents the cases in which university-based science teacher educators from different institutional contexts around the world describe alternatives to neoliberalism-influenced STEM education. They are: towards globalization as possibility; science education guided by social and ecojustice principles; connecting pre-service teachers to social movements; considering 'the other' in science teacher education; socio-technical controversies in and out of classrooms.

AB  - Summary Psychosocial and behavioral factors play a major role in health preservation, medical outcomes, and healthcare delivery, together encompassing healthcare outcomes. Several broadband psychometric instruments (MMPI, MBHI, MBMD) have been useful in predicting healthcare outcomes relevant to behavioral medicine research and practice. The MMPI has been shown to predict pain-related outcomes, surgical outcomes, and the course of some diseases. The MBHI and MBMD have been shown to predict outcomes in HIV/AIDS, cancer, end-stage renal disease, heart disease, organ and stem cell transplant populations, and responses to anti-retroviral, anti-coagulant, and pain treatment programs. Recent validation studies with the MBMD have produced normative data and specialized reports for bariatric surgery patients and pain treatment settings, and predictive validity research is accumulating.
