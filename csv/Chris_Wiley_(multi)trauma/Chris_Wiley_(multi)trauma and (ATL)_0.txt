AB  - Abstract Objective Regionalised civilian trauma systems improve patient outcomes, but may deskill clinicians outside major trauma services (MTSs). We aimed to characterise experience and confidence in trauma management among emergency physicians working in MTS to those working elsewhere. Methods Emergency physicians working within the Victorian State Trauma System were surveyed about their pre- and post-fellowship training experience, their estimated hours per fortnight in different centres, the frequency of performance/supervision of critical emergency skills and their confidence in a range of trauma skills. Results The 138 respondents analysed represented 33% of active Victorian FACEMs. The cohort were mostly males (69.6%), younger than 50 (75.4%) and were generally (69.6%) six or more years post-fellowship. FACEMs working in a MTS were more likely to have been a trauma registrar prior to fellowship (13.3% vs 3.7%, P = 0.046). MTS clinicians performed more, supervised more and were more confident in trauma team leading, traumatic airway management and rapid infusion catheter and multi-access catheters. Confidence in trauma team leading was only associated with exposure to performance or supervision of trauma team leading. Performance of trauma team leading was more common in clinicians at a MTS (odds ratio 3.19, 95%?CI 1.00?10.20, P = 0.05). Conclusion Exposure to major trauma is associated with time spent working in a MTS and exposure is associated with confidence. A mature inclusive trauma system must ensure clinicians across the system gain the experience or training to provide trauma care that will result in similar outcomes for patients regardless of initial presenting hospital.

AB  - Objectives To investigate whether implementing a geriatric resuscitation protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement is associated with lower mortality through the early recognition of occult hypoperfusion (OH). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level I trauma center. Participants All hemodynamically stable individuals with blunt trauma aged 65 and older admitted to the Level I trauma center from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011 (n = 1,998). Measurements Mortality over time (according to quarter) was analyzed using an adjusted logarithmic regression model stratified according to the presence of OH. OH was defined as lactate of 2.5 mM or greater. Results Overall mortality was 3.9% (n = 78). Admission venous lactate was collected in 73.5% of participants, of whom 20.5% had OH (n = 301). In participants with OH, a significant decrease in mortality was observed over time (adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.66, P = .002). A smaller yet significant decrease in mortality rates in participants with normal perfusion status was also observed (adjusted R2 = 0.55, P = .01). Conclusion Early identification and treatment of OH in elderly adults with trauma using venous lactate-guided therapy coupled with early trauma surgeon involvement was associated with significantly lower mortality. A protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement should be followed to improve the care of elderly adults with trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Trauma is an important health problem. With the anticipated decline in communicable diseases and nutritional problems in the next millennium, trauma might replace communicable diseases as a problem and rank second only to non-communicable diseases. Trauma is a surgical disease and a general surgeon?s leadership is imperative to the success of regional trauma systems. Designation of trauma centres would improve patient outcomes, increase surgeons? experience and reduce costs in health care. The success of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Programme has shown how the input of surgeons can change the concept of our care for trauma victims. The lack of local trauma data has limited our appraisal to intellectual guessing. To objectively appraise local demand, a territory-wide major trauma outcome study should be conducted in Hong Kong.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the peripheral vascular trauma. The presence of a vascular ?hard sign? is highly specific for major vascular injury and mandates operative exploration, however, absence of hard signs does not reliably exclude injury. In contrast, the ?soft signs? of vascular injury does not reliably predict major vascular trauma. It is generally accepted that in the absence of hard signs, patients with a normal peripheral vascular examination does not require further investigation regardless of the presence of soft signs. The arterial pressure index (API) has gained acceptance in some trauma centers as a useful tool in the evaluation of peripheral vascular trauma. While duplex ultrasonography is non-invasive, it is less sensitive in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular trauma than angiography and requires the presence of a trained ultrasonographer, who may not be available at all times.

AB  - Aim.? The aim of this ethnographic study was to explore the culture of a trauma team in relation to human factors. Background.? Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death in the first four decades of life in the western world. Evidence suggests that the initial assessment and resuscitation of trauma victims is most successfully carried out by an organized trauma team. Most trauma teams use Advanced Trauma Life Support principles which focus on rapid assessment and management of the patient's injuries. Similarly, most trauma education focuses on Advanced Trauma Life Support principles, concentrating firmly on the patient's physical status. Nevertheless, contemporary literature about emergency teams suggests that human factors, such as communication and interprofessional relationships, can affect the team's performance regardless of how clinically skilled the team members are. Method.? Focused ethnography was used to explore the culture of a trauma team in one teaching hospital. Six periods of observation were undertaken followed by 11 semi-structured interviews with purposively chosen key personnel. Data from transcripts of the observation field notes and interviews were analysed using open coding, followed by formation of categories resulting in the emergence of six central categories. Results.? Findings suggest that leadership, role competence, conflict, communication, the environment and the status of the patient all influence the culture of the trauma team. Interpretation of these categories suggests that trauma team education should include human factor considerations such as leadership skills, team management, interprofessional teamwork, conflict resolution and communication strategies. Relevance for clinical practice.? The findings suggest that support systems for role development of junior team leaders should be formalized. The proven airline industry techniques of Crew Resource Management, focusing on teamwork and effective communication, could be implemented into continuing professional development for trauma teams to engender collaboration and interprofessional practice.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aims to compare the trauma care systems in Asian countries. Methods Asian countries were categorised into three groups; ?lower middle-income country?, ?upper middle-income country? and ?high-income country?. The Medline/PubMed database was searched for articles published from January 2005 to December 2014 using relevant key words. Articles were excluded if they examined a specific injury mechanism, referred to a specific age group, and/or did not have full text available. We extracted information and variables on pre-hospital and hospital care factors, and regionalised system factors and compared them across countries. Results A total of 46 articles were identified from 13 countries, including Pakistan, India, Vietnam and Indonesia from lower middle-income countries; the Islamic Republic of Iran, Thailand, China, Malaysia from upper middle-income countries; and Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore from high-income countries. Trauma patients were transported via various methods. In six of the 13 countries, less than 20% of trauma patients were transported by ambulance. Pre-hospital trauma teams primarily comprised emergency medical technicians and paramedics, except in Thailand and China, where they included mainly physicians. In Iran, Pakistan and Vietnam, the proportion of patients who died before reaching hospital exceeded 50%. In only three of the 13 countries was it reported that trauma surgeons were available. In only five of the 13 countries was there a nationwide trauma registry. Conclusion Trauma care systems were poorly developed and unorganised in most of the selected 13 Asian countries, with the exception of a few highly developed countries.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To investigate differences between paediatric patients with moderate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatric ED, with respect to: demographics, patterns of presentation, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), interventions and outcome. Method:? Retrospective cohort study. Moderate to severe trauma was defined as ISS >9. Paediatric patients admitted to hospital via Starship Children's Emergency or KidzFirst ED, with trauma from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, with ISS >9 were identified using multiple databases. The charts were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, hospital of first presentation, diagnoses, ISS, Paediatric trauma score (PTS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), ventilator hours, length of admission, survival and discharge destination. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals, Mann?Whitney U-test, ?2-test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. Results:? A total of 393 children with moderate to severe trauma were identified using initial search strategies. Of these, 82 children met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study; 42 children were admitted via KidzFirst ED and 40 via Starship Children's ED. There was no statistically significant difference in ISS (P= 0.86), PTS (P= 0.11), GCS (P= 0.62), hours on a ventilator (P= 0.28) and length of stay (P= 0.87) between children admitted from Starship or KidzFirst ED. Conclusion:? This study suggests that there are no differences in the numbers or severity of paediatric trauma patients admitted from the Starship and KidzFirst ED. This indicates triage is to the closest ED despite having a tertiary referral centre for paediatric trauma available in Auckland City.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Hemoperitoneum in the hypotensive trauma patient is an indication for emergent laparotomy. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) is a widely used tool for detecting hemoperitoneum. The usefulness of FAST is currently limited by low sensitivity. We hypothesize rolling patients onto their right side will pool small volumes of fluid into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen leading to increased sensitivity. Methods Peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited for voluntary participation in a small pilot prospective clinical trial. Each participant first underwent a supine FAST followed by a 30-second roll onto the right side. Once back in the supine position, the FAST was repeated (FASTeR or FAST examination after right-sided roll). About 50?mL aliquots of dialysate were sequentially infused into the abdomen and the imaging sequence repeated until a positive finding was obtained. Results Seven patients were consented for the study. One patient was found to have an equivocal examination secondary to renal cysts. All six remaining participants converted to a positive FASTeR at an intra-abdominal fluid volume at which standard FAST was negative. Conclusions Rolling patients to the right side increased FAST sensitivity, converting false-negative to true positives examinations. A larger study is needed to validate our preliminary data.

AB  - Background Trauma systems have improved outcomes for injured patients, but might be challenging to implement. We assessed the implementation of a trauma system in Norway after recommendations for a national trauma system were published in 2007, with a focus on elements in acute care hospitals. Methods All hospitals in Norway, except for the four regional trauma centres, admitting injured patients at the time of the study were included in a telephone survey. The questionnaire was administered during May 2013 by the regional trauma coordinators who interviewed the local trauma coordinator and/or the local doctor responsible for trauma care in all the acute care hospitals. The main categories were availability of the trauma team and team training, written procedures, preparedness and training of personnel. The compliance to a set of 17 predefined trauma system criteria was evaluated at each institution. Results Of the 35 acute care hospitals in Norway admitting trauma patients at the time of the survey, all were included. The median number of fulfilled criteria was 14. Major deficiencies were found in fulfilling competence criteria, maintaining a local trauma registry, and trauma audits. The number of fulfilled criteria correlated strongly with the size of the hospital and the frequency of trauma team activation. Conclusions Shortcomings in requirements for lower-level trauma care hospitals correlate to hospital size and frequency with which the trauma team is activated. In order to fulfill the minimum requirements, smaller hospitals should receive more attention.

AB  - Summary It is important to remember that while trauma is the most common cause for deaths in childhood, the majority of paediatric trauma results only in minor injury, but may be associated with long-term morbidity that stretches into adulthood. Here, injury prevention is the best strategy. This chapter discusses the ways to lessen or prevent childhood injury, and the mechanism of injury. It talks about the initial assessment and management of childhood injury. Patient management consists of a rapid primary survey and resuscitation of vital functions, followed by a more detailed secondary assessment, then stabilisation and transfer to definitive care centre where required. There are various scoring systems, which exist to allow the quantification of the magnitude of single or multiple injuries, for example, the Champion Trauma Score and Paediatric Trauma Score (PTS). These scores can be a useful predictor of outcome and allow comparison of groups of trauma patients.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

AB  - Background? A balanced transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets are recommended for massively bleeding trauma patients. Fibrinogen concentrates could potentially lessen or replace the need for FFP and/or platelet transfusions. Aim? To provide a review of the literature covering the application of fibrinogen concentrates in trauma care. Methods? PubMed and Cochrane database search: fibrinogen and (concentrate or trauma), not congenital, published between 2000 and 2012. Results? Six papers were identified. None were randomized controlled trials. The main conclusion of these papers was that administration of fibrinogen sometimes together with prothrombin complex concentrate might improve haemostasis in trauma patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Data regarding the effect of fibrinogen concentrate together with a more physiological resuscitation fluid, i.e. FFP, or as the only intervention in bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Conclusions? Evidence for the use of fibrinogen concentrate to trauma patients with massive bleeding is sparse, of poor quality and confined to patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of fibrinogen concentrate, as the only intervention, are urgently needed.

AB  - Audit is the evaluation of patient care. The care of the injured patient commences at the accident scene and involves prehospital triage and management, emergency hospital assessment and resuscitation, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, operative surgery, intensive care unit management, acute hospital care and rehabilitation. Audit assesses the delivery of trauma care and clinical management and through identification of inadequacies facilitates the introduction of appropriate improvements. Both the American National Academy of Sciences?National Research Council and the Australian National Health & Medical Research Council have recommended the establishment of an audit process to evaluate the quality of trauma management and to obtain quality assurance. They have advised that this process would be assisted by the development of regional trauma registries and a uniform approach to the grading of injuries. Reduction in the preventable death rate, frequency of complications and duration of hospitalization has followed audits as a result of changes in the organization and quality of trauma care. In the United States, for example, the preventable death rate after injury was reduced from 35 to 15% in Orange County, California and from 14 to 3% in San Diego County, California. Studies from Great Britain, The Netherlands, Canada, Australia and elsewhere have further supported the view that trauma audit modifies practice leading to reductions in mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Background: Most studies on trauma and trauma systems have been conducted in the United States. We aimed to describe the factors predicting mortality in European trauma patients, with focus on triage. Methods: We prospectively registered all trauma patients in Eastern Denmark over 12 consecutive months. We analysed the flow of trauma patients through the system, the time spent at different locations, and we assessed the risk factors of mortality. Results: We included 2875 trauma patients, of whom 158 (5.5%) died before arrival at the hospital. Most patients (75.3%) were brought to local hospitals and patients primarily (n=82) or secondarily triaged (n=203) to the level I trauma centre were the most severely injured. Secondarily transferred patients spent a median of 150?min in the local hospital before transfer to the level I trauma centre and 48?min on transportation. Severe injury with an injury severity score >15 was seen in 345 patients, of whom 118 stayed at the local hospital. They had a significantly higher mortality than 116 of those secondarily transferred [45/118, 38.1% vs. 11/116, 9.7% (P<0.0001)]. Mortality within 30 days was 4.3% in admitted patients, and significant risk factors of death were violence [odds ratio (OR)=5.72], unconsciousness (OR=4.87), hypotension (OR=4.96), injury severity score >15 (OR=27.42), and age. Conclusions: Around 50% of all trauma deaths occurred at the scene. Increased survival of severely injured patients may be achieved by early transfer to highly specialised care.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To record the current standards of management and education in trauma surgery in 12 geographically and socioeconomically diverse countries in Europe. Design: Questionnaire study. Setting: Teaching hospital, Austria. Intervention: Questionnaire sent to experts on trauma in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Main outcome measure: Comparison of management of patients before, during, and after admission to hospital, and opportunities for initial and in-service training. Results: Management of patients and opportunities for training varied considerably from country to country, ranging from an organised trauma service throughout with specialised training to a haphazard and variable service that depended more on individual hospitals, doctors and patients. Conclusions: Standardisation of management and training would be desirable, and should be possible at least in countries that are members of the European Union.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Sonographers of a large, metropolitan health service were trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma in preparation for a potential mass casualty incident. Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.
