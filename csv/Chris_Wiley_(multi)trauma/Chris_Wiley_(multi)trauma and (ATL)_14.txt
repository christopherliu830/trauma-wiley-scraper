AB  - A transition from methadone to buprenorphine without intervening withdrawal symptoms is critical for advancing the treatment of opioid-dependent patients. Four pregnant inpatients were transferred from methadone (65?85 mg) to five days of immediate release morphine (IRM) and then to buprenorphine (12?28 mg). Withdrawal scores decreased during the five days of IRM and subsequently increased over the first three days on buprenorphine. The transitional use of IRM appears safe for both mother and fetus. Withdrawal symptoms appeared during buprenorphine induction; however, these data suggest that the intensity of withdrawal symptoms may be lessened by the dose and frequency of buprenorphine administration.

AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the development and activity of a multidisciplinary service to manage self-poisoning. DesignDescriptive, comparative study with prospective data collection. SettingRegional toxicology treatment centre in the Hunter area of New South Wales (NSW) with primary and secondary referral service to 385000 people and tertiary referral service to a further 100000. PatientsAll patients (1987-1995) with poisoning or envenomation presenting to the Hunter Area Toxicology Service (HATS). Main outcome measuresAverage length of stay for HATS compared with national and NSW hospitals; mortality data for HATS compared with NSW. ResultsAverage length of stay for HATS was 0.53-1.22 days shorter than for all Australian hospitals, potentially saving 518 bed-days, valued at $468000 per year. Average length of stay was 0.94-3.39 days shorter than for all NSW hospitals, saving 1470 bed-days at $1.4 million per year. Inpatient mortality (0.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0-1.1) was not significantly different from NSW (0.5%; 95% Cl, 0.2-0.8). Standardised mortality ratios showed no greater all-cause suicide mortality. ConclusionsIn our centralised model for managing self-poisoning, all toxicology patients in an area health service are diverted to one hospital, where all patients with deliberate self-poisoning are admitted under the one multidisciplinary team, and all receive psychiatric assessment. This model has substantially reduced bed stay, with considerable savings to the Hunter Area Health Service manifested as an increase in beds available for other purposes.

AB  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the practical applications of simulation and brings some exciting and varied case examples from experts across the world which share the challenges and opportunities that the use of simulation in healthcare education can bring. Included in the chapter are reports and examples from around the world; from Australia, the Netherlands, the USA, Africa and the UK and from both primary and secondary care. Another common theme from the examples in the chapter is the concept of professional role modeling in simulation based education. The case studies in the chapter demonstrate the need to pay attention to the theoretical and pedagogical underpinnning of simulation activities such as behaviourism for over-learning, social constructivism for resolving cognitive conflicts and transformative learning.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bilateral uterine artery embolisation (UAE) was used to treat 11 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Uterine volume and dominant fibroid volume were assessed quantitatively by ultrasonography both before and at two and six months post procedure. Both uterine arteries were occluded effectively in all of the women, and the procedure was well tolerated, with hospital stays limited to 24?48 hours in all cases. An improvement of symptoms occurred in 10 of the 11 women. There were no significant complications. The mean percentage reductions in uterine volume and dominant fibroid volume at six months following the procedure were 45.32% and 56.34%, respectively. Bilateral uterine artery embolisation for the treatment of uterine fibroids is a minimally invasive technique with very good clinical results. This procedure may be considered as an alternative to hysterectomy, or myomectomy in properly selected cases.

AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.
