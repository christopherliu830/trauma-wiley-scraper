AB  - Abstract Problem Asherman's syndrome (AS) is characterized by endometrial fibrosis leading to intrauterine adhesions and symptoms like hypomenorrhea, infertility, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Macrophages are key regulators of inflammation, tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. However, the role of macrophages in AS remains unclear. Method of study Endometrial biopsies of AS patients and controls were collected during the late proliferating phase of menstrual cycle. Fibrosis and proliferation markers were detected by Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. Macrophages were examined by immunostaining and flow cytometry. The expression levels of CCL2, CSF1, CSF1R, and GM-CSF were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. A well-differentiated endometrial cell line Ishikawa (IK) was used for in vitro studies. Macrophages differentiating from THP-1 monocytic cells were polarized by IL-4/IL-13. Their culture supernatants (M(IL-4/13)-S) were applied to H2O2 or bleomycin-damaged IK cells. Results In AS patients, endometrial stroma was replaced by fibrous tissue and cell proliferation was reduced. Macrophages in endometrial tissue were mainly alternative activated macrophages and their number was significantly decreased in AS patients. The CSF1 expression level was reduced in AS patients. M(IL-4/13)-S promoted the growth and migration of IK cells and inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis. M(IL-4/13)-S protected IK cells from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Conclusion Macrophages are critical cells involved in the process of endometrial repair and fibrosis. The decreased amount of endometrial macrophages may be attributed to the reduced expression level of CSF1. Manipulation of macrophage activation/function may provide a novel therapeutic target for AS.

AB  - Objective? Playground and sporting accidents account for a large percentage of paediatric injuries, yet they are largely preventable. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors and mechanisms associated with upper and lower limb fractures in children. Method? 145 children admitted to a regional Australian hospital (Coffs Harbour Base Hospital) totalling 207 upper and lower limb fractures over an 12 month period between January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2004 were identified from the hospital medical records database. Retrospective analysis was performed on demographic data, fracture type and mechanisms causing the fracture. Results? Males accounted for 69.7% of all childhood limb fractures. 77.7% of all fractures were upper limb, while 22.3% were lower limb. The leading causes of lower limb fractures were football injuries, push bike accidents, and aquatic accidents, accounting for 51.8% of all lower limb fractures. Monkey bars, swings, trees, skateboard and scooter accidents were associated with a relatively high prevalence of upper limb injuries when compared to other injury mechanisms. Football, push bike and skateboard accidents alone accounted for 40.6% of fractures in our male patients. This figure was only 4.5% in our female patients, and in general, the causes of fractures in females are more evenly distributed. Conclusion? Limb fractures in children have a diverse range of causes, but specific fractures occur more frequently in particular sexes and with certain activities. There is a role for further injury prevention targeting specific high risk groups and activities.

AB  - The clinical trigger to consider the presence of a coagulopathy is the onset of non-surgically controllable bleeding. While earlier consensus documents considered this event predictable by modelling blood loss, and factor level decline, we now recognize confounding variables such as shock, hypothermia, metabolic disturbances and fibrinolysis confuse the picture to such an extent traditional treatment algorithms are irrelevant. The monitoring of coagulopathy by traditional coagulation screens also lacks validation, and is usually so delayed in response time to become irrelevant to appropriate management. Attaining euvolaemia is possible with large volume dedicated infusion systems but in a patient with massive mediator release and comorbidities may not achieve adequate tissue oxygen delivery. Evidence based transfusion triggers are still lacking. Management of coagulopathy is by component replacement early. Delays occur because of slow coagulation test turnaround times, and the place of newer point of care monitors and thrombelastography needs evaluation. Delay in delivery of blood components due to processing time may worsen the outcome. Factor VIIa probably has a unique place in the management of coagulopathy in these patients, but studies are needed to define dosage and time of dose (2). The management of acidosis and hyperlactaemia are fundamentally improved by better perfusion, but short term correction may be indicated to reinforce coagulation factor function.
