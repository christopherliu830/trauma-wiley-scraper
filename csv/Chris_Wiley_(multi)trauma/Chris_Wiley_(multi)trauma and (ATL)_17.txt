AB  - ?Hurricane Katrina ? Unorganized, unprepared and internationally embarrassed? Despite well defined, pre-exisiting organizational plans and national response strategies, Hurricane Katrina exposed major weaknesses in the ability of a region or nation to respond to a tragedy of significant magnitude. Significant lessons were learned from the event. Must have in place: ?? A national and regional disaster response plan ?? A ?Chain of Command / Responsibility? Doctrine ?? A national and regional disaster response system ?? National, regional and local ?Incident Command? structures ?? Emergency supply stockpiles ?? Pre-established communication frequencies Major considerations: ?? Make this a military function ? make all civilian agencies report to them ?? Military has the comm, logistics, command structure, personnel and the training to take on this mission. ?? Train for an event at regional and national levels ?? Cross train all responders ?? Eliminate the red tape at the front end of the event ?? Mobilize and ?do it?

AB  - SUMMARY Fifty-seven patients (45 males, 12 females) with a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were serially evaluated by ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT). Thirty patients had a single study, 18 had one follow-up study while 9 had two follow-up studies. The aetiology was gallstone disease in 26% of patients and a history of chronic alcohol abuse in only 16%. No cause could be identified in 47% of patients; 22% of US scans were unsatisfactory for the evaluation of pancreas whereas CT was uniformly satisfactory. Peripancreatic inflammation was detected in only 29% patients on US compared with 91% on CT. Pancreatic abscesses were detected in 8 patients on CT and gas was present in all of them. Fourteen patients underwent guided interventional procedures (US, 12; CT, 2). On follow up after 3 months, worsening of inflammation was detected in 11% patients on CT, which was not detected on US. It is concluded from this study that CT is far superior to US in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis, detection of peripancreatic inflammation and its extension into the retroperitoneal compartments and mesentery, and also for the evaluation of fluid collections, haemorrhage and abscesses. However, US provides easy guidance for percutaneous interventional procedures and can be used for follow-up scans.

AB  - The single vehicle rollover accident is a highly complex crash mode and there is growing concerns about its incidents and consequences in central Australia. The aim of this paper is to assess: 1 The incidence and injury patterns of rollover accidents 2 Pre rollover characteristics on rollover propensity 3 The injury severity and outcome of rollover accidents The absence of speed limit, unfenced roads, vast distances traveled, unsealed roads and high use of alcohol makes the spectrum of MVA? s in NT unique. In this two year period of study from Jan 2004 ? Dec 2005, there were 470 motor vehicle accidents of which 126 were single vehicle rollover accidents. 132 patients were admitted; 73 NT residents of which 45 were of aboriginal origin and 14 were international tourists. There were 37 deaths in Central Australian roads and 20 were due to single vehicle rollover accidents. None of the deaths occurred at the Alice Springs hospital . Most rollover accidents occur at a speed above 100?km/h. 24 patients had an ISS?>?15 and 35% of all injuries were to head, neck and shoulder. Rollovers occurred when the vehicle left the road way and encountered a tripping mechanism such as soft dirt or loose gravel. Those who were belted fared better than those unbelted occupants. Completely ejected occupants were all unbelted. Mean time to hospital from time of accident was 8Hrs. Primary prevention strategies need to involve remote communities, tourists traveling in central Australia and address alcohol and restraint use.

AB  - Abstract. This article reviews molecular mechanism of intraocular inflammation in animal models and in humans, and the immunological defence system of the eye with particular attention to ocular pigment epithelium. In experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes, play a central role in its immunopathogenic mechanisms. In humans, activated CD4+ T cells also play a central role in the immunopathogenic mechanisms. This notion is demonstrated in two human diseases: one is Vogt?Koyanagi?Harada disease, and the other is human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) uveitis. Activated CD4+ T cells infiltrating the eye are harmful to vision-related cells and tissues in the eye and cause sight-threatening conditions. However, the eye has regional defence systems to protect itself from these harmful activated T cells. We focus on ocular pigment epithelium (PE) and demonstrate immunoregulatory activity of iris PE and retinal PE. Iris PE suppresses activated CD4+ T cells by cell-to-cell contact with a crucial role played by B7-2 molecule on iris PE and CTLA4 on T cells. The actual immunosuppressive factor being membrane bound TGF-?. In contrast, retinal PE suppresses activated CD4+ T cells by soluble factors, such as soluble TGF-? and thrombospondin 1. In addition to the direct T-cell suppression by ocular PE, ocular PE has the capacity to promote activated T cells to regulatory T cells and use them as a tool to amplify the immune down regulation in the eye. The molecular mechanisms of generation of T regulatory cells by iris PE and retinal PE is also discussed.

AB  - KCNE5?Gene Variant, QTc and Survival in ACS.?Introduction:?The KCNE family is a group of small transmembrane channel proteins involved in potassium ion (K+) conductance. The X-linked?KCNE5?gene encodes a regulator of the K+ current mediated by the potassium channel KCNQ1. Polymorphisms in?KCNE5?have been associated with altered cardiac electrophysiological properties in human studies. We investigated associations of the common rs697829 polymorphism from?KCNE5?with baseline characteristics, baseline electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements, and patient survival in a cohort of post-acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients (the Coronary Disease Cohort Study cohort). Methods and Results: DNA samples (n = 1,740) were genotyped for rs697829 using a TaqMan assay. Baseline ECG data revealed corrected QT (QTc) interval was associated with rs697829 in male, but not female, patients, being extended in the G genotype group (A 416 ± 1.71; G 431 ± 4.25 ms, P = 0.002). Covariate-adjusted survival was poorest in G genotype patients in Cox proportional hazard modeling of mortality data of males (Poverall= 0.020). Male patients with G genotype had a hazard ratio of 1.44 (1.11?2.33) for death when compared to the A genotype male patients (P = 0.048) after adjustment for age, baseline log-transformed N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), ?-blocker and insulin treatment, QTc interval, history of myocardial infarction, and physical activity score. Conclusion: This study suggests an association between rs697829, a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from KCNE5, and ECG measurements and survival in postacute ACS patients. Prolonged subclinical QT interval may be a marker of adverse outcome in this group of patients.?(J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 23 p. 319-324, March 2012.)
