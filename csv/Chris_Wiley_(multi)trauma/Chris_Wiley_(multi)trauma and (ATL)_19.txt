AB  - Abstract The Children Act (1989), Department for Education and Employment Circular 10/95, Protecting Children from Abuse: the role of the education service and government guidance place increasing responsibilities upon schools to be proactive in child protection. This article examines policy and practice in relation to child protection in primary schools and reports the perspectives of child protection coordinators. It draws on the findings of the Social Work in Primary Schools (SWIPS) project based on qualitative research in 15 primary schools and a national questionnaire survey. The findings are analysed in relation both to Nias's discussion of the ?culture of care? in primary schools and to the tensions between the Government's inclusive education rhetoric and its Standards agenda.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Acquired laryngotracheal stenosis (ALTS) results from abnormal mucosal wound healing after laryngeal and/or tracheal injury. Patients with ALTS often present late after significant reduction of the airway lumen and onset of symptoms. Motivated by the need for earlier detection of affected patients, we sought to investigate genetic markers for ALTS that would identify susceptible patients. Study Design Pilot Case-Control Study. Methods Seventy-six patients were recruited, 40 patients with ALTS and 36 control patients with airway injury but without ALTS. DNA was isolated from whole blood and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from patients. Custom primers were designed and the TaqMan assay employing allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to interrogate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs2569190, rs1799750, and rs1800469 located in candidate genes CD14, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1), respectively. A logistic regression model was used to examine the association of candidate gene polymorphisms with the presence or absence of ALTS. Results All 76 patients were successfully genotyped at the three loci of interest by optimizing the genotyping protocol. MMP-1 SNP rs1799750 was most significantly associated with development of ALTS (P?=?0.005). Conclusion Identification of SNPs associated with development of ALTS will provide new experimental targets to study wound healing in human subjects. The association found in the current study between ALTS and SNP rs1799750 is being validated in a larger population examining an expanded set of relevant SNPs. Identifying patients with genetic susceptibility to ALTS and poor wound healing in the upper airway will be useful for management of patients after upper-airway injury. Level of Evidence N/A.

AB  - ObjectiveTo identify trends in the use of opioid drugs for chronic non-cancer pain. DesignReview of three sets of official records ? the record of Schedule 8 (S8) opioid drugs used in Australia, 1984-1995, from the national Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; New South Wales Department of Health statistical summaries of the number of authorities to prescribe S8 drugs for cancer pain and non-cancer pain for each June from 1990 to 1996; and NSW Department of Health patient records for a cohort of patients first prescribed S8 drugs in 1991. Main outcome measuresTotal quantities of opioids used in Australia; numbers of S8 authorities issued in NSW. Outcome measures for the cohort study were the proportion of patients remaining on opioids long-term, the proportion for whom dose escalated over time, and the diagnoses for which opioids were being prescribed. ResultsBetween 1986 and 1995, the amount of oral morphine used in Australia rose from 117 to 578 kg. Use of all other oral S8 opioids combined increased from 93 to 149 kg. ConclusionsThere has been a dramatic increase in opioid prescribing, a substantial proportion of which is for noncancer pain. In a sample of patients being treated for noncancer pain, long term use and dose escalation occurred in one third of cases.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in acute conjunctivitis (non-trachoma) in Australia and to examine the source of transmission. Design: A prospective survey of 400 consecutive patients presenting with acute conjunctivitis to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Emergency Department, Melbourne, from May to November 1991. Patients identified with chlamydial conjunctivitis during the survey period and in the following two months were assessed for concomitant genital infection. Results: Chlamydia was the causative organism in 2% of patients with acute conjunctivitis. Of 15 patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis, 11 presented with disease in one eye only, and the same number had had symptoms for longer than two weeks. Many had been seen previously by experienced ophthalmologists, yet there were long delays in making a definitive diagnosis. Ten of the 12 adult patients who were assessed had signs of concomitant genital tract infection, although none had past or current genital tract symptoms. Serotyping of chlamydial isolates from the genital tract and eye showed concordance in individual patients. Conclusion: Most cases of ocular chlamydia infection have a genital source. Therefore, it is essential that all patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis and their sexual partners are examined and treated for concomitant genital infection.
