AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess whether prehospital triage guidelines, based on mechanistic criteria alone, accurately identify victims of motor vehicle accidents (MVA) with major injury. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Royal Melbourne Hospital trauma database. Mechanisms analysed were those outlined by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and Advanced Trauma Life Support/Early Management of Severe Trauma prehospital triage guidelines. Results: There were 621 MVA analysed, 253 with major injury (40.7%). Multivariate logistic regression indicated prolonged extrication time (P < 0.0001), cabin intrusion (P = 0.047), high speed (P = 0.003) and ejection from vehicle (P = 0.04) were statistically associated with major injury. Vehicle rollover and fatality in the same vehicle were not statistically associated with major injury. Conclusions: These data suggest that existing guidelines for the prehospital triage of MVA victims, based on mechanistic criteria alone may need revision.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Large volume fluid resuscitation attempting to normalise physiological parameters in hypovolaemic shock has become the accepted management practice during the last 30 years. This doctrine, based on research in the 1950s, teaches that shock increases mortality, aggressive resuscitation improves outcome and normalisation of vital signs protects against multiple organ dysfunction. The wide acceptance of this doctrine is demonstrated by the central role it plays in the American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course and its Australian equivalent the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) course. During the late 1980s, a number of animal research papers demonstrated severe limitations to the earlier work performed in the 1950s and proposed an alternative approach using hypotense or minimal fluid resuscitation. Controlled haemorrhagic shock is hypovolaemic shock in which the source of the bleeding is easily controlled without operation and hence aggressive fluid resuscitation can be pursued with minimum risk. Uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock is hypovolaemic shock due to bleeding which cannot be controlled without surgery. The restoration of blood pressure towards normal levels may lead to dislodgement of thrombus and loss of vascular spasm in damaged vessels, with a subsequent increase in blood loss. It is in this situation that hypotense resuscitation is thought to be of most value. Hypotense resuscitation is defined as the use of fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure at lower than normal levels which are sufficient to maintain life, but minimise the risk of exacerbating internal bleeding. Prompted by animal research a number of human studies have been undertaken to clarify the role of fluid resuscitation in uncontrolled haemorrhage. At present, there is wide acceptance of the use of hypotense or minimal volume resuscitation for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and a recent demonstration that morbidity and mortality are decreased by the use of hypotense resuscitation in penetrating truncal trauma. There are however many other clinical situations that may produce uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock about which we have little clinical data to predict appropriate levels of fluid resuscitation. These include ectopic pregnancy, gastro-intestinal haemorrhage and blunt multi-system trauma. This paper will analyse the animal studies that demonstrate the physiological effects of the various fluid resuscitation regimes and discuss all the clinical papers on the subject of hypotense resuscitation. An attempt will then be made to integrate this data into current Australian practice and give broad guidelines on the modern management of uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock, based on minimal volume or hypotense resuscitation.

AB  - 1 Ahmed T. Abdelmoity, and 1 Amit Verma ( 1 Peter Kellaway Section of Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Benzodiazepines are rarely used as long term therapy for patients with epilepsy. However, once traditional antiepileptic drugs have failed an adjunct trial may be justified to help reduce seizure frequency. 1 ?Patient's Initials ?Seizure Type Seizure frequency ?before Seizure Frequency ?after ?Date started Clorazepate ?dose S.A.

Localization Related - Right Frontal 5?6 per week 1?2 per week 2/09/2005 11.25 at night Patient Demographics and Seizure Frequencies Prior to and After Starting Tranxene SD. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients from the Baylor Comprehensive Epilepsy Program Outpatient Clinic. Patients who had been started on Tranxene SD (a sustained release preparation of Clorazepate) were enrolled into the study. Five patients with refractory epilepsy, met criteria for enrollment. Of these patients, two patients had a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy, and three had a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy. Seizure frequencies were recorded prior to and after the initiation of Tranxene SD. Baseline seizure frequencies ranged from daily seizures to two seizures a week. Duration of follow-up ranged from 20 days to seven months. The total daily dose ranged from 5.625 mg up to 33.75 mg (either in once or twice a day dosing). Results: Tranxene SD was effective in 100% of patients, with 3 of 5 patients becoming seizure free. Please see table for detailed results in each patient. Irritability and increased daytime sleepiness were the most common side effects to Clorazepate. These side effects were tolerated well by the patients. Subjective sleepiness was initially reported by patients, which then returned to baseline. Conclusions: In our small series of patients with refractory generalized and localization related epilepsy, a significant reduction in seizure frequency was seen in all patients started on Tranxene SD. The small sample size may be resonsible for the realtively dramatic results seen in our patients. Adverse reactions including increased sleepiness were manageable. The duration of follow-up was relatively short to assess whether tachyphylaxis is a problem with continued treatment. It is possible that treatment with Tranxene SD (or other benzodiazepines) may be useful in short term durations to help decrease seizure frequencies.

Methods: Forty-six non-consecutive patients with refractory epilepsy submitted to CR were studied. Age ranged from 17 to 58 years (M = 37.6±8.7). Twenty-seven patients were males. All patients have been followed up at the Hospital Brigadeiro Epilepsy Surgery Program in S?o Paulo. The follow-up time range from 2 months to 11 years. Only one patient was unable to read and write. Twenty-four patients have been rendered seizure-free after surgery, 20 patients had partial complex seizures and 2 patients had partial with secondary generalization. Results: Twenty-six patients (56.5%) were professionally impaired by epilepsy. Twenty-seven of them (58.7%) were afraid that seizures could interfere in their professional life; twenty-six patients (56.5%) believed that epilepsy restricted their professional choices and thirty-two of them (69.5%) believed that epilepsy had already caused problems in their professional life. Six of them who were employed before surgery lost their jobs. Three patients that were not working before surgery are employed nowadays. Conclusions: Data concerning epilepsy and employment are scarce in the Brazilian population, especially after CR. Despite the fact that almost all patients could read and write, most of them had no professional skills. The high unemployment and sub-employment rate found in our patients, even in those who were cured by surgery, highlights the need for the development of rehabilitation programs directed to this selected population, as a way of improving quality of life and self-esteem.

Although fatigue is a frequent and disabling symptom in epileptic patients, there have been only a few investigations on the subject. We examined the frequency of fatigue and depression in semptomatic and idiopatic epilepsy patients and we aimed to assess the relationship between fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients by using P300. Methods: We measured fatigue and depression with the Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS) and Beck Depression Scale(BDS), respectivelly in 19 patients with idiopatic epilepsy, 54 patients with semptomatic epilepsy and 31 control subjects. The oddball paradigm was used in the measurement of P300 in all groups. Results: FSS and BDS scores were significantly high and latancies of P300 were significantly long in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients. There was a poor corelation between depression and fatigue in epileptic patients. Although latencies of P300 was significantly long in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients with fatigue, there was no correlation latencies of P300 and depression. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there is an important relationship between fatigue and cognitive dysfunctions in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients. 1 Sinan A. Barazi, 1 Richard P. Selway, 1 Gautam Tawari, and 1 Charles E. Polkey ( 1 Neurosurgery, Kings College Hospital, London, United Kingdom ) Rationale: VNS is being used increasingly as treatment for intractable epilepsy. There is to date no long term study investigating the satisfaction of patients with this emerging therapy, and few data on outcome at more than five years Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 62 patients with intractable epilepsy, who were treated at King's College Hospital between 1995 and 2000, by RPS and CEP. The patients' mean age at time of implantation of VNS was 28.7 years (range 6 to 59 years); the average duration of epilepsy at implantation was 20.4 years (4 to 56); the mean age at seizure onset was 8.8 years (0 to 50); mean follow-up was 76 months (51 to 114). 3 patients died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We questioned patients on overall benefit of their VNS treatment, and differences in memory, achievements, mood, verbal skills, alertness, cluster seizures and post-ictal confusion. Results: The median pre- and post-implantation monthly seizure frequency in the 35 patients who continue to use the device are 24 (3 to 1800) and 4.5 (0 to 1000) respectively (mean improvement 59.1%, median follow-up 71 months). Retention rate is 59%. Corresponding median monthly seizure frequency in all patients was 22 (1 to 1800), and 9.5 (0 to 1000). 26 patients (44.1%) had no improvement, 5 (8.5%) had less than 50% improvement, 26 (44.1%) had greater than 50% improvement in seizure frequency (including 4 seizure-free), and 2 patients (3%) were worse. 24 patients who no longer use the device have undergone explantation (median 71 months follow-up; one infection, 23 non-efficacy). 27 patients (45.8%) were dissatisfied with VNS, 26 (44.1%) were satisfied, and 6 (10.1%) were undecided. Of 28 patients who had no improvement or a deterioration in their seizure frequency, 1 was satisfied with the VNS experience, 3 were undecided, and 24 were dissatisfied. Of the 31 patients who experienced an overall improvement in seizure frequency, 3 were dissatisfied, 3 were undecided, and 25 were satisfied. Mean quality of life measures showed an improvement in all domains. Conclusions: VNS shows a long term retention rate and efficacy which is highly favourable when compared to medical treatments for intractable epilepsy. 44.1% of our patient group was satisfied with VNS, and 45.8% of patients was dissatisfied. 1 Iblissen Ben Hamouda, 1 Claude Adam, 1 Michel Baulac, and 1 Vincent Navarro ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France ) Rationale: Pseudo-epileptic seizures (PES) with prolonged duration and resistance to short-acting antiepileptic drug may sometimes be taken for a status epilepticus. Ours goal were to examine (i) the frequency of pseudo-epilepticus status admitted on intensive care units (ICU) among patients with pseudo-epileptic seizures, (ii) the clinical and electrophysiological presentations of these patients and (iii) their comorbidity. Methods: We researched among the population of patients with PES, followed in our Epilepsy Unit on a period of 28 months, those who were admitted in an intensive care unit. We examined clinical and EEG presentation of their manifestations, and medical history. Results: (i) We identified 13 patients for which the diagnosis of pseudo-epilepticus status was secondarly done, among 64 patients with PES. Patients were aged from 16 to 58 years, 5 males and 8 females. Diagnosis of PES was done in intensive care unit in 1/13 cases. (ii) Motor activities were present during PES (n = 12). In intensive care unit, EEG was not performed (n = 6), showed artefacts during the motor activities (n = 2) (that were considered as epileptic for 1 patient), slow waves (n = 1), fast activities due to medication (n = 1) and was normal (n = 3). Eight patients received high doses of AED when admitted on intensive care unit, and three where under respiratory assistance. (iii) Eleven had chronic psychiatric manifestations and 9 had psychogenic precipitating factors. Three patients have a history of epilepsy. Four patients had previous hospitalisations for pseudo-epilepticus status. Conclusions: Pseudo-epileptic statuses admitted in intensive care units are frequent. Clinical presentation and EEG may be misleading. ICU physicians must be aware of this condition and avoid aggressive treatment. 1 Meriem K. Bensalem Owen, and 1 Toufic A. Fakhoury ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY ) Rationale: The objective of this study is to emphasize the importance of repeating video-EEG monitoring in patients with epilepsy when they have a change in seizure semiology and to pay special attention to concomitant ECG recordings. Methods: We describe two patients who developed a change in their semiology after initial video-EEG monitoring. The first patient is a 25 year old man with stereotypic events since childhood characterized by palpitations at times associated with a sensation of fear. His first EEG-CCTV study was unrevealing. Subsequent interviews with witnesses to his events revealed that brief periods of confusion and pressured out of context speech are at times associated with these events. The second patient is a 60 year old woman who was evaluated for a longstanding history of refractory epilepsy. EEG-CCTV monitoring showed partial seizures originating from the left temporal lobe. A few months later there was a change in the semiology of her seizures, which became more severe and associated with loss of consciousness leading to falls. Both patients had repeat EEG-CCTV studies. Results: During the first patient's repeat EEG-CTV study, stereotypical events were recorded and consisted of simple partial seizures with or without evolution to complex partial seizures. On one occasion, there was secondary generalization. The study localized the epileptogenic focus to the right temporal lobe. Concomitant ECG showed sinus tachycardia, with the heart rate increasing up to 200 beats per minute. In the second patient the repeat study again localized the epileptogenic focus to the left temporal lobe. However, with the more severe seizures associated with loss of consciousness, concomitant ECG showed bradycardia leading to asystole which lasted as long as 16 seconds. The patient subsequently had a demand pacemaker inserted. Conclusions: Repeating video-EEG monitoring is critical in the evaluation of patients with epilepsy who develop a change in seizure semiology. In addition, concomitant ECG recordings should be reviewed carefully in view of possible arrhythmogenic effects of seizures. 1 Dietrich Blumer, and 2 Bola Adamolekun ( 1 Psychiatry, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ; and 2 Neurology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ) Rationale: A majority of studies has shown a concurrence rate of epilepsy in patients with nonepileptic seizures (NES) of about 10% to 18%; most frequently epileptic seizures (ES) and NES occur sequentially rather than simultaneously, often beginning with the former (1). This group of patients has found little attention. We have explored the alternating relationship of the two types of paroxysmal disorders and report a novel treatment for patients with the history of both ES and NES - reduction of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to the minimum required to achieve optimal freedom from seizures - that proved remarkably effective in our first two patients, one with initial ES and one with initial NES. The same treatment has since been applied in five more patients with both well documented ES and NES. Methods: Presence of ES and NES were documented by Video-EEG (VEEG) whenever possible. AEDs were very gradually decreased as frequent NES predominated. Results: The first patient had experienced nocturnal ES for 30 years. After 2 years of freedom from seizures, diurnal spells occurred and, over 15 years, became more frequent upon increasing antiepileptic treatments; she became anergic, fearful and headaches became constant. After EEG monitoring showed NES only, her antiepileptic treatment was gradually decreased until she regained, after 2 years, full health without seizures. The second patient was initially diagnosed by VEEG as having NES; he was disabled, anxious and depressed. After 6 years he experienced a flurry of ES, followed by remarkable improvement of his mental state. Upon treatment with AED his former NES condition resumed. He finally recovered once the AED was reduced. Over the last 6 months, the effectiveness of reducing AEDs has been clearly confirmed in five consecutive patients with both types of seizures. Of the seven patients, five had initially presented for treatment with ES and two with NES. Six had a personal history of early trauma, and five had a family history of epilepsy. Conclusions: A lowering of the AED to the minimum required for control of the ES appears to be required to achieve optimal freedom from either seizure. NESs have a psychobiologic basis and have been recognized as posttraumatic startle seizures (2). Excessive suppression of the epileptic paroxysmal activity favors the expression of the posttraumatic paroxysmal activity in patients with both types of paroxysmal disorders. Of etiological significance is the finding that the patients commonly have both a personal history of trauma and a family history of epilepsy.

The time course of these effects has not been fully determined. Methods: The hour before through the hour after seizures in 4 patients with TL epilepsy (11 to 42 years old; 3 female, 1 male; right- sided onset seizures in 2, left-sided onset in 2) were studied. RR intervals were interpolated with a cubic spline function and highpass filtered. Wavelet coefficients were determined from the continuous wavelet transform and converted to amplitudes with the Hilbert transform. Changes in sympathetic and vagal HR modulation were inferred from changes in high frequency (HF, 0.15?0.5 Hz) and low frequency (LF, 0.04?0.15 Hz) power from the following rules: a change in vagal activity is reflected by a change in HF and LF power in that direction, a change in sympathetic activity is reflected in HF activity in that direction, and changes in the LF/HF ratio resolve ambiguous patterns arising from simultaneous changes in sympathetic and vagal HR modulation. Results: Nine complex partial seizures were recorded: 4 secondarily generalized (left onset in 3, right in 1) and 5 did not (left onset in 2, right in 3). Pre-ictal HR modulations attributable to seizures were small in relation to background fluctuations. The number of seizures showing increased sympathetic and decreased vagal HR modulation increased as the seizure approached (Fig 1). 8/9 seizures demonstrated ictal tachycardia (mean pre-ictal HR + 3 SD). All were associated with a very low frequency peak (0.004?0.04 Hz), on average exceeding the pre-ictal baseline by 4.8 SD. This peak was coincident with LF and HF minima, and corresponds to sustained sympathetically mediated acceleration of the HR. In the post-ictal period, in 8/9 seizures vagal HR modulation was at least transiently lower in the post-ictal state than in any of the points in a reference state composed of a random sampling of 20% of the points on the HF and LF curves in the pre-ictal period. Secondarily generalized seizures were associated with longer periods of this degree of vagal depression than complex partial seizures (mean 26 vs. 11 min): limited data suggested that LF HRV and respiratory frequency were uncoupled in this period. Increased post-ictal sympathetic HR modulation was often evident, but was less extreme and of a shorter duration. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that increased sympathetic and decreased vagal HR modulation often precede the electroclinical onset and ictus of TL seizures. The post-ictal period is characterized by decreased vagal HR modulation that persists for considerably longer after secondarily generalized seizures.

Bromfield ( 1 Neurology, Brigham  and 2 Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Despite the fact that refractory status epilepticus (RSE) represents an important cause of neurological morbidity and mortality, there have been few studies of its treatment, particularly comparisons among drugs used for coma-induction. Most studies are case series in which a specific antiepileptic drug (AED) was prescribed, and do not accurately reflect the variety of approaches used in clinical practice. Moreover, the impact on outcome of EEG suppression remains unclear. Methods: Among 127 episodes (107 patients) of status epilepticus (SE) collected from a retrospective database of two tertiary-referral hospitals in Boston, we identified cases that were refractory to first-line (benzodiazepines) and second-line (phenytoin valproate, phenobarbital, or other) AED, and needed intubation and induced coma for clinical management. Coma induction was assessed with regard to the AED used and the extent of EEG suppression achieved. Short-term mortality was analyzed in relationship to demographic and clinical variables, and the treatment strategy used. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results: We identified 49 episodes of RSE occurring in 47 patients. RSE tended to occur more frequently in incident SE than in recurrent SE episodes (p = 0.06). Mortality was 23% for RSE and 8% for non-RSE patients (p = 0.05); patients with RSE episodes were more likely to lack a history of epilepsy (p = 0.01) or of SE (p = 0.05) prior to the study period, and had a higher prevalence of nonconvulsive SE with coma (p = 0.07). One coma-inducing AED was prescribed in 45%, whereas two ore more were used in 55% of episodes; the most used agents were barbiturates (31 episodes), propofol (27) and midazolam (19); in 20/33 (61%) monitored episodes, the medication was titrated to EEG burst-suppression. Demographics, clinical variables and outcome did not differ significantly between the different coma-inducing strategies, or between episodes with and without EEG burst-suppression. Barbiturates showed a tendency to be used preferentially in episodes related to ominous etiologies. Conclusions: RSE has a higher prevalence in incident than in recurrent SE, and shows higher mortality than non-RSE. In our series, RSE episodes were managed with a combination of coma-inducing AED markedly more often than in series published previously. In this setting, which may more accurately reflect usual clinical practice, mortality appears to be independent of the specific AED used for coma induction and the extent of EEG suppression, suggesting, in agreement with previous studies, that the underlying etiology is the main determinant of outcome.

Methods: A 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled trial was undertaken in 28 patients. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 16 years and weight ≥ 30 kg with the maximum interval since epilepsy diagnosis was 3 years and had at least one partial-onset seizure during a 3-months retrospective baseline phase. The main outcome measures proportion of patients who showed 50% or greater reduction in frequency of seizures and withdraw from the study for any reason. Topiramate was initiated at 50 mg/day and titrated to a recommended dose of 200?400 mg/day Results: Topiramate treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in seizure severity based on 77.3% were seizure-free. The percentage of patients with a ≥50% seizure rate reduction from baseline was 13.6%, and 9.1% were not improved. There were no discontinuations from the study due to adverse events. The adverse events were mild intensity included paresthesia, dizziness, weight loss, anorexia, numbness, slow mentation, and hypoesthesia. Conclusions: The study suggests that topiramate in doses 50?200 mg/day was well tolerated and effective in the monotherapy treatment of patients with partial epilepsy.

Cysneiros, 3 Cristine Baldauf, 3 Meire Argentoni-Baldochi, 3 Cassio R. Forster, 3 Carla Baise-Zung, 3 Valeria A. Mello, 3 Claudia T.S. Ruggi, and 3 Arthur Cukiert ( 1 Engenharia Biomedica, Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Neurology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 3 Hospital Brigadeiro, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 4 Departamento de Farmacologia, Universidade Sao Camilo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important cause of death among epilepsy surgery patients. The aim of this study was to determine the mortality rate due to SUDEP in patients who had epilepsy surgery at the Hospital Brigadeiro Epilepsy Unit (S?o Paulo, Brazil). Methods: Nine hundred and fifty patients who underwent epilepsy surgery between January 1996 and January 2005 were included in the study. All subjects had been followed up until January 2005. Results: During the study period, two SUDEP episodes occurred. Both patients died during the early stage after surgical procedures. No SUDEP occurred among the remaining 948 patients who had epilepsy surgery even after long term follow-up. Patient I: This 32 years-old man had simple and complex partial seizures since the age of 8 (seizure's frequency, 1?2/week). MRI disclosed right mesial temporal sclerosis. He was submitted to an uneventful right cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy. By Day 9 after surgery, he was packing together with his mother to leave the Hospital and presented SUDEP. Necropsy showed no pathological substrate for SUDEP. Patient II: This 18 years old boy had postural frontal lobe seizures since the age of 2. MRI was normal. Ictal and interictal video-EEG showed secondary bilateral synchrony. He was submitted to bifronto-mesial subdural electrodes implantation. On the second post-operative day, he was having breakfast, waiting to be transferred to the Video-EEG Unit and presented SUDEP. Necropsy showed no pathological substrate for SUDEP. Conclusions: The unexplained cause of SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy still remains a challenge. Our results suggest that SUDEP's incidence might be lower in our populatiom than that noted in other studies, especially in those reporting on chronically refractory epileptic patients. (Supported by FAEP, FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES.) 1 Alberto Diaz, 1 Jose Hernandez, and 1 Bernardino Torres ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Hospital Edgardo Rebagliati Martins, Jesus Maria, Lima, Peru ) Rationale: Different etiologies in adult epileptic patients have been demonstrated between developing and undeveloping countries but this difference is not so clear among elderly patients. The purpose of the study is to show our experience in relation to etiologies and clinical characteristics in elderly epilepsy. Methods: We made a prospective clinical study of epileptic patients older than 60 years, all cases were inpatients in the Epilepsy Unit of the biggest Peruvian hospital between January 2002 to December 2004. Results: Among 248 epileptic patients, 58 cases were older than 60 years and none of them had antecedents of seizures. It was possible to find a focal etiology in all patients. Stroke was the most frequent cause in 31 patients, followed by tumour in 13 causes. Most patients had generalized seizures and neurological focal findings. We don't report status epilepticus cases. Conclusions: As in developing countries, we found that stroke is the most frequent etiology in Peruvian epileptic elderly patients, and generalized seizures are the most common seizure type. 1 Antonio Donaire, 1 Mar Carreño, 1 Rolando Agudo, 1 Nuria Bargalló, and 1 Carmen Tur ( 1 Neurology, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain ) Rationale: Seizure semiology plays an important role in the epilepsy classification proccess. Long-term video EEG evaluation (LTVE) is considered the ?gold-standard? to study seizure semiology. However, LTVE is not always available and seizure semiology has to be inferred from the clinical history. The aim of this study was to compare the seizure semiology reported by the patient in an outpatient tertiary epilepsy clinic with the semiology observed during LTVE to determine the degree of reliability of the symptoms and signs referred by the patients. Methods: We analyzed the seizure semiology reported in the outpatient clinic to an experienced epileptologist by all patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation between 1990?2004 and compared it with the seizure semiology observed during LTVE. Concordance rate was defined as percentage of patients who described a certain seizure semiology which was later confirmed during LTVE. Seizures were classified according to the semiological seizure classification. Recorded seizures were reviewed by two independent observers. Results: We reviewed the medical reports as well as the LTVE evaluation of 330 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation (166 men; mean age 36). Epilepsy was classified as frontal in 49 patients (15%), temporal in 205(62%), parieto-occipital in 23(7%) and just focal epilepsy in 53(16%). More patients reported auras before (224) than during LTVE (126). On the contrary, lateralizing signs were seen during LTVE (120) more frequently than reported in the outpatient clinic (77). When lateralizing signs were reported in the outpatient clinic and then observed during LTVE, their concordance rate was 75%(28/36). In frontal lobe epilepsy the seizure semiology agreement before and after LTVE was 41%. The best concordance (100%) was seen in bilateral asymmetric seizures, followed by dialeptic seizures (80%). In TLE the concordance in seizure semiology was 69%, being higher in automotor seizures (79%) and lowest in dialeptic seizures (37%), because up to 60% of automotor seizures were described as dialeptic seizures in the outpatient clinic. In parieto-occipital lobe epilepsy the concordance was 45%, being higher in simple motor seizures (tonic/clonic) (80%) followed by automotor seizures (40%). Considering only seizure types, the highest degree of concordance was seen in automotor seizures (80%), followed by dialeptic seizures (44.6%) focal motor (tonic and clonic) seizures (39%). Conclusions: Concordance in seizure semiology reported by the patients and later observed during LTVE seems to be high in TLE, followed by parieto-occipital and frontal lobe epilepsy. The seizure types that show a higher degree of concordance are automotor, focal motor, and dialeptic seizures. Epileptic auras are more frequently reported before than actually during LTVE; lateralizing signs are seen more often during LTVE, although when patients report them, they usually do it accurately. 1 John O. Elliott, and 1 Mercedes P. Jacobson ( 1 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Elevated serum homocysteine (s-Hcy) is recognized as an independent risk factor in premature coronary disease and cognitive impairment. A recent study by van Meurs, et. al. found the risk of fracture was double in those with elevated s-Hcy. Epidemiological studies have found the incidence of fracture in epilepsy to be twice that of the normal population. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have been shown to increase s-Hcy by lowering blood folate levels. The literature suggests a homocysteine-associated disturbance in collagen cross-linking is involved in bone loss. The goal of this study was to see if there is a relationship between metabolic bone loss in epilepsy and homocysteine. Methods: Standard practice in our clinic is to address bone health and nutrition with all patients. We screened 405 patient charts seen in our clinic over the past 2 years. Data on 120 patients included: age, gender, seizure type, years on AEDs, s-Hcy, serum folic acid (s-FA), supplementation patterns and DEXA screening results was compiled. Results: This was an adult epilepsy population: mean age: 44 years (SD = 14.1, range 17 to 81), there were 51 males and 69 females. Fifty were African American, 46 Caucasian, 20 Latino and 3 Asian/Other, average length of AED exposure: 26 years (SD = 14.8, range 2 to 64). DEXA results were found for 85 patients and homocysteine levels for 103 patients. Sixty-seven patients had complete records. Sixty-four subjects had abnormal DEXA results (osteopenia n = 35, osteoporosis n = 29). Normal DEXA results were found in 21 patients. There was a history of fracture in 22 subjects (18%). Mean homocysteine levels in micromol/L (SD) were 11.3 (7.6) for African Americans, 12.5 (8.3) Latinos, 9.4 (4.1) Caucasians and 6.8 (0.8) Asian/Other. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed. Bone loss status was not significantly correlated with s-Hcy (n = 67; Pearson's r = .11, p = .38). Surprisingly, length of years on AEDs was not correlated with an increased risk for bone loss (n = 85; Pearson's r = -.001, p = .99). As expected, body weight was inversely correlated with bone loss (n = 85; Pearson's r = -0.46, p = .000) and s-Hcy was inversely correlated with s-FA (n = 89; Pearson's r = -0.41, p = .000). Only four subjects had s-FA below the normal range of 5.4 ng/ml. Conclusions: This is the first study to look at s-Hcy and bone loss in epilepsy. Our data does not support a relationship, however; the use of a retrospective design may have prevented us from detecting an effect, since only 67 patients had completed both tests and half of the patients took multivitamins. In addition, this study included some older indivduals with diagnosis of epilepsy at mid-life. Our data supports previous studies, which found elevated s-Hcy in patients taking AEDs. Based on our data, elevated s-Hcy may also be related to ethnicity and/or related dietary habits. Six AEDs have known anti-folate mechanisms in pregnancy, cardiovascular protection and bone loss. Nutritional supplementation continues to be important in preventative epilepsy care. 1 Claudia Engbring, 1 Christoph Kellinghaus, 1 Stefan Evers, 1 Frank Bösebeck, 1 Gabriel Möddel, and 1 Ingo W. Husstedt ( 1 Neurology, University of Münster, Münster, Germany ) Rationale: Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is associated with infections of the central nervous system secondary to immunodeficiency as well as with neurological deficits due to direct effects of the neurotropic virus itself. Seizures and epilepsy are not rare among HIV-infected patients. However, systematic data about incidence and prevalence of seizures and epilepsy in HIV-positive patients are scarce. We intended to investigate the incidence and prevalence of acute seizures and epilepsy in neurological patients infected with HIV. Methods: The database of the Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Münster, was searched for patients with HIV-infection admitted to in-patient or out-patient treatment between 1992 and 2004. Their charts were reviewed regarding all available sociodemographic, clinical, neurophysiological, imaging and laboratory data. If possible, information about seizure therapy and outcome was gathered. Stage of infection according to the CDC-classification. Results: Of 831 HIV-infected patients admitted to our department, 51 (6,2%) had seizures and/or epilepsy. Eight of the 51 patients (16%) were diagnosed with epilepsy before the onset of the HIV-infection. Eleven patients (22%) only had single or few provoked seizures in the setting of acute cerebral disorders (8 patients), drug withdrawal or sleep withdrawal (2 patients), or of unknown cause (1 patient). Thirty-two patients (63%) developed epilepsy in the course of their HIV-infection. Of the 51 patients, 38 (75%) were already diagnosed with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (AIDS) at their first documented contact. Toxoplasmosis (7 patients), progressive multifocal leukodystrophy (7 patients) and other acute or subacute cerebral infections (5 patients) were the most frequent causes of seizures. EEG data of 38 patients were available. EEG showed generalized and diffuse slowing in 14 patients, regional slowing in 12 patients and epileptiform discharges in 1 patient. Only 9 of the patients had normal EEG. The majority of the patients (46 patients = 90%) were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-seven patients (53%) were on anticonvulsant therapy (gabapentin14 patients, carbamazepine 9 patients, valproat 2 patients, phenytoin 1 patient, lamotrigine 1 patient). Conclusions: Seizures are a relevant neurological symptom during the course of HIV-infection. Although in some patients seizures only occur in the setting of acute disease progress, the majority of patients with newly onset seizures eventually develop epilepsy and require anticonvulsant therapy. 1 David M. Ficker, 1,2 Bruce K. Schefft, 1 Jerzy P. Szaflarski, 1 Michael D. Privitera, 1 Jennifer Cavitt, and 1 Angela Morriss ( 1 Neurology, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: To compare the frequency of depression in refractory temporal, extratemporal and primary generalized epilepsies confirmed by video/EEG monitoring. There have been conflicting reports that seizure localization is associated with depression. Methods: Records from the epilepsy monitoring unit admissions from January 2003 through March 2005 were reviewed for seizure localization (temporal vs. extratemporal vs. primary generalized). Patients who had seizures recorded on video/EEG and a Beck Depression Inventory ? Second Edition (BDI-II) measured were included for analysis. Patients with poorly localized seizures were excluded. Seizure localization was determined by ictal EEG onset and neuroimaging. Patient data was reviewed at our epilepsy surgery conference to finalize seizure localization. Results: 119 patients met inclusion criteria (63 temporal, 35 extratemporal and 21 primary generalized). 79 of the 98 patients with partial onset seizures had unilateral seizure onset (37 right, 42 left). ANOVA showed no differences between the three groups. Mean BDI-II scores Temporal Extratemporal Primary Gen Mean BDI-II 11.89 14.03 16.86 Std dev ?1.14 ?1.56 ?2.97 Overall, 37% of patients had depression based on BDI-II scores (score greater than 15). No differences were found in the frequency of depression among the three groups (frequency of depression: temporal: 28.6%, extratemporal: 42.9%, primary generalized: 52.4%, p = NS, Chi square). However, between group analyses showed that patients with primary generalized epilepsy were more likely to be depressed than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. When the extratemporal and temporal groups were combined into a ?partial epilepsy? group, there were no differences in mean BDI-II score and frequency of depression when compared to the primary generalized group. No significant differences were found between left and right seizure onset and mean BDI-II scores or the frequency of depression. Conclusions: Patients with refractory generalized epilepsy had a greater frequency of depression than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. No differences in mean BDI-II score was seen between temporal, extratemporal and primary generalized epilepsy. The high frequency of depression in refractory primary generalized epilepsy may be clinically important and warrants further study. 1 Nathan B. Fountain, and 1 Miao Liu ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Population based epilepsy studies provide accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence but provide limited data about precise seizure (SZ) type and epilepsy syndrome characteristics because a detailed SZ history and diagnostic tests cannot be systematically obtained and detailed SZ frequencies are not known. We prospectively collected data on a finite epilepsy population to determine the characteristics defining each SZ type and epilepsy syndrome and correlated it with SZ frequencies, especially with regard to refractoriness. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data was acquired directly from patients and medical records, then refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy at least 5 years old. Frequency of each SZ type was collected at each visit. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed. Epilepsy syndromes containing less than 10 patients were not included in comparisons. SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time from June 2000 to November 2004. ?SZ-free? was defined as a total frequency of 0 for all types combined at the last clinic visit. Duration of SZ freedom was defined by interval since last visit at which any SZ were reported (SZ frequency > 0). Current SZ frequency was categorized as 0, 0 to <1, ≥1, and ≥30 SZ/mo. Results: A total of 1638 patients were analyzed. Overall, current SZ frequency was 0 in 51%, 0?1 in 14%, ≥1 in 35%, and ≥30 in 8%. SZ frequency was more likely to be 0 for patients with Only Generalized SZ (60%) compared to Only Partial SZ (47%) or Mixed SZ (40%) while Mixed SZ was more likely to be ≥30 SZ/mo (21%). Among the categories of SZ combinations, GTC Only was most likely to be SZ free (73%) and CPS+SPS+Secondary Generalized was least likely (33%). SZ frequency ≥30 was most common for Mixed SPS+Primary Generalized (57%) but this group only contained 7 patients. Among epilepsy syndromes, SZ freedom was most likely for Juvenile Absence (80%), Benign Rolandic (79%), and Idiopathic Localization-Related Not Further Classifiable (73%). Lennox-Gastaut (29%) was most likely to have ≥30 and Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (16%) is also likley but mostly due to myoclonic SZs. SZ frequency ≥1 was most likely for LGS (65%), frontal lobe epilepsy (50%), and MTLE (42%). MTLE patients were generally unlikely to be SZ free (44%) and also unlikely to have essentially daily SZs (5%). Conclusions: The overall rate of SZ freedom is surprisingly high. Refractoriness varies by epilepsy syndrome and SZ type but associates best with epilepsy syndrome. Patients with mixed SZ types are more likely to be refractory and have essentially daily SZs. MTLE was among the most frequently refractory, which is important because it represents the most common identifiable epilepsy syndrome. 1 Kristen M. Fowler, 1 Donald L. Schomer, 2 Cynthia L. Harden, 2 Blagovast Nikolov, 3 Michael Sperling, 3 Joyce Liporace, 3 Gwendolyn Taylor, 4 Page B. Pennell, 4 Melanee Newman, 5 Joseph M. Massaro, and 1 Andrew G. Herzog ( 1 Harvard Neuroendocrine Unit, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ; 2 Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY ; 3 Neurology, Thomas Jefferson Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA ; 4 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ; and 5 Harvard Clinical Research Institute, Boston, MA ) 1 [ Pairwise comparisons of seizures on different days of the cycle. Significant comparisons for both seizure frequency (A) and seizure occurrence (B) are indicated in the table using numbers to show the level of significance an shading to reflect the positivity (black boxes) or negativity (white boxes) of the comparison. Level of significance is indicated as follows: 1 = p < 10; 2 = p < 05; 3 = p < 01; 4 < 001; 5 = p < 0001. Axis numbers = days of cycle; day 1 = menstrual onset; day ?14 = day of evulation. ] Rationale: Seizures may vary during the menstrual cycle because hormones have neuroactive properties and hormone levels change during the course of the cycle. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how seizure frequency and occurrence varies across the menstrual cycle. Methods: The subjects were the first 100 women with clinical and EEG features of localization-related epilepsy, 13?45 years old, who participated in the baseline phase of a larger multicenter investigation of cyclic progesterone therapy for intractable seizures. Each subject participated in a 3-month baseline phase during which she recorded seizures and menses. Midluteal serum progesterone levels were measured with 5 ng/ml cutoff to indicate ovulation. The data consisted of 1) average seizure frequencies for each cycle day and 2) proportions of cycles with seizure occurrence on a given cycle day. Statistical comparisons of seizure frequency and occurrence were performed using generalized estimating equation one-way ANOVA and logistic regression followed by pairwise multiple comparisons of days based on the least square means. The results (pairwise p-values) were then plotted as tables for ease of visualization of resulting patterns. Results: Data were available for 292 cycles: 229 (78.4%) were ovulatory; 54 (18.4%) were anovulatory; no sample was collected for 9 cycles. The distribution of both seizure frequencies and occurrence on particular days was not uniform across the cycle (ANOVA p < .001). There was a 2-fold difference between highest (day 1) and lowest (day -8 and day 7) frequencies for both seizure frequency and occurrence. Pairwise daily comparisons are shown in Fig. 1. Two-way ANOVA did not show a significant interaction between ovulation status and seizure patterns. Comparison of seizure distributions in cycles with high vs low progesterone levels, however, showed significant differences for both seizure frequency (ANOVA p < .001) and occurrence (p < .05). Conclusions: The distribution of seizure frequencies and days with seizure occurrence varies significantly over the course of the menstrual cycle with the highest likelihood perimenstrually and the lowest during the midluteal and midfollicular phases.

D Giano ( 1 Epilepsy Program, Institute for Neurological Research - FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Epilepsy currently affects 1?1.5% of elderly being the third most frequently encountered neurologic problem in this population. Additionally, the incidence of new onset epilepsy is higher among the elderly than in any other age group. As in the general population, EEG and MRI are the cornerstones of diagnostic assessment; however, the finding of nonspecific changes associated with aging that do not necessarily indicate an underlying predisposition for epilepsy makes results difficult to interpret. The purpose of the current study is to give an overview of epidemiologic data in the elderly, focusing on etiology and seizure semiology. Methods: Retrospective database and medical records analysis of adult patients with epilepsy admitted to our Epilepsy Program from January 2004 to May 2005. Results: 19 out of 292 (6.5%) patients, 11 women and 8 men, admitted to our program were older than 65 with a diagnosis of new-onset epilepsy. The mean age of seizure onset was 73 years old (range: 65?86). The seizure semiology included: generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in 7 (37%), with a 57% occurring only over sleep; complex partial seizures (CPS) in 3; simple partial seizures (SPS) in 2; SPS evolving to CPS in 2 and complex partial seizures with secondary generalization (CPS-GTC) in 4. Four patients with CPS were not corretly diagnosed until they had the first GTCS. EEG were performed in 16 of 19, only 5 (31%) showed epileptiform abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis. MRIs were obtained in 18 out of 19, five of them were diagnostic. The etiology of the epilepsy included: ischemic stroke in 2; lobar hemorrhage in 1; primary brain tumors in 2.; Alzheimer disease in 1; remaining unknown in 12 (63%). Conclusions: The most common seizure type seen in our series was GTCS without a clear-cut partial onset. Epilepsy was mainly cryptogenic followed by vascular or neoplastic etiology. Distinguishing epilepsy from paroxysmal nonepileptic events can be difficult as the ictal semiology may be misinterpreted as symptoms of other typical diseases in old people (syncope, transient global amnesia).Further studies in this area are still needed to establish optimal diagnostic strategies. 1 Mandeep Garewal, 1 Salvador Cruz, 1 Jayant N. Acharya, and 1 R. Edward Hogan ( 1 Department of Neurology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Epilepsy partialis continua (EPC) is rarely related to paraneoplastic syndromes. We present a case of EPC, refractory to multiple AEDs, which responded to treatment with methylprednisolone. Methods: We reviewed the findings of a 63 year old woman who presented with EPC. Results: A 63 year old woman presented with EPC of the left hemi-face and arm of 3 weeks duration. Extensive workup including CSF results, cytology, herpes PCR, encephalitis panel, Lyme antibodies (abs), HIV abs and ELISA testing, was negative. Paraneoplastic panel was positive for anti-striatal abs. AEDs (valproic acid, phenytoin, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and chlorazepate) given in maximally-tolerated doses did not result in improvement of EPC. Propofol reduced the severity but did not abolish the EPC. Four weeks after onset of EPC, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone 250 mg IV q 6 hours. Neuroimaging was obtained 2 weeks before the onset of EPC and at weeks 3, 4, 5 after onset of EPC. The day following methylprednisolone treatment, the seizure frequency and duration had remarkably diminished. Three days later, EPC had subsided. Methyl-prednisolone was administered for a total of 5 days, followed by a course of oral prednisone. Phenytoin, chlorazepate and valproate were weaned off. The patient was discharged on carbamazepine, levetiracetam and oral prednisone. Prednisone was tapered over the following two months. One year after presentation, she had no recurrence of symptoms. Five weeks after onset of EPC, a biopsy of a lung nodule showed small cell carcinoma, which prompted treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. Neuroimaging findings: MR brain 2 weeks prior to EPC (obtained for clinical indication of encephalopathy) was normal. At 3 weeks after onset of EPC, FLAIR showed hyperintensity in the left frontal, temporal, and insular regions. At week 4 after EPC onset, an additional hyperintensity was noted in the right frontal region, which resolved on repeat MR obtained 5 weeks after EPC onset. There was no contrast enhancement at any time. The figure shows FLAIR images before and after steroid treatment of EPC. Conclusions: EPC is commonly refractory to conventional AEDs, but may respond to treatment with corticosteroids. Our case illustrates that corticosteroids can be efficacious in treating paraneoplastic-related EPC. Continued resolution of EPC after taper of corticosteroids was likely related to treatment of the underlying neoplasm. This case illustrates the importance of workup for associated neoplasm in patients with EPC. 1 Nicole C. Hank, 1 Steve S. Chung, and 1 David M. Treiman ( 1 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: In the past decade many new medications have become available for various neurological disorders including epilepsy. Clinical Trials, an essential component of drug development, helps to establish efficacy and safety. Thus, clinical research has grown significantly in parallel to new medication development in the health field. It is critically important for investigators to identify and recruit potential candidates for clinical trials in order to efficiently complete studies and to evaluate drug efficacy and safety in a timely fashion. In order to improve and understand effective recruitment strategy, we surveyed current clinical study participants at our epilepsy center. Methods: Thirty-three Epilepsy patients who all are currently participating in one out of 5 (phase II, III or IV clinical multi-centered) epilepsy studies at BNI were asked questions pertaining to reasons for participation and continuation of study as well as primary concerns for participation when they were asked to participate in the clinical study. Patients were asked to rate their answers on a 0?10 scale with 10 being the strongest influence and 0 the least influence. Questionnaires were administered to patients during their clinic visits or via email and were analyzed. Results: Twenty-nine out of 33 patients (88%) answered investigator rapport (physician and coordinator) to be the number one reason why they chose to participate in a study (X = 9.7). Three patients answered that the most important influential rationale was financial reasons (reimbursement or no insurance), and the remaining one patient stated no other medical options were available. When patients were asked what biggest concerns they had prior to consent, nearly all patients (94%) expressed the fear for unknown potential side effects. Even though seizure improvement was reported by 40% of the participants, only 1% (3 out of 33) stated efficacy was their number one reason for continuing in a study, while 91% (30 out of 33) chose to continue participation based on investigators' care. Conclusions: This study shows that establishing a good patient/doctor rapport is the most important factor to successfully recruit patients for clinical trials. Regardless of the type of clinical trials, good medical care from investigators was the most important determinant factor in those who complete trials. 1,2 Sheryl R. Haut, 3 Aaron LeValley, 3 Charles B. Hall, and 2,3 Richard B. Lipton ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center, Montefiore Med.Ctr/Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 2 Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Stress is an often reported, but rarely studied trigger factor for seizures. Using diary data, we explored the population and within person effects of stress on the occurrence of seizures. Methods: Subjects 18 yrs or older with localization related epilepsy were recruited from the Epilepsy Management Center and the neurology clinics at Montefiore Medical Center. Eligible subjects had at least 1 seizure within the prior 12 months and the ability to self-maintain a daily diary. Diary data included dates and times of all seizures, and daily stress, measured on a 10 point ordinal scale (1 being least, 10 being highest stress). We modeled the association of stress on a given day as a predictor of seizures over the subsequent 24 hrs using mixed-effects logistic models for the entire population, and logistic regression models for individuals. Results: Sixty four subjects maintained seizure diaries with daily stress levels for >1 month and up to one year (median: 246 diary days) for a total 15,806 person days of diary data. Increases in recorded stress levels were associated with increased risk of seizures in the subsequent 24 hour epoch (p > 0.000); A three unit increase in stress was associated with a 32% increase in the relative odds of seizure (OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.22?1.40). These findings were independent of hours of sleep. Within-person significance for stress and seizure risk was demonstrated for 25% of subjects at 0.10 level, and 20% of subjects at 0.05 level. Conclusions: Elevations in daily stress measurements were significantly associated with increased risk of seizure in the subsequent 24 hours, independent of hours of sleep. This association was significant for at least 20% of individual subjects. This subgroup may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stress. Further studies will explore the mechanisms of this stress effect, and examine potential behavioral interventions to uncouple stress from seizure risk. (Supported by K23NS02192 (P.I.

Therefore, we assessed self-perception of awareness of complex partial seizure (AOCPS) through a thorough interview. Methods: Patients with CPSs during sleep only, overt mental retardation, or the total number of CPSs ≤3 were excluded because we considered that they could not give reliable information for AOCPS. We included consecutive 134 patients at our epilepsy clinic, whose CPSs had been observed and given sufficient information for awareness of CPSs by patients and their family members, and investigated the proportion and characteristics of patients without AOCPS compared with those with AOCPS and the change of unawareness of their CPSs during the follow-up. Results: Thirty-one patients (23%) did not have AOCPS completely (n = 23) or incompletely (n = 8). Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were more frequently detected in patients without AOCPS (94%; complete, 96%) than those with AOCPS (55%), mainly in the temporal region. Bilateral independent IEDs were found in 48% of patients without AOCPS (complete: 52%) compared with 13% of those with AOCPS (p < 0.001). The lateralization of epileptic foci based on ictal semiology, IEDs and structural lesions on MRI was not different between patients without AOCPS and with AOCPS. Eighty-four percent of patients without AOCPS were classified as having temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) compared with 70% of those with AOCPS (p = 0.093). TLE patients without AOCPS were less likely to have structural lesions involving mesial temporal region and more likely to have normal finding on MRI compared with those with AOCPS. Six of 23 patients with complete unawareness of their seizures had experienced AOCPS even with de novo aura in three patients during the follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a significant number of epilepsy patients are not aware of their CPSs. Unawareness of CPSs may occur especially in TLE patients with bilateral independent IEDs and without structural lesions involving mesial temporal region. 1 Nikolas Hitiris, 1 Rajiv Mohanraj, and 1 Martin J. Brodie ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Division of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Clinical and biological differences between responders and non-responders to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may help to explain the basis for refractory epilepsy. Methods: A total of 890 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy attended the epilepsy clinic of the Western Infirmary, Glasgow between July 1982 and May 2001. Follow up data were available for 780 (88%). All were initially treated with monotherapy and treatment was altered depending on response and tolerability. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who went into remission following the first AED dose (immediate responders) with those who remained pharmacoresistant de novo (non-responders). The non-responders never gained control of their seizures for any 12-month period from onset. Results: We identified 245 (31%) immediate responders and 276 (35%) non-responders (see table). Non-responders were more likely to have clusters of seizures [OR 9.17 (95% CI 1.17?72.18), p = 0.035], a family history of epilepsy [OR 1.85 (95% CI 1.1?3.11), p = 0.02], traumatic head injury [OR 3.12 (95% CI 1.72?5.64), p < 0.001] and psychiatric co-morbidity [OR 2.02 (95% CI 1.24?3.28), p = 0.004]. Factors that did not achieve statistical significance between the groups were birth injury, febrile seizures, previous status epilepticus, neurological deficit and learning difficulties. Conclusions: In this longitudinal study, 31% of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy remained seizure-free following the first dose of their first AED whereas a further 35% appeared to be refractory de novo. Clinical factors that identify early refractory epilepsy could lead to improved pharmacotherapy or prompt surgery. Comparing responders with non-responders to AEDs may provide insights into the pathophysiology of refractory epilepsy.

Hussain, 1,2,3 Richard B. Lipton, 1 Sheryl R. Haut, 1,2,3 Carol A. Derby, and 1,4 Shlomo Shinnar ( 1 Neurology, Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 2 Einstein Aging Study, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 3 Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; and 4 Pediatrics, Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Compared to young adulthood, the incidence of epilepsy is thought to increase substantially after age 60, and may be further elevated among males and African-Americans. The reason for this rise is uncertain. Although elevated risk may be due in part to stroke, dementia, and other risk factors common in older adults, it has been postulated that aging itself may be associated with increased risk of epilepsy. We therefore sought to determine the incidence of epilepsy in a relatively healthy, racially-diverse, elderly cohort. Methods: 1919 community-dwelling subjects (age 70+) followed in a prospective longitudinal aging study were screened for seizures. For all subjects who screened positive and a sample of subjects who screened negative (n = 100), we determined which subjects had epilepsy with onset after age 45 by means of standardized telephone interviews and review of aging study records. For screen-positive subjects, we sought hospital medical records to verify self-reported age of onset. Age-specific and cumulative incidence of epilepsy were estimated using reconstructed cohort methods and the Kaplan-Meier procedure. We assessed sex and race as risk factors using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: 45 subjects screened positive for seizures, and 1874 screened negative. Of the 45 screen-positive subjects, 21 had epilepsy with onset after age 45, 21 had likely seizures or epilepsy with onset before age 45, 2 experienced single provoked seizures, and 1 subject had possible epilepsy. None of the 100 screen-negative subjects interviewed had epilepsy. Age-specific incidence of epilepsy was generally low but increased with age. Incidence (per 100,000 person-years with 95%CI) was 10.6 [2.2, 30.9] between 45?59 years, 25.8 [10.4, 38.1] between 60?74 years, and 101.1 [41.4, 160.8] between 75?89 years. No difference was observed between males and females, but African-American race was associated with greater cumulative incidence of epilepsy (p = 0.048) and was a significant risk factor in the regression model (hazard ratio with 95%CI: 2.63 [1.07, 6.37]). Conclusions: The incidence of epilepsy was low in this relatively healthy elderly cohort. This study was unique in that we evaluated race as a covariate and observed elevated risk among African-Americans. Future analyses are planned to estimate the incidence among elderly individuals who do not have competing risk factors for epilepsy such as stroke and dementia, and to determine whether our race-specific findings are modified or confounded by cardiovascular risk factors.

Although very often used in motor control research, its clinical application is scarce. The goal of this study is to present two cases of paroxysmal events in which the BP has been diagnostic in standard video-EEG studies. Methods: Two patients presented with sudden jerking of the limbs. A 42-year-old woman had daily abnormal movements of the legs for more than 10 years. They appeared periodically at rest in wakefulness. The second patient is a 55-year-old man with daily sudden jerking of the arms, also in wakefulness, in the last year. The physical exam was normal in both cases. A digital 24-hours video-EEG recording was performed to find at least 100 limb movements. The movement-related potentials were calculated using back-averaging of the EEG activity in relation of jerk onset. Results: In the interictal recordings and during the episodes no epileptiform activity was noted. In the first patient, a BP was found when the patient imitated the movements, but not when studying the actual movements. In the second patient, a clear BP was found when studying the jerking movements. In the first case, the diagnosis of periodic limb movements was established. In the second patient, the voluntary nature of the movement was demonstrated. Conclusions: Back-averaging of movement-related activity is a feasible technique for the diagnosis of paroxysmal events. In the differential diagnosis between seizures, movement disorders and other non-epileptic events, the movement- related potentials can be used as a diagnostic tool if the events are frequent enough. 1 Gaby S. Pell, 1 Regula S. Briellmann, 1 Patrick C.H. Chan, 1 David F. Abbott, and 1 Graeme D. Jackson ( 1 Brain Research Institute, Austin Health, Heidelberg West, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) on MR imaging is associated with reduced hippocampal volume and increased T2-relaxation time. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides additional information on tissue microstructure. We perform a voxel-based (VB) analysis of DTI in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with unilateral HS. The common framework will allow comparison with VB morphometry (VBM) and VB T2-relaxometry (VBR). Methods: We assessed 15 healthy controls and 12 left HS patients at a 3T GE scanner. DTI was performed with 28 directions (b = 1100 s/mm3). An eight-echo CPMG sequence was used for T2-relaxometry, and a 3D SPGR sequence for morphometry. Data were analysed using FSL and SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). For DTI, we assessed fractional anisiotropy and diffusivity. For VBM, we used an optimised protocol (1) and assessed both the gray and white matter segment. VBR was performed as described in our earlier manuscript (2). Threshold for all analyses was p < 0.001. Voxels were counted in ipsilateral peri-hippocampal and temporal lobe regions. Results: DTI changes in left HS were more pronounced than VBM or VBR abnormalities. The table shows the number of activated voxels with each technique. Reduced anisotropy was found in the left uncinate fasciculus, anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and corpus callosum. Increased diffusivity was found in the ATL and parahippocampal white matter. Gray matter volume loss was detected in the hippocampus proper, white matter volume loss in the ATL. VBR showed a T2 increase in the lateral and ATL white matter. Conclusions: The most prominent abnormality in the hippocampus proper was a volume deficit. Additionally, there were extensive temporal lobe white matter abnormalities. The DTI changes close to the hippocampus may be secondary, and associated with memory deficits and seizure circuits. The DTI, VBM and VBR abnormalities in ATL may be primary, and associated with temporal lobe development (3). REFERENCES Good CD, et al. NeuroImage 2001;14: 21?36 Pell GS, et al.

Elliott ( 1 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Elevated serum homocysteine (s-Hcy) is recognized as an independent risk factor in premature coronary disease. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have found ischemic heart disease is increased by 20% and fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) is three times higher in patients with epilepsy. The incidence of cerebrovascular accident in epilepsy populations is estimated to be two to six times that of the normal population. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have been shown to increase s-Hcy by lowering blood folate levels. The goal of this study was to examine homocysteine and other cardiovascular risk factors in epilepsy. Methods: We screened 405 clinic charts over the past 2 years to identify 120 subjects with CVD assessment including: age, gender, seizure type, years on AEDs, s-Hcy, serum folic acid (s-FA), lipids, glucose, blood pressure, weight, smoking and alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and vitamin use patterns. Results: This was an adult epilepsy population: mean age (SD) was 44 years (14), range 17 to 81, there were 51 males and 69 females. Fifty were African American, 46 Caucasian, 20 Latino and 3 Asian/Other, average length of AED exposure was 26 years (SD = 14.8, range 2 to 64). Average homocysteine levels in micromol/L (SD) were 11.3 (7.6) for African Americans, 12.5 (8.3) for Latinos, 9.4 (4.1) for Caucasians and 6.8 (0.8) for Asian/Other. Homocysteine was inversely correlated with s-FA (n = 89; Pearson's r = -0.41, p = .000). Fifteen percent of subjects had s-Hcy levels > 15 micromol/L a concentration that is associated with a three-fold increase in myocardial infarction and a two-fold increased risk in carotid stenosis. Mean body weight was 174 lbs. (SD = 43.21). All four ethnicities had average BMI considered overweight based on National Institutes of Health guidelines. BMI was positively correlated with total cholesterol (n = 79; Pearson's r = 0.347, p = .002) and with LDL cholesterol (n = 74; Pearson's r = 0.321, p = .005). Mean total cholesterol (SD) was 197 mg/dl (39) and mean HDL (SD) 61 mg/dl (21) were within optimal ATP III guidelines. Mean LDL cholesterol (SD) was 113 mg/dl (34) which is considered above optimal. Eleven patients took statins. Mean blood pressure (SD) was 129/79 mmHg (18/11) which is in the pre-hypertensive range according to the revised JNC 7 guidelines. Twenty five patients received medication for hypertension. Conclusions: Phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid and lamotrigine are known folate antagonists. Homocysteine levels > 7 micromol/L increase the risk for CVD in a linear dose-response relationship with no specific threshold level. Elevated s-Hcy has responded favorably to vitamin supplementation in several epilepsy studies. However, s-Hcy remains elevated despite use of vitamins in half of the subjects. Other factors such as lipids, blood pressure and obesity require more intensive intervention. Preventative care in epilepsy clinic should consist of appropriate CVD screening with culturally sensitive health promotion. 1 Behrouz Jafari, 1 Daniel I. Rifkin, 1 Sandra A. Block, and 1 Mona Sazgar ( 1 Neurology, State University of New York at Buffalo/The Jacobs Neurological Institute, Buffalo, NY ) Rationale: Previous reports have documented coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and epilepsy, as well as the effect of treating sleep apnea on seizure frequency and excessive daytime sleepiness. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of sleep related symptoms in a population with medically refractory epilepsy. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review study on an outpatient population who were seen at a tertiary epilepsy center within the Kaleida Health System at Buffalo, NY. From all the patients who were seen for seizure disorder, those with medically intractable epilepsy were selected. All of the patients had completed the same questionnaire about measures of sleep-related breathing problems, sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and hypertension. Other data including seizure frequency, seizure duration and type and number of anti-epileptic drugs were also extracted from the patient charts and entered into a database. Results: Of 84 adult patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy, 28 qualified for medically intractable epilepsy by the study criteria. Fifteen subjects (53%) reported symptoms of sleep disturbance including 14 (50%) with excessive daytime sleepiness, and 11 (40%) with snoring. Five patients (18%) had sleep disorders confirmed by polysomnography. Eight subjects (28%) had hypertension. Subjects with sleep disturbance were more likely to be younger and female. Although there was no statistical difference between the two groups with regards to the type and number of antiepileptic drugs and seizure localization (temporal versus extra-temporal), the subjects with sleep disturbance tended to have a higher seizure frequency per month, and were more likely to have their first seizures at a younger age (Student T-test p < 0.05). Conclusions: The high concordance between sleep disturbance and seizure intractability suggests that sleep disorders may play an important role in seizure exacerbation. The presence of features of sleep disturbance in patients with medically intractable epilepsy should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying sleep disorder contributing to the therapeutic resistance. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which sleep disturbance contributes to seizure intractability. 1 Venkata V. Jakkampudi, 1 William S. Corrie, and 1 Robert J. DeLorenzo ( 1 Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Authors debate about the duration of a seizure before acute treatment is appropriate. We wished to provide data on the duration of seizures observed in the epilepsy monitoring unit when the seizures subsided without acute therapy. This data will assist this debate. Methods: We logged the five longest epileptic seizures of each patient who was eighteen years or older and was in our epilepsy monitoring unit between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2004. Most patients were in acute anticonvulsant withdrawal, but not those with a history of status epilepticus. We excluded patients with invasive electrodes and patients who were studied to determine if seizures continued. Seizure onset and end were determined by a single epileptologist (W.S.C.) who is experienced in intensive seizure monitoring evaluations. He chose seizure start as the initial EEG change or clinical change. Usually, the end of the seizure was chosen on EEG criteria. Results: We observed seizures in 191 patients during this time. Most seizures (487) were of less than two minutes duration, 78 were 2?3 minutes, 21 were 3?4 minutes, 14 were 4?5 minutes, 9 were 5?6 minutes and 7 were more than 6 minutes long. Our longest seizure was 13 minutes in duration and was a partial simple seizure with only subjective symptoms. No primary generalized seizures were more than 3 minutes long. When seizures secondarily generalized, the generalized portion of the seizure was no more than 3 minutes long. However, the seizure could have a significant partial portion both before and after the generalized segment. None of our patients received medication to terminate a seizure, although several received medications shortly after a seizure when we judged that we had recorded enough events to answer the question posed for the admission. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that most seizures last less than two minutes. However, some seizures can be quite lengthy, yet still be both self-limited and associated with mild symptoms. We did not observe ?lengthy? primarily or secondarily generalized seizures in this cohort. This data supports the advice to physicians to observe a partial seizure before giving an acute anticonvulsant medication. 1 Lara E. Jeha, 1 Imad M. Najm, 2 Bill Bingaman, and 1 Hans O. Luders ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Seizures persist in 30?54% of patients after anterior temporal lobectomy performed for the treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Predictors and mechanisms of early versus late postoperative seizure outcome remain unclear. Methods: We reviewed the records of 371 adult patients operated on between 1990 and 2001 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The primary outcome variable was any seizure recurrence. Multiphase hazard model analysis was used to construct a time-to-event curve. Plots of the predicted probability of any seizure recurrence by significant risk factors were produced. Multivariate logistic regression was used in additional analyses to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 5.5 years. Seizures recurred in 140 patients (38%). The rate of seizure freedom was 78% (95% CI = 75?81%) at 1 year, and 53% (95%CI = 47?58%) at 10 years. Seizure freedom at two years was lowered by frequent preoperative seizures (67% versus 79%, [p-value = 0.015], generalized-tonic-clonic seizures (74% versus 86%, [p-value = 0.029]), bilateral MRI abnormalities (58% versus 78%, [p-value = 0.004]), the use of invasive EEG monitoring (66% versus 77%, [p-value = 0.005]), and epileptiform discharges on EEG 6 months postoperatively (54% versus 78%, [p-value = 0.001]). Late seizure freedom (at 8 years) was lower when surgical pathology was restricted to gliosis (44% versus 64%, [p-value = 0.009]), and higher when intraoperative electrocorticography was used [p-value = 0.021]. Epileptiform EEG at 6 postoperative months predicted breakthrough seizures upon discontinuation of anticonvulsants [O.R = 4.29(95%CI = 1.21?15.13)]. Conclusions: Factors identified by 6 postoperative months predict early and late seizure recurrence after temporal lobectomy. The presence of different predictors of early versus late recurrent seizures suggests different mechanisms of recurrent disease at various postoperative intervals. 1 Sigmund Jenssen ( 1 Neurology, Drexel Medical College, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The elderly in United States are representing a greater percentage of the general population than before. This age group has increased risk of developing epilepsy as compared to those who are younger. Previous reports indicate that in this age group the clinical presentation of new onset epilepsy is frequently varied and obvious epileptic seizures are sometimes not reported. Epileptiform activity in the EEG (EA) is highly specific for epilepsy when acute symptomatic conditions and PLEDS are excluded. Methods: We reviewed chief complaint (CC) and EEG findings in patients mimimum 65 years old with EA referred to the neurophysiology laboratory at Hahnemann University Hospital between October 2004 and April 2005 for possible new onset seizures. Patients with known additional acute CNS event, PLEDS, recent medication change, severe metabolic derangement or prior history of epilepsy were excluded. Results: 20 patients were found to have EA. Mean age was 79.5 (range 69 to 92), 12 were women. Some patients had two CC. Most common CC was confusion (13), then came fall (4), witnessed seizure (3), syncope (2), focal weakness (1), aphasia (1) and hallucinations (1). Of risk factors there was dementia (5), stroke (4) and meningioma (1) while ten with no risk factors. EEG showed diffuse slowing (5), normal back ground (15), electrographic seizures (2). EA was localized in one temporal lobe (10), both temporal lobes (8), parietal (1), or frontal (1). Most common medical condition was arteral hypertension (10). Conclusions: Chief complaint in new onset epilepsy among the elderly is varied, confusion being the most common and witnessed seizures less common. Although stroke and dementia are risk factors, many have no risk factors. Electrographic seizures are seen occasionally, even without reported witnesses seizures. We attempt to confirm these findings in a larger number of patients. 1 Barbara C. Jobst, 1 David Coffey, and 1 Peter D. Williamson ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Propofol is increasingly more popular for the treatment of status epilepticus due to the short half-life and ease of use. In children a rare but serious complication with acidosis and rhabdomyolysis has been reported. Propofol infusion syndrome in children includes cardiac and renal failure, rhabdomyolysis and severe metabolic acidosis. In children prolonged use (>48 hours) and doses above 5 mg/kg/hr have been associated with propofol infusion syndrome. Methods: We report an adult case of status epilepticus treated with propofol. The patient died of propofol infusion syndrome as a consequence. Results: A 36 years old women with intractable, localization related epilepsy was admitted due to non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient was chronically treated with topiramate. Two weeks prior she had delivered a healthy girl after a complicated pregnancy. The patient required intubation after administration of benzodiazepines. Propofol was administered for intubation. While on propofol the patient continued to have motor activity and epileptiform EEG changes. Propofol was increased but the patient was never treated with higher doses than 5mg/kg/hr. With the addition of phenobarbital and valproic acid, status epilepticus was eventually controlled. The patient remained in a burst suppression pattern on EEG. Propofol was reduced to sedative doses, but 48 hours after admission the patient developed severe rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy. Despite several attempts of cardioversion the patient died of bradyarrhythmia on the fourth day after admission. Conclusions: Propofol infusion syndrome with rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, lactic acidosis and bradyarrhythmias does not only occur in children but also occurs in adults. It can be a deadly complication of the treatment of status epilepticus. Caution should be used if prolonged propofol infusion is required for status epilepticus. Patients should be monitored for signs of myolysis and acidosis. 1 Susan D. Kelley, 2 Selim R. Benbadis, and 3 Dalia Adams ( 1 Rehabilitation  2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ; and 3 Rehabilitation, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: Little is known about types of mental health treatment that is most effective for pseudoseizure patients who have high rates of psychiatric illness, specifically PTSD, depression, and dissociation (Bowman, 2001). Numerous controlled studies and case reports have provided evidence for the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in the treatment of PTSD, a variety of anxiety disorders, dissociative symptoms, and somatoform disorders. To date, however, there have been no reported studies on using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing with trauma-based psychogenic seizures. Methods: This pilot study integrates Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing into the psychological treeatment of pseudoseizure patients referred after video EEG monitoring confirmed the presence of psychogenic seizures and diagnostic interviews found virtually ubiquitous trauma experiences. Data were analyzed for patients referred from a hospital based clinic serving Floridians and persons from the southeastern U.S. over a 2 year period. Results: The study protocol comprised 2 to 3 initial sessions for diagnosis and rapport building followed by weekly Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing treatment ranging from 3 to 15 sessions. In the majority of patients, psychogenic seizures were either extinguished completely or decreased significantly in severity and frequency. Followup data reveals no return to seizure status for those patients successfully treated with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. Conclusions: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing appears to be a viable intervention in the psychological treatment of psychogenic seizure patients. Further controlled studies will be needed. 1 Sejin Lee, 2 Daewon Seo, 3 Hyungkook Park, and 4 Sangdoe Yi ( 1 Neurology, Yeungnam Medical Center, Daugu, Korea ; 2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ; 3 Neurology, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Chunan, Korea ; and 4 Neurology, Keimyung University Hospital, Daegu, Korea ) Rationale: To describe the clinical and MR characteristics of patients with familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy(MTLE). Methods: The MTLE was identified by clinical and EEG findings in 3 epilepsy clinics. Familial MTLE was defined when two or more family members presented with the diagnosis of MTLE. Results: Eight patients were diagnosis of familial MTLE in four unrelated families. Three of 8 individuals had typical aura of MTLE. Seizure types were complex partial with or without secondary GTCs in 6 of 8 patients. History of earlier febrile convulsion was positive in 2 patients. MRI showed hippocampal sclerosis in 3 of 7 patients(43%). Benign MTLE was seen in 6 of 8 patients(75%). Two patients with refractory MTLE had hippocampal sclerosis and received temporal lobectomy, and one patient became seizure free. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis have seizure onset early in life and have history of febrile convulsion, and seizures are often not well controlled. Conclusions: Familial MTLE is rather a clinically heterogeneous syndrome, in terms of MRI finding, seizure type and seizure outcomes in contrast to the original report of Berkovic. This may be partly due to absence of detailed diagnostic criteria of familial MTLE. So some of our patients may be just causal occurrence of MTLE in two family members. 1 Sang Kun Lee, 1 Jung Joo Lee, 1 Seo Young Lee, 2 Chun-Kee Chung, and 3 Dong Soo Lee ( 1 Neurology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ; 2 Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ; and 3 Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: In order to assess the role of various diagnostic modalities, to identify surgical prognostic factors and concordances with presurgical evaluations, and to characterize the clinical features of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Methods: We studied 71 FLE patients who underwent epilepsy surgery and were followed up more than two years. Diagnoses were established by standard presurgical evaluation. Results: Thirty-eight of the 71 became seizure-free after surgery, and another 25 patients a favorable outcome. Clinical manifestations could be categorized into six types; initial focal motor (nine patients), initial versive seizure (15), frontal lobe complex partial seizure (14), complex partial seizure mimicking temporal lobe epilepsy (18), initial tonic elevation of arms (11), and sudden 2GTCS (4). The diagnostic accuracies of interictal EEG, ictal EEG, MRI, PET, and ictal SPECT were 28.9%, 60.5%, 47.4%, 36.4%, and 33.3% in the seizure free patients respectively. These were 21.2%, 57.6%, 24.2%, 28.6%, and 22.7% in non-seizure-free patients respectively. No significant relationship was found between the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities and surgical outcome except MRI (p = 0.038). The concordance of two or more modalities was significantly observed in seizure free patients (P = 0.027). Among other clinical characteristics (age at surgery, seizure frequency, sex, presence of 2GTCS, presence of possible causes, and side of surgery), only the side of surgery was a significant prognostic factors (The left side had poorer outcome.). No definite relationship was found between the location of intracranial ictal onset zone and clinical semiology. Conclusions: Though various diagnostic methods can be useful to diagnose FLE, only MRI can predict the surgical outcome. Concordance between presurgical evaluation modalities indicates a better surgical outcome. 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 1 Roger Walz, 1 Americo C. Sakamoto, 1 Paulo Zanello, 1 Vinicius H.

Assirati Jr., 3 Carlos G. Carlotti Jr., and 1 Joao P. Leite ( 1 Neurology, CIREP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Radiology, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 3 Surgery, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a major cause of seizures in many less developed countries. Although less common, NCC is becoming a significant health concern in developed countries as well, mostly due to migration of infected persons. The main causes of intractable epilepsy (IE) are mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), brain tumors (BT), and malformations of cortical development (MCD). Although studies in endemic regions have indicated that NCC is the leading cause of symptomatic epilepsy, there is no study investigating the relationship between calcified cysticercotic lesions (CCL) and intractable epilepsy (IE) in general. Here we carry out a cross-sectional study investigating the etiological profile of IE in our country, an endemic region for NCC, with attention to the presence of CCL. Methods: From 2002 to 2003, 512 consecutive patients (273 women) evaluated at Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine Hospital, aged >18 years, were included in the survey. Intractability was defined as: 1) one or more seizures every 3 months during the last year of follow-up review or until successful seizure surgery, and 2) failure of two or more first-line AEDs at maximum tolerated doses. Neuroimaging included brain CT scans with contrasted and noncontrasted phases, high-resolution MRI with special protocols to epilepsy for all patients. Results: Five hundreds and twelve patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age at enrollment was 38.66 ± 10.6 years. The mean age at epilepsy onset was 11.9 ± 7.4 years (range 1?36 years). The epilepsy duration was 21 years ± 11.3 years (range 3?48 years). The mean seizure frequency was 4.3 ± seizures per month. The most frequent epileptogenic lesion was MTS (52,6%), followed by MCD (13.8%), and BT (10.5%). cNCL were found in 38% of cases, but, in most cases, associated with another epileptogenic lesion. Isolated CCL were found in only 1,8% of cases. In addition, we found a very higher prevalence of CCL in MTS cases (36,7%), in comparison with extratemporal epilepsy (16,8%) (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: We found evidence that the etiological profile of medically IE is very similar to those from developed countries, and that neurocysticercosis, even in an endemic region as Brazil, is a rare cause of IE. We found that CCL were twice more frequent in patients with MTS than in those with extratemporal epilepsy, suggesting either a potential role of NCC in the development of MTS or that CCL and MTS covariate with another variable, such as socioeconomic status.

Yacubian ( 1 Neurology, UNIFESP/EPM, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: We aim to investigate the chemical integrity of the thalami in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) with different times of disease using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Methods: We performed multi-voxel 1H-MRS with TE of 30 ms (PRESS sequence) at 1.5 Tesla scanner over the thalami of 14 patients with 1?10 years of clinical history of JME and 16 patients with more than 10 years of disease (mean age = 21.3 vs. 31.5 and mean time of disease = 6.4 vs. 21.8, respectively). All patients had a typical history of JME, typical EEG findings and normal high-resolution magnetic resonance neuroimaging. We determined ratios for peak values of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, glutamine-glutamate and inositol over creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr). Results: Thalamic NAA/Cr ratios were decreased in JME patients with longer time of disease (right side = 1.4722 ± 0.2724; left side = 1.4817 ± 0.2206) compared to patients with less than 10 years of disease (right side = 1.8484 ± 0.2249; left side = 1.6903 ± 0.2539) with p values of 0.0004 and 0.0254, respectively. We did not find significantly differences of the other metabolites between both groups. Conclusions: These results are suggestive of progressive thalamic neuronal damage directly associated with time of disease in patients with JME. (Supported by CAPES/CNPq.) 1 Miao Liu, and 1 Nathan B. Fountain ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Population based epilepsy studies provide accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence but provide limited data about precise seizure type and epilepsy syndrome characteristics because a detailed seizure history and prior antiepileptic drug (AED) use can't be obtained. We prospectively collected data on a finite epilepsy population to determine the characteristics defining each seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data was acquired directly from patients and medical records, then refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy 5 years old or greater. Data collected included demographics, ILAE seizure (SZ) type, ILAE epilepsy syndrome, etiology, EEG, neuroimaging, family history, and current and prior antiepileptic drug use. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed. SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time from June 2000 to November 2004. Results: A total of 1638 patients were analyzed. Overall, mean current age is 31.9, mean age at seizure onset was 14.4, and 49% are female. An etiology is known in 16% and 49% had a family history of epilepsy. Median current SZ frequency is 3/mo. The median for the highest monthly frequency ever reported by patients is 5/mo and for the minimum seizure frequency ever reported is 1/mo. Patients most frequently reported having only partial-onset SZ (60%) compared to only generalized SZ (37%) and mixed partial and generalized SZ (4%). Among the 14 categories of SZ combinations, CPS + Secondarily Generalized (25%) and Multiple Generalized (17%) are most common. The most common syndromes are Symptomatic Localization-Related Not Further Classifiable (17%), Cryptogenic Generalized Not Further Classifiable (16%), Idiopathic Generalized Not Further Classifiable (8%), and MTLE (7%). Other specific syndromes were less frequent. The mean number of AED ever used is 4. AEDs are not used at all by 9% while 19% use three or more AEDs. 47% patients previously failed three or more AEDs. Patients with only generalized SZ more commonly are off all AEDs (11%). Conclusions: It is well know that partial-onset seizures are more common and this clarifies that CPS + secondary generalization is the single most common combination of SZs. The etiology of epilepsy is rarely identifiable and most patients do not fit into a specific syndrome but MTLE is the single most common specific syndrome. A surprising minority of patients was not on AEDs but nearly half have failed 3 AEDs.

In the few reported cases, it has been suggested it involves the connections between the temporal lobe and the hypothalamus or the preoptic areas. We describe the first case of a patient who experienced pilomotor seizures for several weeks in relation to a transient MRI signal abnormality. Methods: A 35-year-old right-handed woman exhibited sudden epilepsy with a seizure frequency reaching 30 per day. They lasted less than 90 seconds each. They consisted of bilateral sensation of chill associated with nausea, thoracic sensation, and followed few seconds later by piloerection involving both arms and legs. EEG recording found slow waves on the left temporal region. MRI performed one week after the first seizure, showed a T2 and FLAIR signal increase in the left mesial temporal area without mass effect. She received antiepileptic drugs which decreased the severity and the frequency of seizures. Four months later, MRI showed a clear regression of the signal abnormality. At this time the number of seizures decreased from 30 to 10 per day. EEG-video performed at this time, recorded 6 seizures, each lasting less than 1 minute. These seizures consisted of sensation of chill ascending from the feet to all of the body associated with piloerection in the left arm. Results: Ictal EEG found a rythmic slow activity with a maximum amplitude on the left central and temporal area. Conclusions: Our observation showed that piloerection could be the main feature in the course of partial seizure of temporal lobe origin. The transient MRI T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality might be in relation with the high seizure frequency. Piloerection is probably more frequent than suggested in the course of temporal lobe seizures. 1,2 James W. McAuley, 1 Ian B. Hollis, and 1,3 Thomas Wolfe ( 1 College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; 2 Department of Neurology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; and 3 Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Columbus, OH ) Rationale: Comprehensive treatment of epilepsy involves many facets including self-management behaviors. The most common self-management strategy is adherence to an antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen. Controlling other non-drug related factors, such as management of information, concern for personal safety, management of the seizures themselves, and lifestyle issues can also play a large role in the overall success of therapy. The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the relationship between self-management behaviors and clinical outcomes. Methods: Adult epilepsy patients whom were able to complete the surveys by themselves and had been taking AED therapy for at least 6 months were recruited from our outpatient epilepsy clinic for this cross-sectional, descriptive study. We used two previously-validated surveys to assess various self-management behaviors. Morisky's four-item self-reported adherence measure (not epilepsy-specific) and DiIorio's 38-item scale that assesses frequency of use of epilepsy self-management practices were administered to a random sample of patients. We also collected clinical (seizure activity, number of AEDs and presence/absence of toxicity) and demographic information. The response to the Morisky questions provides a score ranging from 1 to 4. A score of 1 categorizes the patient in the ?low? medication-taking behavior category, a score of 2 or 3 is ?medium? and 4 is ?high? medication-taking behavior. On the Epilepsy self-management scale (ESMS), each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = Never to 5 = Always. Higher sores indicate more frequent use of self-management strategies. In addition, this scale can be divided into 5 subscales that address patient management of medication, information, safety, seizure and lifestyle. Results: Data on eighteen patients (8 female, 10 male) has been collected to date. Their average age is 42.61 yrs (range 26?64). Patients were taking an average of 1.53 AEDs (range 1?2) as well as other prescription medications (median = 2.5, range 1 to 18). Their monthly seizure burden ranged from seizure-free (n = 7) to ?daily? seizures (mean ± STD = 4.1 ± 10.45). Despite 7 patients acknowledging they have ?forgotten to take their medications,? the average Morisky Score had most of them in the ?High? medication taking behavior category (3.39 ± 0.92). The average ESMS scores indicated frequent use of self-management strategies (3.62 ± 0.43). On our initial evaluation of this data, the medication-taking behavior did not predict the clinical outcomes. Conclusions: In our small sample of patients, we have found that it is not simply medication-taking behavior that influences seizure activity. Further exploration of the relationship between clinical outcomes and other non-drug self-management strategies is needed. 1 Flavia S. Miyashira, 2 Henrique Carrete Jr., 1 Elza M.T. Yacubian, 1 Eliana Garzon, and 1 Americo C. Sakamoto ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Radiology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: To report findings on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) population at UNIPETE, from 2000 to 2005, including epidemiologic, imaging and natural history data. Methods: All diagnosed TLE due to MTS outpatients were included. Epidemiologic data was performed, as well as age and kind of initial precipitating insult (IPI) if present, age at first and second seizures, time spared until maximal tolerated dosage (MTD) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), presence of remission period, epileptogenic zone lateralization, age at MTD and age at surgery if applicable were evaluated. Results: We had 149 patients, aged 16 to 72 (40± 10years), 81 (54.36%) female, (85.23%) right-handed. According to lesion area, 80 (53.69%) were left-sided, 59 (39.59%) were right-sided and 10 (6.7%) were bilateral. 63 (42.28%) had IPI, mainly febrile seizures (52%). First spontaneous seizure (FSS) occurred from 0,08 to 55 years (11±10). Remission of seizures was seen in 31(21%). 89 (60%) reached MTD at 39±9, 28±11.5 years after FSS. 52 surgeries has been performed, age at surgery was 39±9, 29±12 years after diagnosis. Conclusions: TLE due to MTS in this service seem to present similar points to what previously described in literature; the time spared from first seizure to MTD is larger than that observed in developed countries, which might be related to socio-economic conditions, leading to surgeries later in life, with all its related consequences. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 Rajiv Mohanraj, and 2 Martin J. Brodie ( 1 Department of Neurology, Royal Perston Hosptial, Preston, Lancashire, United Kingdom ; and 2 Epilepsy Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes (IGES) constitute 20?40% of all epilepsies. Up to a third of cases are diagnosed after the second decade of life1. The prognosis of IGES in the non-pediatric setting may vary from that in infants and children because of differences in genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Methods: All patients diagnosed with IGES at the Epilepsy Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, between 1981 and 2001 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data, including syndrome classifications and pharmacological outcomes, were collated by a review of casenotes. Response to treatment was defined as complete control of seizures for 12 months. Patients remaining seizure free to the end of follow up were considered to be in remission. Results: Of 780 patients diagnosed with epilepsy over the 20 year period, 105 (13%) met the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria for IGES. The median age at onset was 17 years (range 5?51). Syndromes included Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME, n = 55), Epilepsy with Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) Only (n = 28), Epilepsy with GTCS on Awakening (n = 7), Juvenile Absence Epilepsy (n = 4), Epilepsy with GTCS during sleep (n = 3), Late Onset Myoclonic Epilepsy (n = 3), Childhood Absence Epilepsy (n = 2) and Epilepsy with Myoclonic Absences (n = 1). Overall, 76 (74%) patients responded to treatment. Sixty-six (64%) of these attained remission, which was achieved with antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy in 56 (54%) cases. The responder rate in the whole cohort with valproate (66%) was higher than with lamotrigine (45%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.076). In patients with JME, however, valproate was significantly more likely to produce remission (75%) than lamotrigine (39%; p = 0.014). The effect of age at onset, gender, family history of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, psychiatric co-morbidity, epileptiform abnormalities on EEG and seizures types on treatment outcomes was analysed by logistic regression. History of febrile seizures was the only factor that was significantly associated with reduced probability of remission (Odds ratio 0.18; 95% CI 0.03?0.96) Conclusions: IGES constituted 13% of cases in a largely adult cohort of newly diagnosed epilepsy. Approximately 2/3 of these patients achieved remission with AED therapy, mostly with a single drug. Valproate appeared to be the most efficacious drug, especially in JME. Previous febrile seizures were associated with reduced likelihood of remission, which could imply a genetic component to pharmacoresistant IGES.

J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2003;74: 192?196. 1 Majid Molaie, and 1 James Brust ( 1 Neurology  Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and Department of Radiology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Most versions of the language and memory component of the intra-carotid amytal (ICA) test employ a cutoff score denoting the point at which test failure is judged to occur. There may be patients with low enough baseline cognitive functioning who might fail such tests under any circumstances. For such patients the ICA procedure for testing language and memory functioning would be invalid. This study attempted to identify such patients and the variables that would predict them. Methods: The study examined a group of adult candidates (n = 54) for epilepsy surgery. Three equivalent versions of the language and memory portion of the ICA test were developed. The version of the language and memory test used during the pre-injection, baseline phase was randomly selected. The study analyzed the relationship of clinical variables and neuropsychological test variables to performance on the practice version of the test. Results: Average scores on the practice version of the test were uniformly quite high (mean language score = 14.93, mean memory score = 9.81). No subjects scored below the cutoff for failure. No relationship was found between clinical variables and performance on the baseline test. A moderate correlation was found between the baseline memory test and one pre-surgical neuropsychological test of memory. Otherwise, scores on the baseline test were unrelated to any of the neuropsychological test scores. In some cases, scores on the pre-surgical neuropsychological tests were quite low (WAIS-III full scale IQ = 50). In none of these cases were there failures on the baseline test. No relationship was found between scores on the baseline test and the ability of patients to cooperate with the actual ICA procedure. Thirty-one subjects had surgery for seizure control. Seventy per cent of these had good surgical outcomes. Several had post-surgical subjective complaints of language or memory problems. None had amnestic disorder. No relationship was found between scores on the baseline test and surgical outcome or post-surgical subjective complaints. Conclusions: The validity of the ICA test depends on the use of test procedures that any patient can perform at baseline. The results of this study indicate that procedures can be designed whose validity is resistant to the effects of extremely low pre-surgical cognitive functioning. With ICA test procedures where this presumption may not automatically be present, the validity of test participation can be confirmed with an equivalent baseline version of the test prior to the actual clinical procedure. 1 Vincent Navarro, 1 Claude Adam, 2 Claire Petitmengin, and 1 Michel Baulac ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France ; and 2 INT-GET, Groupe des Ecoles de Télécommunication, Evry, France ) Rationale: Tooth-brushing epilepsy is a very unusual form of reflex epilepsy, provoked by the act of tooth brushing. We report a 57-year-old patient with intractable partial epilepsy in which seizures were induced not only by tooth brushing, but also by seeing or thinking to a toothbrush or toothpaste. Methods: Patient was referred to our Epilepsy Unit for long-term video-EEG recordings. Various types of cognitive tasks were performed to provoke seizure. Results: The first seizures started at the age of 50. The patient noted that several activities related to a toothbrush frequently provoked the seizures (approximately 40% of the seizures). Seizures could be provoked by (i) tooth-brushing, especially in the morning, or (ii) seeing a toothbrush or toothpaste (its own, or seen on TV, in supermarket), especially if these objects were seen in an inadequate location, or (iii) thinking to toothbrush or toothpaste. No other trigger factor was identified. The seizure started with the pleasant feeling to be somewhere else during few seconds, then the patient felt anxious and a loss of consciousness with oral automatisms may occur. Brain MRI was normal, except for few hypersignals in the white matter and moderate enlargement of the lateral ventricles. During the video-EEG monitoring, four seizures were recorded. Two were elicited by tooth brushing in the bathroom, while the patient was alone. Several tests failed to provoke a seizure: tooth-brushing in front of the video camera, presentation on a TV screen of various pictures related to the toothbrush, researching a toothbrush hidden in the patient's room. On the other hand, two seizures were elicited by the evocation of (i) the TV advertisement that recently had provoked a seizure (a man with a toothbrush), and (ii) a place related to seizures that the patient avoided. The EEG showed a left temporal lobe onset of the seizures, and interictal epileptic spikes in the same area. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first report of reflex epilepsy in which seizures could be provoked by thinking to a toothbrush. This case differs from four previous patients reported with tooth-brushing epilepsy, for which hyperexcitability of the suprasylvian operculum was suggested. EEG and clinical data of our patient suggest a left temporal epileptogenic focus. We hypothesize that this epileptogenic zone may be closely related to the neurons responsible for the mental representation of the toothbrush in the temporal lobe. 1 Maromi Nei, 2 Reginald T. Ho, 1 Michelle A. Payne, 2 Tammi Wicks, and 1 Michael R. Sperling ( 1 Neurology, Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Cardiology, Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is most commonly seen in patients with refractory epilepsy. The etiology is uncertain, although a cardiac arrhythmia may be responsible for death in some patients. Video-EEG/EKG monitoring reveals that many patients have EKG rhythm and repolarization abnormalities in association with their seizures. However, thus far only limited data are available re: cardiac rhythm in these patients over several months. Objective: Assess the types of and frequency of cardiac rhythm and repolarization abnormalities over a 14-month period in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Patients with refractory epilepsy with ≥1 complex partial, generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, or atonic seizure/month underwent cardiac rhythm monitoring using a subcutaneously implanted recording monitor (Medtronic Reveal), to be implanted for a total of 14 months. Individuals ≥ 50 yrs of age or who had a history of cardiac disease or abnormal EKG were excluded. Patients were evaluated by a neurologist and cardiologist at 1 month after device implantation, then every 3 months thereafter for a maximum duration of 14 months for device interrogation. At each interrogation, data regarding heart rate and rhythm as well as repolarization abnormalities were noted. Patients or caretakers were asked to keep a seizure log and activate the device at the time of seizures. In addition, automated heart rate detection of rates < 30 and >180 BPM was programmed. Results: Thus far 13 patients (mean age 38.7 yrs, range 23?47 yrs; 8 men, 5 women) with refractory epilepsy (2 idiopathic generalized, 3 symptomatic generalized, and 8 partial) have been implanted and recorded over an average of 6.8 months (range 0.5 - 14 months). Patients had a history of epilepsy onset at a mean age of 7 years and epilepsy duration of 31.7 years. An average of 31 seizures/patient occurred during the study period. 3 patients had active vagal nerve stimulators. 2 patients (who did not have active vagal nerve stimulators) had sinus pauses of up to 4.8 seconds recorded unassociated with seizures. 2 patients had T wave inversions occurring only in association with seizures (1 patient with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 1 patient with tonic seizures). All other patients had only sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia associated with their seizures. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that patients with refractory epilepsy may be at increased risk for cardiac ischemia during seizures. Additionally, sinus pauses may occur in these individuals without evidence of a seizure. Further investigation in larger numbers of individuals is needed to determine the clinical significance of such abnormalities in this patient population. (Supported by Medtronic, Inc.) 1 Juan G. Ochoa ( 1 Neurology, University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL ) Rationale: Clinical practice differ significantly from the methodology used in postmarketing studies to assess the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic medications. Retrospective review permits analysis of the practice parameters and outcome measures without influencing them. The lack of restrictions regarding label indications, titration parameters, dosage, etc may change the outcome compared to controlled prospective studies. Methods: To compare the experience of a typical epilepsy center and the postmarketing data regarding the outcome after treatment of epilepsy with levetiracetam, restropective review were performed at the Epilepsy Clinic at The UF Neuroscience Institute, Jacksonville, FL between July 1,2002 and June 30, 2004. 100 random charts containing patients treated with Levetiracetam were extracted from our epilepsy clinic database. Incomplete records were excluded. 68 patients with diagnosis of epilepsy treated with levetiracetam were included. Results: 68 patients included 53% women and 47% men, 19% had a generalized epileptic disorder and 81% had focal epilepsy with or without generalization. The average age was 45 years including three (4.4%) children. The average total dose was 1994 mg and 17.6% was monotherapy. The overall seizure reduction at least 50% of reported baseline was 57% including a seizure free of 36%. Among the patients on monotherapy 50% became seizure free and 75% had a seizure reduction at least of 50%. The side effects more commonly reported included somnolence 17.6% and behavioral 11.8%. Memory deficit and dizziness occurred only in 2.9 and 1.5% respectively. 17% discontinued treatment because of side effects and it was related to behavioral side effects (7.4%) and sedation (7.3%). Only 4.4% discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy. Comparing with the results of the Keeper trial efficacy was similar, at least 50% seizure reduction of 57% in both studies and a seizure free of 36% versus 20% in Keeper trial.The side effect profile was similar as well regarding somnolence 17% versus 16% and behavioral 11.8% versus 7.4%. However dizziness was rather infrequent 2.9% compared with 9.0% in the Keeper trial.. Conclusions: The results of this study are comparable with the Keeper trial, a multicenter open label community based study, including efficacy and side effect profile. This study included small group of patients on monotherapy who reported higher seizure freedom and efficacy, however the number is too small to draw conclusions.

Decreased glucose metabolism in epileptogenic focus was suggestive of irreversible damage with prognostic implication. Attention has not been much paid to the prognostic implication between the glucose metabolism in temporal lobe and HS.We tried to define the clinical characteristics in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) depending on the decrease of the glucose metabolism and also the impact of hippocampal sclerosis in the same situation. Methods: 68 epilepsy patients with temporal spike in EEG were recruited. 56 patients among them had unilateral hippocampal sclerosis in MRI. The patients with additional lesion except for HS in MRI were excluded and patient with history of central nervous infection also excluded even in case of the isolated unilateral HS in MRI. Analysis was done to define the clinical profiles and prognosis between 40 patients with HS and 11 patients without HS. All of those showied decreased glucose metabolism in temporal lobe in 18F-FDG PET image. Another trial was done between those 56 patients with decreased metabolism in temporal lobe and 12 patients with normal MRI but without decrease of glucose metabolism in PET. Results: In the first trial, preponderance of female prevalence was noted, even in group of normal MRI with decreased metabolism. The incidence of head trauma in addition to the febrile convulsion was statistically significant higher in the group with HS (P < 0.05). Automatism was in higher in HS group but nocturnal preponderance was noted in normal MRI group. Good prognosis (Angel? class I. and II.) was statistically significant in normal MRI group (17.5% vs. 43.8%; p < 0.05). In second trial, head trauma was also higher incidence in the group with normal glucose metabolism than those of the decreased glucose metabolism. Complex partial seizure without 2? GTC, clustering nature, and nocturnal dominancy were statistically significant higher in normal glucose group. The prognosis of the group with normal metabolism was statistically significant (p < 0.05) better than those of the group with decreased glucose metabolism and normal MRI. Conclusions: This study suggested that decreased glucose metabolism in temporal lobe made some effect on difference of clinical profiles of TLE, even though in the presence of HS. Decreased glucose metabolism in TLE seemed to be an independent prognostic factor irrespective of the presence of HS in MRI. 1 Arjune M. Patel, 1 Raj D. Sheth, 1 Bruce P. Hermann, 1 Christian Dow, and 1 Jana Jones ( 1 Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Speed of propagation of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy to the contra lateral temporal lobe is predictive of seizure outcomes. In humans direct seizure propogation from ipsilateral hippocampus to contra lateral hippocampus is believed to occur through neocortical parenchymal spread. Fast propagating seizures are associated with worse outcomes following temporal lobectomy. The relationship between seizure propagation times in temporal lobe epilepsy and MRI volumetrics and neuropsychological function, however has not been examined. Methods: Propagation times from the ipsilateral to the contra lateral temporal lobe were measured using presurgical video telemetry. Propagation times were correlated with a comprehensive array of neuropsychological measures and quantitative MRI total brain grey and white matter volumes. Normalized Z-score measures were used for both neuropyschological testing and for MRI volumetrics. Analysis was performed on second seizure propagations by dividing groups into fast (<5 seconds) and slow (>5 seconds) propagators based on the median propagation times. Results: 20 patients had 2nd seizure propagation times that could be analyzed. 9 had fast propagation times (2.3 ± 1.8 seconds) and 11 had slow propagation time (10.3 ± 5.4 seconds). Slow propagators had significantly better immediate (105.45 ± 14.4 vs. 89.44 ± 22) and delayed auditory memory (103.18 ± 12.3 vs. 89.22 ± 19.3). Similarly memory scores were also better for slow propagators (100.09 ± 16.6 vs. 86.56 ± 16.4). Fast propagators had greater total cerebral volumes compared to slow propagators. Segmentation by grey and white matter volumes were also larger for fast propagators compared to slow propagators Conclusions: These findings suggest that faster propagation of seizures to the contra lateral hemisphere is associated with worse neurophysilogical function and larger grey, white and total brain volumes. 1 Scott Pearlman, 1 Diana Richardson, and 1 Mary R. Andriola ( 1 Neurology, Stony Brook Epilepsy Management Program, Stony Brook, NY ) Rationale: Topiramate (TPM) is a newer antiepileptic medication available in the United States for the treatment of epilepsy since 1996. It is indicated as adjunctive therapy for adults and pediatric patients ages 2?16 years with partial onset seizures, or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and in patients 2 years of age and older with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The purpose of this study was to review our clinical experience with TPM in an adult population. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 12 adults with a variety of epileptic syndromes who had been on prior therapy and had an EEG while on TPM from Jan 2003 to Dec 2004. Ages ranged from 22 to 56 years. Demographics, seizure types, previous antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), dosages, concomitant AEDs, adverse events and outcome were recorded. Results: Twelve patients were included; five men and seven women. Eight had partial onset epilepsy, and four primary generalized epilepsy. Associated disorders included mental retardation, renal failure, and history of meningitis. Patients were taking up to 3 AEDs when TPM was added. A >50% seizure reduction was found in 8 patients (67%) Adverse events (AEs) included nephrolithiasis, behavioral difficulties, and parasthesias. Two patients experienced beneficial weight loss. Three patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. One patient undergoing hemodialysis required an additional dose with dialysis for adequate seizure control. Conclusions: Topiramate is an effective and well tolerated medication in the adult population for both partial onset and primary generalized epilepsy. Monotherapy is possible in both partial and generalized epilepsy patients. In this population studied all had difficult to control epilepsy and we were able to achieve significant improvement in 67% of our patients. 1,2 Timothy E. Welty, 1 Andrea Pierce Ashley, and 2 Edward Faught ( 1 McWhorter School of Pharmacy, Samford University, Birmingham, AL ; and 2 Department of Neurology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: Osteoporosis (OP) is a well-documented chronic adverse effect of AED therapy. DEXA scans are the standard testing procedure for OP. However, DEXA can be costly and exposes a patient to radiation. Heel ultrasound (HU) is less costly, can be performed during a routine office visit, and is less risky. HU is used in many screening programs for OP, but has not been evaluated as a tool to screen for OP due to AED therapy. Methods: Patients ages 19?70 yrs with epilesy and managed in our clinc are eligible for this study. Inclusion criteria are patients receiving PB, PHT, CBZ, or VPA for at least 6 months. Patients are excluded if they are pregnant, on chronic corticosteroid therapy, taking prescription medications for OP, have parathyroid disorders, are institutionalized, or have sores or abrasions on feet. A questionnaire is completed by the patient to asses OP risk factors and calcium intake. HU is performed in clinic using a Sahara Hologic Sonometer. Each patient is sent for a DEXA scan. WHO standards for diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis are used. The primary outcome is comparison of HU to DEXA results. Secondary outcomes are evaluation of various risk factors and calcium intake. Statistical analysis will be using a students t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient with α= 0.05. A power analysis to detect at least a half standard deviation between HU and DEXA showed at least 64 individuals should be enrolled. Results: A total of 65 participants will be enrolled. Preliminary evaluation of the first 7 patients enrolled in the study shows a mean age of 49.6 yrs, among 5 women and 2 men. Mean duration of older AED therapy was 12.4 yrs. 3 patients smoke an average of 1 ppd, 3 women had a hysterectomy, 2 patients have a fracture history, the mean caffeine intake is 2.4 cups of coffee/day, and 1 is taking hormonal replacement therapy. Four patients are osteopenic according to HU using WHO standards. Two patients have completed the study and the final diagnosis was consistent between HU and DEXA (1 osteopenic and 1 normal). A full comparison and evaluation of patients enrolled will be made. Conclusions: Very preliminary data show that HU may be a useful screening tool for OP in patients taking chronic AED. 1 Aleksandra Pikula, 1 Costas Michaelides, and 1 Georga D. Montouris ( 1 Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA; Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA; and Department of Neurology, Boston Univesrity School of Medicine, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is associated with a high mortality and high incidence of neurological sequelae. Long term follow up (up to one year) of three patients treated with prolonged iatrogenic coma for RSE is reported. Methods: Three female patients ages 17, 29 and 33 years were admitted to the ICU in status epilepticus refractory to standard treatment. Two were new onset seizures secondary to viral encephalitis and the third was an exacerbation of seizure activity secondary to a mitochondrial disorder. Prolonged iatrogenic coma was induced for up to 54, 59 and 81 days respectively. All three required high doses of antiepileptic medications, in polypharmacy to control seizure activity. VNS was implanted in one case to control seizures Upon hospital discharge, all of the patients were followed by an epileptologist. Medications were reviewed and adjusted when necessary, seizure count was recorded, evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL) was noted and neurological exam was performed. Results: All three patients have improved seizure control on polypharmacy. One patient experienced breakthrough seizures secondary to missed doses of AED. She is now seizure free on dual drug therapy. Neurologically, she demonstrates only a mild monoparesis of a lower extremity. The patient with a mitochondrial disorder has rare simple partial hemifacial seizures. She has demonstrated significant gain in ADL, ambulation, and speech,all of which show improvement over her pre RSE condition. The third patient with concomitant diagnosis of schizophrenia experienced breakthrough seizures when,at another facility, reduction of AEDs was undertaken. Currently, adjustments have been made with significant improvement in seizure control. Fluctuations in cognitive skills are seen, which may be related to her psychiatric condition. She does not however, demonstrate any focal neurological deficits. Conclusions: The management of RSE remains a challenge. Each of the patients required prolonged iatrogenic coma. Each responded to different agents and to polypharmacy. Long term outcome has been favorable in each case. Despite the perception that RSE carries a poor prognosis, close supervision and aggressive treatment can result in a favorable outcome 1 Gerard Pinol, 1 Jose Angel Mauri, 1 Carlos Tejero, 1 Iris De la Puerta, 1 Luis Fernando Pascual, and 1 Enrique Mostacero ( 1 Service of Neurology, Clinical Hospital, Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain ) Rationale: We had studied demographic characteristics, stroke risk factors, size of lesions, seizure type and EEG findings. We evaluated if the patients received antiepileptic drugs after the first seizure and also we evaluated the recurrence of seizures along 5 years. Methods: Included in this study were 1061 cerebrovascular disease patients (846 ischemic stroke, 186 hematoma and 29 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)) who were admitted to the Department of Neurology of Clinic Hospital to Zaragoza between January 1998 and December 2000. Of these patients, 39 had early seizures in acute stroke. Results: 3.7% of patients (2.2% with ischemic stroke, 8% hematoma and 13% SAH) experienced one first-ever seizure. Mean age of 70.15 years. Arterial hypertension was the main risk factor stroke, it was present in 44% of patients. Of 39 patients, 54% developed generalized seizures and 46% partial onset. The main territory of ischemic stroke affected was medium cerebral artery. Cardioembolism was the main cause of ischemic stroke with seizures. 58% and 42% of hematomas were lobars and lentriculars respectively. Death was in 18% of patients in the first week. 61% of patients received antiepileptic drugs and phenitoine was the most used. Conclusions: Male patients with hipertension and hematoma or SAH suffer early seizures in most frecuency. High mortality in the first week. Low recurrence of seizures in the future and so the antiepileptic treatment musn't be prolonged more than 3 month. 1 Wesley J. Poynor, and 1 William R. Garnett ( 1 School of Pharmacy, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Zonisamide (ZNS) is a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug that exhibits a significant interaction with phenytoin (PHT): the half-life of ZNS is decreased by 60% (from 69 hours to 28 hours) due to the induction of enzymatic metabolic activity by PHT. Our objective was to explore this interaction with particular attention to the reverse drug interaction, i.e., the withdrawal of PHT therapy and its clinical implications for ZNS dosing. Methods: We developed a pharmacokinetic multiple-dosing model based upon a previously published multiple-dose clinical study of ZNS in normal volunteers. Using this model, we simulated the addition of PHT to ZNS monotherapy. We also simulated the withdrawal of PHT from binary therapy. In these simulations we assumed that enzyme induction due to PHT occurred over a 7 day period (i.e., the half-life of ZNS decreased gradually over a 7 day period). We also assumed that the de-induction of enzyme metabolic activity occurred over a 7 day period and that this de-induction phase did not occur until PHT levels were substantially zero, which we assumed occurred 7 days after the discontinuance of PHT therapy. Results: The decline in ZNS plasma levels upon adding PHT was 60%; perhaps more significantly, the ZNS plasma levels seen on monotherapy were more than double those seen with PHT co-therapy. We note that in co-therapy with PHT, ZNS dosing levels could easily be pushed from 200 mg BID to as high as 400 mg BID and still have plasma levels in the therapeutic range of 15?30 mcg/ml. When withdrawing PHT from co-therapy, there is a 7 day period during which PHT levels are declining to zero and the enzymatic metabolic activity is still induced. De-induction occurs after PHT levels are virtually zero and we assume to occur over 7 days. In this case the ZNS dose must be decreased to a target level of 200 mg BID. Assuming that we raised the dose of ZNS to 400 mg BID when given with PHT, we recommend decreasing the ZNS dose beginning 7 days after discontinuing PHT therapy. Thereafter we recommend decreasing the ZNS dose to an intermediate level (300 mg BID in our example) for 3 days (6 doses) and then beginning the 200-mg-BID maintenance dose regimen. This strategy is based on solid pharmacokinetic evidence and maintains plasma levels of ZNS in the therapeutic range throughout the transition Conclusions: ZNS dosing when given with PHT can be rationally elevated from the monotherapy dose recommendation of 200 mg BID up to a 400 mg BID level. The adherence to a 200 mg BID dose in co-therapy with PHT may explain apparent failure to achieve additional antiepileptic activity when adding ZNS. The reverse drug interaction occurs when PHT is withdrawn from ZNS therapy. Because of the dramatic effect of PHT on ZNS half-life, dose adjustments are necessary when PHT is withdrawn.

One large prior study (n = 16'432) observed IFBA in only 0.024% of patients, most of them children with secondary epilepsies. More recently, ictal beta activity on scalp EEG and intracranial EEG was reported in patients with neocortical epilepsies undergoing presurgical evaluation. There is little data on this seizure pattern beyond such patients and studies describing it in human status epilepticus are lacking. Methods: Report of two patients, in whom IFBA became the only electroencephalographic seizure pattern in the late phase of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) (patient 1), and in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) (patient 2). Results: Patient 1: 52 year old female patient with bitemporal non-lesional epilepsy since age 18. Non-adherence to AED treatment and methaqualone intoxication induced RSE lasting 54 days. Various treatments, pentobarbital anesthesia inclusively, failed. RSE eventually subsided under high-dose midazolam and carbamazepine. On day 42, serial episodes with complete loss of responsiveness and tonic upward-gaze were observed; EEG showed high-amplitude beta activity for 15?20 seconds, followed by attenuation. These seizures persisted until was RSE stopped. Patient 2: 49 year old male schizophrenic patient without history of seizures admitted because of confusional state and hyperglycemia. Medications were quietiapine, biperiden, and risperidone. Repetitive episodes (up to 20/h) of slight tonic right-sided head version and starring started on day 2. Concomitant EEG showed high-amplitude beta-activity for 45?60 seconds followed by slowing and subsequent attenuation. NCSE responded well to lorazepam and valproic acid. Conclusions: Our patients both showed IFBA as the exclusive electroencephalographic seizure pattern in NCSE. IFBA must be differentiated from lateralized asymmetric non-epileptic beta activity occuring in patients with infarcts and tumors who do not experience seizures. Differential diagnosis of IFBA in our first patient additionally includes high-dose benzodiazepine treatment, but the clinical and electroencephalographic evolution render this cause very unlikely. In the second patient, seizure semiology during early NCSE allowed immediate recognition of the ictal nature of the beta activity. However, in the first patient, the ictal nature of beta activity was unequivocally recognized only after she showed a clear clinical seizure correlate (starring and upward-gaze deviation) in the late phase of RSE. With minimal or absent clinical seizure manifestations, antiepileptic treatment in NCSE is predominantly guided by EEG. Therefore, the recognition of rare or atypical electroencephalographic seizure patterns, such as IFBA, is essential in these patients. 1 Susan Rahey, 1 Mark Sadler, and 2 Andrew Ross ( 1 Medicine (Neurology), Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ; and 2 Diagnostic Radiology, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ) Rationale: To report supernumerary phantom limb as an ictal phnomenon. Methods: A 66 year old right handed biologist presented with a 4 year history of stereotypic spells. His attacks are characterized by a nonspecific feeling of anxiety and unsteadiness followed by a profound perception that he has developed a third upper extremity. The supernumary limb cannot be seen but is perceived as ?right handed,? is positioned directly in front of him, and that the fingers can be moved. The experience has sufficient reality that the patient has attempted to use the limb during automatic movements (e.g. to use the turn signal while driving; unsucessfully bracing himself against falling). These events last 2?5 minutes, ocasionally 10, and occur up to 6 times daily. Impaired consciousness or motor phenomenon have never occurred. The mental status examination revealed minor defects of immediate memory and attention but the neurologic examination was otherwise normal, including evaluation of parietal lobe function. Results: The MRI scan disclosed periventricular and subcortical white matter ischemic change. The interictal EEG was normal. An ictal EEG (coincident with the perceived appearance of the third arm) disclosed a new 4?6 Hz polymorphic rhythm predominantly at CZ-C4. An ictal HMPAO-SPECT scan demonstrated a restricted zone of increased perfusion in the right central-parietal area. Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and levitiracetam have been poorly tolerated and without benefit. Conclusions: A supernumerary phantom limb may occur as an ictal accompaniment of parietal lobe epilepsy. A literature search found only 3 previous reports of similar phenomena, with none since 1968. 1 Maria V. Recio, 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil, 1 Michael J. McLean, and 1 Martin Gallagher ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Cerebellar lesions are associated with epilepsy but it is not known what type of epilepsy is associated with them. There are reports of seizures originating in the cerebellum itself in patients with cerebellar lesions, but it is not known how often this is the case in patients with congenital or acquired cerebellar lesions. Here we characterized epilepsy associated with cerebellar malformations by reviewing the records of all patients in our database with cerebellar malformations. Methods: We identified patients with documented epilepsy from our database. Medical records were reviewed for age, gender, age at seizure onset, family history for epilepsy, risk factors for epilepsy including febrile seizures, seizure type, localization and frequency, response to treatment, epilepsy surgery if performed, and eventual outcome at follow-up. Symptoms and neurological examination signs cerebellar dysfunction were reviewed. Brain CT and MRI images were reviewed for cerebellar as well as extracerebellar abnormalities. We excluded patients with only cerebellar atrophy. Results: We identified 10 patients (8 women) with cerebellar lesions and epilepsy in our database of 2288 epilepsy patients. Their ages ranged from 26 to 52 years (mean 37.5); age at seizure onset ranged from 2 weeks to 30 years (mean 10.2). The cerebellar malformations included Dandy-walker cyst (3 patients), cerebellar tumors (3 patients), posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (2 patients- one with abnormal cerebellar segmentation and one with cerebellar hemisphere and vermis hypotrophy), agenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere (1 patient), Chiari malformation and cerebellar hypotrophy (1 patient). Cerebellar exam abnormalities were present in four patients. The epilepsy was classified as partial in 9 patients (2 left mesial temporal, 3 right mesial temporal, 1 left frontal, 1 left occipital, 2 unclassified), and one symptomatic generalized. A presurgical evaluation was performed in 6 patients. The epileptogenic focus was temporal in 5 and in the supplementary motor area in one. The brain abnormality considered responsible for epilepsy was hippocampal sclerosis in 4 patients, hippocampal malformation in 1 patient, temporal tip cortical malformation in 1 patient. Five patients had epilepsy surgery (4 temporal, 1 mesialfrontal). All had a favorable initial response to surgery becoming seizure-free (Engel class I) or almost seizure-free (Engel class II), but seizures eventually recurred in 2 patients after one year with no seizures. Conclusions: Epilepsy with cerebellar structural abnormalities is most often of temporal lobe origin. There is usually associated temporal lobe pathology accounting for the seizure tendency, including hippocampal sclerosis and temporal developmental malformations. Cerebellar pathology should not preclude epilepsy surgery 1 J.J. Uranga Rodriguez, 1 F. Chaves Villalobos, 2 O. Serrano Prian, 2 I. Pozo Trujillo, 2 C. Sanchez Ruiz, 2 C. De la Torre Rueda, and 1 Jimenez Hernandez ( 1 Neurology, Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Seville, Spain ; and 2 Psychology University, Seville University, Seville, Seville, Spain ) Rationale: We present a 33-year-old woman presented with a subacute confusional state, headaches, myoclonus, seizures, unsteadiness and an amnesic syndrome as a presentation of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Methods: Complementary investigations showed euthyroidism,raised thyroid microsomal antibodies, pleocytosis in CSF, negative neuronal potassium channels, negative antineuronal antibodies, negative PCR for herpes simple virus in four determinations, continuous bitemporal spikes in EEG, normal PET study, chest CTscan and mamography. Results: The patient was 21 days in intensive care unit with invasive ventilation and general anesthesia with unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs. A T2-weighted MRI of the brain showed bilateral symmetric areas of increased signal in the mesial temporal lobes and hippocampus that had a low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and gadolinium enhanced. The clinical and radiologic improvement after steroid and inmunoglobulin therapy. The patient was assessed neuropsychologically three months after discharge. Her scores on executive skills, visual, verbal, working and autobiographical memories were all pathological. Her scores on language, visuospatial, visuoconstructive functioning were all above average. Atentional process are slowed. Conclusions: The clinical and laboratory features in this case support a diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. We think than the immunoglobulin treatment is a important options in those patients. We conclusions that in cases with epilepticus status and bilateral mesial temporal involvement is necessary to reject Hashimoto's encephalopathy and use precocious inmunomodulador treatment for prevent consequences. The thyroid microsomal antibodies determinations is necessary in cases with bilateral mesial temporal involvement and cryptogenic epilepticus status. 1 Charles A. Sansur, 1 Jeff Elias, 1 David S. Geldmacher, and 1 Mark Quigg ( 1 Neurosurgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Neurosurgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Assessment of eloquent functions during brain mapping usually relies on testing reading, speech, and comprehension to uncover transient deficits during electrical stimulation. These tests stem from findings predicted by the Geschwind-Wernicke hypothesis of receptive and expressive cortices connected by white matter tracts. Later work, however, has emphasized cortical mechanisms of language function. We report two cases that demonstrate that conduction aphasia is cortically-mediated and can be inadequately assessed if not specifically evaluated during brain mapping. Methods: To determine the distribution of language on dominant cortex, we performed electrical cortical stimulation using implanted subdural electrodes during brain mapping before epilepsy surgery. We report our findings in two patients. There was an interelectrode distance of 1cm. We stimulated adjacent pairs of contacts using a 50 Hz square wave signal starting at a duration of 2 seconds and an intensity of 4.5 mA. We increased duration to 5 seconds and increased current by 1 mA increments until (1) a response occurred, (2) an afterdischarge or clinical seizure occurred, or (3) no response was achieved at a stimulus of 12.5 mA/5 seconds. Results: We elicited a transient, isolated deficit in repetition of language with stimulation of the posterior portion of the dominant superior temporal gyrus in one patient and of the supramarginal gyrus in the second patient. Conclusions: These cases demonstrate a localization of language repetition to the posterior perisylvian cortex. Brain mapping of this region should include assessment of verbal repetition to avoid potential deficits resembling conduction aphasia. This study provides further evidence that the white matter disconnection hypothesized by the Wernicke-Geschwind model is not an obligatory cause of conduction aphasia. 1 Kimberley K. Schaub, 1 Nancy Foldvary, and 1 Peggy Crawford ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Research in sleep and epilepsy has revealed a dynamic relationship between the disease and the sleep-wake cycle. Many people with epilepsy report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), commonly attributed to the effects of seizures and/or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea are yet another cause of EDS. In some patients with epilepsy, sleep instability, possibly independent of these forementioned factors, may be present as many individuals with epilepsy have increased latency to sleep onset, increased number and duration of awakenings, decreased sleep efficiency, increased number of shifts between stages of sleep, and decreased or fragmented REM sleep on polysomnography (Besset, 1982; Touchon, Baldy-Moulinier, Billiard, et al., 1987, 1991). EDS can negatively affect quality of life. As a result, many attempt to compensate for sleepiness with the use of caffeinated beverages. Caffeine, a mild stimulant, is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world and in high doses may cause nausea, trembling, nervousness, as well as increased seizure frequency (Zagnoni and Albano, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate caffeinated beverage consumption in individuals with epilepsy and to identify demographic and disease related variables associated with its use. Methods: Participants were one hundred and ten adults (42% male) aged 18?75 with medically intractable epilepsy, referred for surgery evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. All subjects participated in a health psychology evaluation that included questions regarding employment, education, psychiatric and sleep history as well as use of caffeinated beverages, alcohol and illicit drugs. Fourteen percent of participants were treated with monotherapy, 66% were taking two AEDs, 17% three, and 4% four or more AEDs (intermittent benzodiazepine use excluded). Forty-two percent were employed and 58% were not currently employed. Results: Caffeinated beverage consumption ranged from 0 to 128 oz. daily, with an average of 30 oz. Although no significant differences were observed in caffeinated beverage consumption between men and women, individuals who consumed larger quantities of caffeine also used nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substances regularly and were more likely to be employed. Disease related variables, particularly greater numbers of AEDs, correlated with greater caffeine consumption. Conclusions: These results suggest that use/overuse of caffeinated beverages is common among individuals with medically intractable epilepsy, particularly those on AED polytherapy, use other substances, or are employed.Given the impact that these issues have on quality of life, these findings highlight the importance of further research into the causes and treatment of sleep and wake disturbances associated with epilepsy. 1 Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, 2 Christhop Kurth, and 3 Thomas Mayer ( 1 Epilepsy Centre, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany ; 2 Epilepsy Centre, Kork, Kehl-Kork, Baden-Württemberg, Germany ; and 3 Epilepsy Centre, Diakonie Kleinwachau, Liegau-Augustusbad, Sachsen, Germany ) Rationale: Premonitory symptoms are usually defined as phenomena occurring more than 30 minutes before the onset of epileptic seizures. So far, their meaning is unclear, unlike auras, they are, however, generally not regarded as a correlate of ictal epileptic activity. So far few data are available on their prevalence and to their semiologic characteristics as compared to auras in the same patient. This study investigated the prevalence and type of premonitory symptoms in epilepsy patients at three german tertiary referral centers. Methods: Questionnaires were handed out to a total of 500 unselected patients at the epilepsy centers of Freiburg, Kork, and Kleinwachau agreeing to participate. 415 patients had epilepsies classified as focal, 82 had epilepsies classified as primarily generalized. Patients were asked to report the presence of signs or symptoms preceding seizure for at least 30 minutes. If premonitory symptoms were present, they were asked to describe their nature. These data were related to the epilepsy syndrome and to seizure semiology. Results: 35/500 patients (7.0%) reported symptoms occurring more than 30 minutes preceding the onset of seizures. 30 patients had focal epilepsy (prevalence 7.2%), 5 had generalized epilepsy (prevalence 6.1%). The median of estimated time of premonitory symptoms preceding the seizure was 90 min (range 30 minutes - 24 hours). Most common symptoms reported were restlessness, headache, feeling uncomfortable, nausea, disturbance of concentration, dizziness and tiredness. In 17/35 patients also auras were reported; in three of them, symptoms were similar suggesting that they also suffered from prolonged auras. In the majority of patients, however, symptoms differed considerably. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study in patients at tertiary referral centers resulted in a frequency of premonitory symptoms well below previous reports which may be due to the fact that other studies did not investigate auras separately. Differences in semiology between premonitory symptoms and auras in the vast majority of patients suggest a different underlying pathophysiology. 1 Tania M.G. Henriques, 1,2 Fulvio A.

Methods: Forty-three non-consecutive patients (26 males) submitted to both temporal and extratemporal cortical resection were studied. They were assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a generic instrument with the following domains: functional capability, mental health, social function, emotional aspects, physical function, general status of health, vitality, bodily pain; used to assess quality of life. The follow-up time after CR ranged from 2 month to 11 years. Fifty six per cent of patients had controlled seizures, 39.5% had complex partial seizures and 4.6% presented partial seizures with secondary generalization. Results: Mean age of our population was 37.4±10.1, ranging from 17 to 58 years old. The mean score for each domain for cured/non-cured patients were as follows: vitality, 81/62; general health status, 82/65; pain, 79/59; social function, 84/63; emotional aspects, 81/47; mental health, 77/53; physical function, 88/61 and functional ability, 94/82. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the type and frequency of seizures might be important factors in QOL measures. Assessing QOL and outcome after epilepsy surgery could lead to a better understanding of the various aspects related to the well being of chronically refractory epileptic patients. (Supported by FAEP, FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES.) 1 Larissa I. Seredycz, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Health services research in epilepsy is in its infancy in many parts of the world. This type of research is crucial in understanding provisional health services in epilepsy, treatment gaps, and determinants of variations encountered. Whether the right patients are receiving the right interventions at the right time requires research of this nature. Administrative databases are a rich resource that has been used in many areas but rarely in epilepsy. ICD9, and more recently ICD10 codes are utilized worldwide in administrative databases. There is little information on the validity of ICD9 codes for epilepsy and no information on ICD10 codes. We undertook a before and after comparison of ICD9 and ICD10 epilepsy coding in inpatients in a large health region. Methods: All discharge diagnoses in Canada are ICD coded and captured in a central repository. ICD9 codes were used in our region until 2000. Thereafter ICD10 codes were adopted. We obtained ICD codes epilepsy- related, in any sequence (whether most responsible diagnosis for admission or not) for 2000 (ICD9) and 2004 (ICD10), in five inpatient facilities within the entire Calgary Health Region (population 1.4 million). We grouped ICD codes into generalized, localization-related, status epilepticus and other. We examined the distribution of each group within the two coding systems, both as a most responsible diagnosis and as other diagnoses. Results: The following ICD 9 codes were used: generalized epilepsy (345.0, 345.1, 780.4, 333.2), localization-related epilepsy (345.4, 345.5), status epilepticus (345.3, 345.7), other epilepsy (345.8, 345.9). For ICD 10 the following codes were used: generalized epilepsy (G40.3, G40.4, G40.6, G40.7), localization-related (G40.0, G40.1, G40.2), status epilepticus (G41.0, G41.2, G41.8, G41.9, G40.5), other epilepsy (G40.8, G40.9). In the absence of overt changes in availability of inpatient services, ICD9 captured 968 patients and ICD10 captured 625 per year. Table 1 Conclusions: In the absence of expected changes in the patient population or rate of admissions, substantial discrepancies occurred between types of epilepsy and numbers of epilepsy captured by the two coding systems. ICD10 coding seems better at capturing localization-related epilepsy and status epilepticus as well as having fewer patients in the non-specific (other epilepsy) category. This difference was apparent both for most responsible diagnosis and for other diagnoses. Before ICD codes can be used extensively in health services research, further research should focus on their accuracy based on comparison with clinical diagnoses, in addition to exploring variables that explain differences between systems.

We further examined this question by (a) Attempting to replicate the original association and (b) Using a combination of tagging SNPs and direct sequence based methods to examine whether other variants in the gene are associated with drug resistant epilepsy in an Irish epilepsy cohort. Methods: 440 patients with an established diagnosis of epilepsy were enrolled. Phenotypic information was recorded in a secure linked anonymised database. We examined C3435T to replicate the original association. We also genotyped 5 additional tagging SNPs and 3 putatively functional variants. Results: Of 440 patients, 242 were drug responsive and 198 were drug resistant. Direct comparison of the genotypes of both groups revealed no significant association of any particular SNP with refractory epilepsy. Haplotype analysis failed to yield significant association of either group with a particular genotype. Discussion: An association of the CC genotype at C3435T has been reported in patients with drug resistant epilepsy(1). An exact replication study has failed to confirm that association.(2).However, the association was replicated by a similar but not identical definition of pharmacoresistance(3). It is possible that the C3435T polymorphism is not itself causal but associating through LD with the causal variant. Hence,analysis of SNPs in strong LD with C3435T has been suggested(4). We attempted an exact replication using map and sequence based methods but failed to find a significant association with drug resistant epilepsy. Conclusions: We examined C3435T as well as all other common variants in MDR1 and failed to identify a significant association with drug resistant epilepsy.This supports the view that the original association(1), maybe a false-positive finding. However, the ambiguous nature of the phenotype definition does not rule out a role variation in MDR1 with pharmacoresistance in a specific group of antiepileptic drugs.

Holzemer ( 1 Neurology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO ) Rationale: During initial clinical trials of ondansetron, only 10 patients (<1%) had seizures. All had tumors with numerous risk factors for seizures. There are only two additional reports of seizures following ondansetron administration in humans, one in a patient with septic shock after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, and another in a patient with metastatic breast cancer on chemotherapy. In animal studies, both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects of ondansetron have been described. Methods: Retrospective review of three patients evaluated during the period 2004?2005. Results: There were two females and one male. Ages ranged from 38?56 years. None had a previous or family history of seizures. Past medical history was significant only for diabetes, with one patient presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred in each patient 12, 15 and 22 minutes after injection of 4 mg of ondansetron intravenously for severe nausea and vomiting. Seizures were brief and patients returned to their baseline clinical state within a few minutes. Although no antiepileptic drugs were given, none had seizure recurrence subsequently. Brain MRI and EEG were normal in all patients. Conclusions: The temporal relationship between ondansetron administration and seizures, lack of EEG or MRI abnormalities and absence of seizure recurrence suggest that the seizures in our patients were causally related to ondansetron. Ondansetron associated seizures may be more common than previously recognized and can occur in patients with no obvious predisposing factors. Based on previous reports and our own experience, they typically present as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure within 30 minutes of parenteral administration of ondansetron. The exact mechanism is unknown. 1 Tanvir U. Syed, 1 Ahsan M. Arozullah, 1 Anu K. Podichetty, and 1 Eduardo R. Locatelli ( 1 Neurology Department, Cleveland Clinic Florida, Weston, FL ) Rationale: To determine whether a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures (NES) can be predicted by sociodemographic information and a simple questionnaire. Methods: Epileptic and NES patients were recruited from a multispecialty community-based clinic equipped with an epilepsy-monitoring unit. The diagnosis of NES was confirmed by video-EEG monitoring and clinical data. Patients completed a self-administered survey consisting of quality of life (QOLIE-31), depression, and anxiety scales. Subsequently, an interviewer-based questionnaire was used to assess sociodemographic information, attitudes toward self-care, social-support, trust in the healthcare system, self-efficacy, and health-literacy. Epilepsy-specific parameters included seizure frequency (per month), seizure control (seizure-freedom for the past 12 months), time since diagnosis, and AED compliance. The bivariate relationship between each potential predictor and the diagnosis of NES was tested using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the independent t-test for continuous variables. Predictors with p < 0.20 in the bivariate analysis were entered into a stepwise conditional multivariate logistic regression model with the diagnosis of NES as the dependent variable. Predictors with p > 0.05 in the regression model were sequentially deleted from the analysis until only statistically significant predictors remained. Results: To date, 98 epileptics (mean age 42 ± 17, 60.2% female, mean seizure frequency 2.6 ± 0.7) and 19 NES (mean age 41 ± 14, 94.7% female, mean seizure frequency 11.1 ± 3.7) have completed both surveys. Bivariate analysis identified female gender (p = 0.004), Non-Caucasian ethnicity (p = 0.087), unemployment (p = 0.102), low income (p = 0.016), increased seizure frequency (p < 0.001), greater time since diagnosis (p = 0.017), poor AED compliance (p = 0.196), low QOLIE-31 score (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.001), low social support (p = 0.067), and low self-efficacy (p = 0.068) as potential predictors of a diagnosis of NES. The medication effects subscale of the QOLIE-31 and the tangible subscale of the social support inventory were the only subscales not found to be significantly related to a diagnosis of NES. The final logistic regression model retained female gender (OR = 17.3 [1.6, 183.6]), low income (graded from 1 = lowest to 7 = highest, OR = 0.74 [0.56, 0.99]), low overall-quality-of-life subscale score of QOLIE-31 (scaled 0?100, OR = 0.94 [0.92, 0.98]), and higher seizure frequency (OR = 1.1 [1.03, 1.17]) as independent predictors of a diagnosis of NES. The C-statistic and GOF statistic for the model were 0.894 and 0.338, respectively. The positive predictive value for predicting a diagnosis of NES in our patients was 91.4%. Conclusions: 2 items from the QOLIE-31 questionnaire (overall-quality-of-life subscale) and sociodemographic information may be useful in differentiating NES patients from true epileptics. 1 Jose F. Tellez-Zenteno, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: A previous epidemiological study has shown that patients with epilepsy have substantial comorbidity of chronic conditions1. We hypothesized that the somatic multicomorbidity in epilepsy is not specific for epilepsy, but that other chronic conditions share similar comorbidity. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Population Health Survey (NPHS, 49,000 respondents) and the Community Health Survey (CHS, 130,882 respondents). Both surveys used probabilistic sampling of the entire Canadian population and explored the presence of 19 common chronic conditions, ascertained through trained personal interviewers. We obtained risk ratios for prevalence of chronic conditions in 4 target disorders that can affect similar age groups: epilepsy, asthma, migraine and diabetes Results: 19 chronic somatic conditions were explored. 13 chronic conditions occurred significantly more frequently in epilepsy patients than in the general population, 10 in asthma, 14 in diabetes and 10 in migraine (Risk ratio >1.0, 95% CI excluded the null value). Chronic conditions with very high prevalence (Risk ratio >2) in our target disorders were: Epilepsy: upper gastrointestinal problems, stroke, urinary incontinence, bowel disorders, chronic fatigue, migraine, pulmonary conditions and heart disease. Migraine: upper gastrointestinal problems, bowel disorders, and chronic fatigue. Diabetes: arthritis, high blood pressure, pulmonary conditions, heart disease, stroke, cataracts, thyroid conditions, cancer and glaucoma. Asthma: pulmonary conditions and chronic fatigue. Conclusions: Epilepsy has the highest somatic comorbidity. It is similar in frequency to Diabetes, a systemic, multiorgan condition. However, the profile is different, only 3 of 8 highly comorbid conditions were shared. Only fatigue and pulmonary conditions occurred in at least three of our target disorders. Comorbid conditions in migraine and asthma were infrequent, but similar in type to epilepsy. We conclude that somatic comorbidity in epilepsy is as high as in systemic, multiorgan disorders, and that it cannot be explained simply as a function of its chronicity. We discuss methodological issues and validity of findings REFERENCE 1.?Gaitatzis A, Carroll K, Majeed A, Sander W. The epidemiology of the comorbidity of epilepsy in the general population. Epilepsia 2004;45(12):1613?1622. 1 Maria E. Fontela, 1 Maria B. Viaggio, 1 Veronica De Simone, and 1 Alfredo Thomson ( 1 Epilesy Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: There is a known increased mortality rate in patients with epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death is the most important epilepsy related cause of death. Experimental and clinical data support that early age at onset of seizures, mental retardation, frequent tonic-clonic seizures as well as intractability are significant risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The main autopsy finding, pulmonar oedema, is still not enough to understand the cause of death of the affected patients. Depending on the cohort studied, SUDEP is responsible for 2 to 18% of all deaths, although the incidence may be up to 40 times higher among young adults with epilepsy. However, (up to our knowledge) incidence of SUDEP in South America has not been reported. The aim of our study is to communicate the frequency of SUDEP in our population. Methods: Clinical records of patients evaluated in our Section from 1999 to December 2004 were reviewed. History of their disease, personal data, treatment given, circumstances of death and autopsy reports were analyzed. Patients with epilepsy who died suddenly and unexpectedly, fulfilling established SUDEP criteria were included. Results: Total of clinical records evaluated: 1000 (from 1999 to Dec. 2004). Educational program about SUDEP was started in 2003. Seven cases fulfill SUDEP criteria, 5 were females and 2 males. Six died between December 2002 and 2004 and one in 1999 (this particular death was read in newspaper and relatives were contacted). The average age at seizure onset was 10,71 ± 4,46 years (range: 3?16 years old). The mean age of death was 33,85 ± 6,7 (28 to 45 years old), resulting in mean duration of seizures of 23,14 ± 7,24 years. Two cases had primarily generalized epilepsies and five suffered from focal seizures with secondary generalization. Three patients were mentally retarded and one had a vascular sequelae in temporal lobe. Except for this patient, all the others had normal MRIs. Seizure frequency median was 4/month (range: 2?150/month). All patients were intractable but one. All of them were on politherapy. No patients had any other potential cause of death and were, aside from epilepsy, healthy at the moment of death. Five patients underwent necropsy, and were classified as definitive SUDEP. The autopsy reported: pulmonary oedema in 3 cases and no remarkable findings in the others. Conclusions: The clinical features described in our study group are similar to those previously reported in the literature. Although the number of SUDEP cases is small, 5 of them were reported after 2003 which might reflect the influence of the educational program implemented at our Department. We believe education is necessary in order to identify SUDEP cases. Patients and family members need to be aware that SUDEP is the most important cause of death related to epilepsy. Its recognition is essential and the first step to determine the incidence of SUDEP in South America. 1 Eugen Trinka, 1 Iris Unterberger, 1 Gerhard Bauer, 1 Jean-Pierre Ndaysaba, 1 Norbert Embacher, 1 Gerhard Luef, 1 Gerald Walser, 1 Klaus Seppi, 1 Judith Dobesberger, and 2 Wilhelm Oberaigner ( 1 Neurology, Universitätsklinik Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria ; and 2 Clinical Epidemiology, TILAK, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria ) Rationale: To evaluate the overall mortality and cause specific mortality in epilepsy patients in Tyrol, Austria as well as their risk factors. Methods: All pts with definite epilepsy (n = 3334) treated at the seizure clinic Universitätsklinik für Neurologie, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria between 1970 and 2000 were included. 1530 of them were incident cases. Diagnosis was based on ILAE classification. Living or dead status was obtained from the Institut für Klinische Epidemiologie, TILAK using a specialized probabilistic record linkage. Pts. were followed until death or end of 2003. A total of 48.595 person-years were analyzed. Standardized mortality rates (SMRs) were calculated by comparisons with those living in the same geographic area in Tyrol. Exact 95% confidene intervals were calcualted by assuming a poisson distribution, using stata? statistical package. Results: We observed 648 deaths compared to expexted 297.4 resulting in a overall SMR 2.2[2.0?2.4] after >30 Years of follow-up. The highest mortality was found in the younger age groups (26?45yrs, SMR 6.8[3.8?11.2]) and in symptomatic epilepsies (3.1[2.3?4.9]) as compared to those with idiopathic (2.7[0.7?7.0]) or cryptogenic etiology (2.2[1.6?3.1]). Elevated SMR after 2 years follow-up were not related to any specific seizure type but was strongly increased in those with persistent seizures as compared to seizure free pts. (SMR 3.3[2.6?4.4] vs. 1.4[0.8?2.3], p < 0.0001). Pts of the cohort 1995?2000 had significantly lower mortality rates than those between 1985?1989 (1.8[1.1?2.9] vs. 4.7[3.3?6.4]). The most common causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases (26%), neoplasms excl. brain tumors (23%) and cardiovascular diseases (15%). The highest cause specific SMR were found for epielpsy (91.6[66.3?123.4]), brain tumors (22,7[15,7?31,8]), and external causes (2,4[1,8?3,3]). Conclusions: The mortality of pts with epilepsy in Tyrol is substantially increased. There is a strong relation to persistent seizure activity and excess mortality possibly amenable to prevention. A reduction of the SMR in the past decade indicats an improved health service in the province. 1 Lori D. Uber-Zak, 1 Matthew T. Hoerth, 2 Takkin Lo, 3 Victor K. Lamin, and 1 Travis E. Losey ( 1 Department of Neurology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ; 2 Department of Pulmonary/Critical Care, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ; and 3 Department of Nephrology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ) Rationale: Valproic acid (VPA) can cause hyperammonemia alone or in combination with other agents. Hyperammonemia is associated with EEG abnormalities including triphasic waves, high amplitude delta and generalized spike and wave. Hyperammonemia can also lead to cerebral edema, coma and death. We hypothesized that refractory VPA induced hyperammonemia in the setting of status epilepticus (SE) could be treated with hemodialysis (HD) and would lead to improvements in the EEG. Methods: Two patients in SE treated with pharmacologic coma in addition to standard antiepileptic drugs developed refractory hyperammonemia secondary to VPA. HD was undertaken to lower ammonia (NH3) levels. NH3 levels were measured pre and post HD during continuous EEG monitoring. EEG patterns were analyzed. Other laboratory parameters were measured. Results: Marked improvements in NH3 levels were noted after each round of HD. Additionally, the generalized, periodic triphasic waves seen before HD were replaced by a pattern of diffuse slowing. Permanent resolution of the hyperammonemia and its associated EEG abnormalities came only after discontinuation of the VPA. Conclusions: HD can be an effective method for the treatment of VPA induced hyperammonemia in the setting of SE. Improvements in the EEG findings after HD may help to distinguish triphasic waves secondary to hyperammonemia from other more malignant patterns in SE. 1 Iris Unterberger, 1 Judith Dobesberger, 1 Norbert Embacher, 1 Gerald Walser, 1 Gerhard Luef, 1 Elfriede Karner, 1 Margarete Delazer, 1 Thomas Benke, 2 Martin Ortler, and 1 Eugen Trinka ( 1 Neurology, Medizinische Universität Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Medizinische Universität Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria ) Rationale: Epilepsy often is a chronic disorder with great impact on patients' psychosocial functions. Prevalence of affective symptoms (anxiety and depression) is 20?55%. The aim of our study was to evaluate affective symptoms in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, which underwent the Innsbruck Epilepsysurgery programme. Methods: 102 konsecutive patients were studied. Postoperative seizure outcome was classified by the proposed classification of Wieser (2001). The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) was used to identify caseness (possible and probable) of anxiety disorders and depression. Patients were studied preoperatively, 3 mo and 1 yrs postoperatively. Patients were divided into two groups [HADS (0?7; normal), HADS (> = 8; possible/probable). Results: 102 patients (51 f, median age 42 yrs, range (17?71 yrs) were included. 54 and 73 patients showed modest anxiety and depression scores preop (HADS = 0?7) compared to 48 and 29, who exhibited elevated scores (HADS> = 8). There was no korrelation between duration of epilepsy, diagnosis and localisation of epilepsy, age or gender and HADS results. Patients with elevated scores preoperatively improved significantly over time postoperatively (p < 0.001; anxiety and depression), but showed elevated scores overall compared to patients revealing modest scores (p < 0.005). patients with normal scores preoperatively showed improved anxiety scores postop, depressin scores were stabile. There was no significant korrelation between seizure freedom (yes/no) and HADS scores, although seizure free patients showed a trend to perform better. Conclusions: Affective symptoms (anxiety and depression) were found in 30?50% of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. A significant postoperative improvement of anxiety and depression scores was shown. 1 Ralf W. Van Der Sluis, 1 Peter Boardman, and 1 Keijian Tang ( 1 Neurology, New Jersey VA Health Care System, East Orange, NJ ) Rationale: To assess increasing capability of residents by level of training to recognize and treat two distinct and important epilepsy syndromes. Methods: An observational, cross sectional study was performed among the residents of the neurology program of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark. Two vignettes of a typical case of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) respictively were presented to the residents. A questionnaire was provided to the residents with questions regarding diagnosis, EEG features, treatment and prognosis. The questionnaire was scored by means of a self designed scoring protocol. ANOVA of scores between groups of residents stratified by training year and combined in junior and senior groups was performed, and also versus 2 control groups of Board Certified/Board Eligible (BC/BE) neurologists with and without extra training in EEG/epilepsy. Results: Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of JME was significantly different between groups. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in senior (PGY3?4) residents compared to junior (PGY1?2) residents. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was not significantly better between residents of all separate training years and neurologists without extra training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in neurology attendings with training in epilepsy when compared to residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of MTLE was significantly different between groups. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better for PGY4 residents compared to PGY1 residents. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was not significantly better between residents and neurologists without extra training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in neurology attendings with training in epilepsy when compared to junior and senior residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Conclusions: Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of JME and MTLE remains poor among residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Syndromic diagnosis of epilepsy continues to remain suboptimal, with negative repercussions for therapeutic management. Optimal management for patients with epilepsy is with neurologists with special expertise in epilepsy. 1 Lina Wang, 1 Gregory Mathews, and 1 Bassel Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Analysis of seizure semiology is an important element of the presurgical evaluation. Hypermotor pattern at seizure onset is traditionally considered characteristic of frontal lobe seizure origin, with only rare reports in temporal lobe epilepsy. After observing several patients with hypermotor seizures and temporal tip lesions, we analyzed seizure manifestations in consecutive patients who had epilepsy surgery and MRI evidence of temporal tip lesions, to evaluate the frequency of hypermotor manifestations in epilepsy with temporal tip lesions. Methods: We systematically reviewed seizure history, imaging findings, EEG-video monitoring data, operative reports, pathology findings, and postoperative outcome in consecutive patients with temporal tip lesions evaluated over the preceding 10 years. We also reviewed recorded seizures for analysis of seizure semiology. Results: Eight patients were found having temporal tip lesions. The age of seizure onset varied from 2 to 35 years (average 18). All patients had intractable complex seizures ranging in frequency from 1?2/day to 1?2/month. In all patients, brain MRI showed anterior temporal tip lesions. These included cavernoma in 2 patients, focal cortical dysplasia in 1 patient, cortical and subcortical white matter gliosis in 3 patients, ganglioglioma in 1 patient, and astrocystic proliferation in 1 patient. Four patients manifested hypermotor seizure semiology. The main features were rapid onset with moaning, barking or squealing vocal sound (2 patients) and vocal expletives (1 patient), followed by repetitive leg movement (bicycling, kicking, flexion-extension or sideway motion) in all 4 patients, repetitive body rocking motion (3 patients), pelvic thrusting (1 patient) and thrashing or flexion and extension of upper extremities (3 patients). The patients with hypermotor seizures also showed automatisms, head turning and unresponsiveness. The other 4 patients had typical manifestations of temporal complex partial seizures: gradual onset with staring, unresponsiveness, oralimentary or limb automatisms, hand posturing and head turning. In the four patients with hypermotor seizures, ictal EEG demonstrated 4?5 Hz theta activity in the anterior temporal region then spread to the inferomesial temporal region, while the other 4 patients had initial rhythmic theta in the inferomesial temporal region. All eight patients underwent epilepsy surgery. Six patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy. One patient received lateral anterior temporal resection. One patient had a resection of cavernous angioma. Six patients remained seizure free since surgery (follow up range 12?36 months). Conclusions: Hypermotor seizures occur frequently in patients with temporal tip lesions. It is not clear if the hypermotor manifestations reflect temporal tip involvement or spread to the frontal lobe through the uncinate fasciculus. A search for temporal tip pathology is recommended for patients with hypermotor seizures and temporal epileptiform discharges. 1 Kevin J. Weatherwax, 1 Ron D. Chervin, 1 Linda Selwa, 1 Rosanna Wedal, and 2 Beth A. Malow ( 1 Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ; and 2 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: OSA commonly coexists with epilepsy, and its treatment may improve seizure control and daytime sleepiness. The frequency of OSA in epilepsy may be as high as 33% (Malow et al., Neurology 1997), which is higher than that reported for the general population. The mechanisms whereby OSA exacerbates seizures are unclear. Processes that fragment sleep may facilitate nocturnal (sleep-related) seizures. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with sleep-related seizures are at higher risk for OSA. Methods: Adult patients with epilepsy completed a survey about their sleep and seizures. The survey included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ), which has been validated as a screening instrument for OSA in epilepsy patients (Weatherwax et al., Sleep Medicine 2003). Surveys were completed during a visit to the adult neurology clinic or during long-term monitoring in the epilepsy laboratory at the University of Michigan. Patients were divided into two groups: those with sleep-related seizures (SRS) or awake seizures. Sleep-related seizures were defined by subject report that at least half of their seizures occur during sleep. T-tests were used to compare age, body mass index (BMI), ESS, seizure frequency and SA-SDQ scores between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to examine whether the occurrence of SRS was predicted by the frequency of OSA symptoms and by SA-SDQ scores. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The survey was completed by 1256 patients, including 562 men (44.7%) and 694 (55.3%) women (Table 1). Thirty percent of the patients had SRS. Symptoms of OSA that predicted SRS included loud snoring (p = 0.019); witnessed apnea (p = 0.0001); awakening gasping for breath (p = 0.005) and overall SA-SDQ score (p = 0.03). ESS score was not associated with having SRS (p = 0.111). Conclusions: Epilepsy patients at high risk for OSA, as reflected by loud snoring, witnessed apnea and higher SA-SDQ scores are more likely than other patients to have seizures predominantly during sleep. As SRS tend to occur in lighter stages of sleep (Minecan et al., Sleep 2002), pathological events that facilitate arousals with shifting to a lighter sleep stage, such as obstructive apneas, potentially play an important role in exacerbating SRS in patients with epilepsy. Patients with SRS may merit special consideration in screening for obstructive sleep apnea.

Yerra, 1 Christine Kilpatrick, 3 Marienne Hibbert, 3 Caroline Brand, 1 Zelko Matkovic, and 1,2 Terence O'Brien ( 1 Department of Neurology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; 2 Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 3 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Around 4% of people experience one or more seizures in their lifetime. Only handful of studies examined the issue of first seizure, which presents unique challenges in terms of definitive diagnosis, prognostication and management. First seizure remains a controversial topic, with different studies reporting differing results because of variations in study inclusion criteria, case ascertainment and sample size. This study presents 6-year experience of a dedicated First Seizure Clinic run by epileptologists. Methods: First Seizure Clinic was established in 1999. Patient were referred from general practitioners in the community and emergency and other departments of our hospital. A prospective database of all attendees to the clinic incorporating demographic, clinical, EEG, and neuroimaging data has been maintained since 2000. The data was comprehensively analyzed to define characteristics and outcomes of attendees to the clinic. Results: Data was available for analysis in a total of 415 patients. People with existing diagnosis of epilepsy were excluded. Events were diagnosed as epileptic seizures in 325 (78%), as non-epileptic events in 58 (14%) and as uncertain in 31(8%). Seizures were thought to be provoked in 79 (24%) and unprovoked in 246 (76%). Follow up data was available on 295 patients (89%) with median follow up of 175 days (25th-75th percentile: 87?707 days) for all attendees to the clinic, and 244 (87?497) for those with epileptic seizure at presentation. Of patients with an unprovoked seizure, 64 (26%) had recurrent seizures. Median number of days to recurrent seizure was 227 (91?489). A lower recurrence rate was seen in patients with provoked seizure, 12 of 79 (15.1%, p = 0.049; Fisher exact test, one tailed). Conclusions: At least a quarter of patients will have further seizures following presentation with first epileptic seizure. Seizure recurrence is less following provoked seizure. The data should provide useful information to the clinicians in counseling such patients.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of traumatic spino-pelvic dissociation (TSD) treated with modified bilateral triangular fixation. Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com

AB  - 1 Koichi Akaike, 2 Shigeya Tanaka, 3 Shin-Ichi Imamura, 1 Motofumi Kasugai, 1 Hideyuki Matsukubo, 1 Hideshi Tojo, and 1 Akira Sano ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, Field of Social and Behavioral Medicine, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ; 2 Neurosurgery, Tanaka Neurosurgical Clinic, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, Japan ) Rationale: Gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl) cyclohexane acetic acid) is used clinically to treat partial as well as generalized seizures. While various experimental studies have investigated the effects of gabapentin in animal models of epilepsy, the precise mechanism of action of gabapentin against limbic seizures remains unclear. We therefore studied the efficacy of gabapentin during limbic status epilepticus induced by microinjection of kainic acid (KA) into the amygdala. Methods: Fourteen male Wistar rats (250 to 300 g) were prepared for experiments by a stereotactic operation performed with intraperitoneal pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg). A stainless steel screw was placed in contact with the dura overlying the left sensorimotor cortex (LCx). An additional screw was placed in the frontal sinus as a reference electrode. For microinjection, a stainless steel cannula with an inner needle guide was inserted into the left basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). Bipolar depth electrodes were placed in the LA and the left dorsal hippocampus (LH). Seven days after the operation, 1.0 microg of KA was injected into the LA (n = 8; KA group). In the control groups, 1.0 microl of PBS was injected into LA (n = 6). In the KA group, 120 minutes after KA injection, while rats were exhibiting limbic status epilepticus, gabapentin was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 100 mg/kg. All rats were observed electrophysiologically and behaviorally over 7 days. The spike amplitude were measured in all records and values were expressed as persentage of controls. Results: On the EEG in KA-injected rats, multiple spike discharges initially appeared in the LA 10 to 20 min after KA injection, and rapidly propagated to the LdH. Sixty minutes after KA injection, the seizure involved the LCx and resulted in limbic status epilepticus. Behaviorally, the rats showed bilateral facial twitching, mastication, and salivation. Ten to twenty minutes after gabapentin administration, the seizures in the LCx were selectively suppressed (spike amplitude; 10% of controls). The seizures in LA and LH also reduced (spike amplitude; approximately 30?50% of controls) In addition, behavioral seizure manifestations disappeared. In controls, the severe seizures continued. Conclusions: These results suggested that gabapentin suppresses secondary generalization of limbic seizures by a direct effect on the cerebral cortex. (Supported by Pfizer.) 1 Gregory N. Barnes, 1 Xiaoji Zhang, 1 YanFang Li, 2 George M. Smith, and 3 Patricia E. Schauwecker ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN ; 2 Physiology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY ; and 3 Cell and Neurobiology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Molecular determinants which modify activity synaptogenesis may form the core mechanistic components of cortical reorganization after brain injury. Semaphorin 3F (Sema 3F) signaling has been identified as a putative molecular determinant of activity dependent synaptogenesis in the mouse kainic acid model of epileptogenesis. The Sema 3F receptor is a multi-subunit complex composed of at least two proteins, Plexin A3, and Neuropilin 2 (NPN2). Methods: The activity dependent regulation and structure of the mouse NPN2 promoter is detailed here. Results: We have identified a 1.7 kb putative NPN2 promoter from the FVB/NJ (epileptogenic sensitive) and C57BL/6J (epileptogenic resistant strain) mouse strains. The distinct NPN2 promoters, in addition to common putative transcription factor binding sites, have six different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that specify distinct putative transcription factor binding sites. The FVB/NJ NPN2 promoter has distinct activity dependent methylation sites, whereas these are absent in the C57BL/6J promoter. When the FVB/NJ nucleotide is substituted for C57BL/6J nucleotide, at least two sites, SNP site 2, and SNP site 6, reduce the activity of the C57BL/6J NPN2 promoter by 90%. These putative strain specific-enhancer sites may explain why NPN2 transcription is maintained in C57BL/6J hippocampal neurons but not FVB/NJ hippocampal neurons after kainic acid status epilepticus (KA-SE). In addition to regulation of the NPN2 transcription by glutamate receptors, we also report the NPN2 promoter may be regulated by reactive oxygen species. We have also determined the sequence of the human NPN2 promoter contains important SNPs distinguishing temporal lobe epilepsy patients from controls, which might be a biomarker or perhaps a causal factor in epilepsy. Promoter activity is an important determinant of NPN2 mRNA levels and thus sema 3F signaling; selective deletion of Sema 3F in the mature forebrain greatly facilitates epileptogenesis via PTZ kindling. Conclusions: This data provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that distinct alleles of synaptic plasticity genes may confer susceptibility for acquired epilepsy after brain injury.

Anderson ( 1 Deptartment of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ; 2 Pediatrics ; and 3 Division of Neuroscience ) Rationale: Kv4.2 subunits are thought to compose hippocampal A-type K+ channels, which regulate dendritic excitability in hippocampus. ERK activation via PKA and PKC downregulates dendritic A-type K+ currents and is associated with an increase in post-synaptic excitability. Direct ERK phosphorylation of Kv4.2 channel proteins is a candidate mechanism for this effect. We previously demonstrated a dramatic increase in ERK activation and phosphorylation of Kv4.2 acutely following kainate seizures. In the studies presented here we characterize the cellular localization of ERK activation and Kv4.2 regulation in hippocampus during status epilepticus (SE). Methods: Seizures were induced in adult rats by kainate (KA) (15 mg/kg IP). Seizure activity was monitored and scored based on the Racine Scale. After 1-hr of SE animals were sacrificed for biochemical and molecular studies using whole cell homogenates, cellular membranes and synaptosomal preparations. Results: Studies using hippocampal membrane preparations showed an increase in ERK-phosphorylated Kv4.2 (p < 0.05) while total Kv4.2 remained unchanged acutely following kainate-induced SE. This increase in Kv4.2 phosphorylation with SE was accompanied by increased ERK activation (p < 0.05) without a change in total ERK in membrane preparations. In parallel, using hippocampal synaptosomal preparations, we found increased ERK-phosphorylated Kv4.2 (p < 0.05) and ERK activation (p < 0.05) following SE. Intriguingly, levels of total Kv4.2 were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the synaptosomal preparations following acute SE. During this same time period, total ERK remained unchanged in the synaptosomal preparations. Studies are underway to evaluate the time-course of these changes in total Kv4.2 regulation and ERK signaling following convulsant stimulation. Conclusions: Our results reveal an increase in ERK-phosphorylated Kv4.2 channels and a decrease in total Kv4.2 proteins in the synaptosomal cellular compartment. The net effect of these changes is predicted to lead to an overall increase in hippocampal excitability during status epilepticus.

Benassi, 1 Jerome Engel Jr., and 1 Anatol Bragin ( 1 Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Neurology, Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; and Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Recently we have described the presence of pathological high frequency oscillations in the kainic acid rat model of epilepsy. These oscillations, which may be a marker of progressive epileptogenesis, appear to reflect changes in neuronal network excitability associated with an initial precipitating event that may lead to chronic epilepsy. The goal of these studies was to investigate (1) the existence of similar patterns in mice after pilocarpine (PILO) induced status epilepticus (SE) and (2) the neuronal substrates of such oscillations. Methods: C57B6/J adult mice (15?25g) were subjected to electrophysiological recordings under urethane anesthesia (1.5g/kg) between 1 and 3 weeks after PILO (320 mg/kg, s.c.) induced SE. Simultaneously, extracellular unit activity was recorded by a glass pipette (15?25MΩ) and local field potentials were recorded by a 20-?m tungsten microelectrodes placed ≤500?m from the tip of the glass microelectrode. Juxtacellular labeling was performed according to the protocol described by Pinault (1996). After completion of electrophysiological experiments, brains were sliced and sections processed for peroxidase-based neurobiotin visualization used for morphological reconstructions. Cross-correlation analysis between unit activity and local field potentials and power spectral analysis were performed using Datapac (Mission Viejo, CA) software. Results: Similar to electrographic patterns observed in the kainic acid-treated rats, PILO-treated mice had interictal epileptiform events (IEE) with and without high frequency signals (100?500 Hz) and electrographic (EEG) seizures. Power spectral analysis of interictal local field potentials indicated the existence of activity with peaks at 2.0, 5.0?7.0 and 10?40 Hz. Two interneurons, one pyramidal and two granular cells were identified using juxtacellular labeling. One granular cell had no spontaneous activity, but discharged exclusively during epileptiform activity. During seizures, the discharge rate of the hilar interneuron increased to 0.59/sec from a baseline of 0.26/sec. The frequency of discharges of remaining cells (one CA1 interneuron, one pyramidal and one granular cells) was not affected either by the IEE or EEG seizures. Conclusions: During the early stage of epileptogenesis, the electrographic EEG patterns and spectral frequency characteristics of interictal and ictal discharges are similar between kainic-treated rats and PILO-treated mice. Simultaneous extracellular unit and field potential recording, combined with juxtacellular labeling, may identify neuronal mechanisms of progressive epileptogenesis in a mouse model of chronic epilepsy.

Essley ( 1 Center for Anesthesiology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Medical Affairs, UCB, Inc., Smyrna, GA ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug indicated for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults and children age 4 and older, which exhibits good tolerance and no known drug interactions. In addition to its antiepileptic effects, LEV has also been shown to possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain. While the molecular mechanisms of LEV's action are not fully known, it is known to interact with a specific binding site, synaptic vesicle protein 2A, which is a critical component in the neurotransmitter release process. Intracellular Ca2+ plays a major role in a variety of neuronal functions including excitability and neurotransmission. LEV has been shown to reduce Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors from the intracellular stores of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we investigated the effects of LEV on Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor (RyR), which is a Ca2+-regulated Ca2+ release channel in the ER, in sensory neurons of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Methods: All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Freshly dissociated lumbar DRG sensory neurons (L1-L6) from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were measured using the fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura-2. Caffeine (5 mM) was used to stimulate Ca2+ release through the RyR. LEV was used at a final concentration of 100 ?M. Results: In the presence of 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, stimulation of sensory neurons with caffeine elicited two types of responses. Small diameter, capsaicin-sensitive neurons showed a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca2+: an initial rapid rise (peak) due to release of Ca2+ from the ER, followed by a sustained Ca2+ rise due to Ca2+ entry through the capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) pathway. Large diameter neurons showed only a rapid but transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ due to ER Ca2+ release. Extracellular application of LEV did not elicit any changes in intracellular Ca2+ in either type of neurons. However, pretreatment of cells with LEV resulted in inhibition of caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses in both types of neurons. In small neurons, LEV reduced the peak Ca2+ response by 27% and the sustained Ca2+ response by 32%. In large neurons, LEV reduced the caffeine-induced Ca2+ response by 35%. These effects are similar to the inhibitory effects of the general anesthetic drug propofol, which also exhibits anti-epileptic activity. The mechanism(s) by which LEV exerts its effects on RyR-mediated Ca2+ signaling is not known, however, these effects are also mimicked by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the antiepileptic drug LEV inhibits intracellular Ca2+ signaling mediated by RyR and CCE pathways in sensory neurons. The LEV-mediated regulation of Ca2+ signaling is similar to that mediated by PKC. (Supported by American Heart Association (National Center).) 1 Robert E. Blair, 2 Katherine W. Falenski, 2 Billy R. Martin, and 1,2 Robert J. DeLorenzo ( 1 Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA ; and 2 Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is believed to be a primary mechanism underlying seizure discharge. Endocannabinoids in the brain have been shown to operate as retrograde modulators of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal transmission through activation of the presynaptic cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). Studies from our laboratory have shown that exogenous cannabinoids infer CB1-dependent anticonvulsant activity in both in vivo and in vitro models of seizure and epilepsy (Blair et al., 2006, JPET, 317(3),1072?78; Wallace et al., 2003, JPET, 307(1), 129?37), and that the endocannabinoid system acts to tonically regulate epileptic seizure discharge through CB1 activation. Furthermore, we have observed a permanent redistribution of CB1 protein expression throughout the hippocampal formation in the rat pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of acquired epilepsy. This study was carried out to determine if the reorganization of the CB1 in the epileptic hippocampus acts to redirect the role of the endocannabinoid system towards regulating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Methods: The rat pilocarpine-induced SE model of acquired epilepsy was utilized for this study. Epileptic and control animals were anesthetized and the brains were perfusion-fixed transcardially. Brain cryosections were made and processed for immunofluorescent co-localization analysis using antibodies specific for the CB1 and markers for excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter 1: VGLUT1) and inhibitory (vesicular GABA transporter: VGAT) terminals. Results: When compared to control, CB1 immunostaining was increased in epileptic hippocampus in the stratum oriens and radiatum throughout the CA1-CA3 molecular regions that co-localized with VGLUT1-positive glutamatergic terminals. In the CA1-CA2 stratum pyramidale layer highly enriched with VGAT-positive GABAergic terminals, CB1 immunostaining was dramatically decreased in epileptic hippocampus as compared to controls. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that pilocarpine-induced SE, with subsequent development of epilepsy, causes a redistribution of CB1 expression as indicated by both an increase at glutamatergic and decrease at GABAergic terminals. Such a reorganization of the CB1-dependent endocannabinoid pathway throughout the hippocampus would act to suppress excitatory and increase inhibitory synaptic transmission in the epileptic phenotype and may underlie the anticonvulsant properties of cannabinoids in this model.

Pulse, and 1 Karin Borges ( 1 Pharmaceutical Sciences, Texas Tech University Health Science Center, Amarillo, TX ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, low-protein diet that is anticonvulsant in drug-resistant epileptic children. Furthermore, it is anticonvulsive and neuroprotective in experimental brain injury in rodents, although its mechanism of action is still unknown. Our hypothesis is that the ketogenic diet leads to changes of brain metabolism and neurotransmitter levels reflected in the chemical composition of the extracellular fluid in the brain. Methods: Three week-old C3Heb/Fe mice (Jackson Labs) were fed the ketogenic diet (Harlan-Teklad TD.06233) or control diet (TD.06232) with matched amounts of minerals and vitamins ad lib for 2?4 weeks. The latency to flurothyl-induced seizures was measured after 3 weeks of feeding. We are using in vivo microdialysis to measure metabolic intermediates and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of mice on the different diets. The CMA 600 microanalyser is used to measure glucose, lactate and glutamate. Results: Weight gain of both groups was similar, but mice on the ketogenic diet had significantly higher serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels than control mice (2.7-fold, n = 10 mice each, p < 0.05). Latency to flurothyl-induced tonic seizures was significantly increased (10%) by the ketogenic diet (n = 10 mice each, p < 0.05). Preliminary microdialysis data suggests that the glucose/lactate ratio in the brain extracellular fluid is altered significantly in ketotic mice (p < 0.05 unpaired two-sided t-test). Mice on the control diet showed a glucose/lactate ratio of 1.5 ± 0.2 (mean ± standard deviation; n = 3), whereas ketogenic mice had a ratio of 3.4 ± 0.7 (n = 3). We are in the process to measure the absolute concentrations of glucose, lactate and glutamate in the brain extracellular fluid by microdialysis using the zero-flow method. Conclusions: In summary, our preliminary data indicate that brain energy metabolism is altered in mice on the ketogenic diet, which may contribute to protecting the brain from seizures and brain damage.

Buckmaster ( 1 Comparative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA ; and 2 Neurology  n = 9) or those with high firing rate (>5 Hz) and narrow spikewidth (<250 ?sec) that were tonically active (putative interneurons; n = 7). Action potential frequencies were plotted relative to seizure onset, binned (bin width = 10 sec) and compared to baseline levels using a repeated-measures ANOVA (p = 0.05). Results: No significant differences were observed between baseline and preictal action potential frequency in granule cells (2.7 ± 0.7 Hz baseline vs. 2.7 ± 1.0 Hz preictal, ANOVA, p = 0.958) or interneurons (10.6 ± 2.5 Hz vs. 11.9 ± 2.1 Hz, p = 0.665). Conclusions: The lack of significant changes in action potential frequency in either granule cells or interneurons during the preictal period suggests that seizures in Mongolian gerbils are not initiated by disinhibition in dentate gyrus. These preliminary results do not reject the possibility that disinhibition plays a role in seizure initiation in other brain structures. They do, however, show the utility of recording multiple, single neurons in vivo for testing hypotheses of ictal transition by identifying activity changes in specific neuron classes with respect to spontaneous seizure onset.

Bender, 2 Mira Kuisle, 4 Didier Pinault, 3 Ryuichi Shigemoto, 2 Luthi Anita, and 1 Tallie Z. Baram ( 1 Pediatrics  2 Pharmacology  3 Division of Cerebral Structure, National Institute of Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan ; and 4 Physiopathologie Clinique et Experimentaler de la Schizophrenie, Faculte de Medecine, Strasbourg, France ) Rationale: (Ih), the current carried by the HCN channels, contributes to neuronal membrane properties and network integration. Thalamic HCN channels participate in thalamocortical oscillations that are involved in sleep and have been implicated in absence epilepsies (Di Pasquale et al., 1997; Strauss et al., 2004; Budde et al., 2005). In both thalamus (absence) and hippocampus (febrile seizure-related limbic epilepsy), the epilepsies associated with HCN channel dysfunction commence during development. This suggests that disrupted developmental regulation of thalamic HCN channel expression may contribute to the process of initiation of these epilepsies. Therefore, we studied the developmental expression patterns of HCN channels in thalamus, and probed the role of these channels in an established model of absence epilepsy, the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). Methods: We used in situ hybridization (quantitative and single-cell resolution) to investigate the thalamic expression of HCN channel isoforms 1, 2 and 4 in Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal days (P) 2, 7, 11, 18 and 60, as well as in adult GAERS rats and age/strain matched controls. The developmental studies were augmented by immunocytochemistry. Results: (1) HCN1, 2 and 4 isoforms were expressed in distinct patterns in thalamus as early as P2. The HCN1 isoform resided primarily in thalamic nuclei that inter-connect with limbic regions (e.g., anterodorsal, lateral posterior). In contrast, HCN2 channels were robustly expressed in nuclei of the ventral group that relay somatosensory input to cortex (e.g., ventral posteromedial; VPm). HCN2, but not HCN4, was found in reticular nucleus (Rtn). In general, expression patterns in immature thalamus were similar to those in adults. (2) Levels of HCN2 and 4 isoforms did not distinguish GAERS rats from controls. However, HCN1 mRNA levels were strongly increased in the VPm (58%) and Rtn (28%). (3) Consistent with the increased contribution of HCN1 to the molecular make-up of thalamic Ih in the GAERS, the h-current in these rats was much less sensitive to non-saturating levels of cAMP, influencing thalamocortical oscillations (Kuisle et al., 2006). Conclusions: (1) Nucleus-specific expression patterns of thalamic HCN isoforms are established early postnatally, consistent with a key role for these channels in fundamental functions of the thalamocortical network (2) Increased expression of HCN1 channels in GAERS rats is associated with Ih dysfunction that may contribute to their epileptic phenotype.

Methods: Using the isolated intact hippocampus of the immature mouse, we characterized hypoglycemic seizures in vitro during transient hypoglycemia, and their effects on synaptic transmission, neuronal morphology and hippocampal glycogen content. Results: Hypoglycemic seizures occurred less frequently with increasing extracellular glucose concentration. The irreversible loss of synaptic transmission, however, was only dependant on the occurrence of hypoglycemic seizure activity, irrespective of glucose concentration. Comparatively, no hypoglycemic seizures were generated in the isolated neocortical block during transient hypoglycemia, and the loss of synaptic transmission was reversible. Similar spontaneous seizure-like activity in the hippocampus was produced by the glycolysis inhibitor iodoacetate, and 500 ?M L-aspartate but not by hypoxia. Hypoglycemic seizure activity was abolished by NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists. The clinical anticonvulsant midazolam, but not phenytoin or valproate also abolished hypoglycemic seizures. In both cases, the prevention of hypoglycemic seizures led to the maintenance of synaptic transmission. Non-glycolytic, oxidative substrates attenuated hypoglycemic seizure activity, without supporting synaptic transmission, even in the presence of adenosine antagonist DPCPX. Methods used to abolish or significantly decrease hypoglycemic seizure activity led to the protection against glycogen depletion and a decrease in cell damage. Conclusions: These data suggest that suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability during hypoglycemia decreases subsequent neuronal damage.

General Hospital, Boston, MA ; 2 Inst. for Psych., Hungarian Acad. of Sci., Budapest, Hungary ; 3 New York University Medical Center, NY, NY ; 4 Brigham  5 Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 6 University of CA, San Diego, CA ) Rationale: With limited available in vivo microphysiology, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of focal seizures in humans remain unclear. Yet this type of detailed information is important in the design of new therapeutic approaches to epilepsy. To more completely characterize the physiological evolution of seizures and how neuronal populations contribute to the development and spread of synchrony we recorded interictal and ictal activity in epileptic patients using intracortical linear microelectrode arrays, depth and subdural grid macroelectrodes. Methods: Microelectrode arrays measure potential gradient (PG), current source density (CSD) and multi-unit activity (MUA) from a restricted region of cortex ?300 ?m in diameter. These parameters, when combined, present a view of active microcircuitry during a given event. This information is complemented by macroelectrodes which provide contextual information about widespread cortical activity. We analyzed interictal discharges and 13 seizures from 7 patients who were undergoing intracranial investigation for intractable temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy of different etiologies including mesial temporal sclerosis, dysplasias, tumors and structural lesions. Results: Microelectrode recordings of some ictal events showed similarities to the PG, CSD and MUA profiles of interictal events. During most seizures, however, there was a progression in this profile suggesting changes in the cellular substrates underlying ictal spike generation. In particular, large amplitude burst discharges toward the seizure's end involved more robust participation of deeper cortical layers and greater population neuronal firing. Seizures also exhibited differing phase characteristics during their evolution: trains of ictal discharges recorded either from two laminar microelectrode arrays or from different points on the subdural grid showed phase locking during some epochs in the seizure but were phase variable at others. Likewise, interictal events often showed inconsistent onsets and spread patterns. Conclusions: These results lead us to speculate that network synchrony is achieved and then spreads by different modes during focal seizures in humans; epileptiform activity is generated not from a single cellular source but from different micro-circuitry networks and propagation relies on a variety of pathways. Furthermore, it is likely that both local and distributed processes interact to shape the overall spatio-temporal evolution and synchronization features of the seizure. This type of in vivo data may influence future designs of surgical procedures and brain stimulation paradigms. (Supported by NIH, AES, Grass Foundation.) 1 James W. Chen ( 1 Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: It has been established that optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging correlates well with seizure activity. In this study, we obtained high-spatial-resolution images of normalized oxy-hemoglobin (Hb), deoxy-Hb, total Hb, oxygen saturation and oxygen-consumed maps of acute neocortical seizures in rats by using spectral images recorded simultaneously at multiple wavelengths. Methods: In 17 Spraque-Dawley rats, surgery and OIS imaging were performed under general anesthesia in a thinned skull preparation. OIS images were obtained with two CCD cameras with combination of two optical filters among 852, 780, 610 and 568 nm. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in real time with multiple depth electrodes or Michigan 16-channel electrodes in the somatosensory cortex. OIS spectral images were synchronously recorded with EEG. Acute seizures were induced by penicillin applied topically. Images of oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, total Hb, oxygen saturation, oxygen-consumed and scattering maps were obtained by performing the following sequential numerical steps:1) ratio analysis, 2) image transformation and co-registration, 3) pixel-by-pixel calculation of normalized oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, total Hb, oxygen saturation and oxygen consumed using the Beer-Lambert law, 4) reconstruct normalized images. Results: High-spatial-resolution normalized images of oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, total Hb, oxygen saturation and oxygen-consumed maps were reconstructed to study seizure induction and propagation. It was noted that before or at seizure onset, the concentration of deoxy-Hb transiently increases, in both parenchyma (?0.03%) and venous space (?0.06%). After that, it was quickly followed by increases of oxy-Hb in the parenchyma (?0.03%) and venous space (?0.06%). Conclusions: By obtaining OIS spectral images of multiple wavelengths simultaneously, normalized high-spatial-resolution maps of oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, total-Hb and oxygen saturation could be reconstructed. Based on these maps, changes of oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb and total-Hb could be reviewed with information of the anatomical structures. These maps showed initial increase of deoxy-Hb transiently in both parenchyma and venous space before seizure onset.

Although the significance of abnormal plasticity, such as cell genesis has been described in the hippocampus after seizures, little data so far ascertained the preventive strategies in epilepsy. We have tried to discover desirable drugs to rectify the abnormal plasticity for clinical use. Erythropoietin (EPO), recently known as cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory agent, and neurogenic modulator, may constitute an effective therapeutic modality in cases of epileptic insult. However, there is no study for the effects of exogenous EPO on the epileptogenic process. Methods: In this study, we examined the effects of EPO in the epileptic rats with lithium/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE), in terms of neuronal loss, inflammation, and cell proliferation . Results: The neuronal death, inflammation, and cell genesis was substantially linked together in more extensive areas, notably in entorhinal, perirhinal, piriform cortex, amygdala and parts of the thalamus as well as the hippocampus. The EPO receptor (EPOR) mRNA level was increased in the first week after SE, and decreased thereafter. EPOR was increased in the damaged areas such as hilus and CA1 subfield. During the latent period after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, EPO prevented neuronal death and microglia activation in these areas, and inhibited the generation of ectopic granule cells in the hilus and new glia in CA1. Conclusions: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for EPO in chronic epilepsy. Currently, we are trying to disclose the agents potentially conferring anti-epileptogenesis in a variety of epilepsy models, including febrile convulsion and neocortical epilepsy.

Moshé ( 1 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY ; 2 Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY ; and 3 Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY ) Rationale: The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) plays an important role in seizure control. There has been evidence that impairment of tonic GABA current may contribute to the development of generalized epilepsy in humans. We have found that the delta subunit, an important component of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors mediating tonic current, is present in the SNR and its expression significantly decreases with age in male and female rats. Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine whether tonic GABA current is present in GABAergic neurons and whether its magnitude changes with age. Furthermore, we studied alterations in phasic GABA inhibition as a function of age and sex. Methods: We studied two groups of Sprague-Dawley male and female rats at postnatal days (P) 10?15 and older than P22. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from electrophysiologically identified nigral GABAergic cells in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX). Gabazine 500 nM was applied to inhibit GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). GABAA tonic current was revealed by bath-applied bicuculline 100 uM and was measured as the change in baseline current before and after bicuculline. IPSCs were analyzed before TTX and gabazine were applied. Results: The tonic GABA current was present in GABAergic neurons in younger rats, however it was significantly lower in older animals. On the contrary, frequency and amplitude of phasic GABA inhibition was higher after P22 compared with younger rats. We did not find significant differences between sexes in either parameter. Conclusions: The tonic GABA current can be revealed in GABAergic SNR neurons. Although there is no apparent difference between males and females, the magnitude of tonic GABA inhibition significantly decreases with age. These findings can be explained by the age-related decrease in delta subunit expression in SNR neurons and the absence of sex differences in its expression. On the other hand, phasic GABA inhibition prevails later in development probably reflecting more dense synaptic connections onto GABAergic neurons or increased expression of synaptic GABAA receptors. Given the importance of SNR GABAergic neurons in seizure control, these findings could facilitate treatment of epilepsy based on the maturational state of the brain.

Hewett ( 1 Neuroscience, UConn Health Center, Farmington, CT ) Rationale: IL-1 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine with neuromodulatory functions within the central nervous system. IL-1 signal transduction is mediated by the type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed by neurons in the primary cell layers of the hippocampus. Using mice lacking IL-1R1, the hypothesis that endogenous IL-1 contributes to neuroplasticity associated with PTZ-induced kindling, a model of epileptogenesis, was tested herein. Methods: Homozygous male C57BL/6 mice (8?10 weeks) lacking a functional IL-1RI gene or wild-type controls were bred at the UCHC and acclimatized to handling stress for one week prior to use. A PTZ dose-response relationship was performed to determine the effect of IL-1RI deletion on acute convulsant activity of PTZ. Kindling was induced by a once daily administration of a subconvulsive dose of PTZ. All mice were monitored for 15 min following PTZ administration and scored for seizure severity using an established seizure severity scale (Stages 0?4). The latency (time to onset) of a generalized convulsive seizure (Stage 3?4) was also measured. Mice were considered kindled after exhibiting ≥ 4 consecutive Stage 3?4 seizures. Results: PTZ induced kindling in wild-type C57BL/6 mice in a dose-dependent manner. After 18 days (i.e., 18 doses of PTZ), 40 and 57% of mice subjected to daily doses of 20 or 24 mg/kg PTZ, respectively, had become kindled. In stark contrast, IL-1RI null mice, treated in parallel, did not become sensitized to the convulsant properties of PTZ (0% kindled at either 20 or 24 mg/kg PTZ after 18 days). To determine if the inability of IL-1RI null mice to kindle was due to decreased sensitivity to PTZ, the dose-response relationship to acute PTZ-induced seizures was determined. Compared to controls, IL-1RI null mice were less sensitive to acute PTZ-induced seizures, as indicated by a rightward shift in the acute convulsive response between 20?58 mg/kg PTZ. For example, 36 mg/kg PTZ elicited a mean seizure score of 2.9 ± 0.3 in control mice but only 1.1 ± 0.1 in the IL-1RI null mice. Further, IL1-R1 null mice showed an increased latency to a seizure elicited by 50 mg/kg PTZ, a dose that resulted in generalized convulsions in both mouse strains. Time to onset was 138 ± 23 and 336 ± 60 sec for control and IL-1RI null mice, respectively. To determine if kindling could be achieved in IL1-R1 null mutants, these mice were administered once daily doses of 31 mg/kg PTZ. This dosing paradigm induced kindling in IL-1RI null mice that resembled kindling induced in control mice with 24 mg/kg PTZ. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that IL-1RI null mice are less prone to PTZ-induced kindling. This is likely due to a reduction in the sensitivity of these mice to PTZ and not to an inability to kindle. These findings suggest that endogenous IL-1 facilitates PTZ-induced kindling by decreasing the PTZ seizure threshold.

Seizures initiate as the inhibitory cells enter a transient state of depolarization block. The origin of this layer specific blockade of cellular spiking activity is unknown, but it shares physiologal similarity with hypoxic depolarization block. We present measurements with extremely high spatially resolutions utilizing nanoscale optical probes, PEBBLES (Barker et al., (1998) Anal. Chem) as well as measurements from optically active oxygen sensing whole-cell mircoelectrodes. Methods: Two probes were used in these experiments. In the first case we have developed a technique to use a combination of electrical current and pressure to drive small nanoscale oxygen sensitive probes, or PEBBLES, into the extracellular space of the brain slices. In addition we coat the tip of a microelectrode with a mixture of fluorescent dyes which permit the measurement of local tissue oxygen pressure simultaneous with extracellular or intracellular electrical potential. A ratiometric dye cocktail is made by dissolving the following components, PVC ? Poly(vinyl chloride), DOS ? Bis (2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, PtOEPKt ? Pt(II) Octaethylporphine Ketone and BODIPY 577/618 in the solvent THF ? tetrahydrofuran. Borosilicate glass micropipettes (3?7 MW) are dipped in the above cocktail, calibrated and inserted into tissue. Light from a metal hallide light passes through a 580 nm excitation filter, and is directed towards the sample using a 590 nm dichroic mirror. The fluorescence light is filtered alternatively at 620 nm and 760 nm to image the BODIPY and PtoEPKt-Pt(II) respectively. Results: Intracellular electrical measurements reveal interleaving activity between excitatory cells in the st. pyramidale and inhibitory cells in the st. oriens. We recently presented simultaneous measurement of extracellular electrical activity and quantitative oxygen measurement on the level of microdomains within neural tissue. We have further refined this technique to measure simultaneous whole-cell electrical recordings with local oxygen measurements. Optical measurements using both small nanoscale PEBBLES as well as optodes display an increase in intensity during the seizure which corresponds to a decrease in the local oxygen pressure. Conclusions: We utilized nanoscale probes, PEBBLES, to measure the oxygen pressure across different strata in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus during 4-AP induced seizures allowing a detailed investigation of the role that oxygen plays on the level of microdomains of cortical layers or even near single cells in the formation and termination of seizures.

Kondratyev ( 1 Pharmacology, Georgetown Univ, Wash, DC ; 2 Pediatrics ; and 3 Interdisc Program in Neurosci ) Rationale: Continuous seizures or status epilepticus (SE) endanger vulnerable neurons, with prolonged durations causing cell death. Seizure-evoked oxidative damage, including DNA damage, can contribute to this injury (Crowe et al., AES, 2005), but the threshold duration of seizures to induce DNA damage is not known, nor do we know if DNA damage occurs after seizure durations not causing cell death. Because phosphorylation occurs at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), DSBs can be quantified by measuring phosphorylated histone H2AX (?-H2AX). We examined ?-H2AX in specific brain regions after seizure durations subthreshold for causing neuronal death. Methods: Four seizure conditions were studied: 1) acute repeated minimal electroshock seizures (ECS); 2) 30 min of kainic acid (KA)-evoked brief intermittent seizures (prior to the onset of SE); 3) 5 min of continuous seizure (SE) induced by KA; and 4) 120 min of KA-evoked SE in rats pre-exposed to a neuroprotective regimen of ECS for 7 days. Seizures induced by KA (12.5 mg/kg, ip) were terminated with diazepam (30 mg/kg, ip). ECS (200ms, 22?28mA) induced 5?10 sec limbic seizures. A single (acute) ECS session consisted of 3 ECS at 30 min intervals; chronic ECS consisted of daily sessions for 7d. Rats were perfused after seizure termination; brains were cryosectioned for ?-H2AX immunohistochemistry. Results: Neither acute nor chronic ECS changed ?-H2AX immediately or 24h after the last seizure. KA-evoked intermittent seizures (5?7 brief seizures in the first 30 min) caused significant increases in ?-H2AX in neurons in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (hilus and granule cells), amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. Even greater increases were seen following 5 min of SE, although in most areas (except for dentate granule cells) this was not as great as that obtained after 120 min of SE. With ECS preconditioning, the increase in ?-H2AX induced by prolonged (120 min) SE was reduced by at least 80%; the residual increase in ?-H2AX was less than that seen after 5 min SE in rats without preconditioning. Conclusions: Our observation that ?-H2AX increased after seizures that did not cause significant cell death indicates that DSBs are an early sign of cell endangerment. Moreover, the transient increase in ?-H2AX in death-resistant cells (dentate granule cells) suggests that rapid activation of repair processes may contribute to the resistance of these neurons to seizure-evoked injury. Because a single cluster of 5?7 seizures increased ?-H2AX, whereas acute or chronic ECS did not, it appears that isolated seizures do not induce DSBs and that a minimum seizure density is needed to trigger DNA damage. Our data also suggest that 5 min of SE in seizure-naive animals causes substantial DNA damage in the absence of neuronal loss. Thus, early intervention to terminate SE may be necessary to minimize adverse neurological sequelae that can occur without neurodegeneration.

University, Roma, Italy ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of partial complex seizures in humans. For several years neuroscientists have focused on investigating network and intrinsic properties of the hippocampus proper, and its role in TLE. Recently however, they have been giving more importance to parahippocampal structures, including the subiculum. Subiculum is the closest structure to the hippocampus; it receives inputs from the hippocampus proper and projects to the entorhinal cortex. Methods: The brain was quickly removed from adult rats and cut into slices (450 ?m thickness) that initially included the hippocampus and adjacent enthorinal cortex. The subiculum was further isolated from these slices by cutting out the CA1, dentate gyrus, pre- and para-subiculum and enthorinal cortex. We performed extra- and intracellular recordings from isolated subiculum minislices obtained from both non-epileptic controls (NEC) and pilocarpine-treated rats, which represents an animal model of TLE. Results: In subiculum minislices, application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) induced spontaneous network activity in both NEC (interval of occurrence: 85.71 ± 10.56 s; duration: 0.78 ± 0.06 s; n = 15) and pilocarpine-treated (interval of occurrence: 73.35 ± 8.74 s; duration 0.64 ± 0.01 s; n = 7) animals. Intracellular recordings revealed that subicular cells at resting membrane potential exhibited three different types of spontaneous network activity. In the first group, field activity corresponded intracellulary to an initial hyperpolarization followed by a long-lasting depolarization (LLD). In the second group, the LLD was preceded by an initial depolarization leading to one or more action potentials. Finally, in the third group, an initial burst discharge was found to precede the LLD. In both NEC and pilocarpine-treated tissue, all three types of activity were contributed by GABAA receptors since the activity is markedly reduced by picrotoxin. Comparison of NEC and pilocarpine-treated tissue revealed a difference in the expression of these three types of activity. In NEC, 71.43% of the cells, demonstrated the first situation (n = 10/14); this percentage dropped to 57.14% in pilocarpine-treated animals (n = 4/7). The second situation occurred in 21.43% of NEC (n = 3/14) and in 14.28% of pilocarpine (n = 1/7). The third situation was present only in 7.14% of NEC (n = 1/14) but in 28.57% of pilocarpine-treated rodents (n = 2/7). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that 4-AP induces network-driven events in subicular minislices of both NEC and pilocarpine-treated rats. In addition, subicular cells from epileptic tissue are more likely to exhibit network-driven burst discharges as compared to those from NEC.

Methods: In Denmark, legislature since 2005 enforces, for all drugs including AEDs, delivery by the pharmacy of the cheapest preparation. For AEDs, the bioequivalence range has been set to 90 ? 111% of the original. Bioequivalence is tested by comparison of a single dose of two preparations in a group of healthy volunteers. Frequent changes in price of 7 different generic Lamotrigine preparations expose patients to multiple preparation shifts. Some patients report problems following shifts, sometimes of a serious kind. In view of obtaining sufficiently detailed pharmacokinetic data including Cmax, Cmin, tmax, Cmax/min and Cx, we have started in selected cases to compare daily profiles of the preparations in question. There are no standard methods to establish such profiles. Ideally, blood sampling would have to take place at 30 ? 60 min intervals after drug intake, followed by increasing intervals until the next dose. But compromises are necessary because blood sampling needs to be integrated into daily hospital routine. Another question is the adequate interval between the two comparative profiles. In addition, possible pharmacokinetic interactions with co-medications need to be considered. Results: We present preliminary findings with sampling intervals of three and four hours, and with intervals between profiles of one to three weeks. The three hour schedule appears to provide reasonably informative data, whereas a four hour schedule may fail to detect differences in tmax and carries a risk of rather imprecise Cmax measurements from which other calculations depend. Deviations clearly exceeding the accepted bioequivalence range were observed under realistic clinical conditions, and could confirm and explain reports of both status epilepticus with lower bioavailability, and locomotor ataxia with the consequence of fall, skull fracture and intracranial bleeding with higher bioavailability. The deviations observed in the daily profiles were not necessarily apparent when only morning trough levels were compared. Conclusions: Comparative daily profiles provide differentiated information on the bioequivalence of different LTG preparations. In clinical conditions, deviations outside the accepted bioequivalence range were observed and could explain serious morbidity following preparation shift. For clinical purposes, a 3 hour sampling schedule seems to be adequate. 1 Céline M. Dubé, 1 Amy L. Brewster, 1 Cristina Richichi, 1 Elyzabeth Custodio, and 1 Tallie Z. Baram ( 1 Anatomy  Dubé et al., 2006). The generation of HCN1-deficient mice (HCN1-/-) provides a powerful tool to examine the potential causal role of reduced HCN1 channels in this hippocampal network dysfunction. These studies examined whether immature HCN1-/- mice are more sensitive to seizure provocation and prone to develop spontaneous recurrent seizures as adults. Concurrently, we examined the developmental expression and seizure-evoked regulation of the remaining hippocampal HCN isoforms in these mice. Methods: The threshold temperature required for the onset of a hyperthermic ?febrile? seizure was studied as a measure of hyperexcitability in HCN1-/- mice and wild-type controls. Experimental FS were induced on postnatal day 14 and animals monitored as adults for the emergence of spontaneous seizures using digital video hippocampal EEG recordings. Seizure events were determined according to both EEG (i.e., polyspikes or sharp-waves with amplitude > 200% of background lasting over 6 seconds) and behavioral criteria (i.e, freezing and ?limbic? automatisms). Hippocampal mRNA and protein expression of HCN channel isoforms 1?4 was quantified using in situ hybridization and Western blots. The cellular and subcellular distribution of HCN isoforms was analyzed via immunocytochemistry. Results: Threshold temperatures for experimental FS onset in HCN1-/- mice were significantly higher than those of controls: 41.9 ± 0.2 °C (n = 22) vs 40.7 ± 0.2°C (n = 24) p < 0.0001. These data indicate that HCN1-/- mice are less sensitive to seizure generation. EEGs were normal in all control mice and preliminary data have not yet revealed spontaneous seizures in HCN1-/- mice. Analyses of mRNA and protein expression are ongoing, but preliminary data support an absence of compensatory changes in HCN2 and HCN4 (Nolan et al., 2004). Conclusions: These experiments suggest that global absence of HCN1 channels from all cell types and cellular compartments yields a ?hypoexcitable? network. In addition, they suggest that HCN1 channels contribute to hippocampal network properties in a complex manner that is dependent on the cell type (e.g., interneurons vs principal cells), subcellular compartment and perhaps developmental expression programs.

Noebels ( 1 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ; 2 Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ; and 3 Department of Pharmacology, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ) Rationale: Loss of function mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) have been linked to epilepsy in humans, but the mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability remain unclear. One possibility for this unexpected seizure phenotype is a compensatory dysregulation of other sodium channel subunits expressed in brain. Methods: To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined two VGSC knockout mouse models with spontaneous seizures: one heterozygous for deletion of the Scn2a gene and the other homozygous for knockout of Scn1b. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate on RNA from whole brain and selected brain regions from at least 4 pairs of mutant and wild-type littermate controls to compare transcript levels of all known brain VGSC subunit genes (Scn1a, 2a, 3a, 5a, 8a, and 1b-4b). Results: As expected, in each model we found that the disrupted gene had correspondingly decreased levels of mRNA expression (?65% of wild-type in Scn2aKO/+ and 0% in Scn1bKO/KO mice). In addition, in both models, we found that the expression levels of other VGSC genes did not fall outside of the range of normal biological variation (among wildtype mice on the same strain background) with the exception of Scn5a. This TTX-insensitive VGSC was previously shown in our laboratory to be expressed at low levels in restricted limbic structures of the wild type brain. We found a consistent increase in Scn5a in the B1KO/+ and B1KO/KO mutant whole brain samples, as well as a highly variable increase in the Scn2a KO/+ forebrain samples compared to wildtype littermates. Conclusions: This result demonstrates that deficiency of VGSC alpha and beta subunit genes may lead to dysregulation of other pore forming subunit family members in the developing epileptic brain. These preliminary results in conjunction with cellular resolution analyses may help to define the network contributing to the seizure phenotype in these models.

In the pediatric population, seizure prevalence is estimated at 3?5%, the highest incidence of which is in the first year of life. This is a critical neurodevelopmental epoch and the long-term consequences of these neonatal seizures are not fully known. Thus we sought to determine whether maternal infection alone, or in combination with a neonatal febrile convulsion, affected subsequent seizure susceptibility as well as memory and learning in adults. Methods: Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ?g/kg, i.p.) or saline (sal; control) on gestational day 15 (G15), to mimic a gram-negative bacterial infection. On postnatal day 14 (P14), febrile convulsions (FC) were induced with LPS (200 ?g/kg) and kainic acid (KA; 1.75 mg/kg), which is known to evoke seizures in about 50% of rats at this age. Two months later, all groups were subjected to learning and memory tasks both before and after an adult seizure. One week prior to evocation of an adult seizure with KA (15 mg/kg) rats were subjected to a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. One week after the adult seizure, rats were then tested for learning and memory in a water maze paradigm. Adult seizures were attenuated within 30 minutes of seizure onset with parenteral diazepam (5 mg/kg) to mimic clinical practice. Results: Prenatal LPS exposure resulted in a trend towards increased neonatal seizure susceptibility at P14 compared to saline-treated controls. Further, a subset of animals with a history of prenatal LPS and FCs showed deficits in learned fear to contextual stimuli compared to cohorts of animals with no prenatal LPS and FC. Rats with a history of prenatal inflammation and postnatal FCs showed enhanced susceptibility to seizures as adults, compared to the control condition (no maternal treatment but suffered FCs). Results of the spatial learning water maze task revealed no statistically significant differences between any groups of rats regardless of prenatal treatment or FC outcome, when the KA provoked seizure were attenuated at 30 minutes. Conclusions: In this study, our findings suggest that prenatal LPS in combination with a neonatal FC alters adult seizure threshold as well as impairs memory performance to contextual fear stimuli. The lack of effect of adult seizure (in any group) on water maze testing, when seizures were attenuated, further emphasizes the importance of early seizure intervention.

Faingold, and 1 Srinivasan Tupal ( 1 Pharmacology, Southern Illinois University Sch. Med., Springfield, IL ; and 2 Neurology, Southern Illinois University Sch. Med., Springfield, IL ) Rationale: In response to acoustic stimulation genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPR-9s) exhibit tonic extension audiogenic seizures (AGS). However, with frequent repetitive AGS (audiogenic kindling) seizures increase in duration and an additional behavior, post-tonic clonus (PTC) is induced, which increases in incidence and duration as kindling proceeds. This AGS kindling-induced convulsive behavior change is long-lasting and is considered to be a model of epileptogenesis. Previous studies indicate that plastic changes in the synaptic projection to the lateral nucleus of amygdala (LAMG) are critical in the processes involved in production of PTC. Activation of NMDA receptors in LAMG can transiently cause the emergence of PTC in non-kindled GEPR-9s (NK-GEPR-9s) and conversely, inhibition of NMDA receptors by a NMDA receptor antagonist reversibly blocks PTC in kindled GEPR-9s (K-GEPR-9s). Previous studies of AGS kindling also observed increased expression of an immediate early gene, as indicated by c-fos changes in LAMG. A number of steps in the molecular cascade occur between NMDA receptor activation and c-fos expression, and cAMP is implicated in this cascade. The present study examined whether PTC incidence was altered by focal microinjection into LAMG of agents that alter adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, which is the enzyme responsible for cAMP production. Methods: GEPR-9s (200?400 g) used in the present study all exhibited tonic hindlimb extension. Audiogenic kindling involved once daily presentation of an electric bell (122 dB SPL re: 0.0002 dyne/cm) for a maximum of 60 sec given on 14 consecutive days. Microinjection cannula guides (21G) were implanted stereotaxically above LAMG bilaterally under ketamine/xylazine (100/3 mg/kg) anesthesia, and all rats continued to exhibit tonic AGS one week after implantation. An AC activator forskolin (50?200 ?Mol/side) or an AC inhibitor (SQ22536, 0.5?1.0 nMol/side), was focally microinjected (at 0.5 ?l/min for 2 min) into LAMG bilaterally via an infusion cannulae (26G). The animals were then tested for AGS at 1, 12, 24 and subsequently every 24 hrs and then once a week. Results: Bilateral microinjection of forskolin caused the appearance of PTC in NK-GEPR-9s in response to presentation of the acoustic stimulus with an onset of 12 hr. However, AGS with PTC continued to be observed thereafter for a minimum of 5 weeks after the single microinjection. The AC inhibitor, SQ22536, transiently blocked PTC in K-GEPR-9s with an onset of 1 hr post microinjection. A complete blockade of seizures was observed at 12 hrs subsequent to which the animals gradually recovered to display a tonic hindlimb extension seizure followed by PTC at 120 hr post microinjection. Conclusions: These data indicate a potentially important role of AC activation in the LAMG in the molecular cascade subserving AGS kindling in GEPR-9s, a model of epileptogenesis.

Merlin ( 1 Neurology and Physiology and Pharmacology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY ) Rationale: Activation of metabotropic receptors in the CNS elicits long-lasting effects that may participate in epileptogenesis. Many such receptors are linked to phosphoinositide or phosphatidylcholine metabolism, and the resultant DAG production activates protein kinase C (PKC). We used a phorbol ester to activate PKC to determine its effect on picrotoxin-induced network activities in vitro. Methods: 400 ?m transverse guinea pig hippocampal slices were placed in an interface chamber and intracellular recordings were obtained from CA3 stratum pyramidale. Picrotoxin (50 ?M), a GABAA antagonist, was bath-applied to elicit baseline interictal activity (synchronized discharges < 500 ms long), and changes in burst length were monitored following the application of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Bursts were considered ictaform if they met the following three criteria: (1) unaffected by hyperpolarization, (2) the oscillations within each burst slowed in frequency toward the end of the burst, and (3) length of the burst exceeded 1 s, the presumed minimum length for a clinically-correlated experience to potentially occur if the discharge were expressed in vivo. Data are reported as means ± SE; significance was determined using the Student's t-test, with p < 0.05 deemed significant. Results: As phorbol esters activate second messengers, preincubation for at least 30 min is recommended. Yet within 40?60 min, bath application of 1 ?M PDBu typically increased the length of picrotoxin-induced interictal bursts to ictaform events 2?8 s long (mean peak burst length 5.6 ± 0.5 s; latency to produce 1 s ictal-length burst 48 ± 4 min; n = 7 out of 8 slices); this effect persisted for over 1 hr following washout of PDBu. When PDBu was applied in the presence of 10 ?M chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor, the burst prolongation was either completely prevented (n = 4) or significantly suppressed (peak burst length 2.8 ± 0.7 s; time to ictal-length 68 ± 13 min; n = 6; p < 0.05). Bursts could be blocked by application of either 1 ?M tetrodotoxin (n = 3) or a combination of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists (50 ?M D-AP5 and 20 ?M CNQX, respectively; n = 2), suggesting the discharges were synchronized events; no intrinsic oscillatory activity was uncovered during these manipulations. NMDA antagonist alone could not prevent the induction of these bursts, but did reversibly shorten the length of expressed bursts, as did 25 ?M MPEP, an mGluR5 antagonist. While PDBu has been reported previously to enhance glutamate release, bath application of the glutamate reuptake inhibitor L-trans-2,4-PDC (100?200 ?M) was unable to simulate the response seen with PDBu (n = 2). Application of PDBu in the absence of picrotoxin also elicited burst prolongation, but a higher concentration was necessary to result in a similar peak burst length and time to ictal response (2?10 ?M; n = 4). Conclusions: Generalized PKC activation in the hippocampal slice has powerful excitatory effects on network activity with implications toward epileptogenesis.

Flores, 2 Sebastian Ivens, 2,3 Alon Friedman, and 1,4 Daniela Kaufer ( 1 Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA ; 2 Institute of Neurophysiology, Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany ; 3 Laboratory for Experimental Neurosurgery, Soroka University Medical Center and Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel ; and 4 Department of Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA ) Rationale: Different types of cortical injury such as trauma, ischemia and infection are often accompanied by increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have recently shown that perturbations in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may lead to epileptiform activity in the neocortex. We also demonstrated that serum albumin acts as the epileptogenic factor. Our recent data suggest that the action of serum albumin is mediated via its interactions with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) receptors in astrocytes. Following albumin uptake into astrocytes we show that the glial inward rectifying potassium channel, Kir 4.1, was down regulated which results in reduced buffering of extracellular potassium. This, in turn, leads to activity-dependent accumulation of extracellular potassium, resulting in N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA)-receptor-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity. Methods: In order to elucidate the cascade of transcriptional effects following albumin uptake and the consequent TGF-? receptor activation we evaluated expression levels at different time points following induced permeation of BBB, exposure to albumin, or exposure to TGF-?. Genome scale evaluations using DNA microarrays were carried out in conjunction with gene-specific quantitative RT-PCR of pre-selected genes. Results: All three treatments resulted in down regulation of both Kir 4.1 and the glial protein, glutamine synthetase as well as up regulation of the glial fibrillary acidic protein albeit with different time courses. All genes were normalized to ?-Actin which showed no change in expression across all treatments and time points. Analysis of the genome scale expression levels present transcriptional signatures common to all three treatments, revealing the molecular pathway underlying the process of epileptogenesis. Conclusions: Here, we highlight a novel cascade of events following common brain insults leading to brain dysfunction and eventually epilepsy, suggesting possible therapeutic targets. (Supported by the Mary Elizabeth Rennie Epilepsy Foundation.) 1 Corey Flynn, and 1 G. Campbell Teskey ( 1 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Epilepsy is characterized as a chronic brain state with a very low seizure threshold. In people that develop epilepsy, there must be changes in brain functioning that results in a lowered seizure threshold prior to the appearance of the first seizure. Currently there is no animal model of induced epilepsy that allows for the exploration of the neural basis of a low seizure threshold without the elicitation of seizures. For instance stimulation that results in kindling both lowers thresholds and elicits seizures. Likewise the models that develop spontaneous seizures result from a treatment that elicits seizures. In this study we employed repeated application of subthreshold electrical stimulation in an attempt to lower seizure thresholds without eliciting seizures. Methods: Expt 1: Rats were implanted with bipolar stimulating and recording electrodes in the corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex respectively. Once daily stimulation consisted of biphasic rectangular waves (1 ms, 60 Hz, for 1 sec). A range of stimulation intensities (20, 30, 40, 50, and 500 uA) was used. Prior to, and following 20 stimulation sessions at a single intensity, the afterdischarge (seizure) threshold was determined. Expt 2: The goal of this experiment was to reduce seizure thresholds in the absence of ANY seizures. Because the measurement of afterdischarge threshold (ADT) necessitates one AD, the initial ADT measurement was excluded for Expt 2. The intensity groups chosen for Expt 2 were 20, 50, and 500 uA as well as two additional groups (150, 250 uA). Results: Repeated stimulation at 50 uA was most effective at reducing the ADT in sensorimotor neocortex. However, even at this intensity, it was difficult to achieve a complete absence of seizure activity. Unexpectedly the highest intensity stimulation groups (250, & 500 uA) showed repeated seizure activity but did not show a reduction of ADT. Conclusions: Low intensity electrical stimulation allowed for the reduction of seizure thresholds with few seizures, while high intensity electrical stimulation reliably elicits seizures without lowering seizure thresholds. These two stimulation protocols can be used to dissociate the neural basis of a low seizure threshold from the reorganizing effect of repeated seizures. (Supported by NSERC.) 1 Chris R. French ( 1 Neurology, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: The rapidly activating voltage activated sodium current (Ina(t)) underlies the rapid depolarizing phase of the action potential in most neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system. This current has a rapid (sub-millisecond) activation phase, followed by by a slower (>10 ms) falling phase, termed inactivation. The aim of this study was to better characterise the inactivation process in a mammalian central neuron, and to observe the effects of chemical removal of inactivation on this current. Methods: Hippocampal CA1 neurons (n = 100) were acutely dissociated from female Wistar rats, 2?5 weeks of age, using a pronase-based protocol. Ina(t) was recorded under voltage clamp conditions with the whole-cell patch clamp technique using specially fabricated low-resistance patch electrodes at 20°C. With this method, the rising phase of the sodium current could be resolved. Results: Macroscopic inactivation of Ina(t) was evident at membrane potentials around ?40 mV, had a bi-exponential decay (Fig. 1A), becoming more rapid with greater depolarization (fast and slow time constants of 0.5 and 2.5 ms respectively at 0 mV). The amplitude ratio of the fast and slow components approached a limiting value of 0.7, and the bi-exponential inactivation was remarkably well accounted for by the addition of a second open state in the kinetic description. The steady-state inactivation (hα) relation reached a maximum at ?120 mV, with a half-inactivation voltage of ?71 mV, complete inactivation at ?40 mV and was best fitted by a double Boltzman distribution. Data from double pulse techniques suggested that the time course of macroscopic inactivation reflects the true interconversion rates between open and inactivated states. Similar experiments at subthreshold potentials revealed that transitions from activatable closed states to inactivated states were surprisingly long (?100's of ms) which is likely to affect repetitive firing rates. Addition of the enzyme papaine (1 mg/ml) to the patch-electrode solution resulted a rapid increase in Ina(t) amplitude (?100%) and gradual removal of inactivation, and a negative shift in activation (Figure 1 B,C). Time constants of activation and deactivation were largely unaffected by inactivation removal. Conclusions: These observations reveal major discrepancies between properties of rat CA1 INa(t) and conventional invertebrate models, and suggest that substantial alterations to the Hodgkin-Huxley model must be made to adequately model mammalian CNS excitability.?[figure 1] 1,2 Linda K. Friedman, and 2 Robert Keesey ( 1 Neuroscience, New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, Old Westbury, NY ; and 2 Neuroscience, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ ) Rationale: Sustained increases of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) following prolonged seizures or other neurological insults are thought to be responsible for neuronal cell death. However, elevated calcium in central neurons does not always lead to neurotoxicity. In fact, under certain circumstances calcium can even protect neurons from dying. Methods: The FURA-2AM dye indicator was used to measure intracellular Ca 2+ after single (1xKA) or multiple (3xKA) episodes of KA seizures that were induced on postnatal (P) days P6, P9 and P13. Slices from control animals were exposed to middle doses of glutamate (30 ?M) and NMDA (30 ?M). Results: Basal Ca 2+ measurements were very consistent and relatively low in control slices prepared from P6, P9, and P13 rat pups. At 5 hrs after a singe episode of status epilepticus at P6, P9 or P13, basal Ca2+ levels in the presence of TTX were elevated in an age-dependent fashion such that CA1/subiculum and DG had the largest concentrations of Ca2+, consistent with early studies (Hammon and Heinemann, 1988). After ratiometric calculations it was found that CA2 and CA3 neurons also increased their Ca2+ concentrations but to a lesser degree. Responses to NMDA were also significantly potentiated in CA1/subiculum and DG at the three perinatal ages examined. Calcium levels returned to baseline in the presence of the selective antagonist NMDA receptor APV. In contrast, after 3xKA, much smaller increases in both Ca2+ baseline and NMDA stimulated responses were observed 5 hrs after the third seizure relative to animals after 1xKA. This decrease in Ca2+ permeability coincides with a reduction in NMDA receptor protein expression in CA1/subiculum rather than the loss of GluR2 subunits that has been observed in adults. A full time course of Ca2+ baseline and agonist and antagonist responses at these early ages will be presented. Quantification of baseline and pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors will be illustrated by pseudocolor images. Conclusions: Data show that a single episode of KA-induced status epilepticus increases hippocampal sensitivity to NMDA after seizures have subsided. However, multiple perinatal seizures reduce glutamatergic stimulated Ca2+ influx to induce long-lasting tolerance and neuroprotection.

Moshe ( 1 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; 2 Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Neonatal prolonged seizures may cause long term functional changes which in certain cases may increase the risk for subsequent epilepsy. Using a model of 3 episodes of neonatal kainic acid induced status epilepticus (KA-SE), we have shown that the normal GABAA receptor mediated differentiation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and its role in seizure control are disrupted. Here we investigate whether the 3 episodes of neonatal KA-SE also lead to long term changes in GABAA receptor subunit expression, which could alter its sensitivity to GABAAergic drugs. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 3 daily episodes of KA-SE at postnatal days (PN) 4, 5, and 6 by intraperitoneal injections of KA (PN4: 1.25 mg/kg; PN5: 1.5 mg/kg; PN6: 2 mg/kg) and were monitored behaviorally for 6 hours daily (n = 8 rats, KA456 group). Micropunches from the anterior SNR were obtained at PN30. RT-PCR using primers specific for the a1 ? a6, b2, g1, g2L, delta GABAA receptor subunits, the rho1 GABAC receptor subunit, and beta-actin were performed. RT-PCR products were electrophoretically separated and compared by densitometry with the subunit expression of control PN30 male anterior SNR (n = 7 rats). Results were referred to beta-actin. Results: Control male PN30 anterior SNR expressed the following subunits: a1 > b2, a5, g2L > g1, a2 > a3, a4, delta, rho1. The a6 subunit was not expressed, whereas low expression of rho1 was detected in 2/7 control rats. In the PN30 KA456 male rats, the following subunits were reduced compared to controls: (1) a1 subunit (P < 0.05, unpaired t-test); (2) the a3 subunit was not present in 5/3 KA456 rats, whereas it was present in all studied controls (chi square P = 0.01); (3) the g1 subunit also tended to be reduced in KA456 males (unpaired t-test P = 0.055). No significant changes in the other subunits were seen. Conclusions: The anterior SNR of PN30 control male rats had a relative dominance of benzodiazepine-sensitive subtypes, over the extrasynaptic and steroid sensitive delta-containing subtypes. The PN30 KA456 male anterior SNR had reduced expression of the a1 and a3, and showed a trend for reduced expression of the g1 subunit. These suggest that the sensitivity to certain benzodiazepine GABAA receptor agonists ? ie those selective for a1, a3, and possibly g1 ? may be reduced in KA456 rat anterior SNR. Since a1-selective GABAAergic drugs can mediate anticonvulsant effects through their actions on the PN30 anterior SNR, further studies are needed to test whether the reduction of a1 subunits in KA456 rats may be a mechanism of drug refractoriness to the anticonvulsant effects of certain GABAAergic drugs, especially those selectively acting on a1-containing receptors.

Rogawski ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS-NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: (R,S)-1,3-Butanediol (1,3-BD) is a common food additive that has a long history of safety in various species. 1,3-BD is metabolized by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in the liver to form ?-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone, which are the same ketone bodies whose levels are elevated in the ketogenic diet. Here we sought to determine if 1,3-BD has anticonvulsant effects and could potentially be a replacement for the ketogenic diet. Methods: The anticonvulsant activity of 1,3-BD was assessed in several in vitro and in vivo models. Acute toxicity was determined in the inverted-screen test. To determine the contribution of ketosis to the anticonvulsant efficacy of 1,3-BD, animals were pretreated with the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole. In addition, we used the R- and S-enantiomers of 1,3-BD since only the R-enantiomer can be directly converted to acetone. Results: 1,3-BD attenuated epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (55 ?M) in rat hippocampal slices in a concentration-dependent manner (10?100 mM). Furthermore, 1,3-BD (1?32 mmol/kg, IP) demonstrated a broad anticonvulsant profile in a variety of seizure tests in mice (iv PTZ test, electroconvulsive threshold, 6-Hz seizure model) and rats (amygdala-kindled seizures). The anticonvulsant effects of 1,3-BD occurred at doses devoid of acute toxicity. After the administration of an anticonvulsant dose of 1,3-BD, levels of the ketone body, ?-hydroxybutyrate, were comparable to those seen in mice exposed to the ketogenic diet for several weeks. Inhibition of 1,3-BD conversion to ketone bodies by 4-methylpyrazole (25 mg/kg) augmented the anticonvulsant effects of 1,3-BD, indicating that 1,3-BD itself has anticonvulsant activity. Like the racemic form of 1,3-BD, the R- and S-enantiomers individually demonstrated robust anticonvulsant properties, demonstrating that conversion to ketone bodies is not required for seizure protection. However, the R-enantiomer was modestly more potent suggesting that ketone bodies could contribute to the anticonvulsant activity. Conclusions: 1,3-BD and its enantiomers are protective in a broad range of seizure models. Conversion to ketone bodies is not required for efficacy, but could augment the activity of the parent. Further studies are required to assess the potential of 1,3-BD or its enantiomers in the treatment of epilepsy. (Supported by NINDS/NIH.) 1 Krista L. Gilby, 2 Thomas N. Ferraro, and 1 Dan C. McIntyre ( 1 Institute of Neuroscience, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ; and 2 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have recently been established as true co-morbid disorders (Kanner et al., 2003). Fast (seizure-prone) and Slow (seizure-resistant) kindling inbred rat strains, derived via selective breeding, serve as an excellent model for seizure susceptibility, yet Fast rats also exhibit adult behavioral profiles indicative of relative ADHD-like behaviors. In order to begin to explore the genetic basis for relative seizure susceptibility and ADHD-like behaviors in Fast rats, we interbred the two strains and examined adult offspring (F1 hybrid) behaviors. Methods: Male Fast rats were bred with female Slow rats to create an F1 population of hybrid pups. Offspring generated by breeding Fast males with Fast females or Slow males with Slow females served as control populations. As adults, all rats were compared in several behavioral paradigms known to elicit differential responses from Fast and Slow rats including kindling, restraint and open field. Water consumption was also compared. Finally, blood was extracted from all rats and levels of non-esterfied fatty acids (NEFA), known to be deficient in Fast rats, were compared. Results: F1 hybrids showed water consumption and kindling rates that were indistinguishable from Fast rats. Remarkably, however, hybrids exhibited behaviors that were near identical to Slow rats in both the open field and restraint paradigm. Thus, hybrids appear to have maintained the relative seizure susceptibility, but not the ADHD-like behaviors, of their Fast fathers. Further, blood analysis showed that F1 hybrids exhibited the relatively higher NEFA levels characteristic of Slow rats. Conclusions: Results suggest that a primary dominant or semi-dominant genetic effect mediates the differences in kindling rate and water intake between Fast and Slow rats. Lack of a similar finding for other behavioral traits may be due to a maternal genetic influence or the influence of unknown environmental factors. Interestingly, NEFA was higher in hybrids and Slow rats compared to Fast rats, thus implying a link between ADHD-like behaviors and a relative NEFA deficiency. (Supported by CIHR and NSERC to DCM.) 1 Joseph Glykys, and 1 Istvan Mody ( 1 Neuroscience IDP and Deptartment Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Phasic and tonic inhibitions are mediated by synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, respectively. Extrasynaptic receptors respond to ambient levels of GABA thought to originate in part from spillover after vesicular release. If both phasic and tonic inhibitions are activated by vesicular GABA release, in any given cell there should be a correlation between the magnitudes of the two types of inhibition. Methods: Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and from molecular layer interneurons. In order to measure tonic and phasic inhibitions simultaneously over short periods of time (1 s), we developed a new method of measurement of their mean values (Imean). In addition, simulations of sIPSCs were used to model specific changes in phasic currents. Results: Simulations of sIPSC showed that this new method is highly sensitive and can detect the combined effects of small changes (?15%) in two sIPSC properties (e.g., amplitude and decay time constant) even when the change in each individual parameter is not statistically significant. Using this method we investigated changes in phasic and tonic inhibitions during spontaneous and sucrose induced bursts of sIPSCs recorded in hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells. During the bursts there was a large increase (?52 Hz) of sIPSC frequency with a concomitant change in baseline holding current. However, simulations of sIPSC bursts even at much higher frequencies than those actually recorded showed only a minimal contribution of phasic inhibition to the baseline current, thus indicating that tonic inhibition was also activated during the bursts. In addition, we found a strong cross-correlation between phasic and tonic inhibitions when vesicular GABA release was reduced by perfusing TTX + CdCl2. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a significant portion of tonic inhibition being mediated by GABA released from the very vesicles responsible for activating phasic inhibition. Therefore, phasic and tonic inhibitions can be modulated in unison resulting in a compound dampening effect on neuronal excitability.

Methods: In this study, 32 one month old baby Sprague-Dawley rats were used for sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) staining method and 72 more animals were used for other parameters in parallel groups. Study groups consist of a control (8), cortical dysplasia (8), hypertermia (8) and cortical dysplasia and hyperthermia (8) groups. The pregnant rats which have been given sodium pentobarbital anesthesia with the dose of 30 mg/kg intraperitonally, were administered gamma irradiation of 145 cGy from the uterus on day E 17. To induce hyperthermia (39.5 ± 0.5°C), rats were exposed to an elevated ambient temperature (55?60°C) for 30 minutes. Vital signs such as body temperature and arterial blood pressure were also recorded. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot methods were used to show any alterations in occludin protein, and electron microscopy was performed to evaluate structural properties of BBB in this experiment. On the day of the experiment there was no mortality in hyperthermic animals. Results: Blood pressure levels of rats with hyperthermia and rats with hyperthermia as well as cortical dysplasia increased significantly when compared to control values. Seizures the rats had were observed clinically; the longer the duration of hyperthermia was, the more seizures were seen. Both hyperthermia and cortical dysplasia did not change BBB permeability to NaFlu. Hyperthermia induced a generalized increase in BBB permeability to NaFlu in rats with cortical dysplasia and the highest increases (>130% over control values) were recorded in diencephalon and cerebellum regions. Western blot analysis of brain capillaries showed that the expression of the transmembrane tight junction protein occludin was not changed in response to dysplasia and hyperthermia. Conclusions: These results indicate that immature rats are resistant to hypertermic BBB disruption. However, hyperthermia may induce significant BBB permeability increase under cortical dysplastic conditions. We conclude that cortical dysplasia as an underlying pathology could increase the disruption of BBB integrity during hyperthermia. 1 Bj?rnar Hassel, 2 Ray Dingledine, 3 Leif Gjerstad, and 3 Erik Taub?ll ( 1 Division for Environmental Toxicology, Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Kjeller, Norway ; 2 Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: The development of epilepsy, epileptogenesis, involves changes in gene expression. Pharmacological modulation of gene expression has been suggested as an approach to inhibit epileptogenesis. Levetiracetam (LEV) has antiepileptogenic properties, whereas phenytoin (PHT) does not. We hypothesized that regional alteration of gene expression after LEV treatment might point to brain regions that are important for epileptogenesis. Methods: Female Wistar rats were fed perorally with LEV (150 mg/kg) or PHT (75 mg/kg) twice daily for 90 days. N = 7 in each group. Affymetrix oligonucleotide-based microarrays were used to identify regional alterations in gene expression in pons/medulla oblongata, hippocampus and frontal cortex. Results: LEV treatment caused changes in the expression of 65 genes in pons/medulla oblongata, 3 in hippocampus, and 1 in frontal cortex. PHT treatment, in contrast, caused changes in the expression of 3 genes in pons/medulla oblongata, 64 genes in hippocampus, and 322 genes in frontal cortex. Very little overlap between regions or drug treatments was observed with respect to affected genes. Median serum drug concentration 4?6 h after last dose was 231 ?mol LEV/L and 50 ?mol PHT/L. Conclusions: We conclude that antiepileptic drug treatment may cause dramatic and region-specific changes in mRNA levels, possibly reflecting their different action on receptors and ion channels in the plasma membrane. The finding that gene expression was altered predominantly in pons/medulla oblongata after LEV suggests that this brain region, which i.a. harbours monoaminergic and cholinergic projection neurons, may be important for epileptogenesis. 1 Matthew H. Higgs, 2 Carol A. Robbins, and 1,2,3 William J. Spain ( 1 Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; 2 Neurology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; and 3 Neurology, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: High-frequency spike bursts have been recorded in neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo. Burst firing may promote epileptic discharges by increasing firing rate, synchronizing firing at high frequencies, and increasing neurotransmitter release at facilitating synapses. It is unclear whether bursts primarily reflect the pattern of synaptic input or intrinsic cellular properties. In some pyramidal neurons repetitive bursting occurs during direct current (DC) stimulation, but in most bursting is absent or appears only at the onset of current steps. In order to determine how intrinsic cellular properties shape firing patterns of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons during input with rapid fluctuations characteristic of in vivo synaptic excitation, we applied broadband noise stimuli. Methods: Coronal slices of rat sensorimotor cortex were superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (34°C) containing blockers of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors. Intracellular recordings were obtained from 21 regular-spiking neurons in layer 2/3 using sharp microelectrodes filled with 2.7 M KCl and 1% biocytin. The location and pyramidal morphology of most cells were confirmed by biocytin histochemistry. Neurons were stimulated with broadband current noise (1 ms exponential relaxation) in combination with a DC offset that was usually set near spike threshold. Results: All of the neurons tested fired regularly during DC stimuli, without repetitive bursting. However, 19/21 cells generated a mixture of single spikes and bursts of two or more spikes during noise stimuli. Raising the noise amplitude or the DC offset increased burst frequency, while the mean duration of intra-burst intervals remained nearly constant at approximately 10 milliseconds. The interval-dependent firing probability (hazard function) during high-noise stimulation roughly corresponded to the post-spike voltage trajectory, which is shaped by a fast afterhyperpolarization (fAHP), a fast afterdepolarization (fADP), and a medium-duration afterhyperpolarization (mAHP). Increasing the fAHP conductance by spike-triggered dynamic current clamp had little effect on regular spiking to DC stimuli but strongly reduced stochastic bursting. Conclusions: Our results suggest that intrinsic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, including their small fAHP and prominent fADP, create an intrinsic resonance that is usually subthreshold during firing to DC stimuli but promotes bursting with an intra-burst frequency of approximately 100 Hz during noisy excitation. This frequency is similar to that of ripples observed in extracellular and EEG recordings during neocortical seizures, suggesting that high-frequency resonance in regular-spiking pyramidal neurons may contribute to epileptic discharges.

One area of the brain where this has been demonstrated is the hippocampus. We hypothesize that NE exerts its anti-epileptic effect in the hippocampus in part through activation of an α1 adrenergic receptor (AR) located on a specific subset of CA1 GABAergic interneurons. Methods: Hippocampal slices prepared from young rats were used for all studies. Functional Studies: To determine the specific AR subtype expressed by CA1 interneurons, a panel of subtype specific AR agonists and antagonists was utilized. Cell-attached recordings were conducted under IR/DIC optics, with aCSF perfusion enabling drug delivery in timed increments. Action potential frequency of the interneuron was recorded, plotted as a concentration response curve, and analyzed by Schild regression. To determine if NE promotes GABA release in CA1, cell-attached and whole-cell recordings were conducted on pyramidal cells. NE challenges were made in normal aCSF and then aCSF containing GABA receptor antagonists. Molecular Studies: Cytoplasm was collected from NE-responsive CA1 interneurons and used for single-cell RT PCR. The resulting cDNA template was profiled in terms of AR subtype, neuronal cell type, and neuropeptide expression using real time PCR. Results: 6-fluoronorepinephrine (6FNE), an α AR agonist, produced a dose-dependent increase in action potential frequency in ?50% of CA1 interneurons. The response to 6FNE could be blocked by the α1 AR antagonist prazosin, but not by the α2 AR antagonist rauwolscine, suggesting that NE-responsive interneurons express an α1 AR. Subsequent studies performed with the α1 AR subtype specific antagonists 5-methylurapidil, WB 4101, L-765,314, and BMY7378 produced Schild regressions that suggested predominate functional expression of the α1A AR. Molecular analysis of NE-responsive CA1 interneurons revealed transcripts for the α1A and α1B AR, the neuropeptide somatostatin and the GABAergic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase. Initial recordings from pyramidal cells suggest that α1 AR activation decreases the activity of these cells, an effect that is attenuated by GABA blockade. Conclusions: We have identified a distinct subset of somatostatin expressing, GABAergic CA1 interneurons that respond to NE via an α1A AR. Adrenergic activation of these interneurons appears to increase the amount of GABA released to pyramidal cells. These findings elucidate one mechanism by which NE may be exerting an anti-epileptic effect in the hippocampus, and furthermore identify a specific receptor subtype that may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of epilepsy.

Lenck-Santini ( 1 Neurocience Center at Dartmouth, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Interictal spikes (IS) are morphologically defined, episodic, transient EEG discharges that occur as a result of synchronous, paroxysmal depolarization of neurons resulting in a series of action potentials. The localization of focal IS correspond closely to the site of the seizure focus and IS remain one of the most important diagnostic features on the EEG. In humans there is a clear relationship between state and IS. Inactivity, drowsiness, and sleep are potent activators of IS. The relationship between IS and state in rodents is less clear. In this experiment, we investigated the relationship between theta and IS in the rat pilocarpine model. Methods: Fifteen 60 day old rats 15 P60 rats were treated by lithium/pilocarpine and underwent status epilepticus. Among these animals, five showed spontaneous seizures and interictal spikes two months after status epilepticus induction. They were implanted with a multielectrode array driving electrodes in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus so that bipolar differential recordings above and bellow the cell layer could be performed. Rats were trained to perform two types of behavioral task: 1) Pellet chasing task: rats were trained to forage for pellets randomly scattered in a circular open field arena 2) Linear track shuttle: rats were trained to shuttle between the two ends of a linear track. Hippocampal EEG theta/delta ratios, the ratio of the sum of the power-spectrum in the theta band (6?12Hz) by the sum of the power-spectrum in the delta band (1?5Hz), were performed in both tasks. Results: Strikingly, we found that more IS were observed in sessions with a low hippocampal theta/delta ratio than during periods with high ratios. Within the same session, IS appeared during low theta behaviors (either standing or walking at a speed of <10 cm/sec, ratios ranging from 0 to 4) and disappeared in high locomotion, high theta periods (speed > 10cm/sec, ratio > 4). Pepe add a figure showing this or the EEG versus spikes. Conclusions: These results show that there is a strong correlation between theta and IS. During theta activity IS are suppressed; during periods of decreased theta IS are activated. The relationship between theta and IS demonstrate that as in humans, there is a role of general arousal systems in IS modulation. IS modulation in rodents can be used to model the human condition.

If spirals exist in the cortex, the robust dynamics of the spiral waves may contribute to sustaining seizure activity, strategies of disrupting formation of spirals may be used to disrupt seizure activity. Methods: We used optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes to examine seizure-like events induced by carbachol and bicuculline in rat neocortical slices and in rat cortex in vivo. Slices from visual cortex were sectioned in a tangential plane containing cortical layers III-V. The slices were stained with an absorption dye, NK3630 before imaging, and the signals from the stained tissue were recorded by a photodiode array. In vivo imaging was performed over visual cortex in adult rats. The animals were anesthetized with urethane while a craniotomy window of 5 mm in diameter was created. The cortex was stained by a fluorescent dye RH1691, and fluorescent signals were recorded by a photodiode array. Results: The seizure-like oscillations occurred spontaneously in vitro and in vivo when the drugs were applied. The oscillations were organized spatiotemporally as propagating waves, and complex wave patterns such as spiral, plane, ring and irregular waves were observed both in slices and in vivo. These wave patterns alternated within one oscillation epoch, suggesting the patterns were dynamically organized. Spiral waves, occurred in about 50% of recording trials in slices but were rarely seen in vivo. We examined the initiation of spiral waves in slices and found that collision of two wave fronts usually occurred prior to the initiation of spiral waves. The spiral waves were very stable in slices, some sustained for up to 30 rotations, but spirals in vivo only lasted for a few cycles. In brain slices, ?phase singularity?, a hallmark of spiral waves, can be clearly identified at spiral center as substantial reduction in signal amplitude and a circular phase distribution around it. Phase analysis of the spiral center and surrounding areas suggested that the amplitude reduction was caused by superimposition of multiple widely distributed phases. Conclusions: Our results suggest that spiral dynamics may exist in neocortex during seizure-like activity and may contribute to the sustaining of seizure events.

Methods: Experiments were carried out on 12 male Wistar rats undergone stereotactic implantation of electrodes in the bilateral amygdala, the bilateral dorsal hippocampus, and the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. All received subcutaneous administration of KA (10 mg/kg) to elicit status epilepticus. Thirty min after that, gabapentine (dissolved with distilled water, 30 mg/mL) was administrated intraperitoneally (2mL/kg) (gabapentine group, n = 6), while the rest received intraperitoneal administration of distilled water only (control, n = 6). Results: Ten to 20 min after KA administration, seizure discharges initially appeared in the bilateral amygdala and the bilateral dorsal hippocampus, and then propagated to the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. All rats showed status epilepticus 30 min after KA administration. In gabapentine group, seizure activity of the bilateral sensorimotor cortex decreased 15?30 min after gabapentine administration, whereas those of the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus remained unchanged. Unlike gabapentine group, seizure activity stayed unaltered in control. Conclusions: Gabapentine may show an antiepileptic effect by reducing the seizure propagation to the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. 1 Laura A. Jansen, and 2 Jeffrey G. Ojemann ( 1 Division of Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Department of Neurological Surgery, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center and University of Washington, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Pediatric epilepsy due to areas of focal cortical dysplasia is often intractable to anticonvulsant treatment. Many of the medications used unsuccessfully in treating this disorder, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ACTH, and topiramate, are thought to exert at least a portion of their action through enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission via GABA-A receptors. In the present study, GABA-A receptor properties in resected epileptogenic brain tissue from four children with intractable epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia were measured to determine if this clinical resistance to pharmacologic treatment correlates with alterations in receptor responsiveness to these agents. Methods: Operative resection of the epileptogenic zones was performed, with pathologic diagnoses of focal cortical dysplasia type 2A. Portions of the epileptogenic cortex were flash frozen at the time of surgery and maintained at ?80° C until use. The tissue was homogenized and subjected to a series of centrifugation steps to isolate the membrane fraction. This fraction was resuspended and injected into Xenopus oocytes, resulting in incorporation of brain membrane vesicles into the oocyte cellular membrane. Two-electrode voltage clamp analysis was performed 18?72 hours after injection, at which time GABA-A receptor currents were easily measured. Results: Functional characterization of GABA-A receptor properties was performed, including agonist potency, current-voltage relationship, current rundown, and responses to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, topiramate, and zinc. Results from epileptic cortex were compared with those from non-epileptic autopsy and surgical control samples. Experimentally determined receptor properties were correlated with patient age and clinical characteristics. Conclusions: These studies of GABA-A receptor function in children with intractable epilepsy due to focal cortical dysplasia provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of anticonvulsant resistance in this disorder.

Patel ( 1 Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado ; and 2 Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, CO ) Rationale: Epilepsy is a recent addition to the diverse neurological disorders in which mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction has been implicated as a contributing factor. Studies in our laboratory have shown that status epilepticus (SE) produces oxidative stress that originates primarily from the mitochondria. An important consequence of mitochondrial free radical production is the oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The goal of this study was to determine if acute or chronic epileptic seizures result in oxidative damage to mtDNA and if this activates mtDNA repair. Methods: Oxidative damage to mtDNA base 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8OHdG/2dG), mtDNA damage (quantitative polymerase chain reaction; QPCR), and changes in the base excision repair (BER) proteins (polymerase gamma; pol ? and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase; Ogg1) were determined in mitochondria from the rat hippocampus at various times following acute kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) or chronic kainate-induced epilepsy. To investigate acute SE, rats were injected with a single 12 mg/kg dose of kainate and sacrificed at 24h, 48h, 96h, 7d, 21d post-treatment. To investigate kainate-induced epilepsy, rats were injected with multiple low-dose injections of kainate (5 mg/kg) and sacrificed ≥3 months post-treatment. Rats displaying class IV-V seizures up to 6hr after the initial kainate injection (12 mg/kg; s.c.) as determined using a modified Racine's scale) were used for subsequent studies. Results: Acute kainate-induced SE produced a time-dependent increase in mitochondrial, but not nuclear 8OHdG/2dG levels and mtDNA damage in the hippocampus (not cerebellum). MtDNA lesions returned to control levels after 96 hr. MtDNA damage was accompanied by a significant increase in hippocampal pol ? and Ogg1 mRNA and protein levels. In epileptic rats, mtDNA damage was significantly higher in the hippocampus compared to the cerebellum. In addition, a significant reduction in pol ? protein expression was observed in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum. By contrast, no significant differences in Ogg1 protein levels were observed. Conclusions: These data demonstrate oxidative mtDNA damage and activation of BER following SE. In chronically epileptic rats, hippocampal mtDNA lesions occurred concurrently with a reduction of pol ? repair enzyme. Together, changes in the mitochondrial BER pathway and increased mtDNA lesions provide further evidence for mitochondrial oxidative stress in the epileptic brain. Following acute SE, BER mechanisms are induced to attempt the repair mtDNA lesions. However, chronic epileptic seizures results in a failure of some BER enyzmes and consequent mtDNA lesions which could in turn contribute to the increased seizure susceptibility and development of epilepsy. (Supported by NIH RO1NS039587.) 1 Alicia L. Jensen, and 1 Dominique M. Durand ( 1 Deptartment of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: The effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS), also known as high frequency stimulation (HFS), on neural elements close to the stimulating electrode remains an important question. Although computational studies have suggested that HFS has a dual effect on neural elements (inhibiting cell bodies, while exciting axons), experimental evidence of these effects is conflicting and unclear. The current study investigates the hypothesis that HFS suppresses axonal conduction. HFS application to the axon tracts themselves may provide novel, direct control for disrupting the propagation of seizure activity between brain regions. Methods: Experiments were carried out using in-vitro brain slices. Extracellular recording electrodes were positioned in the CA1 stratum pyramidale and/or alvear axon field to mointor evoked potentials. Electrical stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied in the alveus producing compound action potentials (CAPs). Sinusoidal HFS (50Hz-10kHz) was applied to a third electrode located between the stimulating and recording electrodes. Filtering was used to remove the large stimulation artifact. Antidromic evoked field potential and compound action potential amplitude, width, and latency were analyzed prior, during, and post HFS. Extracellular potassium levels were monitored using single barreled ion-selective microelectrodes. Results: Sinusoidal stimulation suppresses activity in cell bodies (evoked potentials) and axons (compound action potentials). Suppression was dependent on HFS amplitude and frequency, but independent of stimulus duration and synaptic input. The frequency range of this effect is nearly identical to that reported for DBS, with maximal suppression between 50 and 200Hz. At 2kHz, the suppression effect disappeared. The suppression effect was independent of synaptic transmission, and could not be attributed to desynchronization or damage. Suppression of axonal conduction was associated with an increase in extracellular peak potassium concentration (r= 0.92), with complete suppression at a peak potassium threshold of 8.25mM. Bath application of elevated potassium produced significant suppression of axonal activity in 12 mM and 15mM KCl ACSF. However, 8.5 mM bath potassium levels failed to block axonal activity. Conclusions: Sinusoidal HFS suppresses axonal conduction. The frequency dependence of these suppression effects is identical to that observed for DBS in Parkinson's disease. Although the mechanism for HFS suppression is not known, damage to cells, increased inhibition, and desynchonization have been ruled out. An increase in extracellular potassium has been associated with the suppression effect; however, the potassium concentration decays significantly during stimulation while HFS suppression remains high. It is therefore likely, that, depolarization block is partially responsible for the effect. However, other mechanisms must play a role.

Baptiste, 1 Geza Medveczky, 2 Hans Von Gizycki, 1 Ruben I. Kuzniecky, 1 Orrin Devinsky, and 1 Nandor Ludvig ( 1 Neurology, Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY ; and 2 Scientific Computing Center, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY ) Rationale: This study was part of our ongoing effort to identify an ideal drug combination for seizure-controlling subdural Hybrid Neuroprostheses. We have recently shown that in freely moving rats, epidurally delivered pentobarbital can prevent and terminate neocortical seizures induced by localized acetylcholine (Ach) application (Ludvig et al., Epilepsia, 2006; in press). The present experiments were designed to obtain information on whether epidurally applied neurotransmitters, specifically GABA and adenosine, can also exert similar effects in rats. Methods: Each rat was implanted with an epidural cup placed above the right parietal cortex. Epidural EEG electrodes were positioned adjacent to the posterior edge of the cup. After a 6?7-day recovery period, bipolar EEG recordings were conducted in a Faraday cage, using a cable with built-in operational amplifiers to eliminate movement artifacts. For focal seizure induction, 274 mM Ach was delivered into the epidural cup. After a 15-min exposure to Ach, a combination of 250 mM GABA and 5 mM adenosine was delivered into the cup and kept there for a 10-min period. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used to determine the maximum and average power (?V2) of the low-beta (13?20 Hz) frequency band before drug deliveries, during Ach exposure and after the delivery of the GABA/adenosine combination. Results: Ach induced EEG seizures within 390 ± 30 (mean ± S.E.M.) sec, which were accompanied by clonic convulsions. During EEG seizures, there was an increase in maximum power from 13.8 ± 10.3 to 36.2 ± 22 along with an increase in average power from 4.7 ± 2.8 to 8.9 ± 4.9. Delivery of the GABA/adenosine combination fully terminated the ongoing Ach-induced EEG seizures and convulsions within 33.5 ± 21.5 sec. This GABA/adenosine effect was reflected in the reduction of the maximum power from 36.2 ± 22 to 17.2 ± 9.2 and that of the average power from 8.9 ± 4.9 to 3.9 ± 2.3. The EEG power values after GABA/adenosine delivery were comparable to those obtained in the normal, pre-seizure state. Abnormal electrographic signs following epidural exposure to this drug combination were not observed. Conclusions: The combination of GABA and adenosine, delivered onto the surface of dura mater, can fully terminate Ach-induced neocortical EEG seizures and their behavioral manifestations. This suggests that: (1) at least a portion of the GABA and/or adenosine molecules can diffuse through the meninges into the underlying neocortical tissue, and (2) this treatment can terminate locally induced neocortical seizures. Further studies are required to thoroughly determine the efficacy of GABA and adenosine in terminating, and perhaps preventing, focal neocortical seizures upon epidural/subdural deliveries.

We reported that mice of the FVB strain show more seizure susceptibility than those of the B6 in the KA-induced amygdalar seizures. However, the details of the genes responsible for such difference remain obscure. In the present study, we crossed male B6 with female FVB to produce an F1 generation, and made seizure models of the F1. Methods: Male B6 were crossed with female FVB to produce an F1 generation. The F1 (n = 6) underwent implantation of electrodes in the LA and the left sensorimotor cortex (LCx). Stainless cannula was also inserted into the LA for KA injection. All animals received KA injection into the LA (0.5 microg) to induce seizures, Electroencephalographic and behavioral observation was made for 48 hours, and the voltages of the spike were statically analized. Mice then were decapitated and histologic studies including analysis of the neuronal density of the CA3 in the hippocampus were carried out. Results: On electoroencephalograms (EEGs), multiple spike discharges initially appeared in the LA within 10?20 min after KA injection and mouth and facial movement were behaviorally observed. At 20?60 min after KA injection, the seizure discharge propagated to the LCx. Within 60?90 min after KA injection the amplitude of the multiple spike discharges increased. Behaviorally, the animals demonstrated seizure motor manifestation such as head nodding, forelimb clonus, rearing and falling. During ictal EEG change, all mice showed only immobilization, lasting 1?2 min and recurring every 10?20 min. At 48 hours after KA injection multiple spike discharges were disappeared. Neuronal damage in the CA3 region was moderated. Conclusions: In the KA-induced amygdalar seizures, it is likely that mice of the F1 show resistant to seizure susceptibility similar to B6. Further examination related to genetic factor will be needed.

In this study, the changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity after pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling were investigated in rats with cortical dysplasia. To show the changes in the expression of occludin, immunohistochemical and Western blot methods as well as electron microscopy were used. Methods: In this study, 38 young adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used for NaFlu staining method and 108 animals were used for other parameters in parallel groups. Study groups consist of a control (8), cortical dysplasia (10), kindling (10) and cortical dysplasia in addition to kindling and PTZ groups (10). The day of insemination was taken as the embryonic (E) day 0. The pregnant rats which have been given sodium pentobarbital anesthesia with the dose of 30 mg/kg, were administered gamma irradiation of 145 cGy from the uterus on day E 17. The baby rats were given 30 mg/kg PTZ three times per week intraperitoneally to induce kindling model starting from the 2nd week after birth to the 8th week. The changes in the expression of occludin, which is a tight junction protein in BBB, were shown by using immunohistochemical and Western blot methods in addition to electron microscopy. Results: While the arterial blood pressure remained at the control blood pressure values in the rats of cortical dysplasia and cortical dysplasia in addition to kindling groups, application of acute PTZ increased the blood pressure level significantly. The amount of NaFlu dye did not convey a remarkable increase in these rats. However, after seizures induced by PTZ application in the rats of cortical dysplasia and cortical dysplasia in addition to kindling groups, BBB permeability increased siginificantly. Conclusions: In the groups of rats with cortical displasia and PTZ kindled rats with cortical displasia no BBB permeability alterations were observed. However, in the dysplasia+kindling group of rats with acutely induced seizures after being given PTZ, a significant alteration of BBB permeability was seen. This shows that displasia with kindling model is more responsive to acute seizures at least in terms of BBB permeability. 1 Kevin M. Kelly, 1 Hong Xu, 1 Guo Yin, 1 Peter Jukkola, 1 Elena Kharlamov, and 1 Kebin Zeng ( 1 Department of Neurology, Allegheny General Hospital, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA; and Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Biological aging is associated with an increasing incidence of functional deficits in multiple organ systems as well as a growing risk of disease. In the brain, age-related alterations in GABAergic inhibitory system may occur resulting in increased neuronal excitability and the generation of epileptiform discharges. The goal of this study was to determine whether there were significant age-related changes of GABAergic synaptic inhibition to pyramidal neurons of layer II/III of the sensorimotor cortex. Methods: Whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used to record postsynaptic currents (PSCs) and spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) from layer II/III pyramidal neurons in sensorimotor cortical slices of young adult (4 month old, n = 9) and aged (20 month old, n = 9) Fischer 344 rats. Analysis was performed on PSCs and sIPSCs recorded from 44 pyramidal neurons (young, n = 23; aged, n = 21) and mIPSCs recorded from 29 of the 44 pyramidal neurons (young, n = 15; aged, n = 14). Results: For aged animals, compared with young adult animals: 1) the amplitude of mIPSCs increased significantly (?55% higher than that of young animals, 25.72 ± 2.50pA in young vs.39.87 ± 3.82pA in aged), whereas PSC and sIPSC amplitude had no significant change; 2) the 10?90% rise time of PSCs increased significantly (?19% longer than that of young animals, 3.92 ± 0.29ms in young animals vs. 4.65 ± 0.20ms in aged animals)and sIPSCs (?18% longer than that of young animals, 3.97 ± 0.26ms in young animals vs.4.66 ± 0.21ms in aged animals),whereas mIPSC 10?90% rise time had no significant change; 3) The PSC, sIPSC, and mIPSC decay time constant was similar; 4) The charge transfer of PSCs and sIPSCs was similar, whereas the mIPSC charge transfer demonstrated a trend toward increase (?50% higher than that of young animals); 5) there were significant increases in the frequency of PSCs (?130% higher than that of young animals), sIPSCs (?127% higher than that of young animals), and mIPSCs (?144% higher than that of young animals). Conclusions: GABAA-receptor mediated synaptic inhibition of sensorimotor cortex layer II/III pyramidal neurons is enhanced with age. This enhancement of GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission may lead to significant alterations in cortical signaling activity that may be associated with an increased propensity for epileptogenesis in the aging brain. (Supported by R01 NS046015 to KMK.) 1 Do Young Kim, and 1 Jong M. Rho ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: It is well known that oxidative stress disrupts normal synaptic transmission and contributes to cellular injury and hyperexcitability. Seizure activity is also known to increase oxidative neuronal damage, which in turn can impair long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of learning and memory. Recently, we have shown that ketone bodies (KB) strongly suppress hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in neocortical neurons via activation of mitochondrial KATP(mKATP) channels (Kim et al., 2005 Soc Neurosci Abstr). In the present study, we asked whether KB and diazoxide (DZ, an activator of mKATP channels) can protect against oxidative impairment of LTP in rat hippocampus. Methods: Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from Wistar rats (3?5 weeks), and extracellular field recordings were made in CA1 in the presence of various substrates. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated to evoke population spikes (PS) in the stratum pyramidale, and the stratum radiatum was stimulated using a theta-burst protocol (5 trains delivered at 0.2 Hz; each train consisting of five simulations, 0.1 ms, 100 Hz) to induce long-term potentiation (LTP). Results: H2O2 (2 mM, 15 min application alone) strongly inhibited the field population spike (PS) by over 80%. Pretreatment of KB (acetoacetate and D-?-hydrobutyrate, 1 mM each) or DZ (100 ?M) for 10 min prior to H2O2 administration resulted in only a slight depression of PS amplitude (18% and 10%, respectively). The protective effects of KB and DZ were dose-dependent, and were completely reversed by 5-hydroxydecanoate (200 ?M; 5-HD, a mitoKATP blocker). In additional experiments, H2O2 (200 ?M) strongly suppressed LTP induction and maintenance. Neither KB (3 mM alone or applied as a 1:1 cocktail) nor DZ exerted any significant effects on TBS-induced LTP. However, co-application of KB or DZ completely prevented H2O2-induced impairment of LTP. On the other hand, pre-treatment with 5-HD reversed the protective effects of KB and DZ. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that KB can restore oxidative stress-induced impairment of normal synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Furthermore, the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms may involve modulation of mitochondrial KATP channels.

However, there is little information about the anti-epileptic effect of riluzole, since evaluation of this drug has been mostly performed in normal animals. Therefore, the comparison of effects of riluzole with valproic acid (VPA) was conducted in the pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy model (a complex partial seizure model) and the ?-hydroxybutyrate lactone (GBL)-induced absence seizure models. Methods: Following VPA or riluzole treatment, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies were performed in pilocarpine- or GBL-induced epilepsy models. Results: Both VPA and riluzole treatment saliently reduced vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) immunoreactivities and fEPSP slope. Riluzole treatment completely inhibited pre-ictal spikes and spike-wave discharges (SWD) in pilocarpine- and GBL-induced epilepsy model, although VPA treatment partially inhibited. Both VPA and riluzole reduced paired-pulse inhibition in the pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. In the GBL-absence seizure model, riluzole enhanced paired-pulse inhibition, but VPA reduced it. Conclusions: These results suggest that inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release by riluzole may be more effective to reduce seizure activity both in complex partial seizure and in absence seizure than VPA. 1,2,4 Merab Kokaia, 2,4 Sara Bonde, 2,4 Katherine Jakubs, 2,4 Avtandil Nanobashvili, 2,4 Christine T. Ekdahl, 3,4 Zaal Kokaia, and 2,4 Olle Lindvall ( 1 Experimental Epilepsy Group, Section of Restorative Neurology, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden ; 2 Laboratory of Neurogenesis and Cell Therapy, Section of Restorative Neurology, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden ; 3 Laboratory of Neural Stem Cell Biology, Section of Restorative Neurology, Stem Cell Institute, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden ; and 4 Lund Strategic Research Center for Stem Cell Biology and Cell Therapy, Lund, Sweden ) Rationale: Neurogenesis continues in the adult mammalian brain from neural stem/progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ). Status epilepticus (SE) triggers increased SGZ cell proliferation. Intracellular recordings from the aberrant hilar neurons in hippocampal slices from epileptic rats indicate that they retain the intrinsic properties of granule cells. However, they exhibit abnormal pro-epileptogenic burst firing in synchrony with CA3 pyramidal cells, suggesting that the new hilar neurons contribute to the epileptic condition. The functional characteristics of the majority of the new cells generated in the epileptic brain, which are located at their normal site in the granule cell layer, have not been investigated. Methods: We have used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to determine how a pathological environment influences the electrophysiological properties and functional integration of the new cells in the GCL. New neurons were labeled through intrahippocampal injection of RV-GFP and we compared those generated following voluntary running, i.e., a physiological stimulus, with cells formed after SE, i.e., a brain insult. Results: We found that the new cells differentiate into functionally integrated granule cells with similar intrinsic membrane properties in both running and SE environments. However, the neurons born in the epileptic brain show alterations in excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which could attenuate synaptic excitability: The excitatory synaptic drive was attenuated on the new cells born into the epileptic environment compared to those formed under physiological conditions, while the inhibitory synaptic drive on these cells was increased. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that both a physiological stimulus and an insult to the adult brain trigger the formation of new dentate granule cells, which are functionally integrated into hippocampal neural circuitry. However, following the insult, the functional connectivity of the new neurons seems to mitigate the dysfunction in the epileptic brain. These data provide further evidence for a therapeutic potential of endogenous neurogenesis.

Methods: To detect development of rebound phenomena, single dose of CZP (1 mg/kg i.p.) or Ro 19?8022 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) was injected to P12 rats. Seizures were induced by PTZ in doses of 50 (sub-threshold) or 100 (supra-threshold) mg/kg s.c. 12, 24 or 48 h later. To assess changes of seizure susceptibility after chronic administration, animals received either BZ in doses mentioned above for 5 consecutive days starting at P7. PTZ (50 mg/kg s.c.) was injected 2, 4 or 6 d after the last BZ injection. Changes in sensitivity to anticonvulsant effects of BZs after treatment discontinuation were detected in additional groups of animals 1 or 2 days after the end of chronic treatment. Animals received fully anticonvulsant dose of CZP (0.08 mg/kg i.p.) or Ro 19?2088 (0.05 mg/kg i.p.) and 10 min later PTZ in a dose of 100 mg/kg s.c. Incidence and latency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures as well as severity of seizures were registered. Results: After a single injection of tested BZs, anticonvulsant effects expressed as prolongation of GTCS latencies were still observed 12 h (Ro 19?8022) or 24 h (CZP) after injection. In intervals 24 and 48 h, respectively, latencies were however 40?60% shorter compared to untreated controls (p < 0.05). At the same time points, PTZ (50 mg/kg) induced more severe seizures (p < 0.01) with significantly higher incidence of GTCS in BZs-treated rats compared to controls (p < 0.05). Chronic administration of CZP increased both seizure severity and incidence of GTCS for 6 d after the last CZP injection compared to untreated controls (p < 0.05). In contrast, no changes in severity of epileptic phenomena were observed after chronic administration of Ro 19?8022. Neither CZP nor Ro 19?8022 administered chronically changed efficacy of BZs against seizures induced by PTZ (100 mg/kg s.c.) 1 or 2 d after the end of therapy. Conclusions: In immature rats, withdrawal of chronic CZP but not Ro 19?8022 treatment increased severity of PTZ-induced seizures. In contrast, single dose of both CZP and Ro19?8022 led to occurrence rebound phenomenon.

Bergey ( 1 Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Synchronized and recurrent neuronal bursting is a signature of epileptiform activity. Much work has been done on mechanisms underlying these pathological network behaviors. Several mechanisms including membrane after-hyperpolarization and depletion of synaptic transmitter have been recognized as being implicated in the mechanism of recurrent bursting. Using neuronal network models we demonstrate another plausible mechanism for recurrent bursting in disinhibited neuronal networks, caused by short-term (10?100 ms) synaptic depression. Methods: Simulated networks were composed of inhibitory (fast spiking) and excitatory (regular spiking) neurons. Excitatory neurons in response to injected external excitatory current exhibited no spike frequency adaptation. The synaptic weights in networks were dynamically modified with ongoing network activities. To simulate synaptic plasticity we used a phenomenological model in which the synaptic strength change depends on the history of pre-postsynaptic activity and is determined by the synaptic calcium residual level. The networks were activated by action potentials applied at random intervals on inputs of selected excitatory neurons (less then 25% of the total number of neurons). Neuronal bursting in these networks was induced by gradually reducing the excitatory drive to inhibitory neurons. Results: Action potentials applied at random intervals to selected neurons activated the entire network but no bursting behavior was observed. When excitatory drive to inhibitory neurons in these networks was gradually reduced, excitatory neurons exhibited steady, synchronous, and periodic neuronal bursting. Single bursts in neurons lasted for up to 60 ms and were followed by ?100 ms long periods of inactivity. This temporary cessation of single trains of APs in neurons was mediated by synaptic depression. This was confirmed by the two observations: 1) the maximum of short-term synaptic depression of presynaptic connections overlapped with burst cessation in examined excitatory neurons in these networks, and 2) when short-term depression was not simulated there were no bursting behaviors in these networks. The recovery from synaptic depression was always followed by the onset of new bursts in examined neurons, and networks returned to bursting mode. Conclusions: Our results show that short-term plasticity can be a plausible mechanism contributing to the termination of neuronal bursting. In this network model the cessation of single trains result directly from synaptic depression. We specifically utilized a calcium-regulated model of synaptic plasticity. However, other forms of synaptic plasticity matching the time scale of tens of milliseconds might be also responsible for the recurrent cessation of bursting events, including synaptic depletion.

Churn ( 1 Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition charecterized by continuous seizure activity. Previous studies have documented an increase in calcineurin (CaN) activity following SE, as well as an SE-induced increase in the post-synaptic concentration of CaN (Kurz et al. J Neurochem,2001 78:304?15 and Neurobiol Dis,2003 14:483?93). The role of these changes in CaN in the pathology of SE remains unclear. This study examines a potential CaN-dependent modification of the dendritic cytoskeleton involving cofilin activation. CaN has been shown to indirectly induce dephosphorylation of cofilin, an actin depolymerization factor. The ensuing actin depolymerization can lead to a number of physiological changes that are of interest in SE. Methods: Pilocarpine injection was used to induce SE in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. When appropriate, animals were administered 10 mg/kg cyclosporin A or 2.5 mg/kg FK506 i.v. 3h prior to SE. Animals were monitored by video-EEG. At specfic times after the initiation of seizure activity brain tissue was harvested and separated into subcellular fractions by differential centrifugation. Cofilin phosphorylation and total cofilin were assayed by western analysis. CaN activity was assayed via an RII-phosphopeptide based assay. Actin polymerization was assayed both by histochemical means and by determining the ratio of G-to F-actin after separating the two with a solubilization/centrifugation protocol. Results: The immunoreactivity of phosphocofilin decreased significantly in both hippocampal and cortical synaptosomal samples after SE. Hippocampal and cortical phosphocofilin were decreased to approximately 20% of control after 1h of SE (n = 10, p < 0.001). Total cofilin immunoreactivity remained unchanged after 1h of SE, indicating that the loss of phosphocofilin was likely due to dephosphorylation rather than overall loss of cofilin. This dephosphorylation occured as early as 10 min after SE onset, a timeframe that correlates with the timing of the increase in SPM CaN. Cofilin dephosphorylation could be partially blocked by the injection of CaN inhibitors prior to SE, indicating that this process is partially CaN-dependent. Cofilin activation could be further demonstrated by increased actin-cofilin binding on coimmunoprecipitation, which could also be blocked by CaN inhibitors. Finally, SE induced a significant CaN-dependent depolymerization of neuronal actin. Conclusions: The data demonstrate a significant, CaN-dependent activation of cofilin in SE and a subsequent CaN-mediated depolymerization of actin. This research could be applied to explain SE-induced modulation and loss of dendritic spines, as well as changes in receptor localization. Further research into this area may provide useful insights into the pathology of SE and epileptogenic mechanisms.

Lado, 2 Wei Sun, 2 Cynthia Pan, and 2 Hoby Hetherington ( 1 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 2 Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Epilepsy is a common disease disproportionately affecting children. Often, seizures develop months or years ? the ?latent period'?following an initial brain injury, such as an episode of SE in early childhood. Not all individuals with comparable early life SE, however, develop epilepsy. Indeed, only a minority of children at risk subsequently develops epilepsy. To prospectively select children most likely to benefit from antiepileptogenic therapy it is necessary to identify surrogate markers. The recent advances in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) suggest that it may be possible to this tool to identify a surrogate marker of epileptogenesis. Methods: Lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) was induced in 19-day old rat pups. Pups received intramuscular diazepam two hours after onset of SE to reduce mortality. The severity of seizures during SE were scored using the Racine scale. Pups displaying stage 5 seizures were selected for prospective repeated evaluation with MRSI 24 h, 1 wk, 2 wk, 4 wk, 6 wk after SE. MRSI data were acquired with 2ul resolution. Three voxels within each hippocampus (6 voxels per rat) were selected for analysis. Continuous video recordings are analyzed to detect spontaneous seizures in the weeks after SE. In this model, it is expected that approximately 1/3 of rats will have seizures, while the remainder do not. Results: At 24 h after SE, pups showed a 10?20% drop in N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) ratio in the hippocampus. Repeat scans at intermediate intervals show progressive decline in NAA/Cr in most rats undergoing SE, while control levels remain stable or rise. Preliminary evidence in some rats shows that after 6 weeks NAA/Cr may rise. Correlation of MRSI measurements with seizures detected by video recording is ongoing to determine whether the changes observed predict subsequent epileptogenesis. Conclusions: In immature rats, hippocampal NAA/Cr appears to decline for several weeks following SE. Preliminary results suggest there is partial recovery of NAA/Cr in some rats. Whether the degree of NAA/Cr decline, or possibly the extent of recovery, predict subsequent epileptogenesis will be determined as the rats are followed prospectively. (Supported by NINDS NS048149.) 1 Andre H. Lagrange, and 1 Robert L. Macdonald ( 1 Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABARs) produce small but long-lived tonic currents in response to the low levels of ambient GABA (up to ≈1 mM) that are present outside GABAergic synapses. GABARs may also be clustered near synapses (perisynaptic), where they respond to brief surges of extrasynaptic GABA resulting from synaptic overflow. The extrasynaptic GABARs are a mixed population, although α4??δ and α5?3?2L receptors are particularly important in the thalamus and hippocampus. To function efficiently in the extrasynaptic milieu, it has been suggested that these receptors must be non-desensitizing and sensitive to low levels of GABA. Methods: We tested this hypothesis by applying GABA with a rapid drug application system to recombinant GABARs expressed in HEK 293T cells. Results: We report that α4?1δ, α4?2δ, α4?3δ, and α5?3?2L receptors responded to low levels of GABA, although the GABA EC50 varied considerably (α5?3?2L > α4?3δ > α4?1δ > α4?2δ). Since extrasynaptic GABA is thought to change slowly, it is not surprising that all α4??δ combinations activated slowly, requiring nearly 20 ms to reach peak current in response to even saturating GABA concentrations. In contrast, α5?3?2L receptors activated 10 fold more rapidly. All four GABAR isoforms desensitized extensively, with residual currents that were only 30% of peak current during a 4 sec application of 1 mM GABA. Interestingly, the residual currents, generally accepted as measures of tonic inhibition, were very similar at all but the lowest GABA concentrations. However, the GABA concentration producing this maximal ?tonic? current varied from 3?20 ?M, depending on the receptor isoform. Thus, each GABAR responded to its own unique range of GABA concentrations. Finally, α5?3?2L receptors expressed a small spontaneous current (10% of the response to 1 ?M GABA) that was blocked by picrotoxin. This current was not recorded in cells transfected with α1?3?2L, α4?3?2L, α1?3δ or α4?3δ receptors. Conclusions: In summary, we report that the kinetic properties of individual extrasynaptic GABARs are tuned for efficient response to extrasynaptic activation and suggest that the relatively high GABA EC50 and rapid activation of α5?3?2L GABARs renders them ideally suited to function as perisynaptic receptors. Furthermore, a low level of spontaneous activity could allow α5?3?2L GABARs to modulate neuronal activity, even in the absence of ambient GABA. In contrast, the highly sensitive but slowly activating α4??δ GABARs would function well as extrasynaptic receptors. Since ambient GABA levels may be altered during development as well as by drugs and disease states, these findings raise the exciting possibility that selective modulation of extrasynaptic GABAR subtypes may modify specific components of the tonic currents to treat illnesses such as epilepsy.

Corcoran ( 1 Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada ) Rationale: Transfer occurs when kindling of a site reduces the number of stimulations required to kindle subsequently from a secondary site. One explanation of transfer is that kindling of the first site causes other regions to become more susceptible to seizures. Typically only the rate of seizure generalization is affected in transfer, and parameters such as the afterdischarge (AD) threshold in the secondary site are unaltered. It has been reported that prekindling of some brainstem sites results in transfer to forebrain sites, associated with development of classic AD in the brainstem. In our previous studies of brainstem kindling, we observed low amplitude high frequency tightly organized AD, not classic AD. Therefore, we examined the effects of prekindling the brainstem on secondary-site kindling of forebrain sites, to determine whether transfer requires triggering of classic AD in the primary site. Methods: Male Long-Evans rats carried bipolar electrodes aimed at the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis (RPO), mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG), or ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG), with a second electrode aimed at the amygdala. AD thresholds were determined at the brainstem electrode, and the rats received 1-sec trains of balanced square wave stimulation once daily for 30 days. Seven weeks after brainstem kindling the AD threshold of the amygdala was determined. Rats sham-kindled during the 30 days of brainstem stimulation served as the control group. The experimental and control groups were stimulated in the amygdala at AD threshold twice daily, until they had five Stage 5 seizures or until they received 50 stimulations. Twenty-four hr after the last kindling session the AD thresholds were again measured. Results: Prekindling of the RPO, vlPAG and MRF failed to produce transfer to the forebrain, in that kindling at the amygdala proceeded at the rate seen in naive control rats. However, prekindling of the dPAG produced positive transfer to amygdaloid kindling. Unexpectedly, all rats that were prekindled in brainstem sites failed to display a decrease in amygdaloid AD threshold when subsequently subjected to secondary-site kindling of the amygdala, in contrast to the significant decrease in amygdaloid AD threshold displayed by control rats. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prestimulation of brainstem sites results in inhibitory effects on forebrain kindling. The effects are not due to suppression of forebrain-triggered discharge and propagation to distal sites, but reflect inhibition of amygdaloid sensitization to the kindling stimulus. Because brainstem kindling involves low-voltage tightly organized AD, the triggering of classic AD in the brainstem during prekindling is not required for transfer to occur (i.e., dPAG group). Whether primary forebrain kindling affects subsequent brainstem kindling remains to be determined. (Supported by Grants from NSERC and CIHR to MEC.) 1 John G. Lamb, 1 Misty D. Smith-Yockman, 1 Jonathan Constance, 1 Robyn Poerschke, 1 Michael R. Franklin, and 1 Steve H. White ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are man-made ubiquitous environmental contaminants, found as mixtures of more than 200 individual compounds. PCBs are known to cause the induction of drug metabolizing and multidrug transporter enzymes including multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1). We examined the effect of PCB exposure on the expression of MDR1a and MDR1b mRNAs in the rat liver and kidney. The effect of PCB exposure on the effectiveness of phenytoin in the maximal electroshock (MES) test was also examined. Methods: Animals were treated with either corn oil or PCBs (25 mg/kg, i.p.). After 48 hours, groups of animals were dosed with phenytoin (60 mg/kg, p.o.) and subjected to the MES test (bilateral corneal electrical stimulation 150 mA, 0.3 sec.) after two hours. Additional groups of PCB treated animals were pre-treated with clotrimazole (75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2.5 hours prior to phenytoin treatment (to inhibit cytochrome P450 activity) and subjected to the MES test, two hours after phenytoin treatment. The serum level of phenytoin was determined by HPLC analysis. Total RNA was isolated from liver and kidney tissue and the level of MDR1a, MDR1b mRNAs determined by real-time PCR analysis. Results: Significant elevations of MDR1a and MDR1b mRNAs were detected in the liver of PCB treated animals, while only MDR1a mRNA was elevated in the kidney. In the MES test, 7/8 animals were protected by phenytoin in the corn oil control group, while only 2/8 animals were protected in the PCB treated group. HPLC analysis indicated a significant decrease in the level of phenytoin in the serum of the PCB treated animals. Clotrimazole treatment did not affect the number of animals protected against MES by phenytoin (7/8 protected). In PCB treated animals clotrimazole did not fully restore the protection by phenytoin (only 5/8 protected). Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to PCBs causes an increase in the expression of MDR1a mRNA in the liver and kidney, and MDR1b in the liver. PCB exposure also causes a significant decrease in the effectiveness of phenytoin in the MES test. Despite inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity, PCB treatment caused a decrease in the number of animals protected from MES by phenytoin, suggesting a potential role for transporters in the PCB effect. Environmental contaminants may contribute to therapy resistance in epilepsy by multiple mechanisms. (Supported by NO1-NS-4?2359.) 1 Chong L. Lee, 2 James D. Frost Jr., 1 John W.

DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Neuronal activity plays a crucial role in the proper development and maturation of the immature brain. The present project investigates the consequences of activity blockade during critical periods of brain development. Methods: Postnatal day 10 (P10) rats were implanted with a subcutaneous Alzet pump (2 or 4 weeks capacity) filled with 10 ?M tetrodotoxin (TTX). The infusion cannula was implanted either in the cortex or dorsal hippocampus. At the end of the infusion period (at P25 or P39) the pump was removed and animals were implanted with a series of cortical and/or hippocampal silver EEG electrodes. On the following day EEG/video recordings of 2 ? 4 hours duration were initiated. Monitoring was repeated at approximately daily intervals for at least 1 week. All surgical procedures and animal care have been approved by Baylor College of Medicine. Results: To date 35 TTX treated (17 cortical ?1 two weeks and 16 four weeks infusion and 18 hippocampal ? 6 two weeks and 12 four weeks) and 5 vehicle infused (hippocampal ? 4 weeks) animals have been implanted and monitored. All TTX treated animals exhibited high voltage multifocal interictal spiking. A subset of 4 weeks infused animals from each infusion area (3 of 16 cortical and 3 of 12 hippocampal) exhibited sporadic EEG complexes consisting of a generalized slow wave transient, a generalized voltage attenuation (2?4 seconds) or a burst of fast activity (2?4 seconds) .These complexes could occur alone or in various combinations, the most common being a high voltage slow wave complex followed by a generalized voltage attenuation with superimposed fast activity. These complexes could occur in isolation or in clusters and typically occurred on arousal from sleep. These EEG complexes were typically associated behaviorally with a brief tonic spasm, which could be preceded by a body jerk. Some of these animals also exhibited a very high voltage background EEG pattern associated with multifocal sharp wave discharges that resembled the hypsarrhythmic pattern observed in human children with infantile spasms. No seizure activity was observed in 2 week infused animals or in any of the vehicle infused animals. Conclusions: The results suggest that prolonged blockade of neuronal activity during critical periods in early life can induce seizures. Some of these animals exhibited EEG and behavioral phenotypes that are very similar to those found in human cases of infantile spasms.

Prince ( 1 Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA ) Rationale: Na+-K+ ATPase (the ?sodium pump) plays an important role in maintaining ionic gradients in neurons and is expressed in axons where it influences the generation of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events. Blockade of the pump leads to acute epileptiform activity due at least in part to decreases in GABA release. Pump activity is known to be decreased by brain trauma. We therefore assessed anatomical alterations in the pump in a rodent model of chronic posttraumatic epileptogenesis. Methods: Chronic partial isolations of sensori-motor rat cortex were made as previously described. At 7?60d after injury we quantitatively assessed the expression of the neuronal catalytic alpha 3 subunit of Na+-K+ ATPase using standard immunocytochemical techniques, fluorescent and confocal microscopy and image analysis software. Results: Alpha 3 immunoreactivity (IR) was normally prominent in the neuropil and surrounding somata of pyramidal (P) cells in all lamina. The perisomatic IR was colocalized with GAD65 IR and parvalbumin (PV) in presumed inhibitory terminals of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons. Perisomatic alpha 3 Na+-K+ ATPase IR was reduced significantly in partially isolated cortex, without obvious changes in GAD65- or PV-IR. Measurements showed that the interhemispheric differences in alpha3 subunit IR around layer V Pcell somata in partially isolated vrs contralateral cortex were10x greater than interhemispheric differences in controls (p < < 0.05). Such abnormalities were seen 7d following injury, the earliest time point examined (before onset of epileptogenesis in this model), persisted at least 2 mo., and were more marked in 7d vrs 15?30d survivors, but still significant at 15?30d. Conclusions: In the chronically injured, epileptogenic cortex, axons of FS cells, which provide a major component of somatic GABAergic postsynaptic inhibitory innervation in P cells, and the large autaptic input to FS interneurons, contain less Na+-K+ ATPase. Reductions in alpha 3 Na+-K+ ATPase might affect GABA release from inhibitory terminals through depolarization due to increases in both [Na]i and local [K+]o that would be prominent with generation of high frequency discharges such as occur in FS cells normally and during epileptiform activity.

Fisher ( 1 Department of Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA ) Rationale: The incidence of absence epilepsy is higher in females, however, the underlying reasons for this gender asymmetry are unknown. We reported previously that the expression of GABAA receptor subunit ?2 protein levels were decreased in thalamic reticular (nRt) and ventrobasal (VB) nuclei in a group of adult rats (both male and female) after perinatal treatment with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (CSI) AY9944 (Li et al., 2006). We performed studies to evaluate the expression of GABAA receptor α1 and ?2 subunits in thalamic nRt-VB nuclei and somatosensory cortex from male and female rats at ages p35?60 days. Methods: Experiments were carried out according to protocols approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Long-Evans rats were treated with AY9944 (15 mg/kg each) at p1, p5 and p9. Thalamic nRt-VB region, and somatosensory cortex were harvested at p35 and p60. Real-time PCR quantification and Western blot techniques, normalized to control group levels were performed to measure the expression of mRNA and protein levels for α1 and ?2 subunits. Statistical analysis used t-tests with validation on data normalized by log transformations. Results: Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed a gender differential effect of perinatal CSI treatment on expression of GABAA receptor α1 and ?2 subunit mRNA and protein levels in thalamus. At p35, ?2 subunit mRNA levels were decreased in female (control, 1.00 ± 0.04 vs. CSI model, 0.77 ± 0.07, p < 0.02) but not in male thalamus. Corresponding to the decrease of mRNA expression, ?2 protein levels also were decreased in female rats previously given AY9944 (control, 1.00 ± 0.07 vs. CSI model, 0.82 ± 0.04, p < 0.02). At p60, no significant difference was detected in the expression of α1 or ?2 mRNAs. However, reductions of expression of α1 subunit protein levels were seen in female thalamus (control 1.00 ± 0.04 vs. CSI model 0.79 ± 0.04, p < 0.02), but not in male rats. At P60, expression of GABAA receptor ?2 subunit protein also was decreased in the female, but not in the male, thalamus (control 1.00 ± 0.06 vs. CSI model 0.71 ± 0.05, p < 0.01). In contrast, the expression of ?2 subunit protein in CSI model somatosensory cortex was increased in both female and male cortex at age p60, compared to age-matched control somatosensory cortex (female control 1.00 ± 0.06 vs. CSI model 1.15 ± 0.06, p < 0.03; male control 1.00 ± 0.02 vs. CSI model 1.21 ± 0.06, p < 0.02). Conclusions: Perinatal inhibition of cholesterol synthesis differentially alters GABAA receptor subunit expression in male and female rats, demonstrating a decrease of ?2 subunits in female, but not male, thalamic nRt-VB nuclei. Such changes may partially explain the higher incidence of clinical absence epilepsy in female patients.

In adult animals, hyperthermia can aggravate seizure-induced neuronal damage (Liu et al., 1993; Lundgren et al., 1994). However, published reports did not show any additional damage caused by hyperthermic when compared to normothermic seizures in immature brain (Bender et al., 2003; Sarkisian et al., 1999; Toth et al., 1998). To study this problem, we developed a model of lithium-pilocarpine SE in rats at post-natal day 10 (P10), in which we were able to obtain seizures of very similar intensity at a body temperature of 35°C (normothermia) vs 39°C (hyperthermia). Methods: SE was induced in P10 rats with lithium (3mEq/kg, i.p.), and pilocarpine (60 mg/kg, s.c., 24 hours later). Their body temperature was maintained during 30 min of SE at 39 ± 1°C (hyperthermic animals, HT+SE) or at 35 ± 1°C (normothermic animals, NT+SE). Several measures showed seizure severity to be similar in both experimental groups. SE was terminated by diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Control animals received lithium and diazepam in presence of hyperthermia or normothermia. Anesthetized animals were perfused with 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde 24 hours after induction of SE. Each brain was embedded in paraffin and sectioned to 10 uM. The distribution of neuronal injury was evaluated by using Fluoro-jade B staining, whereas the expression of death markers (the active forms of initiator caspase-9 and executioner caspase-3) was assessed by fluorescence immunohistochemistry in adjacent sections. Mode of death (necrotic or apoptotic) from HT+SE and NT+SE animals was defined by electron microscopy. Results: Fluoro-jade B staining showed neuronal injury in CA1, medial amygdala, dentate gyrus inner granule cell layer and cingulate cortex from HT+SE animals. NT+SE animals displayed very mild damage in CA1 and granule cell layer, none in amygdala. No damage was detected in controls. Electron microscopy showed a mixed population of apoptotic and necrotic neurons in CA1 from HT+SE and NT+SE groups. Active caspase-3 immunoreactive neurons were seen in CA1, granule cell layer and cingulate cortex from HT+SE animals, but active caspase-9 staining was limited to granule cell layer and cingulate cortex. Caspase-3 or -9 were not activated in NT+SE animals. Conclusions: Hyperthermia markedly aggravated the severity and the extent of SE-induced neuronal injury through a caspase-3 and/or -9-dependent mechanism.

Schwartz ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Weill-Cornell Medical College, Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY ) Rationale: The hemodynamic changes associated with neuronal activity are the basis for several non-invasive imaging methods, such as fMRI, PET and SPECT. However, the precise spatiotemporal relationship between perfusion, oxygenation and the neuronal dynamic is not well understood since there is no technique for simultaneously measuring neuronal activity and perfusion in a large area of cortex with high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods: Currently, optical recording of voltage sensitive dyes (VSD) offers the best spatial (?50 ?m) and temporal (1ms) resolution for recording neuronal activity from a large area of cortex (several millimeters). Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging offers the best spatial (?50 ?m) and temporal (tens of milliseconds) resolution for recording hemodynamic changes. We developed a technique combining VSD and IOS imaging to simultaneously measure membrane potential, perfusion and hemoglobin oxygenation in vivo. Results: Two illumination sources were employed for VSD (640 ± 10nm, for new blue dye RH-1692) and IOS (570 ± 5 or 605 ± 5) respectively. A 620 nm dichroic mirror was used to separate the VSD (>665 nm) and IOS signals (570 or 605 nm). VSD and IOS responses were simultaneously recorded with two cameras. We compared the IOS result from cortex stained with VSD and IOS result from unstained cortex and found that staining with RH-1692 has no significant effect on the hemodynamic responses. We successfully used this technique in the rat preparation to record interictal events induced with intracortical injection of bicuculline. Conclusions: Simultaneous VSD and IOS recording is a technically feasible method for studying the complex interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity and both increases and decreases in perfusion and oxygenation.

Hintz, 2 Neil J. MacLusky, and 1,3 Helen E. Scharfman ( 1 CNRRR, Helen Hayes Hospital, W. Haverstraw, NY ; 2 Biomed. Sci., University of Guelph, Guleph, ON, Canada ; and 3 Pharmacol.  n = 19/32) vs. sham controls (66%, n = 10/15; p = 0.63). The incidence of CA3 bursts in orchidectomized rats was significantly lower (32%, n = 8/25, n = 4 rats), when tested 12?14 weeks after status, relative to sham and intact rats (pooled; 86%, n = 36/42, n = 7 rats; p = 0.0001). This was unlikely to have been due to differential neuronal damage or sprouting, because they appeared to be similar throughout the septotemporal axis in the two groups. If orchidectomy was conducted after the chronic period was established, it did not stop spontaneous seizures, or have any effect on the incidence of CA3 bursts in slices from these rats (orch., 92%; sham, 100%; p = 1.0). Conclusions: Orchidectomy 2 wks prior to status had no apparent effect on the incidence of status, but it did appear to reduce the incidence of CA3 bursts in slices from rats that were examined during the chronic period in the pilocarpine model. However, orchidectomy after the onset of the chronic period did not influence CA3 bursts. The results suggest that orchidectomy, and most likely testosterone, has a major effect on the development, but not the maintenance, of area CA3 network bursts in the pilocarpine model. This effect would be consistent with recent studies illustrating the influence of testosterone on synaptic remodeling in CA3, and the evidence that synaptic reorganization plays a role in epileptogenesis.

Seyfried ( 1 Biology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA ) Rationale: Glucose uptake into the brain is greater during epileptic seizures than during most other brain activities suggesting a key role for glucose in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. Under conditions of fasting or caloric restriction (CR), however, brain cells can also derive energy from ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, ?-OHB). The high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) was developed as an alternative to fasting for seizure management. We previously showed that CR and a restricted lard-based KD inhibited seizure susceptibility in epileptic EL mice. The EL mouse is a model for age-dependent multifactorial idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and expresses complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. The efficacy of the KD in managing epileptic seizures is dependent on the restriction of caloric intake that lowers glucose thereby allowing the brain to metabolize ketones for energy. KetoCal? (KC) is a commercially prepared soy-oil-based KD for children with a fat to protein carbohydrate ratio of 4:1 and is more palatable than lard-based or medium chain triglyceride (MCT) formulations. In this study we evaluated the antiepileptic and anticonvulsant efficacy of KC in young adult EL mice. Methods: EL mice (about 70 days of age) that experienced at least 2 complex generalized seizures were separated in three groups (n = 8 mice/group) and were fed either a standard high carbohydrate (chow) diet unrestricted (SD-UR), KC unrestricted (KC-UR), or KC restricted (KC-R) to reduce body weight by approximately 20%. Seizure susceptibility, body weights, and food intake were measured once/week over a nine-week treatment period. The handling-induced seizure test was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in each mouse group. Plasma glucose and ?-OHB levels were measured once every three weeks, using enzymatic analyses. Results: Body weights, plasma glucose levels, and seizure susceptibility were significantly lower in the KC-R group over the nine-week testing period than in the SD-UR and KC-UR groups. Plasma ?-OHB levels were significantly higher in the KC-R group (4mM) than in the SD-UR group (0.45 mM) or the KC-UR group (1.1 mM) after week three of the study. Seizure susceptibility was lower (p < 0.05) in the KC-UR group than in the SD-UR group only at the last week of the dietary treatment despite similarities in body weight and glucose levels. Conclusions: KetoCal? is as effective as the lard-based KD in managing IGE in EL mice. No adverse side effects were detected in EL mice receiving KetoCal?. Anticonvulsant efficacy is best when KetoCal? is administered in restricted amounts to lower blood glucose and to elevate blood ketone bodies. We predict that KetoCal? will be effective in the clinic and can be used as a standard ketogenic diet therapy for both human and animal studies.

Laipis ( 1 Anesthesiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 3 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: The mechanisms underlying epileptic activity in untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) patients are not well understood. Based on our previous findings that phenylalanine (Phe) at concentrations found in PKU mouse brain significantly and reversibly depresses glutamatergic synaptic transmission leading to a compensatory increase in the expression and density of glutamate receptors, we hypothesized that seizures in PKU mice might be observed when Phe levels are decreased and glutamatergic activity becomes facilitated. Methods: This hypothesis was tested by examining the susceptibility of PKU mice (female homozygous Pahenu2 BTBR) to audiogenic seizures (AGS) induced by sound stimulus of 118 dB (10?20 kHz). Results: Serum Phe concentrations in PKU mice were more than 10 fold higher than in heterozygous (HET) carriers or wild-type (WT) BTBR mice. Unlike HET carriers or WT mice, adult PKU mice, 8 weeks of age or older, were susceptible to AGS and exhibited dramatic responses with symptoms ranging from uncontrolled running to clonic and tonic convulsions, respiratory arrest, and death. Death could be prevented by pretreatment with oxygen-enriched air. Serum Phe levels in PKU mice could vary significantly with time of day, with an average decrease of 0.53 mM from 9 am to 5 pm. Depending on Phe levels, the same mouse could be either susceptible or resistant to AGS. In general, while adult mice with Phe levels of less than 2 mM routinely exhibited AGS, mice with Phe levels of greater than 2 mM were resistant to the stimulus. Young PKU mice consistently had significantly higher serum Phe levels and were not susceptible to AGS. Serum Phe levels in adult PKU mice could be lowered to normal, or increased to hyperphenylalaninemic concentrations within 12 hours, by switching adult PKU mice from a high to low Phe diet, or vice versa. Susceptibility to AGS disappeared after 12 hours on the low Phe diet. In contrast, more than 7 weeks on a standard diet were necessary before PKU mice, previously maintained for two weeks on a low Phe diet, regained susceptibility to AGS. Conclusions: Complex dependence of AGS on Phe levels indicates that the Phe-induced changes in glutamatergic synaptic transmission may play an important etiological role in PKU seizures. If seizure susceptibility is similarly reversible in human PKU patients, then they may face a risk of becoming susceptible to seizures after relaxing their Phe-restricted diet, perhaps especially with increasing age. Given the known mutation and the well defined biochemical background, the Pahenu2 mouse may become a new valuable model for investigating the mechanisms underlying epileptic activity in general.

Heermann Anesthesia Foundation, Inc.) 1 Alain Matagne, 1 Doru-Georg Margineanu, 1 Karine Leclercq, 1 Donald Dassesse, 1 Nathalie Lambeng, and 1 Henrik Klitgaard ( 1 CNS Research, UCB S.A., Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium ) Rationale: SV2A is the most abundant isoform of SV2, a membrane glycoprotein common to all synaptic vesicles. This protein was recently reported (Lynch et al., PNAS 101:9861?66, 2004) to be the binding site of the newer generation antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam (Keppra?). The purpose of this study was to characterize the potential epilepsy-phenotype of mice lacking SV2A. Methods: SV2A KO mice were generated by using targeted gene disruption in S. Bajjalieh's laboratories at the University of Washington, Seattle (Crowder et al., PNAS 96:15268?73, 1999). Homozygous SV2A KO mice display severe seizures and are not viable beyond 2 weeks, thus precluding phenotyping in adults. In contrast, heterozygous SV2A KO mice (SV2A ±) are viable. In this study, we compared SV2A ± mice to wild type (WT) controls with respect to acute seizure susceptibility in response to both electrical and chemical stimulation. Evoked field potentials were recorded in the CA3, CA1 and DG areas of hippocampal slices in vitro. Different groups of animals, aged 2 months, were used for each experiment. Results: The electrical seizure threshold intensity inducing tonic hind limb extension after corneal electrode stimulation was comparable between SV2A ± and WT mice (n = 19?16/group). Similarly, there was no difference between SV2A ± and WT mice in the threshold dose inducing generalized clonic seizures after continuous intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazole (n = 25/group). In contrast, the (stimulus intensity) ? (population spike) curves of the field potentials recorded from hippocampal slices showed a higher excitability in the CA3 area in slices from SV2A ± mice compared to WT controls. Likewise, kindling acquisition induced by twice daily corneal electrode stimulations (2 mA for 3 s) was markedly accelerated in SV2A ± mice compared to WT (n = 10/group). The induction of secondary generalized motor seizures in all SV2A ± mice was reached after up to 12 repeated stimulations whereas up to 22 stimulations were necessary to reach this end point in WT mice. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest a key role of the SV2A protein in the establishment of a chronic epileptic condition, consonant with the seizure phenotype observed in SV2A homozygous mice. This supports that SV2A is the principal mechanism for the antiepileptic action of levetiracetam.

Moreover, neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA3 region was significantly severer in FVB/N than in C57BL/6. In the present study, we investigated the serial changes of GABA and Glutamate concentration in the left hippocampus after KA microinjection into the amygdala in mice with different strains, C57BL/6 and FVB/N. Methods: Forty-eight male adult mice with two strains (n = 24, respectively) underwent a stereotactic operation using the units for stereotactic coordinates under pentobarbital anesthesia (10 mg/kg i.p.). For microinjection, a stainless steel cannula (outer diameter, 0.6 mm) with an inner needle guide (diameter, 0.3 mm) was inserted into the left amygdala (LA). On the seventh days after surgery, all animals received 0.5 microg of KA into the LA. Two hours (n = 12, respectively) or 48 hours (n = 12, respectively) after KA injection, animals were decapitated and the ipsilateral hippocampus were removed. Intrahippocampal GABA and glutamate were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were analyzed statistically between C57BL/6 and FVB/N by using Student's t-test. In controls (n = 12, respectively), PBS was injected into the LA. They likewise were quantitatively measured using HPLC. Results: There was no significant difference concerning Glutamate and GABA concentration between two strains 2 hours after KA injection. Forty-eight hours after KA injection, however, GABA concentration of the C57BL/6 was significantly higher than that of the FVB/N, while there was no significant difference of glutamate concentration between two strains. In control, there was no significant difference between two strains concerning both GABA and Glutamate concentration 2 and 48 hours after PBS injection. Conclusions: The less seizure susceptibilities of the C57BL/6 may be associated with the intrahippocampal higher GABA concentration than that of FVB/N. This result will contribute to reveal the molecular mechanism of both strains, FVB/N and C57BL/6.

Mazarati, 2 Linda Lundstrom, 1 Don Shin, 2 Ulo Langel, and 1 Raman Sankar ( 1 Pediatrics-Neuro, David School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Neurochemistry, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden ) Rationale: Galanin is a neuropeptide with well established anticonvulsant effects in acute seizure models. No data are available onto whether galanin might inhibit epileptogenesis. In the hippocampus, galanin acts at two G protein-coupled receptor types ? GalR1 and GalR2. We examined antiepileptogenic potential of selective GalR1 and GalR2 agonist to in kindling model, and examined putative downstream pathway that mediate anticonvulsant effects of galanin. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats received 24 hour long intrahippocampal infusion of a non ? selective GalR1/GalR2 agonist galanin (1?29), selective GalR1 agonist synthetic peptide M617, or selective GalR2 agonist galanin (2?11). The peptides were administered alone, or combined with an inhibitor of Gi/o protein pertussis toxin (PTX); blocker of G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK) ? tertiapin Q (TPQ); Gq/11 protein inhibitor [D-Arg1,D-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]-substance P (dSP); or an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release dantrolene. Sixteen hours into drug delivery, the animals were subjected to rapid kindling ? sixty electrical trains administered to ventral hippocampus every 5 minutes. Hippocampal afterdischarge properties before and after treatment, as well as before and after kindling, and the number of stimulations required to reach each consecutive behavioral seizure score (1 through 4) were analyzed. Results: Activation of hippocampal GalR1 delayed, but did not prevent kindling progression. Twenty four hours after kindling, M617 ? treated animals exhibited the decrease of afterdischarge threshold and developed stage 4?5 seizures in response to threshold stimulation, similar to control. GalR1/GalR2 and GalR2 agonists completely prevented both the development of full motor seizures in the course of kindling, and the decrease of afterdischarge threshold 24 hours after kindling procedure. Anticonvulsant effect of GalR1 was not observed in the presence of Gi/o and GIRK inhibitors. Antiepileptogenic action of GalR2 agonist was PTX- sensitive, but GIRK ? independent. Furthermore, inhibition of Gi/o by PTX changed antiepileptogenic effects of galanin (1?29) and of galanin (2?11) to proconvulsant. Inhibition of Gq/11 and of intracellular Ca++ release eliminated proconvulsant effect of PTX+galanin (1?29) and PTX+galanin (2?11) combinations. Conclusions: We conclude that hippocampal GalR1 exert disease ? modifying effect through Gi-GIRK pathway. GalR2 is antiepileptogenic through Gi mechanism, which does not involve GIRK. Our studies also revealed a secondary proconvulsant pathway coupled to GalR2, which involves Gq/11 and intracellular Ca2+. The data are important for understanding endogenous mechanisms regulating epileptogenesis, and for the development of novel antiepileptogenic drugs.

Sosunov ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Neurology, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY ; and 3 Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Prominent astrogliosis is a typical feature of cortical tubers in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). The relationship of these changes to mTOR activation, and the characteristics of tuberous astrogliosis in comparison to astrocytic changes in other human epilepsies have not been investigated. Methods: Neocortical and hippocampal specimens obtained during surgery on pharmaco-resistent MTLE (46 cases) and tuberous sclerosis complex (12 cases) were studied with immunohistochemistry. Results: Most tuber astrocytes reveal high similarity to fibrous-like astrocytes seen in areas of sclerosis in MTLE. These astrocytes differ drastically from protoplasmic astrocytes found in cortex surrounding tubers in TSC and in control human neorcortex or lateral neocortex in cases of human MTLE. Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of sclerotic and tuber astrocytes revealed that they are both characterized by increased GFAP expression and length of cell processes, accompanied by decreased expression of glutamine synthetase and astrocyte-specific glutamate transport proteins. A subpopulation of astrocytes in tubers reveal upregulation of mTOR pathway, based on immunostaining for phospho-p70S6kinase, phospho-S6, phospho-STAT3, and phospho-4E-BP1. This mTOR activation is similar to that previously shown in giant cells (Baybis et al., 2004; Miyata et al., 2004). Acutely reactive astrocytes observed in surgically resected brain tissue from MLTE patients also revealed immunostaining for downstream components of the mTOR cascade. Conclusions: Two types of astrrocytes are found in human tubers: 1) mTOR activated cells similar to acutely reactive human astrocytes; 2) Sclerotic/gliotic astrocytes similar to human astrocytes in areas of sclerosis in MTLE. We hypothesize that activation of the mTOR pathway in tuber astrocytes due to TSC1 or TSC1 genes mutations leads to stepwise phenotypic transformation of astrocytes from reactive to sclerotic/gliotic cells. TSC may thus represent a genetic model of human astrogliosis found in other pathologies such as MTLE, stroke, and head trauma. The possible molecular mechanisms linking mTOR pathway activation, GFAP overproduction, and the appearance of fibrous-like astrocytes are being investigated.

Nicoll ( 1 Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Increased excitatory drive in the thalamocortical network is thought to underlie absence seizures. Mutations in channels that mediate neuronal inhibition have been found in patients with familial forms of the disorder. However, the mutation in the Stargazer mouse, an animal model for absence epilepsy, primarily affects excitatory glutamatergic transmission via AMPA receptors. To date, stargazin and its related family members, the Transmembrane AMPA receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs), have only been shown to regulate synaptic AMPA receptor function in excitatory neurons. However, if TARPs also regulate AMPA receptors in inhibitory GABAergic neurons, the lack of inhibition may lead to seizure activity. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine if TARPs regulate AMPA receptors in GABAergic neurons. Methods: Single and double knockout mice for TARP isoforms ?2 (stargazin) and ?3 were generated. Western blotting was used to analyze AMPA receptor content in different brain regions. Synaptic AMPA receptor currents were measured with standard electrophysiological techniques in acute brain slices and dissociated neurons. Results: Single ?3-/- knockout mouse were indistinguishable from littermates. However, ?2-/- ?3-/- double knockout mice were severely impaired and generally died before the 2nd postnatal week. Western Blot analysis of ?2-/- ?3-/- double knockout mice found no change of AMPA receptor expression in most brain regions. Electrophysiological analysis of the GABAergic Purkinje neurons found a severe reduction of AMPA receptor mediated synaptic transmission in ?2-/- mice, which was not increased in ?2-/- ?3-/- double knockout mice. A specific GABAergic interneuron population was found to be unaffected in single ?2-/- and ?3-/- knockout mice, but showed a nearly complete loss of synaptic AMPA receptors in ?2-/- ?3-/- double knockout mice. Conclusions: TARPs regulate AMPA receptors in GABAergic neurons, in addition to excitatory neurons. They can serve redundant roles as evidenced by the increasingly severe phenotype of double knockout mice.

Rogawski, and 3 Stefano Vicini ( 1 Department of Neurology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ; 2 Department of Physiology  and 3 Epilepsy Research Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Cooling terminates extracellularly recorded spontaneous epileptiform discharges induced by chemoconvulsants in the hippocampal slice (G.K. Motamedi et al., Epilepsy Res., in press). Small temperature drops are effective when cooling is applied rapidly. Here we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of rapid cooling on epileptiform activity in different regions of the hippocampus. Methods: Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out from neurons in mouse hippocampal slices perfused with 50 mM 4-aminopyridine at an initial temperature of 32 °C. Rapid cooling was induced at a rate of 2?3 °C/s by switching to cold aCSF. Results: In CA1 and CA2 neurons, rapid cooling typically induced a 10?20 mV membrane depolarization associated with a large inward current, which was eliminated by 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX). In contrast, most CA3 neurons responded to cooling with TTX- and bicuculline (25 mM)-insensitive hyperpolarizations that were associated with a steady outward current and decreased conductance. Conclusions: Termination of epileptiform discharges in CA1 and CA2 neurons by rapid cooling may occur by synaptically-driven depolarization block. In CA3 neurons, cooling seems to inhibit a persistent depolarizing conductance, raising the possibility that closure of temperature sensitive TRP channels could mediate the suppression of discharges. (Supported by Grant # R01 NS047700 to S.V.) 1 Alberto E. Musto, and 1 Nicolas G. Bazan ( 1 Neuroscience Center of Excellence, Louisiana State University-Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA ) Rationale: Modifications of pyramidal and interneuronal network in neurological disorders are correlated by shape waves and rhythms from electroencephalogram (EEG). Unfortunately how this network participates in epileptogenesis is not yet clear. Methods: Kindling protocol is achieved by stimulating six times daily during 4 days with sub-convulsive electrical stimulations in the dorsal right hippocampus using bipolar electrode units. Spikes and behavioral responses are quantified in order to confirm the progress of kindling. The EEG obtained is recorded using Enhanced Graphics Acquisition for Analysis (RS Electronics Inc.) and offline sort spikes (Plexon Inc.), and analyzed using Neuroexplorer Software (Next Technology) (Musto and Bazan, 2006, Epilepsia, 47:267?76). Results: Spikes and semiological score increase during kindling. Different patterns are discriminated within afterdischarge. A spike-wave pattern appears immediately after the stimulation in combination with a poly-spike complex superimposed over the wave (AD1) and it is followed by another poly-spike complex (AD2). AD2 is followed by a progressive modification of synchronized spikes (AD3). The spreading depression like event (SD) is present at the end of each AD3. Theta oscillation predominates since the first two days of kindling and apparition of significative gamma oscillation is observed within AD2 and precedes the full kindled state. Conclusions: Pyramidal-interneuron network could work properly immediately after each stimulation and could be necessary, but not sufficient for epileptogenesis. The trigger of this oscillation could lead to a mechanism of desynchronisation and synchronism within neuronal network during epileptogenesis. Since a gamma rhythm precedes the generalized seizure, this could be a target for therapeutic intervention. (Supported by NIH Grant: NS 23002.) 1 Prosper N'Gouemo, 2 Carl L. Faingold, and 3 Martin Morad ( 1 Pediatrics, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC ; 2 Pharmacology, Sourthern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL ; and 3 Pharmacology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC ) Rationale: The inferior colliculus (IC) neurons are thought to be critical in the initiation of audiogenic reflex seizures in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR). We previously reported that high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channel current density was markedly enhanced in IC neurons of seizure-naive GEPR-3. Ca2+ currents are known to activate K+ currents that initiate the repolarization of action potential and hyperpolarize the membrane. Such Ca2+-activated K+ currents may represent intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms that would restore the resting state and maintain normal physiological excitability. Whether change in Ca2+-activated K+ current density parallel the upregulation of HVA Ca2+ channel current density reported in IC neurons of GEPR-3 is as yet unknown. Here we report on the expression of Ca2+-activated K+ currents in IC neurons and their modification in seizure-naive GEPR-3. Methods: Acutely dissociated neurons of the IC central nucleus were obtained from male seizure-naive GEPR-3s (12?15 week-old) and age-matched control Sprague-Dawley rats. The currents through K+ channels were recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp techniques. Ca2+-activated K+ currents were recorded in the presence of 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, while dialyzing the neurons with 100 nM free Ca2+ (buffered with 0.5 mM EGTA and Ca2+). Currents were normalized relative to the membrane capacitance as an estimate of current density. Results: Quantification of the current evoked at +20 mV (holding potential ?50 mV) showed that the mean peak current density of total Ca2+-activated K+ current was decreased by ?40% in IC neurons of seizure-naive GEPR-3 (n = 3 cells, 3 rats) that expressed elevated HVA Ca2+ channel current density, as compared to controls (n = 8 cells, 3 rats) Quantification of the voltage dependence of total Ca2+-activated K+ current shows a downregulation of the current density at all voltages tested, on the average, by 60 ± 6% in IC neurons of the GEPR-3 (n = 3 cells, 3 rats), as compared to controls (n = 8 cells, 3 rats). We are currently examining the contribution of various fraction of the current carried by large and small conductance subtype of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Conclusions: The data suggest that Ca2+-activated K+ current density is downregulated and parallel the enhancement of HVA Ca2+ channel current density in IC neurons of seizure-naïve GEPR-3. The upregulation of HVA Ca2+ channel current density and downregulation of Ca2+-activated K+ current density may provide a cohesive mechanism for neuronal hyperexcitability that lead to seizures and mechanistic insights into therapeutic strategies for generalized epilepsy.

Emond, 1 Pablo Lema, and 1 Lionel Carmant ( 1 Research Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Abnormal neurogenesis secondary to status epilepticus (SE) is thought to be involved in epileptogenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the use of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist AIDA limits epileptogenesis and prevents SE-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and hilus. The goal of this study was therefore to explore the specific role of group I mGluR in the abnormal neurogenesis. In this study, group I mGluRs were activated by two agonists. The first agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), activates both subtype 1 and 5 of the group I mGluRs and the second, 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), selectively activates subtype 5. Methods: The agonists were given by intra-cerebro ventricular injection (ICV) in adult (P60) male Sprague-Dawley rats. The agonists were diluted in saline solution (S) and given at doses of 0.83 ?mol/10 ?l for DHPG and 3.33 ?mol/10 ?l for CHPG. Control rats received the same volume of S. To assess neurogenesis, rats of each experimental and control group were given two injections of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) within a two-hour interval and sacrificed 24 hrs after the second injection. This was done at three time-points after agonist injection (7, 14 and 56 days). Immunohistochemical treatment and cell counting techniques were then performed on the brain tissue. Results: No acute convulsion was observed in the different groups. Animals tolerated well their treatment. BrdU-positive cells were found in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in all groups including controls. An increase of 64% in BrdU-positive cells was observed 7 days after CHPG injection and of 11% post DHPG compared to control rats. Fourteen days after agonist injection the levels were at 47% and 38% for CHPG and DHPG respectively. At 56 days post-injection these levels were lower than that of the controls with a decrease in BrdU-positive cells of 28% for CHPG and of 64% for DHPG compared to controls. Conclusions: These results show that the activation of group I mGluR plays a role in neurogenesis in the adult rat hippocampus. It seems that group I mGluR subtype 5 might have a more important implication than subtype 1 in the activation of neurogenesis in the adult rat hippocampus. We now need to define their contribution in SE.

No spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS are observed in rats younger than 30 days of age. In order to determine whether there is a relationship between the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges and development of kindling, we examined amygdala kindling rate and spike-and-wave discharges in 20-day (PN20) and 30-day old (PN30) GAERS. Methods: Electrodes for stimulation and recording were stereotaxically implanted into basolateral amygdala and cortex of male Wistar (n = 12) and GAERS (n = 16) pups. After a recovery period of 24 h, animals were stimulated at 400 microA (80 Hz, each 1 msec in duration, for a total duration of 2 sec) every 20 min in PN20 and 90 min in PN30 groups. Animals received kindling stimulations until they achieved three stage 5 or the maximum number of stimulations (35). Seizures were scored by using Racine's 5-stage scale. EEGs from amygdala and cortex recorded continously before and after each stimulus to analyze spike-and-wave discharges and afterdischarge durations. Results: PN 20 GAERS and non-epileptic Wistar rats show no difference to achieve stage 5 during the kindling progress. Seven out of 9 GAERS animals reached stage 5 and 2 GAERS stayed at stage 2 after application of 35 stimulations in the PN30 GAERS group. The amygdala kindling rate of the 7 kindled animals in the PN30 GAERS group was significantly slower than that seen in non-epileptic animals. Afterdischarge durations of all groups were similar to each other. Spike-and-wave discharges appeared in PN30 GAERS and no spike-and-wave discharge was observed in PN20 GAERS group. The data of cumulative spike-and-wave discharge show a significant increase in post-stimulation 0?10 min period when compared to pre-stimulation period in PN30 GAERS. Kindling-induced increase in spike-and-wave discharges is specifically observed in the 7 kindled PN30 GAERS. In detail, number of spike-and-wave discharges statistically increased whereas mean duration of spike-and-wave complex did not change. Conclusions: These findings suggest that GAERS pups are more prone to develop kindled seizures than adults and resistance to kindling in GAERS is age-related. Ontogenesis of spike-and-wave discharge seems to be involved in the resistance to kindling. The increase in spike-and-wave discharges in postictal state indicates involvement of thalamus and enhanced activity of thalamic nuclei that are responsible for spike-and-wave activity. In addition, the increased spike-and-wave response to kindling stimulations might be a homeostatic mechanism to restore excitatory drive of circuitry involved in kindling progress.

Through its numerous and complex connections within and beyond the limbic system, the cingulate cortex plays different physiological roles that make of it an eclectic structure. According to Vogt et al. (Science 1979; 204:205?207; Vogt et al., Cereb Cortex, 1992; 2:435?443) two main subdivisions can be identified within the cingulate cortex: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the posterior cinguate cortex (PCC), the first being characterized by a high density of opioid receptors (Vogt et al., Exp Neurol, 1995; 135:83?92). To date, many studies have focused on the role of the ACC in pain, but little is known about its involvement in epilepsy. Here we investigate the role of mu-opiod receptors, which are capable of hyperpolarizing interneurons (Tanaka and North, J Neurosci, 1994; 14: 1106?1113), in the control of epileptiform activity in an in vitro rodent model of epilepsy. Methods: Field potential recordings were obtained from ACC deep layers in coronal slices of adult rat brains. 4-aminopyridine (4AP) 50 uM was bath-applied for ≥ 1 hour to induce epileptiform activity. Drugs were bath-applied. Results: 4AP-induced epileptiform activity was characterized by prolonged ictal-like discharges (mean duration = 35.2 ± 4.4 s, mean interval = 310.1 ± 34.2 s; n = 9) that were preceded by a slow negative-going event. Ictal-like activity was reversibly abolished by the NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquino-xaline-2,3-dione (CPP, 10uM) and turned into brief epileptiform events (mean duration = 2.6 ± 0.1 s, mean interval 15.2 ± 1.9 s; n = 3) when GABAergic system was blocked by picrotoxin 50uM plus CGP 55845 4uM, GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists respectively. [D-ala2, N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAGO) 10 uM, a mu-opioid receptors agonist, decreased and eventually abolished ictal-like discharges. This effect was reversed by naloxone 10 uM, an opioid antagonist. Finally, DAGO had no apparent effect on the brief epileptiform discharges recorded after GABAergic system blockade. Conclusions: These results suggest that the ACC is capable of generating epileptiform discharges that primarily depend on NMDA receptors activation. In addition they suggest that opioid receptors may play a critical role in controlling seizures. This action may be mediated via modulation of GABAergic interneuron activity.

The neurologic phenotype of fragile X patients includes epilepsy and it is well reproduced in the fmr1 knockout mice, considered a genetic model of epilepsy. The subiculum belongs to the limbic system and plays a crucial role in initiating epileptiform discharges and in gating hippocampal outputs. This gating function depends on GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition, which is important in controling hyperexcitability both at synaptic (GABAA phasic inhibition) and extrasynaptic (GABAA tonic inhibition) levels. In preliminary electrophysiological studies we have found a loss of GABAergic tonic inhibition in the subiculum of seizure prone fragile X knockout mice. In addition, altered expression of α5 and δ GABAA receptor subunits, which compose receptors mediating tonic inhibition, have been reported in other models of epilepsy. Thereby, in the present study we investigated at the molecular level whether a possible loss of GABAergic tonic inhibition occurs in the subiculum of fragile X versus wild type (wt) mice. Methods: We performed real time RT-PCR experiments with RNAs extracted from subiculum of age-matched fragile X and wt mice. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) housekeeping genes ? reported as suitable for RNA quantification (Radonic et al. 2003) ? were used as reference genes. Using the Pfaffl method (Pfaffl, 2001), we calculated R values (level of expression relative to control) for GABAAα5 and δ subunits genes. Results: GABAAα5 and δ subunits genes were consistantly underexpressed in fragile X mice: for GABAAα5 R = 0.779 ± 0.022 with GAPDH (n = 8) and 0.729 ± 0.017 with TBP (n = 3); for GABAAδ R = 0.829 ± 0.021 with GAPDH (n = 8) and 0.808 ± 0.033 with TBP (n = 3). So the α5 subunit gene expression was decreased by 22% (GAPDH) to 27% (TBP), and the δ subunit gene expression was decreased by 17% (GAPDH) to 20% (TBP) in fragile X versus wt mice. This mild but reproductible decrease was significant: mean R values were different from 1 with a T-test (p values < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that a down-regulation of subunits involved in GABAergic tonic inhibition occurs at the level of RNA in the subiculum of fragile X knockout mice versus control.

Patel, and 1 Li-Ping Liang ( 1 Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: Free iron is an important catalyst for the initiation and propagation of free radical reactions and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neuronal disorders. Studies in our laboratory have shown that status epilepticus (SE) results in increased mitochondrial superoxide production. The toxicity of superoxide radical is mediated in part via the release of redox-active iron from cellular iron stores including labile iron-sulfur centers. The role of intracellular iron in mediating seizure-induced brain damage is unknown.The goal of this study was to determine whether kainate-induced SE produces changes in mitochondrial iron levels, whether this correlates with mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress and if SE-induced oxidative stress can be ameliorated with a cell-permeable iron chelator. Methods: Rats were injected with with 12 mg/kg kainic acid and hippocampal mitochondria were analyzed for chelatable (free) iron measured by the bleomycin method 24, 48 and 96 hr post-KA. N,N'-bis (2-hydroxybenzyl) ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED), a synthetic lipophilic cell-permeable chelator was used as an iron chelator. Brain HBED concentrations, reduced and oxidized glutathione levels and the oxidative DNA lesion 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG/2DG) were measured by an HPLC method coupled with electrochemical detection. Results: Kainate-induced SE in rats resulted in a time-dependent increase in chelatable iron in mitochondrial fractions of the hippocampus. The time-course of the iron changes paralleled the inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase, DNA oxidation (8OHDdG/2DG) and glutathione depletion. Systemically administered HBED, a synthetic iron chelator ameliorated SE-induced changes in chelatable iron and oxidative stress. Furthermore, measurement of brain HBED levels confirmed its penetration in hippocampal tissue. Conclusions: These results suggest a role for mitochondrial iron in the pathogenesis of SE-induced brain damage and iron chelation as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of epileptic brain damage.

Patrylo, 1 Isha Tyagi, 1 Amy Willingham, 2 Sung Lee, and 2 Anne Williamson ( 1 Physiology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Carbondale, IL ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: The elderly have the highest incidence and prevalence for seizure disorders with up to 50% of cases having no identifiable antecedent. Rodents also exhibit an aging-related increase in seizure susceptibility with aged rats having a higher frequency of wet-dog shakes and a shorter latency to onset for hippocampal-associated seizures and status epilepticus during kainate-treatment. Based on kainate's mode of action, we hypothesize that these differences reflect pro-convulsive changes in limbic circuitry. To test this hypothesis, electrophysiological recordings were performed in brain slices. The dentate gyrus was our model region since it is involved in generating wet-dog shakes and limbic seizures, and it is affected preferentially with age. Methods: Field potential and whole-cell recordings were used to assess dentate circuitry and function in brain slices from adult (3?8 mo.) and aged (22?32 mo.) Fischer 344 rats. Results: No aging-related differences were noted in the maximal amplitude of orthodromic evoked field potential responses, or paired-pulse inhibition and facilitation (10 and 50 ms interpulse intervals). However, 5 Hz orthodromic stimulation (10 s) evoked multiple population spikes in 40% of aged slices (n = 10) vs. 0% of adult slices (n = 9; p = 0.033; chi-square). Further, when the dentate's capacity to filter 5 Hz afferent input was assessed by recording in CA3, approximately 30% of aged slices (n = 21) exhibited multiple spikes during the train which often progressed into spontaneous interictal-like events. Similar activity was not seen in adult slices (n = 16; p = 0.036; chi-square). Whole cell recordings revealed no aging-related differences in the membrane properties of granule cells within the linear portion of the IV curve (adult n = 22; aged n = 26), or the conductances and reversal potentials of the fast and slow IPSPs evoked with molecular layer stimulation (adult n = 17; aged n = 21). In contrast, aged granule cells (n = 21) did exhibit a 50% reduction in the frequency of spontaneous IPSPs, compared to adults (n = 20; p < 0.0001; ANOVA). Further, following disinhibition, aged granule cells (n = 16) had an increased probability for generating spontaneous large amplitude prolonged EPSPs (100?400 ms duration; > 10 mV amplitude) compared to adult granule cells (n = 18; p < 0.05; ANOVA). Conclusions: These data reveal that the capacity of the dentate gyrus to respond to and filter afferent input is altered in a pro-convulsive manner in aged rats. Further, these aging-related changes are associated with a compromise in inhibition and an increase in local excitatory activity. These changes could contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to wet-dog shakes and limbic seizures in aged rats during systemic kainate treatment and could contribute to the compromise in spatial learning and memory seen with age. (Supported by NIA and EFA.) 1 Bi-wen Peng, 1 William A. Swan, and 1 Russell M. Sanchez ( 1 Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX ) Rationale: A-type K+ channels can critically determine neuronal excitability and shape spiking patterns. Pharmacological blockade of A-type currents (IA) induces limbic seizures (Juhng et al., 1999 Epilepsy Res 23:675), and decreased or absent IA in principal hippocampal neurons may promote seizures in multiple epilepsy models (Bernard, et al., 2004 Science 305:532; Castro, et al., 2001 J Neurosci 21: 6626). Hypoxia is a major cause of neonatal encephalopathy and seizures, and can lead to epilepsy, but the consequences of an acute episode of seizure-inducing hypoxia are not fully understood. In the current study, we asked whether IA may be altered in hippocampal neurons following neonatal seizure-inducing hypoxia. We examined this in dentate granule cells, as the dentate gyrus is widely believed to gate the propagation of limbic seizures. Methods: Spontaneous seizures were induced by global hypoxia in P10 Long-Evans rat pups (5?7%O2 for 15 min; rectal temp. maintained at 33?34 deg. C.). Whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings were obtained from visually identified dentate gyrus granule cells in hippocampal slices excised 30 min to 7 days post-hypoxia. The magnitude and voltage-dependence of IA, and spiking behavior was compared between control and hypoxia-treated groups. Results: IA was observed in all recorded dentate granule cells (n = 57 control; n = 79 hypoxia). In the hypoxia-treated group, IA amplitude was decreased to 61% of control at maximal activation with no change in the voltage-dependence of activation or steady-state inactivation. Under current-clamp, depolarizing current injection from near rest (?60 to ?65 mV) elicited similar spike patterns between the two groups. However, depolarizing steps to the same absolute current from a negative conditioning potential (?80 mV) to partially remove steady-state IA inactivation revealed a longer delay to initial spike onset in the control (51 ± 3 ms) compared to the hypoxia-treated (15 ± 1 ms) group. This decreased spike latency also was associated with an increased spike frequency in the hypoxia-treated group under this experimental condition. No clear time-dependent differences were observed across days post-hypoxia. Conclusions: Our data indicated that IA was decreased in dentate granule cells acutely and for at least one week following perinatal seizure-inducing hypoxia. Additionally, this decrease in IA was associated with an increased propensity for more rapid action potential firing in response to depolarization from hyperpolarization within a physiological range. Given that the dentate gyrus is widely believed to gate the propagation of limbic epileptiform activity, the observed decrease in IA may decrease this gating function by increasing the intrinsic excitability of dentate granule cells.

Houser ( 1 Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Research Service, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) appear to be particularly important in activity-dependent forms of plasticity. While previous studies have reported a significant increase in phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels in the hippocampus following the induction of severe seizures, it is unknown whether ERK is activated during spontaneous seizures. The goals of this study were to determine if ERK phosphorylation increases after spontaneous seizures and describe the time course and distribution of pERK labeling. Methods: Adult C57BL/6 mice were injected with pilocarpine (320 mg/kg) to induce status epilepticus that was then stopped by injection of diazepam (5 mg/kg) 2 h after seizure onset. Beginning two weeks after status epilepticus, animals were observed for spontaneous behavioral seizures and perfused transcardially with fixative at intervals between 2 min and 24 h after the onset of spontaneous seizures. Tissue containing the hippocampal formation was processed for immunohistochemical localization of pERK. Results: In control mice, moderate to strong pERK immunoreactivity was detected in cell bodies and dendrites of neurons that were scattered throughout the hippocampal formation. Labeled neurons were most prominent in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, subiculum and entorhinal cortex. In mice sacrificed 24 h and longer after spontaneous seizures (n = 22), pERK labeling was substantially decreased throughout the hippocampal formation. However, as early as 2 min after the onset of a spontaneous seizure (n = 5), the cell bodies of many dentate granule cells were moderately to strongly labeled. Increased pERK immunoreactivity was also evident in the entorhinal cortex, subiculum and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. At this time point, pERK labeling in the neocortex was also increased but to a lesser extent than in the hippocampal formation. By 5 min after the onset of spontaneous seizure (n = 3), moderate to strong pERK labeling was evident in virtually all dentate granule cells, the majority of CA1 pyramidal cells and numerous neurons in the entorhinal cortex. At 15 min after spontaneous seizures (n = 6), pERK labeling in these regions was lower than at earlier time points. By 30 min and longer after spontaneous seizures, pERK-immunoreactivity had returned to very low levels, similar to that in animals at 24 h or more after spontaneous seizures. Conclusions: ERK was activated in neurons throughout the hippocampal formation near the time of spontaneous seizures. This seizure-related phosphorylation of ERK could be detected early but for only a short period. The functional significance of such ERK activation is unknown but could be part of the seizure initiation process and potentially contribute to long-term plastic changes in the epileptic animals.

Miller ( 1 Deptartment of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany ; and 2 Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: Accumulating data indicate that seizure-induced upregulation of the multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), can contribute to pharmacoresistance. Enhanced Pgp expression in brain capillary endothelial cells seems to limit brain penetration of antiepileptic drugs. Thus, interaction with factors mediating seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp may be one strategy to limit the development of pharmacoresistance. There is evidence that cyclooxygenase (COX) may be involved in seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp. On one hand COX is induced by seizure activity and on the other hand COX can induce Pgp expression. In the present study, we tested whether COX inhibition can prevent induction of Pgp by seizure activity. Methods: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in rats by fractionated pilocarpine administration (10 mg/kg i.p. every 30 min). Eighteen animals received daily i.p. injections of the COX inhibitor indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg i.p. 2 times daily) starting at the day before status epilepticus induction. Twelve rats received corresponding vehicle injections. SE duration was limited to 90 min using diazepam. Rats were perfused two days following SE. Pgp expression was analyzed in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex by immunhistochemistry. Expression of both groups with SE was compared with that of an additional control group (n = 8) which received vehicle injections, but in which no SE was induced. Results: Severity of SE was not influenced by indomethacin treatment. However, exitus during SE and at the day following SE was more frequent in the group of indomethacin treated rats (44%) as compared to vehicle treated rats (8%). Pgp expression was significantly upregulated in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex following SE. Indomethacin treatment prevented this upregulation both in the hippocampus and the cortex. A pronounced indomethacin-mediated neuroprotection was obvious in the piriform cortex by visual inspection of the brain sections. Currently, we are studying the degree of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus by neuronal cell counts to evaluate whether neuroprotection was also achieved in this brain region. Conclusions: The data indicate that cyclooxygenase plays a critical role in seizure-induced upregulation of Pgp. Inhibition of inflammatory cascades may be a valid strategy to prevent Pgp-mediated pharmacoresistance. Further validation of this strategy is necessary with a focus on safety.

Reid ( 1 Departments of Medicine and Surgery (RMH/WH), University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; 2 Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 3 Howard Florey Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Inducible changes in ion channel expression influencing neuronal excitability are emerging as potential mechanisms in human epilepsies. A relative new comer to the list of ion channels involved in epilepsy is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (HCN). Several studies in chronic human epilepsy and various animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have reported alterations in the HCN expression and function in the hippocampus. However, these changes have only being reported in immature animals or models with significant neuronal loss or in end stage epileptic patients. Therefore, whether these reported changes in HCN expression are a critical component of epileptogenesis in uncertain. Methods: In this study we have measured HCN1 and HCN1 mRNA expression in two different animal models of TLE; the amygdala kindling model (associated with minimal cell loss) and the kainic acid (KA) post-status epilepticus model (associated with significant cell death) during early epileptogenesis. 7?8 week old female rats were studied. The kindled group were electrically stimulated in the left amygdala until ?fully kindled? (5 class V seizures according to the racine classification). The KA group received i.p. KA injections (2.5?5 mg/kg) hourly until continuous seizures were observed on EEG. At designated time points, brains were extracted and hippocampal subregions (CA1  2 Department of Radiotherapy, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium ; and 3 Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden ) Rationale: A common feature in kindling and status epilepticus models for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is enhanced neurogenesis in the subgranular layer of the hippocampus. Although there is evidence that some of these newborn neurons migrate towards ectopic locations and have abnormal firing behaviour, no clear relationship between enhanced neurogenesis and epileptogenesis has been demonstrated. In the present study we investigated the effect of blocking neurogenesis by low dose whole brain ?-irradiation on hippocampal kindling epileptogenesis. Methods: Female rats (n = 16) were implanted with a bipolar recording and stimulation electrode in the right dorsal hippocampus. One week after implantation half of the rats were subjected to low-dose (8 Gy) whole brain irradiation. One or two days after irradiation, rats were subjected to a rapid alternate day kindling acquisition protocol and received 48 stimulations spread over 4 alternating days. One and two weeks after termination of kindling acquisition, rats were retested by giving ten additional stimulations per test. The afterdischarge threshold, afterdischarge duration and the clinical seizure severity (Racine stages 1?5) were compared between irradiated and non-irradiated rats. Results: All rats displayed afterdischarges and clinical seizures with an increasing length and severity, until they displayed five or more consecutive stage 5 seizures and were labelled fully kindled. At kindling day 3 and 4 mean seizure severity in irradiated rats was significantly worse compared to non-irradiated rats. This difference was evident because seizures in irradiated rats developed more quickly to the most severe seizure state compared to seizures in non-irradiated rats. In line with these differences, afterdischarge threshold at kindling day 4 was significantly lower in irradiated compared to non-irradiated rats. All these differences were temporary and could no longer be demonstrated during retest stimulations. Conclusions: Low-dose whole brain irradiation, administered in order to block neurogenesis, leads to a lowered threshold to electrically evoke an epileptic event one week after irradiation. At this time point, irradiated rats also displayed more rapidly more severe seizures compared to non-irradiated rats. These effects were only temporary and no longer evident two and three weeks after irradiation. We can conclude that blocking neurogenesis by low-dose whole brain irradiation has mild accelerating but temporary effects on epileptogenesis.

Frye, and 1 Amy R. Brooks-Kayal ( 1 Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Department of Psychology, University at Albany, Albany, NY ) Rationale: A number of studies suggest that progesterone and its metabolite 5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-THP) act as endogenous anticonvulsants. 3α,5α-THP is a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors and reduced endogenous levels of 3α,5α-THP increase seizure susceptibility. Studies from various laboratories suggest that early-life seizures increase susceptibility to development of seizures in later life. In the current study we induced prolonged status-epilepticus (SE) at postnatal day 10 (P10) and measured levels of progesterone and 3α,5α-THP in plasma and hippocampus immediately after SE and in adulthood. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rat pups at P9 were injected intraperitoneally with 3mEq/kg lithium followed 14?18 hrs later by 60 mg/kg pilocarpine. Control rats were treated identically to that of seizure rats but were injected with 0.9% saline on P10. Trunk blood and brains were collected 6 hours after the onset of SE or in adulthood for measurement of progesterone and 3α,5α-THP in plasma and hippocampus by radioimmunoassay. Results: 3α,5α-THP levels in hippocampus increased significantly (p < 0.0002) in rats that were sacrificed 6 hours after SE induction. Plasma and hippocampal levels of progesterone and plasma 3α,5α-THP were not different in SE as compared to control rats. Rats that had experienced SE at P10 and were sacrificed in adulthood had lower levels of 3α,5α-THP in plasma as compared to control rats (p < 0.013). Levels of 3α,5α-THP in hippocampus and progesterone levels in plasma and brain were not significantly different between seizure and control rats. Conclusions: These results suggest that 3α,5α-THP levels increase locally in association with P10 SE, possibly as an adaptive mechanism to inhibit seizures. Long-term decreases in circulating levels of 3α,5α-THP in adult rats that had experienced SE in early-life may contribute to increased seizure susceptibility in these rats.

However, the network dynamics at the single neuron level during the development and maintenance of seizures remains largely unknown. In this study we studied the firing behavior of single neurons, and monitored synchronization between the different recorded neurons during developing and ongoing seizures evoked by pilocarpine and picrotoxin. Methods: Multi-electrode extra-cellular recordings of single units and local field potentials were performed from the hippocampus of anesthsized (urethane) and awake rats under control conditions and after administration of pilocarpine and picrotoxin. The two convulsants were administered either by systemic (I.P.) or local (intra-hippocampal) injection. In addition simultaneous intracellular whole-cell recordings were performed. Results: Immediately after administration of pilocarpine and picrotoxin, prior to initiation of clinical or electrographic seizures, the frequency of spikes decreased, and synchronization between neurons, as measured by the cross-correlogram, markedly diminished or disappeared all together. In contrast after clinical and electrographic seizures initiated the frequency of spikes gradually increased, neurons tended to fire in bursts and the inter-neuron synchronization markedly increased. The cross-correlograms during the clinical seizure revealed higher values and wider time-windows as compared to control conditions. Similar results were obtained in anesthetized and awake rats; in systemic (I.P.) and local intra-hippocampal administration of the convulsants, and with pilocarpine and picrotoxin. Simultaneous intracellular whole-cell recording from anesthetized rats demonstrated the intracellular correlate of developing seizures. Conclusions: In this study we showed that during the development of pharmacologically induced seizures synchronization of firing between different neurons in the hippocampus decreased dramatically, while only later during clinical seizures inter-neuronal synchronization gradually increased. These findings may promote our understanding of the network dynamics responsible for seizure initiation and maintenance. Moreover, in future it may serve as the basis for detection of impending seizures in human patients.

Englot, 2 Fahmeed Hyder, and 1,3 Hal Blumenfeld ( 1 Neurol., Yale University Sch. Med., New Haven, CT ; 2 Diagnos. Radiol., Yale University, New Haven, CT ; and 3 Neurobiol., Yale University, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Recently, fMRI became an important tool to study brain activity in epilepsy by investigating increases/decreases in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response, known to be associated with changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and -volume (CBV). Although increases in the BOLD response have been linked to increases in neuronal activity, decreases of the signal, although often present, are generally neglected and still poorly understood. A detailed understanding of the relationship and causes of the different hemodynamic and neuronal signals is however essential for interpreting neuroimaging data in epilepsy and also has important implications for its treatment. Methods: 26 Wistar rats were injected with bicuculline (0.5 mg/kg, iv) to induce generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Increased/decreased brain activity during seizures were investigated by combining fMRI and CBV imaging with neurophysiological recordings (field and unit activity), and local CBF measurements using laser Doppler flowmetry. Results: The fMRI showed widespread BOLD and CBV increases throughout the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus during seizures. Neurophysiological recordings, likewise, showed increased CBF, local field potential power and neuronal firing rate in cortical areas. Surprisingly, however, most of the rats had a decreased BOLD response in the hippocampus, which was accompanied by increased CBF and neuronal activity. Conclusions: Our results show that during generalized seizures the brain shows rather heterogeneous BOLD activity with increases/decreases in distinct networks. While our data confirm that increases in the BOLD signal during seizures correlate with increases in CBF, CBV and neuronal activity, we found that in the hippocampus increases in the latter three variables are associated with a decreased BOLD response. This observation argues against the hypothesis of a vascular steal phenomenon as cause for a decreased BOLD signal. Although the cause for the local dissociation of the signals is not known, one possibility is that the neuronal oxygen consumption in the hippocampus during seizures exceeds its supply; which is currently under investigation in our laboratory. In conclusion, our data show that fMRI can reveal important information about the pathophysiology of epilepsy and its treatment, but that the interpretation of the neuroimaging signals during seizures should proceed with caution, and might be different depending on brain region.

Sisodiya ( 1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, The Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom ; 2 Division of Neuropathology, The Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom ; and 3 Department of Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is amongst the most common causes of medically refractory epilepsy in adults. Histologically HS is characterised by segmental neuronal loss, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this cell loss remain uncertain. Deregulation of the serine-threonine kinase cyclin dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) by p25, the calpain-mediated cleavage product of the physiological cdk5 activator p35, occurs in several cell death paradigms. Recently we demonstrated subfield-specific deregulation of cdk5 in human HS while animal models have shown that abnormal phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor might contribute to epileptogenesis. Intriguingly, when cdk5 is deregulated it phosphorylates NMDA receptors resulting in excitotoxicity. We therefore hypothesised that there might be abnormal cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor in HS. Methods: Surgically-resected cases of HS with adjacent histologically-normal temporal lobe and hippocampi from rats sacrificed at intervals following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus were examined for cdk5, p25/p35, NeuN, NMDA and cdk5 phosphorylated NMDA receptor using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, western blots and kinase assays. Results: Animal models demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the ratio of p25:p35 and in p25-cdk5 activity following administration of pilocarpine. p25-cdk5 phosphorylated NMDA was not detected in control animals, but was strongly detected seven days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus and persisted until at least five months after pilocarpine treatment. Furthermore, despite neuronal loss, hippocampi from patients with HS had increased levels of p25-cdk5 phosphorylated NMDA compared to adjacent histologically-normal temporal lobe. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cdk5 might contribute to the neuronal loss, and potentially the epileptogenicity, of HS through direct phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor.

It is known that epileptic activity induce many molecular and structural changes in the brain (Eid et al., 2004). In order to evaluate these changes we aimed to investigate the consequences of a convulsant agent called pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). PTZ is a chemical frequently used in the study of epileptic seizures since it produces a reliable discriminative stimulus (De Boer et al. 1982; Bradford 1989; De Deyn and Macdonald 1989). The present study was focused to analyze the changes resulted from sub-consulvant and consulvant dose of PTZ on rat brain homogenate at molecular level by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into three groups as control (n = 6), sub-convulsant (n = 6) and convulsant (n = 6). The treated groups were made epileptic by a single administration of sub-convulsant (25 mg/kg) and convulsant (60 mg/kg) dose of PTZ. Following PTZ administration, behavioral observations were carried out to determine epileptic activity for 30 min. Subsequently, in the FTIR spectra, the shift in peak positions, the change in bandwidths and the intensity/area values of the bands were determined and compared in between control and treated groups. Results: The results revealed that the concentration of unsaturated lipids decreased for both treated samples. The lipid/protein ratio slightly increased for sub-convulsant group whereas this ratio decreased for convulsant group. An increase in the lipid order and a decrease in the fluidity of membrane were observed for low dose of PTZ's group. However, for high dose of PTZ's opposite effects on the order and fluidity were observed. In addition, the changes in hydrogen bonding capacity of head groups of membrane lipids as well as a decrease in the protein concentration caused by the administration of PTZ were obtained. Conclusions: Consequently, these results show that the early alteration at molecular level resulted from chemically induced epileptic activity can be detected by FTIR. Moreover, the molecular effects of unconvulsive and convulsive epileptic seizures can be compared by this method. Brown S. et al., Seizure (1993) 2: 91?103. Bradford H. F. Epilepsia (1989) 30: 17?25.

However, no single study comparing in parallel their effects on brain Na+ channel-mediated responses is available.In this work the effects of increasing concentrations of CBZ, PHT, LTG, OXC and Top on the release of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, glutamate (Glu), induced by the selective activation of Na+ channels with the Na+ channel opener toxin, veratridine, were investigated; and compared with the effect of the memory enhancer with antiepileptic potential, VPC (ethyl apovincamine-22-oate). Previously we have shown that VPC is a potent inhibitor of the epileptic cortical activity induced by the convulsing agents, pentylenetetrazole and 4-aminopyridine in the guinea pig in vivo (Epilepsy Res. 2004; 60: 63?71; Clin. Neurophysiol. 2004; 115: 2711?17), that VPC inhibits the tetrodotoxin sensitive fraction of the rise in internal Na+ induced by 4-amonipyridine (Neurochem. Int. 2005; 46: 533?540)) in vitro, and that VPC and CBZ presynaptic effects in vitro are additive (Neurochem. Int. 2006; 49: 55?61). In this investigation the efficacy and potency of several of the most widely used AEDs and VPC on Glu release to veratridine was compared. Methods: These experiments were done following methods that we have described previously (J. Neurosci. Res.1995; 40: 613?621; Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 889?895). Results: Under equivalent experimental conditions, CBZ, PHT, LTG and OXC are required in the range from 150 to 1500 uM in order to progressively inhibit the release of [3H]Glu induced by veratridine,VPC is required in a much lower range of concentrations (from 1.5 to 15 uM), and Top was able to inhibit the veratridine-induced response in about 20% only at the highest dose tested (1500 uM). Conclusions: It is concluded that, with the exception of Top, the mechanism of action of all the AEDs tested involves a reduction of the carrier-mediated fraction of Glu release through a decrease in cerebral presynaptic Na+ channels permeability. Considering that the high doses of AEDs required to control seizures are frequently accompanied by adverse secondary effects, the much higher potency of VPC for blocking presynaptic Na+ channels could be advantageous in the treatment of epilepsy.

Sosunov, 1 Xiaoping Wu, 2 Casper Caspersen, 1 Robert R. Goodman, and 1 Guy M. McKhann II ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Uptake and metabolism of synaptically released glutamate by astrocytes is critical for brain homeostasis and protection of neurons against overexcitation. To test the hypothesis that glutamate uptake and metabolism are deteriorated in gliotic protoplasmic astrocytes, we carried out immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analysis of surgically resected brain tissue in patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Methods: Specimens of neocortex and hippocampi from pharmaco-resistent MTLE (n = 44) and cortical tubers resected from epileptic TSC patients (n = 12) were studied with immunohistochemical and patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques. Results: Areas of severe gliosis/sclerosis typical of cortical tubers in TSC and hippocampal sclerosis in MTLE were composed of ?scar? astrocytes characterized by high upregulation of GFAP and S100 beta and less upregulation of CD44 and alphaB-crystallin. These cells revealed dramatic reduction in the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) and astrocytic glutamate transporters proteins (GT: EAAT1 and EAAT2). In addition, scar astrocytes underwent conspicuous alterations in their ?gross? morphology consisting of transformation into fibrous-like astrocytes accompanied by elongation of cell processes but loss of fine lamellipodial structures. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings of scar astrocytes showed dramatic decrease in inward glutamate transport currents, in comparison to control protoplasmic astrocytes. Conclusions: Downregulation of GS and GT expression proceeds in parallel with progression of gliotic changes in protoplasmic astrocytes. We hypothesize that these glutamate metabolic alterations may not be pathology specific, but rather may constitute a common effect of profound reconstruction of the cellular cytoskeleton during the development of gliosis. Astrocytic lamellipodia may be the main subcellular compartment involved in glutamate uptake by protoplasmic astrocytes. These structures are significantly lost in association with GFAP upregulation in gliosis. (Supported by Parents Against Childhood Epilepsy; R21 NS 42334.) 1 Matt Stead, 1 Fredric B. Meyer, 1 Cindy L. Nelson, 1 Stephen J. Goerss, and 1 Gregory Worrell ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: High frequency oscillations (>= 40 Hz) in epileptogenic brain are not yet understood, but are a recognized phenomenon in a large proportion of patients with epilepsy. DC potential shifts have been noted in animal models of seizure but are not routinely recorded in humans with epilepsy. The physiologic effect of extracellularly mediated DC potentials on transmembrane voltage-gated ion channels suggests itself as a potential contributor to ictogenesis, and thus worthy of investigation. Methods: To investigate the potential relationship between high and low frequency oscillations in epilepsy we recorded continuous unfiltered EEG from from 15 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes as part of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The acquistion system used had a dynamic range of +132 to ?132 mV, no hardware filtering, and a per channel digitization rate of 32556 Hz. The data were recorded from Pt/Ir clinical intracranial electrodes in both depth and grid/strip configurations. Nine of the patients had mesial temporal onset, the remaining 6 had neocortical onset seizures. Results: High frequency oscillations, defined here as > = 40Hz, were observed in the clinically determined seizure onset leads in all 15 patients. The seizure onset frequency ranged from 45 to 143 Hz. In 14 of the 15 patients the high frequency discharge was cotemporaneous with a large scale DC shift ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 mV. The shift occasionally preceded the high frequency discharge by many seconds as shown in the accompanying figure, however in some cases the high frequency discharge appeared to precede the DC shift. Conclusions: There is high degree of association between the DC shifts and high frequency oscillations during seizure. Further investigations into the cause of this association may lead to a better understanding of ictogenesis and open novel avenues for treatment.

Staley ( 1 Pediatrics Neurology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ; and 2 Physiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: We used a computational model of simultaneous discharges of a population of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal area CA3 to estimate the relationship between the network connectivity and the probability of spontaneous bursts. Prior investigations (Traub and Miles, Neuronal Networks of the Hippocampus, Cambridge University Press, 1991; Lytton et al. Computer models of hippocampal circuit changes of the kindling model of epilepsy Artif Intell Med. 13:81?97 1998) have supported a nonlinear relationship between connectivity and the probability of synchronous population discharges. In our experiments we wished to simulate the growth of recurrent synaptic connections after an epileptogenic insult (sprouting) in order to model the effects on sprouting on network activity. Methods: Our artificial network model employed an array of 10000 pyramidal cells and 225 interneurons. Interactions between the neurons take place via a randomly generated mesh of synapses that includes activity-dependent depression. The strength of glutamatergic synaptic connections is modifiable according to rules governing long-term synaptic plasticity. The network was initially generated with sparsely connected neurons, simulating the network prior to sprouting. Then after each experiment we increased network connectivity to simulate sprouting of synaptic connections. This was accomplished by increasing the maximum feasible radius of synaptic connections and randomly generating additional glutamatergic synapses onto principal cells and interneurons. Results: We performed experiments for networks with various connectivities, focusing on spontaneous bursting behavior. An average number of incoming connections per neuron in separate experiments ranged between 35 and 208. The relationship between the connectivity and the average incoming connections count was close to linear. Interestingly the relationship between network connectivity and spontaneous bursting behavior was very nonlinear. This agrees with our findings regarding seizure frequency vs. time following an epileptogenic injury, (see abstract by Williams PA et al.), and with prior modeling studies employing more detailed neuronal models (Traub and Miles 1991). Conclusions: The rapid increase in seizure probability that eventually follows an epileptogenic insult may be the result of a more linear increase in local connectivity arising from axonal sprouting. The modeling data suggest that a similar and cotemporaneous change in the pattern of interictal spikes should also be evident. Further, the evolution of interictal spikes over time may reflect changes in the underlying epileptogenic network that may help in clinical decision making regarding long-term seizure probability. These hypotheses are being tested using continuous radiotelemetric EEG monitoring.

However, no similar study has been done in the hippocampus from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Immunocytochemical study at both light and electron microscopic level, double immunostaining, and RT-PCR were used. Results: In the hippocampus from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, PKCα, PKC?, PKC?, PKC?, PKC? and PKC? immunopositive products decreased in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3 areas. However, no obvious change was found in CA2 area. PKC? and PKC? immunopositive products increased in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, however, PKC?, and PKC? immunopositive products decrease in these cells. Double labeling immunocytochemistry showed the co-localization of PKCα, PKCg, PKC?2 with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), G-protein subtype Gq/11α and phospholipids C beta1 subtype (PLC?1) in pyramidal neurons in CA1?3 areas. Under electron microscopic level, PKCδ, PKC?, PKC?, or PKC? was located in the post-synaptic elements. However, PKC? was found in both pre- and post-synaptic elements. Gene expression of different isoforms of PKC such as PKCα, PKC?, PKC?, PKC?, PKC? and PKC? has been studied by RT-PCR in the hippocampus of the ?normal? human samples. We showed relative lower expression of PKC? when compared to other PKC isoforms. Conclusions: PKC? and PKC? may be related to the hyperactivity of granular cells and involved in epileptogenesis. PKCα, PKCg, PKC2 may be involved in mGluR5, Gq/11α and PLC?1 related signal transduction in pyramidal neurons. (Supported by a research grant from National Medical Research Council (No: NMRC/0731/2003).) 1 Sevgi Turker Gorgulu, 1 Feride Severcan, 1 Stephen Wassall, and 1 William Stillwell ( 1 Biology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; Biology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; Physics, Indiana University Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN; and Biology, Indiana University Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Although there have been progresses to understand the mechanisms underlying epilepsy, the cellular and molecular basis of epilepsy still is not known yet very well (Patel, 2004; McCorry et al., 2004; Wolfgang and Dieter, 2002). Therefore, epileptic seizures remain as uncontrolled in at least 30% of all the cases. In order to promote new advances in the development of antiepileptic drugs a better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of epilepsy should be the ultimate goal (Avanzini and Franceschetti, 2003). This can be achieved by beginning to evaluate epilepsy-induced changes in the brain cells. However, beside the consequences of epileptic activity, any possible effect of experimental convulsants on the cells should be under consideration. In order to evaluate the effects of convulsants we initially aimed to investigate the interaction of model membranes with a convulsant agent called picrotoxin (PTX). PTX is a noncompetitive antagonist at GABA-A receptors and it blocks the GABA-activated chloride ionophore (Mazarati et al., 2004). Methods: This study was performed to characterize the effects of PTX on some parameters of dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine (DPPC) model membrane system. We used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), electrospin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. All studies were carried out with three different concentrations of PTX (1 mol%, 12 mol% and 24 mol%). Results: The DSC results revealed that PTX has little effect on the melting behavior of DPPC. Indeed, ESR and steady-state fluorescence data indicated that PTX does not significantly affect the order and fluidity of DPPC model membranes. Conclusions: All these results suggest that PTX does not directly interact with membrane lipids, which means that it only acts by binding the membrane protein. Therefore, it can be concluded that the molecular and cellular alterations of chemically induced seizures are only resulted from the consequences of epileptic activity not from convulsant itself.

Knockdown of EAAC-1 by anti-sense induces convulsive seizures in rats. GTRAP3?18 suppresses the binding affinity of glutamate with EAAC1 on the GABAergic neuron. The aim in this study was to measure the changes in GTRAP-18 expression induced by PTZ-kindling, and evaluate PTZ-kindling development in rats with knockdown of GTRAP3?18. Methods: Exp.1; Male Sprague-Dawley rats were kindled by repetitive i.p. injection of PTZ (16 mg/ml in saline, 40 mg/kg) at the rate of three times a week. Control animals were injected at the same rate with an equal volume of saline. Behavior was observed and scored following each injection. Animals were considered fully kindled after having two consecutive stage 5 seizures. Only fully kindled animals were used for the experiment. Six animals in each group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and killed by decapitation on day 14 of the experiment. PTZ animals were sacrificed following a last stage 5 seizure. A crude membrane fraction extracted from both hippocampi was used for western blot followed by hybridized with GTRAP3?18 polyclonal antibody. Exp. 2; Rats underwent i.c.v. injection of oligonuleotide of anti-sense primer (n = 12) and sense primer (n = 12) for GTRAP3?18. Following these injections half of the rats in each group were used to measure the knockdown ratio of GTRAP3?18, while the remaining rats were used for PTZ-kindling. Results: Exp.1; In PTZ-kindled rats, GTRAP3?18 was reduced to 89% of control. Exp.2; GTRAP3?18 was decreased by about 40% of control in rats receiving the anti-sense oligonuleotide. Further, in these animals, PTZ seizure duration was significantly prolonged, latency more brief and kindling onset earlier when compared to control animals. Conclusions: Prior work with microdialysis from GTRAP3?18 antisense treated rats has shown that extracellular GABA concentration is markedly elevated. In this experiment, PTZ kindling over 14 days caused decrease in GTRAP3?18 protein. This down regulation of GTRAP3?18 may be a fundamental response to kindling to enhance GABA synthesis in compensation for the enduring process of epileptogenesis. However, GTRAP3?18 knockdown was associated with worse responses to PTZ. Our observation suggests that there is a pathological reversal of GABA action between inhibition and excitation that is induced by changes in Cl- gradient with enhanced GABA release.

Heida, and 1,2,3 Solomon L. Moshe ( 1 Departments of Neurology ; 2 Neuroscience ; and 3 Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Seizures affect males more often than females. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) belongs to an endogenous seizure-controlling network. Previous studies suggest that the SNR has age- and sex-specific features in terms of seizure control via activation of the GABAA receptor system. The sexual differentiation of the SNR is apparent during early development. At postnatal day 15 (P15), bilateral SNR infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol have a proconvulsant effect in males and no effect on flurothyl clonic seizure threshold in females. Exposure to testosterone during early postnatal development determines the male SNR response to muscimol. Here we investigated whether the testosterone effects on development of the male SNR response to muscimol are mediated via activation of androgen receptors during early postnatal development. Methods: In order to block the androgen receptors, male rat pups were injected daily with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (10 mg/kg i.p.) at P0-P2. Previously we have found that testosterone exposure during this time period leads to the male, proconvulsant effects of SNR muscimol infusions. At P13, we implanted cannulae in the SNR bilaterally using stereotaxic surgery. At P15, muscimol (100 ng/0.25 ?l per side) or saline (0.25?l per side) was infused bilaterally 30 minutes prior to flurothyl seizure testing. The clonic seizure threshold was determined as the amount of flurothyl necessary to induce the seizure. Subsequently cannulae placements were confirmed histologically. Only rats with bilateral SNR canulae placements were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Muscimol infusions in the SNR of P15 male rats treated with flutamide at P0-P2 had no effect on flurothyl seizure threshold compared to saline-infused controls. This is in contrast to previously published data in naïve male rats, in which SNR muscimol infusions have a proconvulsant effect on flurothyl clonic seizures. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that activation of androgen receptors during the early postnatal period participates in the development of proconvulsant SNR responses to muscimol. Understanding the mechanisms involved in sex-dependent sensitivity to seizures may lead to development of sex-specific treatment strategies.

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin(IL)1beta increases epileptic activity and contributes to neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in perpetuating brain inflammation during epileptogenesis and in the chronic phase of spontaneous seizures (SS). Methods: The immunohistochemical pattern of microglia (CD-11b/c, HLA-DR), monocytes/macrophages (ED-1, CD68), granulocytes (HIS48), T-(CD3, CD4, CD8) and B-lymphocytes (CD45RA), NK (NKR-P1A) was assessed in rats, 4?36 h (acute phase) and 3?7 d (epileptogenesis) after the onset of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and during SS, and in hippocampal specimens from medically intractable TLE with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Results: Activated IL-1beta-expressing microglia and astrocytes were observed in rat forebrain within 4h after SE while abundant parenchymal macrophages were found after 18h. Both cell populations persisted until SS. Granulocytes appeared between 18h-3d only. Scarse B and T-lymphocytes and NK cells were found associated with microvessels, rarely in brain parenchyma. No changes occurred in pilocarpine+phenobarbital treated rats. In human TLE with HS, IL-1beta-expressing microglia and astrocytes, and clusters of perivascular monocytes/macrophages occurred in the hippocampus; T-lymphocytes were scarse and B cells were lacking. Conclusions: Activated glial cells expressing IL-1beta sustain the early phases of inflammation after SE and, toghether with macrophages, contribute to its persistence both in rat and human epileptic tissue. Granulocytes are transiently recruited, while B-, T-, NK-cells are scarse or absent. These findings, together with functional studies in experimental models, indicate that innate, but not adaptive, immunity significantly contributes to epileptogenesis in TLE.

Panizzon ( 1 Neurology, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, North Hills, CA ; and 2 Neurology, David Geffin UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Mitochondria play a central role in energy production and processes of cell death. These organelles also regulate Ca2+ homeostasis, and thereby modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. More recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to occur in seizure foci from humans and experimental models of epilepsy. In addition, a number mitochondrial DNA mutations have been identified which lead to the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Because neuronal injury during prolonged seizure activity may occur via modulation of mitochondrial channels and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, we hypothesized that the opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels would provide protection against CA1 depolarization-induced injury. Methods: Using paired rat hippocampal slices, we monitored the CA1 orthodromic and antidromic population spike (PS) amplitude during depolarization injury with and without chromakalim treatment. To induce depolarization injury, slices were exposed to 25 mM KCl for 8 min. Treatment with chromakalim was begun 30 minutes prior to KCl exposure and continued for the first 15 min. of recovery. Results: Chromakalim, an opener of the mitoKATP channel, provided robust neuroprotection of CA1 PS amplitude in hippocampal slices subjected to depolarization-induced injury. Slices exposed to 25 mM KCl demonstrated rapid loss of evoked response with a mean CA1 orthodromic and antidromic recovery of only 11% 3 and 13% 2, respectively. Treatment with chromakalim (300 uM) provided significant protection against this depolarization injury with CA1 orthodromic and antidromic PS amplitude recovering to 94% 3 and 95% 3. Treatment with 300 uM chromakalim during depolarization injury also produced significant recovery of mean excitatory post-synaptic potential slope (94%± 6) after depolarization when compared to paired, unmedicated slices which did not recover (0%± 0). Mean fiber volley responses were slightly resistant to depolarization injury with a mean recovery of 32%± 2 in paired, unmedicated slices. In contrast, treatment with chromakalim showed full recovery with a mean of 100%± 0. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that chromakalim, a mitoKATP channel opener, provides neuroprotection against CA1 depolarization injury. In addition, these data suggest that the use of agents that modulate the mitoKATP channel may provide a useful strategy in the prevention of brain injury during status epilepticus.

Schwartzkroin ( 1 Neurological Surgery, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA ; and 2 Pharmacology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA ) Rationale: Gene therapy offers an alternative strategy for treating some CNS disorders, but has been relatively unexplored as a therapy for epilepsy. As background for a gene therapy approach, it is important to gain some understanding about the details of expression for those genes exogenously introduced into the brain. Toward this end, we have begun to characterize the efficiency, cell type specificity, and subcellular localization of Kv potassium channel subunits introduced into neurons in vitro. These studies will provide essential background for testing gene therapy approaches in intact preparations. Methods: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC) and dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures were prepared from wildtype mice and Kv1.1 knock-out mice (lacking the Kv1.1α subunit). Cultures were maintained for seven days in vitro, and then infected via an adenoviral vector or an HSV1 vector containing voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit genes (e.g., Kv1.1, Kv?2, Kv1.4, Kv2.1). Cultures were fixed at 1?3 weeks post-infection, and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence and electron microscopic observation. Immuno-reacted cultures were analyzed for cell-type specific expression, subcellular distribution, and co-localization of Kv channel subunit expression. Results: In both primary dissociated cultures and OHSCs, adenoviral vectors successfully infected a variety of neuron types with Kv channel subunits. Exogenously-expressed subunits were observed in vitro at several days post-injection. Adenoviral gene transfer appeared to target larger populations of neurons than the HSV1 vector. Subcellular localization of exogenous subunits did not always reproduce the patterns seen for endogenous subunits. For example, endogenous Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 subunits are expressed only in the axons and terminals of hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells; however, these subunits appeared primarily in cell somata when expressed via viral infection. In the relatively complex and well-organized organotypic cultures, injections of adenoviral vectors resulted in infection of neurons primarily around the site of the injection. In these OHSCs, pyramidal cells, granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons expressed the exogenous gene product. Conclusions: Viral vector-mediated infection with genes for Kv channel subunits resulted in successful in vitro infection of limited neuronal populations. Expression patterns of exogenous Kv subunits did not always mimick the subcellular localization patterns seen in vivo. Further studies are needed to optimize infection efficiency and to reproduce appropriate localization of expression for specific channel subunits.

If the chronic seizures occur at a stable frequency, then post-injury seizure probability can be considered a step function. We hypothesize 1) post-injury seizure probability is a continuous function and that at some point the seizure frequency goes through an exponential growth phase, and 2) that seizures tend to occur in clusters throughout the period of continuously increasing seizure frequency. Methods: We obtained nearly continuous electroencephalographic recordings using radiotelemetry in adult rats for 100 days after kainate-induced status epilepticus (n = 9). Results: In all 9 kainate-treated rats the seizures continuously increased with time after a mean latent period of 8 days, and all rats experienced an exponential increase in the seizure frequency at variable times after the latent period. A frequency histogram of the inter-seizure intervals throughout the period of seizure progression shows a distinct peak of intervals occurring at very short times. An analysis of the inter-seizure interval distribution compared to both a Poisson distribution and matched randomly generated intervals shows that the inter-seizure interval distribution is significantly different from a Poisson and random distribution. Conclusions: Seizure frequency continuously increases as a function of time after injury, suggesting that progressive molecular and cellular changes underlying seizure generation (e.g., axon sprouting and increased recurrent excitation) are steadily increasing with time after the injury. The exponential increase in seizure probability may reflect nonlinearities in the network response to steady increases in sprouting (see abstract by Swiercz et al.). These data also indicate that spontaneous seizures tend to occur in clusters throughout the period of increasing seizure frequency.

We have been investigating the effects of altered metabolism on GABAergic neurotransmission; here we have examined the physiological effects of blocking GABA synthesis using slices from both control and epileptic rats. We have used 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (3-MPA) a selective glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) inhibitor for these studies. Our primary hypothesis is that alterations in excitability will only be seen under activated conditions as GABA stores will need to be depleted. Methods: Adult male rats were used for these studies. We used the systemic kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hippocampal slices were prepared and maintained using standard methods. Field potential recordings were obtained from the CA1 region. Stimuli were delivered to stratum radiatum at an intensity twice that needed to evoke a 1 mV population spike. 3-MPA was washed on and recordings were made in different slices. The effect of repetitive stimulation was determined by giving 10 Hz, 10 sec trains and monitoring both evoked and spontaneous activity. Results: In control animals, 3-MPA was not associated with significant hyperexcitability in the absence of afferent input even after several hours exposure. However, following a series of stimulus trains there was a significant enhancement of the duration of the evoked response and the development of short bursts of population spikes. We assayed the role of neuronal GABA transport by blocking GABA uptake with NO-711. There was a further prolongation of the evoked response in NO-711 and 3- MPA demonstrating that neuronal transport can contribute to synaptic inhibition. However, we were unable to elicit spontaneous activity under either recording condition. We found that raising excitability slightly by bath applying 5 mM K+ ACSF, was associated with the development of interical-like activity in the presence of 3-MPA in all slices studied, however. These events became prolonged seizure-like events following repetitive stimulation. In KA-treated rats there was a significantly greater effect of 3-MPA on the duration of the evoked responses compared to controls. In addition, intracellular recordings demonstrated the development of spontaneous activity, unlike control animals. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that blocking GABA synthesis does not significantly alter neuronal circuit excitability in the absence of robust afferent input and/or a global elevation in tissue excitability. Thus, neurons appear to have plentiful reserves of GABA under baseline conditions in vitro. In epileptic animals, however, there appears to be a reduced inhibitory reserve under conditions when GABA synthesis is reduced. However, this may reflect the higher baseline levels of activity.

Patrylo ( 1 Physiology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Carbondale, IL ) Rationale: The elderly have an enhanced incidence and prevalence of seizure disorders with up to 50% of cases having no identifiable antecedent. This has lead to the hypothesis that aging of the central nervous system (CNS) itself may be epileptogenic. To begin to assess this hypothesis, our laboratory compared the susceptibility of adult and aged rats to kainate-induced seizures and status epilepticus. This study revealed that aged rats have a greater frequency of wet-dog shakes and shorter latencies to onset for all classes of seizures and status epilepticus during systemic kainate-treatment. This experiment did not, however, distinguish whether this aging-related change is due to altered pharmacokinetics, blood brain barrier, and/or pharmacodynamics. Consequently, in this study the threshold for kainate induced seizures was examined in vitro. Methods: Hippocampal slices from adult (4?8 mo.) and aged (22?26 mo.) Fischer 344 rats were examined using field potential recordings from CA3 to assess activity evoked with single or paired orthodromic stimuli. The threshold for kainate-induced epileptiform activity was examined by increasing the kainate concentration (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nM) while monitoring evoked and spontaneous activity. Results: In aCSF, no difference in the maximal amplitude of the evoked response was noted in aged (n = 24; 6.6 ± 0.6 mV) vs. adult slices (n = 25; 6 ± 0.5 mV; p > 0.4; ANOVA). Evoked activity usually entailed a population spike followed by a positive field potential shift that often had a secondary small amplitude spike. In two of the aged slices, but none of those from adults, stimulating at a supra maximal intensity elicited an epileptiform burst. When paired stimuli were delivered using a 50 ms interpulse interval, 92% of aged slices (n = 13) and 31% of adult slices (n = 16) showed facilitation of the second spike (p < 0.001; chi-square). To assess the threshold for kainate-induced epileptiform activity, 10 slices from adult and 10 slices from aged rats were examined. In total, 80% of adult and 90% of aged slices showed epileptiform activity by the time the kainate concentration reached 100 nM. The kainate concentrations required for evoked (9.7 ± 2.8 nM vs. 21.9 ± 4.6 nM; p < 0.05; ANOVA) and spontaneous (20.3 ± 4.7 nM vs. 34.4 ± 4.6 nM; p < 0.05; ANOVA) epileptiform activity were significantly lower in slices from aged rodents, compared to adults. Conclusions: These data indicate that the aged CNS itself has an enhanced susceptibility to kainate-induced epileptiform activity that could contribute to the increase in wet-dog shakes and reduced latency to onset for class I/II seizures and status epilepticus in aged rodents during systemic kainate treatment. Further, if these pharmacodynamic changes also occur in the human CNS during aging, they could contribute to the increased incidence and prevalence of idiopathic seizure disorders.

However, measurement of reductants in brain tissue extracts is problematic because of intrinsic free radical scavenging. Using in vivo methods, we measured hippocampal antioxidant ability from the decay rate of i.p injection of nitroxide radical with 700 MHz Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy during amygdalar ferric chloride-induced chronic recurrent seizures in rats. Methods: We used Region-Selected Intensity Determination (RSID) methods for estimation of nitroxide decay ratio. Hippocampal antioxidant function was estimated based on the half-life of the EPR signal of the blood-brain barrier-permeable nitroxide radical. Rats underwent unilateral right amygdalar injection with aqueous ferric chloride. Recording from chronically implanted depth electrodes showed development of epileptiform discharges, followed by recurrent seizures arising from amygdalar regions with propagation into both hippocampi. EPR spectroscopy with RSID estimation was performed at 5 days, 15 days and 30 days after FeCl3 injection. Results: In bilateral dorsal hippocampal regions, in vivo antioxidant ability was significantly decreased at 5 days and 30 days in animals with chronic, recurrent seizures when compared to controls. Conclusions: We observed impairment of antioxidant function in the hippocampi of rats with epileptogenesis induced by amygdalar ferric chloride injection. Of interest, unilateral induction of a chronic seizure focus was associated with bilateral alterations both early after injection and late. We wonder if hippocampal collapse of glutamate regulation during epileptogenesis might be followed by consumption of endogenous antioxidants.

Although it is well-established that seizures may cause neuronal death under some conditions, seizures may also induce more subtle ?non-lethal? pathophysiological changes in neuronal structure and function, including abnormalities in synaptic transmission. In particular, seizures have been shown to cause morphological changes in dendrites and dendritic spines, but the molecular mechanisms mediating these structural changes are poorly understood. Actin represents a major structural protein of dendrites and actin filaments (F-actin) can be depolymerized by the regulatory molecule, cofilin, leading to structural changes in dendrites. Thus, we examined changes in F-actin and cofilin in hippocampus due to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced seizure activity in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Seizures were induced with intrahippocampal injections of 4-AP in mice in vivo. Epileptiform activity was elicited by superfusion of 4-AP over hippocampal slices in vitro. The gross morphology of dendrites and the number of dendritic spines following one hour of seizure activity was assessed by confocal imaging of fixed hippocampal sections from mice with in vivo seizures or by time-lapse multiphoton imaging of living hippocampal slices during in vitro epileptiform activity. Changes in F-actin levels in hippocampus following seizures was assessed by the phalloidin-rhodamine immunolabeling technique. Total actin, total cofilin, and phosphorylated (inactive) cofilin (p-cofilin) were measured following seizures by Western blotting. Results: Following one hour of in vivo or in vitro seizure activity, there was no significant difference in the gross morphological properties of dendrites and number of dendritic spines in hippocampus. However, hippocampal seizures led to a significant decrease (30%) in F-actin levels, indicating a depolymerization of actin filaments. Correspondingly, seizure activity caused a significant decrease (64%) in p-cofilin, but no change in total cofilin levels, implying an increase in unphosporylated (active) cofilin, which should depolymerize F-actin. By comparison, elevated extracellular potassium (50 mM KCl) induced a rapid swelling and loss of spines in hippocampal slices and a strong decrease (93%) in p-cofilin. Conclusions: Seizures may induce activation of cofilin and depolymerization of F-actin. Although no gross changes in dendritic structure or spine number were observed with seizures over a short time period, these changes in actin dynamics with seizures could be related to dendritic spine loss over a longer time period, more subtle changes in spine morphology, or non-structural roles of actin in synaptic transmission. Additional studies are required to define the functional and clinical relevance of changes in actin polymerization in seizure-induced brain injury.

Kelly ( 1 Department of Neurology, Allegheny General Hospital, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA; and Drexel University College of Medicine Philadelphia, PA, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Acute ischemic infarction of the neocortex is typically followed by functional reorganization of cortical circuitry. In the periinfarction area, GABAergic-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is impaired and neuronal activity is enhanced, changes that may predispose to epileptogenesis and poststroke epilepsy. We used the model of cortical photothrombosis and brain infarction to examine the changes of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic input to pyramidal neurons of layer II-III of ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex 1?2 mm lateral to the infarct 7?10 days after photothrombosis of 4-month-old Fischer 344 rats. Methods: Whole cell patch-clamp techniques were used to record postsynaptic currents (PSCs), and spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) of pyramidal neurons of layer II-III of ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex 1?2 mm lateral to the infarct. Analysis was performed on PSCs and sIPSCs recorded from 46 pyramidal neurons (lesioned, n = 23; control, n = 23) and mIPSCs recorded from 33 of the 46 pyramidal neurons (lesioned, n = 18; control, n = 15). Results: In lesioned animals, PSC amplitude was unchanged compared with controls, whereas decreases were observed for sIPSC (?23% lower than that of control, 24.93 ± 2.23 pA in lesioned vs.32.54 ± 2.98 pA in controls) and mIPSC (?22% lower than that of control, 20.12 ± 1.27 pA in lesioned vs. 25.72 ± 2.50 pA in controls) amplitude. There was an increase in the 10?90% rise time of PSCs (?31% longer than that of control), sIPSCs (?36% longer than that of control) and mIPSCs (?29% longer than that of control) in lesioned animals, whereas decay time constant and charge transfer were not significantly different compared with controls. There was an increase in PSC frequency (?41% higher than that of control, 3.10 ± 0.28 Hz in lesioned vs. 2.17 ± 0.23 Hz in controls) in lesioned animals, whereas sIPSC (?21% higher) and mIPSC (?18% higher) frequency demonstrated only trends toward increases. Additionally, sIPSC and mIPSC conductance was decreased (23% and 21.7%, respectively). Conclusions: These findings indicate that cortical photothrombosis results in alterations of GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal neurons in close proximity to the infarct, which likely contribute to the increased excitatory tone of the area following ischemic infarction and may predispose it to the mechanisms of epileptogenesis.

Yamada ( 1 Neurology, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO ) Rationale: Previous studies have demonstrated that leptin inhibits epileptiform-like activity in rat hippocampal neurons. Therefore, we examined whether leptin acts as an anticonvulsant in an in vivo rat model of focal neocortical seizures. Methods: Focal neocortical seizures were induced by the microinjection of 1 ?L artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 12.5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 12.5 nanomoles) into the motor cortex of halothane-anesthetized, 4?6 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Leptin-treated rats were co-injected with 39 ?M leptin (39 picomoles). A screw electrode was placed symmetrically over each hemisphere and used to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) in a referential montage. We recorded EEG prior to the injection of 4-AP and continued recording for one-hour after the injection. The number of seizures, the average seizure duration, and the cumulative seizure duration during the one hour recording period after 4-AP injection were determined by analyzing the EEG using commercial software (pClamp 9, Axon Instruments). Results: Leptin reduced the number of seizures from 33.8 ± 15.8 seizures/hour to 10.2 ± 3.3 seizures/hour (n = 5 rats/each group, p = 0.012). Leptin decreased the average seizure duration from 34.3 ± 4.9 seconds to 14.5 ± 6.0 seconds (p < 0.001). It also decreased the cumulative seizure duration from 1141 ± 558 seconds to 156 ± 104 seconds (p < 0.01). Conclusions: These results show that leptin has anticonvulsant effects in the in vivo 4-AP model of severe focal neocortical seizures. Thus, leptin and other leptin receptor agonists may be clinically useful anticonvulsants. (Supported by JDRF 1?2004?594 and NIH NS 32636 (KAY).) 1 Audrey S. Yee, 2 Lihong Diao, and 1,2 Kevin J. Staley ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ; and 2 Neurology, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: The spontaneously active in-vitro CA3 slice preparation is an important model of interictal spikes. The temporal pattern of interictal spikes reflects seizure probability in experimental epilepsy. We investigated determinants of CA3 burst timing to understand mechanisms of interictal timing. In numerous paradigms used to initiate bursts, we noted a significant increase in the interburst interval in the 1st hour following burst onset. The mechanisms for this finding are unclear and we investigate them here. Methods: We used rat hippocampal slices (male Sprague-Dawley 4?8 weeks, 400 uM sections prepared with a tissue chopper, slices cut and stored in ACSF) and extracellular field recordings to record bursting from the CA3 pyramidal cell layer. This bursting was induced in modified ACSF (3.3 K+, 0.9 Mg2+, 1.5 Ca2+) by addition of: (1) Pictrotoxin (PTX) 100 uM + CGP 1 uM (2) Bicuculline Methiodine (BMI) 50 uM + CGP or (3) Gabazine (GBZ) 10 uM + CGP to block GABAA and GABAB receptors. In other experiments, slices were co-treated with a glutamate precursor, glutamine (10 uM) or pretreated with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, d-APV 100 uM, prior to GABAA and GABAB blockade. Changes in burst frequency (measured as interburst interval) and burst length were examined. Results: 1. Synchronized network activity can occur in the presence of postsynaptic inhibition. 2. Burst frequency increased during the first hour following burst initiation. 3. The initial burst frequency increase was present regardless of the type of GABAA receptor blockade (BMI, PTX, and GBZ). 4. This initial burst frequency increase occurred in the presence of glutamine replenishment. 5. This initial burst frequency increase occurs in the presence of NMDAR blockade, suggesting that burst-related synaptic plasticity does not explain the initial increase in burst frequency. 6. When the degree of post-synaptic inhibition was increased (see concentration- response curve), initial burst frequency increase was diminished. Conclusions: These results suggest that inhomogeneous GABAA receptor function is reflected in altered burst frequency in the 1st hour after burst induction. Similar inhomogeneities may be present in-vivo early in epileptogenesis. (Supported by NINDS.) 1 Nicole A. Young, 1 Corey Flynn, 1 Lana J. Ozen, and 1 G. Campbell Teskey ( 1 Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Functional alterations in neural networks are thought to underlie both susceptibility to seizures and interictal behaviours. Our laboratory has previously shown that electrical kindling of the rat neocortex, amygdala or hippocampus results in a dramatic expansion of motor maps. The aim of the current study was to determine if those observations extend to another model of epilepsy. In this study we employed the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model that results in extended seizure activity and, after a maturation interval, can ultimately lead to spontaneous seizures. Methods: Young adult male rats were injected with atropine methyl-nitrate (10.0 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to convulsant treatment in order to block peripheral affects. Pilocarpine (320.0 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose that elicited seizures in all rats with approximately 50% expressing status epilepticus. Control rats received physiological saline. All rats were videotaped for 2 hours following convulsant administration or control. Seizure behaviours were quantified by duration and type. Diazepam (10.0 mg/kg) was administered to all rats 1.5 hours following convulsant or control injections to terminate seizure activity and promote survival. Rats had high-resolution intracortical microstimulation movement representations derived using standard methodologies at either 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks or 3 weeks following treatment. Results: Our preliminary results show that rats have motor map expansion following pilocarpine treatment, regardless of whether status epilepticus occurred or not. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a single episode of seizure activity induced by a convulsant agent can alter the functional expression of motor maps.

Therefore, we examined whether potentiating Zn2+ concentrations enhance GlyR mediated inhibition of neuronal bursting induced by a Mg2+ free extracellular solution. Methods: Current clamp recordings from cultured embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons were obtained using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Bursts consisting of 2?10 second depolarizing envelopes with superimposed action potentials were induced by omitting extracellular Mg2+ (?0? mM Mg2+). The basal Zn2+ concentration in our extracellular solution was 0.8 ?M. A nominally Zn2+ free extracellular solution (?0??M Zn2+) was obtained by adding 10 mM tricine, a Zn2+ chelator. Ten ?M D-serine was added to the extracellular solution to saturate the NMDA receptor glycine binding site. Statistical comparisons were made by ANOVA. Results: In an extracellular solution containing 1 mM Mg2++?0??M or 0.8 ?M Zn2+, no bursts occurred and action potentials occurred at 0.2 ± 0.1 Hz (S.E). In ?0? mM Mg2++ 0.8 ?M Zn2+, 11 ± 0.8 bursts occurred per minute, and the action potential frequency was 3.5 ± 0.4 Hz (Figure). Omitting Mg2+ and Zn2+ from the extracellular solution did not change burst or action potential frequency, which were 12 ± 0.8 per minute and 2.7 ± 0.4 Hz, respectively. In ?0??M Mg2++ 0.8 ?M Zn2+, 20 ?M glycine decreased burst frequency from 11 ± 1.3 per minute to 1.4 ± 0.6 per minute (p < 0.05) and decreased action potential frequency from 2.9 ± 0.8 Hz to 0.3 ± 0.1 Hz (p < 0.05) (Figure, top panel). In ?0? Mg2++?0??M Zn2+, 20 ?M glycine decreased burst frequency from 13 ± 0.8 per minute to 7.8 ± 0.8 per minute (p < 0.05) and decreased action potential frequency from 2.6 ± 0.5 Hz to 1.9 ± 0.5 Hz (p < 0.05) (Figure, bottom panel). Although baseline burst and action potential frequency in 0.8 ?M and ?0??M Zn2+ did not differ, 20 ?M glycine decreased burst and action potential frequency in 0.8 ?M Zn2+ more than in ?0??M Zn2+ (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained with 200 ?M taurine. These inhibitory effects of glycine and taurine were blocked by 1 ?M strychnine. Conclusions: These results indicate that potentiating Zn2+ concentrations enhance GlyR mediated depression of neuronal hyperexcitability in pathological conditions. Thus, designing drugs that modulate GlyRs directly or via Zn2+ may lead to novel anticonvulsants.

Schwartz ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY ) Rationale: Epileptic events elicit an increase in neuronal metabolism and an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF), bringing oxygenated hemoglobin to the activated neurons. Whether CBF and oxygenation are adequate to meet metabolic demand in the focus and surround is unknown. Methods: We induced acute focal seizures in the rat neocortex by injection of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 15 mM, 0.5 ?l). The local field potential was recorded to identify the ictal discharge. The partial pressure of tissue oxygen (pO2) and CBF were measured with two Clark-style polarographic oxygen microelectrodes and two probes of laser Doppler flowmetry located in the focus and surround. Optical spectroscopic imaging was used to measure deoxyhemoglobin (Hbr), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and total hemoglobin (Hbt). Results: The duration of ictal discharge ranged from 50 to 200 sec (n = 15 rats). CBF in the focus increased 150.0 ± 13.7% (p < 0.05, n = 4 rats) but decreased in the surround by 90.9 ± 2.5% (p < 0.03, n = 4 rats). Tissue pO2 decreased by 64.3 ± 7.8% (p < 0.05, n = 5 rats) in the focus during the ictal discharge and then increased at the termination of ictal event. In the surround tissue pO2 increased by 120.5 ± 5.1% (p < 0.05, n = 5 rats). The optical spectroscopic analysis showed the spatial extent of the perfusion and oxymetric responses. Conclusions: These results demonstrated a prolonged epileptic dip in both tissue and hemoglobin oxygenation during ictal events in spite of a dramatic increase in CBF in the region of focus. In the surround, pO2 increased in spite of a decrease in CBF, consistent with a decrease in neuronal activity and metabolism.

Fujikawa ( 1 Neurology, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, North Hills, CA ; 2 Neurology, UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ; and 3 Brain Research Institute, UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Seizure-induced neuronal death is morphologically necrotic and caspase-independent, despite internucleosomal DNA cleavage (DNA laddering), a programmed process. We studied whether seizure-induced neuronal necrosis involves translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (endoG) to the nucleus and cytochrome c (cyt c) to the cytoplasm, where AIF and endoG could be involved in large-scale (50 kb) and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation respectively. In caspase-independent, excitotoxic neuronal death, cyt c translocation from mitochondria to cytoplasm may occur because of non-specific outer membrane rupture from mitochondrial swelling. Methods: Adult Wistar rats were subjected to 3-h lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (LPCSE), after which seizures were stopped with diazepam and phenobarbital.

The goal of the present study is to describe pharmacological effects, including gap junction blockade on inhibitory and excitatory conductances and EI network synchrony. Methods: Simultaneous single and dual voltage clamp whole-cell and extracellular recordings were performed in the CA1 region of rat transverse hippocampal slice preparations (n = P16-P30). To induce seizures, slices were bathed in 100?200 ?M 4-Aminopyridine in decreased magnesium (0.6 mM). Intracellular solution contained blockers for voltage-gated conductances. Excitatory conductances were recorded at ?80 to ?50 mV and inhibitory at 0 to +40 mV. Dynamic reversal potentials for interictal bursts and seizures were calculated using varying holding potential (?80 mV to +40 mV). Post-hoc, the cells were stained and identified using fluorescence conjugated antibody cocktails (neurobiotin, somatostatin, parvalbumin, and mGLUR1). Following immunocytochemical testing, the sections were processed for peroxidase-based neurobiotin visualization used for digital morphological reconstructions of the recorded cells. Results: We performed measurements of dynamic synaptic inhibitory (Gi) and excitatory (Ge) conductances in E (n = 12) and I (n = 12) cells during seizures. During the initiation of the ictal events, inhibitory conductances were even or greater to the excitatory conductances. Inhibitory conductances peaked 1?2 seconds before the ictal discharge of pyramidal cells. During the persistent stage of the ictal event, Gi transiently diminished, and then increased with Ge during the post-ictal bursting. Bursts and ictal events were observed in the presence of any one of NMDA (APV), AMPA (CNQX), or GABAa (picrotoxin or bicuculline) receptor blockers. A cocktail of excitatory blockers was necessary to completely abolish bursting and ictal events. Gap junction blockers (mefloquine, n = 14 and carbenoxolone, n = 12) had profound effects on E and I network synchronization, inhibitory currents, and seizure blockade. We measured effects of the individual blockers on burst dynamics and synchronization. Mefloquine preferentially affected inhibitory network synchronization (n = 6), and both carbenoxolone and mefloquine had as strong of an effect on seizures as a mixture of excitatory conductance blockers. Conclusions: We report mechanisms of the first comparative interneuron-principal cell conductance study in a spontaneous in vitro seizure model. Gap junction blockers exhibit a potent effect on neuronal network synchronization and block 4-AP seizures.

However, the effect of seizure type on cytokine production is not well established. The purpose of this study is to examine the concentrations of two key cytokines in patients with temporal and extratemporal epilepsy undergoing a video-EEG study. Methods: Here we determined the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) in serum from 20 patients before and after seizure during continuous video-EEG monitoring in Tampere University Hospital. In addition to baseline the blood samples were taken 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the seizure. The definition of the seizure focus and classification of epilepsy was based on concordant findings in this investigation, and on MRI examination. Patients were divided into two groups: temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 11), and extratemporal epilepsy (n = 9). Results: In the patients with seizures originating from temporal (p < 0.01) and extratemporal lobes (p < 0.05) there was a statistically significant increase in the levels of IL-6 production after the seizure. Moreover, the concentrations of IL-6 were significantly higher in temporal lobe group compared with extratemporal group (p = 0,016). In the patients with temporal seizures there was a significant decrease in the levels of IL-1RA production (p < 0.05) but not in the patients with extratemporal seizures. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that single seizures in chronic epilepsy are followed by activation of cytokine network. The production of IL-1RA and IL-6 are influenced by the origin of the seizures from either temporal or extratemporal lobes. Experimental studies have demonstrated that IL-1RA may act as an anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant, whereas IL-6 seems to be proconvulsant and neurotoxic. Differential activation of these key cytokines may modify central nervous system reactions to seizures. 1 Mohammed Ali Alhakami, 1 Neelan Pillay, and 1 Sam Wiebe ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: The coexistence of localization related and generalized epilepsy is rare (<1%). It is not uncommon for focal and generalized epileptiform discharges (Eds) to coexist in patients with localization related epilepsy. However it is not clear how often such discharges coexist when strict criteria are used to define generalized discharges, and whether the latter entail a poorer seizure outcome following surgery. We studied the characteristics of a cohort of patients with this pattern of EEG findings and describe an index case with localization related and generalized epilepsy. Methods: Eighteen patients fulfilled our criteria, which required the coexistence of interictal focal and truly generalized EDs in the same or in different EEGs. Generalized EDs with shifting focal fragments, and focal discharges with secondary bilateral synchrony were excluded. We reviewed seizure semiology, history of febrile seizures, family history of epilepsy, AEDs used, type of investigations, whether epilepsy surgery was done and seizures outcomes. Results: Eleven patients (61%) were female. Eight were < 10 years old. Generalized EDs consisted of ≥3Hz spike-wave and polyspike-wave. Focal spikes had a variety of distributions. All but two patients had video EEG monitoring. Five patients (27.7%) had a family history of epilepsy, and the neurological examination was abnormal in two patients (11%). Ten patients (55.5%) had normal MRI. Five patients had epilepsy surgery, two of whom had mesial temporal sclerosis(MTS). One patient with left temporal EDs and MTS, underwent a conventional temporal lobe resection. Postoperatively, the patient developed seizures of generalized semiology, confirmed with video EEG. Seizure control was poor in the majority of our patients. Conclusions: The coexistence of focal and strictly defined generalized EDs may be a marker of poor seizure control. In patients with localization related epilepsy, this EEG pattern may indicate poor postoperative seizure outcomes. Rarely, failed epilepsy surgery may indicate the emergence or presence of generalized epilepsy. 1 Gail D. Anderson, 2 Nancy R. Temkin, 3 Ramon Diaz-Arrostia, 2 Carol Farhrenbruch, 4 Michael Edenfield, 5John W. Miller, and 4 S.M. Hossein Sadrzadeh ( 1 Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; 2 Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; 3 Neurology, University of Texas SW Med. School, Dallas, TX ; and 4 Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are a complication of head trauma. Hemorrhagic injury to the cortex has an increased risk of PTS, possibly due to reaction of free hemoglobin (Hb) with lipid rich environment. Hb and iron can enhance oxidative stress. The brain is susceptible to oxidative damage due to is high oxygen consumption, high lipid content and low antioxidant activity. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a plasma glycoprotein that removes free Hb and prevents Hb-induced damage. Hp has three different phenotypes, HP-1-, Hp 2?1 and Hp 2?2. Hp 1?1 is biologically the most and Hp 2?2 is the least active in Hb binding, antioxidant activity. Polymorphisms of apoliprotein E (APOE) plays an important role in neuropathological finding in patients with head injuries. Of the three common alleles, e2, e3 and e4, the presence of e4 has been shown to have a less favorable outcome. We hypothesized that patients who develop PTS have a 1)lower concentration of haptoglobin and/or a higher frequency of low capacity haptoglobin phenotype; 2)higher oxidant stress as reflected in increased 8-isoprostane (8-isoP), a lower total antioxidant capacity (TAOC); 3)higher frequency of APOE e4 allele. Methods: Patients were recruited from our valproate prophylaxis study (Temkin et al. J Neurosurg 1999;91:593?600). Of the 51 who had developed PTS, 25 cases and 26 controls, matched for age, sex, PTS risk factor and treatment group. Baseline information on seizure history, current alcohol use and medications, and 50 ml of blood were obtained. Plasma/serum were used for the biochemical analysis and blood cells for genetic analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-test for the biochemical markers and Chi-square analysis for the genotyping. Results: Haptoglobin Phenotype and APOE Genotype Hp 1?1 Hp 2?1 Hp 2?2 ?2,3 or ?3,3 ?2,4 or ?3,4 or ?4,4 PTS Cases 5 (20.8%) 11 (45.8%) 8 (33.3%) 18 (72.0%) 7 (28.0%) Controls 6 (23.1%) 10 (38.5%) 10 (38.5%) 18 (69.2%) 8 (30.8%) Unable to determine Hp for 1 PTS case PTS Cases vs.Controls 8-IsoP: 246 ± 170 pg/ml vs 172 ± 152 pg/ml (p = 0.1) TAOC: 1.2 ± 0.1 mM vs 1.1 ± 0.1 mM (p = 0.38) Hp: 122 ± 39 mg/dl vs 142 ± 69 mg/dl (p = 0.22) Ferritin 96 ± 87 ?g/ml vs 154 ± 131 ?g/ml (p = 0.069). Conclusions: We found no difference in Hp concentration or phenotype, oxidative activity or capacity, or APOE genotype in the head trauma patients who developed PTS. There was a trend towards an increased oxidative stress and decreased ferritin concentrations. In contrast to microhemorrhagic gradual brain injury that may be mediated by free Hb/iron, direct physical damage in this case may be the most contributing factor in developing PTS.

The assessment of written language may provide a unique insight into the functioning of the human mind and brain. Methods: 60 subjects were recruited from a Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. The group consisted of 39 females and 21 males. Subjects were placed into the following four categories: non-epileptic events (NEE); seizures (Sz); partial seizures (PartSz); complex partial seizures with temporal focus (CPS-TF). Each subject was given a simple writing task to complete. The essays were scored using four unique scales: Subject ? whether the writing concentrated upon physical or emotional aspects of the seizures. Focus ? how much of the essay was on task. Ratio ? a measure of detail. Word ? total word count. Results: Patients with nonepileptic events (NEE) tended to write essays containing both physical and emotional components (p = 0.058), while those with partial seizures (PartSz) did not (p = 0.006). Essays concentrating upon emotional aspects, increased the likelihood of a partial seizure diagnosis being made (p = 0.059). The variance of Ratio was higher in the non-NEE group than in the NEE group (p = 0.0003), while for the PartSz group, the variance of Ratio was higher than in the non-PartSz group (p = 0.000008). Conclusions: The results of the present study have revealed a relationship between the differences of writing content in those with NEE and those with seizures, especially partial onset seizures. The findings with regard to the variable ?Subject? not only give insight into the mind of these patients, but provide the preliminary basis for the development of a diagnostic tool utilizing a simple writing task. With further refinement and validation such a task may one day become an aid to replacing costly video-EEG studies in select patients. The findings with respect to ?Ratio? may also eventually play a role in this later purpose, but yield a different sort of information. The significant difference in variance between groups may be due to the greater degree of structural brain damage likely to be found in patients with partial seizures compared to those with primarily generalized epilepsy or NEE.

Armin Schwartzman was supported by a William R. and Sara Hart Kimball Stanford Graduate Fellowship.) 1 Nabil J. Azar, 1 Tania F. Tayah, and 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: The distinction between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures can be very challenging in the absence of EEG-video monitoring with recorded seizures. Discriminating ictal features described in the literature often cannot be used in the clinic while obtaining the history. Overwhelmed observers often miss ictal details. Postictal signs could prove easier to identify. We observed that the postictal breathing after non-epileptic seizures with generalized motor activity is considerably different from the postictal breathing pattern of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. We evaluated this feature in consecutive patients admitted for EEG-video monitoring. Methods: We reviewed seizures recorded with video-EEG in consecutive adult patients with epilepsy and patients with non-epileptic psychogenic seizures. We reviewed 22 generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 15 patients with epilepsy and 22 convulsive non-epileptic seizures in 15 patients with pure psychogenic seizures. We analyzed the altered postictal breathing pattern for rate, depth, regularity, loudness, and duration. We used the Fisher exact test to compare groups for categorical variables and the student t-test to compare them for continuous variables. Results: The breathing after generalized tonic-clonic seizures was deep with prolonged inspiratory and expiratory phases, regular, and usually loud (except for two short seizures). The breathing after convulsive non-epileptic seizures was characterized by increased respiratory rate or hyperpnea with short inspiratory and expiratory phases, as can be noted after exercise. The breathing was often irregular, with brief pauses. The altered breathing lasted longer after epileptic tonic-clonic seizures. The two groups differed significantly in loudness of postictal respiration, postictal snoring (only with epileptic seizures), respiratory rate (mean of 30/min for the epileptic group and 44/min for the psychogenic group) and duration of altered breathing (mean of 6 min for the epileptic group and 1.6 min for the psychogenic group) (p < 0.00001 for all features). Conclusions: The postictal breathing pattern can help differentiate generalized tonic-clonic seizures from non-epileptic psychogenic seizures and may be helpful to the practitioner obtaining a seizure history in the clinic setting, or witnessing a seizure. 1 Marino M. Bianchin, 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 1 David Araújo Jr., 1 Veriano Alexandre Jr., 1 Lauro Wichert-Ana, 1 Vera C. Terra-Bustamante, 1 Ana Paula P. Martins, 1 Antonio C. Dos Santos, 1 Roger Walz, 1 Jo?o A. Assirati Jr., 1 Carlos G. Carlotti Jr., 1 Osvaldo M. Takayanagui, and 1 Américo C. Sakamoto ( 1 CIREP-Department of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Medical Psychology, Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine, University of S?o Paulo, Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Observations in our population indicate that in endemic areas to neurocysticercosis (NCC), NCC is more common in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) than in other forms of focal medically intractable epilepsy, suggesting a possible association between these two diseases. We designed this study in order to further explore this association. Methods: Retrospective cohort of 191 patients with MTLE-HS from Brazil. We evaluated demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging findings of patients with MTLE-HS plus NCC and compared them with those of patients with MTLE-HS without NCC. The magnitude of differences was measured by the O.R. (95% C.I.). Adjusted O.R. was estimated by logistic regression. Logistic regression was also used to predicting NCC in MTLE-HS patients. Results: We observed chronic NCC radiological findings in 68 (35.6%) MTLE-HS patients. In these patients, NCC was significantly more common in women (45 patients 45.9%) than in men (23 patients, 24.7%), (adjusted O.R. = 3.33; 95% C.I. = 1.67?6.62 p < 0.001), in patients with no history of an initial precipitating injury (IPI) before 5 years-old, (adjusted O.R. = 3.04; 1.38?6.72; p < 0.01), and in patients presenting bilateral temporal interictal spikes during pre-surgical video-EEG, (adjusted O.R. = 2.36; 95% C.I. = 1.19?4.66; p < 0.02). In endemic areas similar to ours, the possibility of finding NCC in refractory MTLE-HS (Prob(NCC) can be calculated by the following equation: Prob(NCC) = 1/(1+e?v), where V = (?0.038 ? 1.2sex + 1.304IPI + 0.95iEEG). This equation was able to correctly predict the presence of neuroimaging findings of NCC in 71% of our surgical MTLE-HS patients. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that NCC might be associated with epileptogenesis in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in susceptible patients, thus being a possible risk factor for development of MTLE-HS. Indeed, if such association were only coincidental, occurring because of the relative high prevalence of both pathologies in the same region, differences between these two groups of patients were expected to be null. However, some important differences were observed and some associations were possible. Differences were observed for women, for those patients without an IPI history before 5 years-old, and for those patients with bi-temporal interictal EEG spikes. These results might help us to better understand the interactions between NCC and MTLE-HS, improving our insights on the possible factors that might explain the association of NCC and refractory MTLE-HS in some world areas.

Boesebeck, 1 Stefan Freermann, 1 Christoph Kellinghaus, 1 Moddel Gabriel, and 1 Evers Stefan ( 1 Neurological Department, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany ) Rationale: Paroxysmal neurological deficits following epileptic seizures or other medical conditions frequent lead to admission on a Neuro-ICU. The etiological misinterpretation of such events may cause a delayed begin of treatment or an inappropriate utilization of diagnostic- and ICU-capacities. Methods: The data of 208 patients being admitted to a Neuro-ICU because of episodic neurological deficits, loss of consciousness and unclear motor phenomena have retrospectively been analyzed. The initially suspected diagnosis in the neurological emergency room was compared to the final diagnosis and the proportion of misdiagnosis was related to the patients' history and diagnostic data respectively. Results: 13.9% of the episodes initially suspected as epileptic seizures proved to be non-epileptic events (NEE). 76% of those patients with ?misdiagnosed? NEE had a prior history of epilepsy. The rate of misdiagnosed NEE was higher in patients with regular EEG-findings (16.7% vs. 8.7%) and regular CT findings (21.2% vs. 11.4%). 15.6% of the epileptic seizures were falsely interpreted to be non-epileptic (6.7% with status epilepticus). The rate of misdiagnosed epileptic Seizures (MES) was higher in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy if compared to known epilepsy (11.2% vs. 1.4%), whereas the rate of misdiagnosed status epilepticus was independent from a prior history of epilepsy (6% vs. 5.4%). The rate of MES was significantly higher in patients with pathologic CT findings (18.9% vs. 1.8%) and pathologic MRI findings (16.3% vs. 3.3%) respectively. MES were most frequent in patients with hydrocephalus, microangiopathy in CT/MRI and prior neurovascular insults. Conclusions: Our data reveille a known epilepsy and the lack of pathological findings on EEG, CT to be risk factors for the misdiagnoses of non-epileptic paroxysmal events, whereas no prior history of epilepsy and pathologic findings on CT and MRI more often caused a misinterpretation of epileptic seizures to be other neurological disorders. 1 Maya R. Carter, 1 Allan Krumholz, 1 Tricia Ting, and 1 Jennifer Hopp ( 1 Neurology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE) is established as a distinct clinical epileptic syndrome with a spectrum of clinical presentations within the heterogeneous group of paroxysmal sleep-related disturbances. Pregnancy is well known to exacerbate seizures in many patients with epilepsy, but there are no reports of the effects of pregnancy on seizures in patients with NLFE. Methods: We report two women with NFLE documented by clinical history and video-EEG monitoring with severe seizure exacerbations during pregnancy. Both patients had long histories of mainly nocturnal episodes of motor jerking or spasm involving mainly the hand and arm on one side and nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Both patients were eventually successfully treated with carbamazepine with nearly complete resolution of symptoms. However, during their first pregnancies both patients experienced severe exacerbations of their nocturnal seizures requiring hospitalizations. Additionally, both patients were on high doses of folic acid. Results: An exacerbation occurred in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in one patient taking stable doses of Carbatrol, with therapeutic carbamazepine blood levels, despite increasing the dosage of Carbatrol. During the exacerbation she experienced several distressing nocturnal seizures. Upon admission to the hospital her seizures were eventually controlled upon substitution with a short acting carbamazepine preparation, given more frequently than her Carbatrol, and the addition of phenytoin. Events subsequently improved and she was tapered from phenytoin and maintained on the short acting carbamazepine with therapeutic blood levels. She delivered a healthy child without complication, after which she resumed taking Carbatrol without problems. The second patient took carbamazepine only at bedtime with therapeutic blood levels, when her seizures suddenly severely worsened in the first trimester of her pregnancy, despite modest increases in the dosages. She was admitted to the hospital and the dosage was increased and spread out and her folic acid dosage was reduced. Her episodes ceased and she eventually was able to return to the full dosage of folic acid. She and her baby are doing well in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Of note is that in the past she had exacerbations of her seizures with the use of birth control pills. Conclusions: Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy as demonstrated by these two patients is a distinct epilepsy syndrome which may be exacerbated during pregnancy and exhibits characteristic clinical features. In particular, these patients may develop severe exacerbations of motor symptoms and seizures during pregnancy. Potential mechanisms include alterations in antiepileptic drug metabolism, hormonal factors that lower seizure threshold, and the effects of folic acid. The potential for pregnancy to exacerbate NFLE should be recognized and warrants further study and investigation. 1 Hyunmi Choi, 1 Dionysios Pandis, 1 Gary Heiman, and 1 W. Allen Hauser ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY; Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY; Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, New York, NY; and Neurology/Epidemiology, Columbia Universiy, New York, NY ) Rationale: Although much is known about the rate of seizure remission in adults that have undergone epilepsy surgery or children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, prognosis for adults with intractable epilepsy is not clearly defined. Population-based or community-based study would require large sample size to detect those with intractable epilepsy that subsequently experience remission. Therefore, examining patients followed at a tertiary clinic setting offers a unique opportunity to study the prognosis in intractable epilepsy patients. Our objectives were to determine the frequency of seizure remission and to evaluate the influence of clinical factors on a 6- month seizure remission among a cohort of adults with intractable epilepsy followed at a tertiary clinic setting. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. We reviewed all adult patients seen in 2001 at the Columbia University Epilepsy Center. Subjects met our criteria if 1) they had failed ≥2 AEDs at the index date in 2001, 2) if they had on average ≥1 seizure per month for 3 consecutive months prior to the index date, and 3) enough follow-up time to experience study endpoint. Those who met our criteria of intractability were followed from their index visit in 2001 until their most recent visit to determine if they experienced a 6-month seizure free period. Crude remission rates were determined, overall and for subgroups, and logistic regression analysis was used to establish the independent significance of the clinical variables, which included history of prior epilepsy surgery, status epilepticus, age of onset, epilepsy classification, developmental delay, and etiology. Analysis was conducted stratifying the subjects by their status of epilepsy surgery following entry into the study. Results: Out of 1389 patients seen at the center in 2001, 191 subjects met our criteria of intractable epilepsy. Mean follow-up of these subjects was 3.5 years. The subjects had the following epilepsy types: Localization-related epilepsy 158 (83%) Primary generalized epilepsy 10 (5%) Symptomatic generalized epilepsy 20 (10%) Both LRE and generalized epilepsy 2 (1%) Unclassifiable 1 (1%) Thirty four subjects had epilepsy surgery after entering the study of whom 21(61.7%) experienced a 6-month remission. Of 157 subjects that did not have epilepsy surgery, 32(20.3%) experienced a 6-month remission during the follow-up. None of the clinical variables were significant predictors of a 6-month remission in either group. Conclusions: Subjects not eligible or refusing epilepsy surgery achieved a 6-month remission at a rate of 6% per year. We found no significant predictors of 6-month remission, likely related to power. We suggest a multicenter study with systematic follow-up of intractable cases to address this issue. (Supported by K12 RR017648.) 1 Ji Soo Choi, 1 Gregory L. Krauss, and 1 Ronald P. Lesser ( 1 Neurology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Seizure response dogs have recently been used to assist patients during seizures and to provide companionship for patients' coping with a chronic condition. We found that 4 of 6 patients with seizure response dogs at our center had, on further investigation, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), and no evidence for epilepsy. These cases illustrate the importance of establishing a firm diagnosis of epilepsy for patients obtaining seizure response dogs. Methods: We evaluated seizure histories, medical evaluations and psychiatric diagnosis of patients with seizure response dogs and PNES. We determined the response of dogs to PNES and their support behaviors. Results: Three patients had specially trained seizure response dogs; a fourth patient's family pet learned to bark during seizures. The four patients reported their dogs reliably anticipated their seizures: in two cases licking them prior to the episodes; two patient's dogs barked prior to their episodes. Three patients had videoEEG which documented PNES; a fourth patient had multiple normal EEG and somatization syndrome. Patients' antiepilepsy drugs were discontinued; their PNES stopped after diagnosis and counseling. Conclusions: Seizure response dogs help vulnerable patients during seizures and help them cope with their chronic condition. Two of our patients with epilepsy are supported by service dogs that stay with them during their unconscious episodes. We found, however, that four other patients with seizure response dogs had PNES, and no evidence for epilepsy. These cases show that patients with abnormal illness behaviors may seek service animals for support and demonstrate the importance of establishing an accurate diagnosis of epilepsy before patients obtain epileptic seizure response dogs. While patients may benefit from emotional support provided by pets, therapy with service animals for primarily psychiatric conditions should be based on individual assessments and formulations regarding these conditions. 1,2,3 Damián E. Consalvo, 1 Marcelo Kauffman, 1 Pablo A. Salgado, and 1,3 Kochen S. Silvia ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Ramos Mejía Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; 2 FEMIEN Foundation, Argentina ; and 3 University of Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: In patients with the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), extrahippocampal abnormalities (EHA) are frequently described on MRI studies. The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of EHA in patients with MTLE-HS, and to correlate these findings with some of its clinical characteristics. Methods: MTLE-HS patients, diagnosed by electro-clinical and high resolution MRI findings were examined. The presence of temporal lobe atrophy (TLA), parahippocampal gyrus atrophy (PHA), fornix atrophy (FA) and mammillary bodies atrophy (MBA) on MRI studies were considered EHA by visual analysis. The variables studied were age, age at the beginning of the epilepsy, time of evolution, history of febrile convulsions (FC), familial epilepsy, status epilepticus, secondary generalization of the seizures and response to the pharmacological treatment. Results: Fifty four patients were included. Fifty of them (92.5%) showed EHA on MRI studies. They were divided in 4 groups. Group 1: TLA patients, 18 cases (33.3%); Group 2: PHA patients, 44 cases (81.4%); Group 3: FA patients, 29 cases (53.7%); and Group 4: MBA patients, 23 cases (42.5%). EHA were found in 14 of 17 (82.3%) normal controls. Anyone showed TLA or PHA. Three controls showed FA (p < 0.02) and 2 MBA (p < 0.04). A strong association between PHA and the history of FC was observed (p = 0,002). There were no differences in the rest of the variables analyzed. Conclusions: The presence of EHA suggests that the causal noxa of the syndrome of MTLE-HS also affects other areas widely connected with the hippocampus. The association between PHA and FC introduce a hypothesis of a physiopathological mechanism of common affectation. 1 Charles L. Dalmagro, 1 Ricardo Guarnieri, 1 Maria Priscila Cescato, 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 1 Veriano Alexandre Jr., 1 Vera C. Terra-Bustamante, 1 Lauro Wichert-Ana, 1 Jo?o A. Assirati Jr., 1 Carlos G. Carlotti Jr., 1 Marino M. Bianchin, 1 Jayme E. Hallak, and 1 Américo C. Sakamoto ( 1 CIREP-Department of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Medical Psychology, Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine, University of S?o Paulo, Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Some reports point to the inverse correlation between depression and the presence of generalized seizures in focal symptomatic epilepsy. However, this issue is still controversial. In order to evaluate whether MTLE-HS patients with few tonic-clonic episodes have differences in the frequency of depressive or other psychiatric symptoms, we conducted the present study. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study we analyzed presurgical data of a group of 81 homogeneous MTLE-HS. Patients were divided in two sub-groups: a) group with rare generalizations (n = 40): no episodes to less than one episode of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure per month; b) group with frequent generalization (n = 41): at least one or more generalized seizures per month. Patients were matched other varibles Psychiatric diagnosis was established by psychiatrists with experience in psychiatric disorders associated with epilepsy, and according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Patients were further classified for positive or negative psychiatric diagnosis and further sub-divided according to symptoms of depression or other psychiatric diagnostics. The magnitude of associations was measured by the O.R. (95% CI). Results: Psychiatric diagnosis was observed in 45 of the 81 patients (55%). In the group with rare generalization we observed 18 patients with psychiatric symptoms and 22 patients without psychiatric co-morbidities. In the group of frequent generalizations we observed 18 patients with psychiatric symptoms and 23 patients without psychiatric co-morbidities (O.R. = 0.96; 95% C.I = 0.40 2.30; p = 1.00). Regarding only depressive symptoms, in the group with rare generalizations, we observed 9 patients with depressive co-morbidities, and 31 patients without any history of depressive co-morbidities. In the group of frequent generalizations we observed 8 patients with depressive co-morbidities and 33 patients without any psychiatric depressive co-morbidities (O.R. = 0.83; C.I = 0.29?2.44; p = 0.79). Conclusions: Our results do not support the hypothesis that secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures affect the frequency of depressive symptoms, depression, or other psychiatric co-morbidities in MTLE-HS patients. However, further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm our results and to assess the impact of surgery in seizure control and its influences in psychiatric co-morbidities.

Reed ( 1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL; Division of Statistics, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL; and Neuroscience, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL ) Rationale: The development of specific epilepsy subtypes may be gender specific (Epilepsia 2005; 46: 956?60), and it has been speculated that response to antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is potentially influenced by gender. Gender influences the pharmacokinetic disposition of drugs in general (Clin Pharmacokinet 2003; 42: 107?21); this concern extends to AEDs (Epilepsia 2005; 46-Suppl 6: 46). While gender is associated with alterations in rat valproic acid (VPA) glucuronidation (Drug Metab Dispos 1996; 24: 367?70), limited information exists concerning the impact of gender on VPA disposition in humans. The objective of this analysis was to examine the effect of gender on VPA pharmacokinetics in adults. Methods: Plasma VPA pharmacokinetic parameters from 5 published multiple dose studies (Clin Drug Investigation 2004, 24 (9): 495?508) in male (n = 106) and female (n = 64) healthy subjects and epilepsy patients on drug-metabolizing hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs receiving 875?5000 mg/day doses of conventional delayed-release enteric-coated divalproex sodium (divalproex) and extended-release divalproex sodium (divalproex-ER) tablets were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS at a significance level of 0.05. A linear mixed model with heterogeneous compound symmetry structure across studies to account for correlation among multiple observations within a subject was used for assessing the gender effect on the response. The model included effects for study, formulation, gender, dose level, an interaction between gender and formulation; body weight (ranging from 45 to 139 kg) was a covariate. Data for divalproex and divalproex-ER were analyzed separately since interaction between gender and formulation was significant (p < 0.0027). Results: Gender did not have a significant influence on VPA pharmacokinetics following divalproex or divalproex-ER administration. VPA least squares mean values for males vs. females, respectively, were: (a) for exposure (AUC24 [mg.h/L]) 1800 vs. 1762 (p = 0.5148) for divalproex and 1593 vs. 1636 (p = 0.5284) for divalproex-ER; (b) for maximum concentration (Cmax [ mg/L]) 101.8 vs. 102.4 (p = 0.8262) for divalproex and 81.0 vs. 83.9 (p = 0.3230) for divalproex-ER; (c) for minimum concentration (Cmin [ mg/L]) 52.6 vs. 51.9 (p = 0.7894) for divalproex and 47.2 vs. 49.1 (p = 0.5470) for divalproex-ER; and (d) for degree of peak-trough fluctuation (DFL) 0.635 vs. 0.660 (p = 0.3687) for divalproex and 0.439 vs. 0.476 (p = 0.2241) for divalproex-ER. Conclusions: No significant differences in VPA pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between male and female participants receiving divalproex or divalproex-ER after accounting for dose, differences in body weight, study effect and multiple observations within a subject/patient.

Jacobson, and 3 Brenda Seals ( 1 Public Health, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; 2 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ; and 3 Public Health, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: It is well known in the neurology literature that anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) lead to bone loss. Several large epidemiologic studies have found twice the fracture rate in persons with epilepsy compared to non-epilepsy populations. To date no one has attempted to assess knowledge of osteoprotective behaviors in persons with epilepsy. Methods: The Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (OKT), a validated, 24-item test, was administered to 94 epilepsy patients. Kim, et al. developed the OKT to measure knowledge of risk factors for osteoporosis and strategies for prevention related to calcium and exercise. Results: Mean age of participants was 45 years with 20 years of AED exposure. There were 66 females and 28 males of which 50 were Caucasian and 44 were non-Caucasian. No significant differences related to age or gender for the OKT were found. One-way ANOVA of ethnicity found non-Caucasians had much lower knowledge for calcium (F = 8.15, p = .005) and exercise (F = 7.71, p = .007). Those reporting > 12 years of education had higher knowledge scores for calcium (F = 39.25, p = .000) and exercise (F = 17.09, p = .000). Subjects reporting an income above $30,001 had higher levels of knowledge for calcium (F = 3.93, p = .024) and exercise (F = 3.46, p = .037). Subjects who were seizure free > 1 year also had higher knowledge related to calcium (F = 6.76, p = .002) and exercise (F = 3.59, p = .032) compared to those reporting seizures within the last year. Significant differences in calcium knowledge were noted for individuals previously diagnosed with bone loss (F = 4.98, p = .028). In addition, for those reporting a family history of osteoporosis, knowledge was higher for calcium (F = 5.58, p = .005) and exercise (F = 6.23, p = .003). Subjects taking calcium supplements had higher knowledge for calcium (F = 5.35, p = .023) but not for exercise. No significant differences were found based on fracture history. Conclusions: Overall, this study adds to the understanding of patient knowledge related to bone loss in epilepsy. Age and gender appear to have little impact on knowledge related to osteoporosis, compared with socioeconomic factors such as years of education, yearly income and ethnicity. This mirrors what has been found in the medical literature for non-epilepsy populations. One area that may help improve knowledge is the use of culturally relevant education materials. Patient education materials that focus on facts and use medical terms foreign to the general public (disease history, etiology, symptoms, treatment options and side effects) are less effective and tend to be written at a level that exceeds the readability of most patients. Clinically, patients may need to achieve longer term seizure freedom before osteoprotective information can be recommended. Low socioeconomic status may place people at a disadvantage for prevention recommendations. 1 Siegward M. Elsas, 1 Garrett White, 1 Carole-Anne Randall-Stitt, and 1 Sonia Munoz ( 1 Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR ) Rationale: This is a pilot study to evaluate physiologic and potential therapeutic effects of a meditative relaxation technique in patients with complex partial epilepsy. Methods: Two patients with a 30 vs. 45 year history of complex partial and generalized seizures practiced meditative relaxation for 30 min per day over 12 months in the context of a behavioral program for seizure control. Three serial EEGs were obtained during simulated stress and meditative relaxation. In addition to epileptic spikes, changes in breathing and heartrate and tonic EMG were obtained as measures of body tension. Results: At baseline, the patients had 4.2 vs. 2.7 GTC and 6.9 vs. 1.9 CPS seizures on average per month despite optimal medical and surgical epilepsy care. Twelve months after initiation of the behavioral program, patient 1 was seizure free for 8 months and patient 2 had 0.15 GTC and 0 CPS on average per month. In both patients, body tension measures in the first serial EEG showed poor compliance with the meditative relaxation. In both patients, the second and third serial EEGs showed increased epileptic spikes and decreased body tension during meditative relaxation compared to the simulated stress periods. Conclusions: Meditative relaxation appears to increase epileptic spikes in the EEG but may reduce seizures for patients with complex partial epilepsy in the context of a behavioral program. It is known that sufficient sleep is essential for maintaining good seizure control, even though sleep temporarily increases epileptic spikes. In similarity to sleep, it is possible that the temporary increase in spikes during meditative relaxation practice may be beneficial to epilepsy patients.

(POLG) gene is presented for the first time with EEG findings. A broader clinical symptomatology has been presented previously, but not a detailed description of the epilepsy. The patients were either homozygous for the 1399 G > A or 2243 G > C mutation, or compound heterozygotes for either of the two mutations. Methods: Data from patients with therapy refractory status epilepticus were collected over several years, and tested for various mitochondrial mutations and delesions. After examination of several candidate areas mutations in POLG were found and subsequent candidate patients tested. Results: Irrespective of the genotype the epilepsies developed a similar semiology with initial features of occipital lobe epilepsy followed by more secondary generalized features including focal motor phenomena and GTC seizures. Occipital seizure phenomena included, flickering coloured lights, visual loss, nystagmus (horizontal or vertical), dysmorphopsia, micro-macropsia, palinopsia and most patients had simple motor phenomena suggesting frontal lobe seizure origin or spread. SPS, CPS, myoclonic seizures and frequent convulsive status epilepticus were observed in the epileptic syndrome. All but one patient developed status epilepticus. Ten of 19 patients are dead, all related to prolonged status epilepticus, icluding 2 with liver failure. Epilepsy was the most common presentation of the full clinical syndrome, often with headache. The mean age at epilepsy debut was 18,4 years (6?58). The broader clinical semiology of most of these patients have been presented (Wintherthun et al. Neurology 2005;64:1204?8 and Tzoulis et al. Brain 2006, in press). The epilepsy and consequences of valproate treatment has proven the most important factor for fatal outcome. Conclusions: Occipital lobe epilepsy is a hallmark of POLG mutations in the present patient population, and epilepsy an important factor in fatal outcome. (Supported by Helse-Vest, Bergen. Norway.) 1 Berend Feddersen, 1 Margret Kilian, 1 Cordula Mauerer, 1 Christian Vollmer, 1 Jan Ricken, and 1 Soheyl Noachtar ( 1 Epilepsy Center Department of Neurology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany ) Rationale: Most seizures of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are characterized by manual and oral automatisms preceded by abdominal aura. Head version, hand dystonia and secondary generalization reflect spread of epileptic seizure activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether different spread pattern in temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to generalize secondarily than others. Methods: We searched the data base of the University of Munich Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for the terms dystonia, version and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The first consecutive 62 TLE patients with seizure evolutions characterized by either dystonia (n = 24) or head version (n = 38) were included in the study. MRI and high quality EEG-videos recordings were available in all patients. 82 seizure evolutions with dystonia were intraindividually compared with 68 seizures of these patients without dystonia. In addition, 65 seizures with version were compared with 163 seizures of the same patients without version. All seizure evolutions were classified prospectively independent of the other clinical results based on a semiological seizure classification system. Head version was classfied independent of secondary generalization of a given seizure. Results: The rate of secondary generalization was significantly higher in seizures with version (86%, 56 of 65) than seizures with dystonia (17%, 14 of 82) (p < 0.001). The comparison of the rate of secondary generalization in seizures of the same patients with and without dystonia (and no version) revealed that the rate of secondary generalization was higher in seizures with dystonia (17% vs. 3%). However, the difference in rate of generalization was much higher in the seizures with version: 12% of the seizures generalized secondarily if no version was present as opposed to 86% in seizures with version. Conclusions: In TLE, epileptic spread to the frontal eye field, which is involved in generating head version is more likely to eventually lead to secondary generalization than spread to the basal ganglia, which is considered a generator of dystonia. These findings could support an inhibiting role of the basal ganglia for spread of epileptic activity. 1 Felicia Ferguson, 1 Martin C. Salinsky, and 1 David Spencer ( 1 Neurology, Oregon Health  Wilcoxon test). For the 1989 cohort, 80% of patients were on AEDs at the time of admission and 24% were on 2 or more AEDs. Results for the 2003 cohort were nearly identical (mean of 1.2 AEDs at admission for each group; NS). Conclusions: Our results show that patients with PS are now being referred for diagnostic evaluation much earlier than was the case 12 years earlier. During this time period there were no changes in the availability of inpatient monitoring in Oregon. Therefore, a likely explanation is the impact of efforts, local and national (AES), to educate students and physicians about PS. Despite progress, two years remains a considerable lag between onset of PS and diagnostic referral, and there has been no reduction in the use of AEDs to treat PS prior to diagnosis. 1 David M. Ficker, 1 Cynthia Hughes, 1 Michael D. Privitera, and 2 Rakesh Shukla ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: To determine which components of quality of life (HRQOL) are different between subjects who were seizure free and not seizure free at last follow up in a cohort of newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: We prospectively measure the QOLIE-89, Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Adverse Events Profile in patients within three months of a new diagnosis of epilepsy. Serial measures are performed every four months. Inclusion criteria are: age between 18?64, able to read and speak English and a minimum tenth grade education. Exclusion criteria are: inability to complete forms, presence of other neurologic or medical disorders that may affect HRQOL, prior craniotomy and use of medications that can affect the central nervous system (other than AEDs). A t-test was performed comparing QOL measures at last follow up between subjects who were seizure free and those not seizure free. Results: We enrolled 53 subjects with newly diagnosed epilepsy (22 males, 32 females). Follow-up data was available on 40 patients (mean duration of follow-up 1.3 years). At last follow-up, 65% were seizure free and 35% were not seizure free. Table 1 summarizes differences on QOL measures between these groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that a seizure free state is associated with a higher QOL and improved anxiety symptoms. We found non-significant trends toward superior scores on other POMS subscales in the seizure free group. 1 Measure Seizure free Not seizure free p value QOLIE-89 78.8 63.6 0.006 POMS tension/anxiety ?9.2 13.8 0.02?

Viaggio, 1 Maria E. Fontela, and 1 Alfredo Thomson ( 1 Epilepsy Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Non Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE) assembles different electrographic and clinical syndromes. Although consciousness impairment is its outstanding feature, several other manifestations such as behavioral and cognitive changes, turns it difficult to diagnose. Due to this pleomorfism, great knowledge of its clinical presentation and high suspicious index is mandatory for prompt diagnosis. Methods: Records of patients with diagnosis of Status Epilepticus admitted into our center between 1996 and 2005 were reviewed. According to clinical and electrographic criteria, cases of NCSE were selected. Semiology, demographic data, aetiology, referral latencies and delays in diagnosis, treatment given and mortality were considered and submitted to statistical analysis. Results: 63 patients were included, 3 of them presented more than 1 NCSE, totaling 68 NCSE. The study group mean age was 57 (±21), in it 35 patients were female. Main presenting features were: consciousness impairment, confusion, behavioral changes and prolonged postictal state. NCSE were classified as acute symptomatic: 26 cases, of remote aetiology: 30 cases and idiopathic or cryptogenic: 12 cases. Mean referral latency was 65 hours (few minutes to 1 month). On admission into our center, suspicious of NCSE arouse: immediately in 54 cases (79,41%), in 9 between 24 and 72 hours and in 5 cases around 96 hours (due to time required to rule out other aetiologies related to history of dementia, stroke, aphasia and psychiatric problems of these patients). Time to control status after treatment started, was 24 hours. The larger delay in referral the longer the time to control status (p = 0.0005). 11 cases were classified as refractory. Five patients died (7,3% of the study group). 4 deaths were related to the underlying disease. While new onset NCSE were 38 cases (with a mean age of 61.2 ± 21.3), NCSE among epileptic patients resulted in 25 cases (mean age: 50.8 ± 18.4); (difference in ages between these sub-groups determined: p = 0.03). Non epileptic patients revealed longer delays when looking for medical intervention; and among them NCSE of acute symptomatic aetiology was more frequent (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Our study population represents one of the largest groups when considering prior reports in the literature. Two main pieces of conclusions could be obtained from its analysis: In first place: Considerable delays in referral were observed probably due to confusing heterogeneous clinical presentation; this determined longer times to control status. Low mortality rate could be related to early diagnosis and few refractory cases. Secondly: in our study population NCSE appeared ?de novo? mainly among older patients and specially related to an underlying acute process. Absence of history of epilepsy resulted in longer delays in looking for medical help. We emphasize that: due to its potential control with prompt treatment and because of its heterogeneous presentation, high suspicious index could improve outcome of NCSE. 1 Nathan B. Fountain, and 1 Miao Liu ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: The rate of becoming seizure free (SF) in established epilepsy is unknown. It is often assumed that SF is unlikely to be achieved once epilepsy is established. An important principle of treatment is that seizures respond soon after an intervention or not at all and that there is a very low background rate of becoming SF that continues even if the intervention is ineffective. We hypothesized (incorrectly) that most patients would become SF at the time of an intervention and then would become SF at a constant very low rate afterward. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from patients in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data were acquired directly from patients and medical records, and refined, cleaned, and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to subjects with definite epilepsy > 5 years old with 3 or more SZ frequency entries to construct SZ frequency curves. Frequency of each SZ type was collected. For each subject, monthly SZ frequency was plotted over time throughout the study period. SF was defined as a total frequency of 0 for at least 6 mo. Duration of SF was defined by the interval between an intervention (surgery, adding a drug, increasing a drug dose, or other) and the last seizure. Results: From 1638 subjects, 988 had 3 or more SZ frequency entries. 231 were excluded because SF was present from the first entry. Therefore, 757 had active seizures at entry to the study and represented the population that could become SF. Of these, 32% (243) became SF and 68% (514) continued to have seizures. Prior to becoming SF, 34% (84) had a history of SF so that a 6 month interval of SF may not be different from their baseline. However, 50% (121) had a high baseline SZ frequency of > 1/mo while only 16% (38) had SZ frequency of < 1/mo. suggesting that SF was not due to low baseline SZ frequency. SF developed at the onset of an intervention in 54%, as expected. a cumulative plot of SF over time revealed a significant minority (25%) became SF over the next 24 mo., a rate of 13%/year. The rate of SF subsequently flattened after 24 mo. to a new baseline rate of only about 1?2% per year. Conclusions: A surprisingly significant minority of patients will become SF in the 2 years after the last intervention, suggesting it may take months for therapy to become effective in some situations. This suggests there are brain changes that occur over long durations, possibly in response to therapy. The low rate of SF subsequent to 2 years after an intervention is likely the baseline rate of SF in epilepsy since it occurred without any recent intervention. [figure 1] (Supported by University of Virginia.) 1 Marlise Frey, 1 Andres M. Kanner, and 1 Glenn T. Stebbins ( 1 Rush Epilepsy Center, Rush University Med Ctr, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Several retrospective studies have reported significant increases in apparent clearance (Cl) of lamotrigine (LTG) during pregnancy. Such an increase has been shown to be progressive until the 32nd week of gestation, followed by a rapid return postpartum to preconception levels. Failure to adjust LTG doses to the increase in Cl yields lower serum concentrations and may result in seizures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the LTG dose adjustments required across trimesters (TMs) to maintain preconception levels in a cohort remaining seizure free during pregnancy. Methods: A retrospective chart review study resulted in four patients meeting the following criteria: stable dose of LTG and seizure free state for at least one month prior to conception, LTG monotherapy or one adjunct AED with no known pharmacokinetic interactions. Adjunct AED dose was not adjusted during pregnancy. No concomitant drug therapy interfering with metabolic pathway of LTG. At least one documented LTG serum level at steady state (Css) and wt. per TM. No known seizures during pregnancy. LTG dose adjustments were only made in an attempt to maintain preconception levels. For each TM the following mean values were recorded for each pt.: wt., dose (in mg/kg), and LTG Css. LTG Cl was calculated with the equation: CL = dose (mg/kg/day)/LTG Css. Data were analyzed using a Friedman's ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. LTG values were normalized for weight (LTG/wt). This value was our primary outcome variable. We also compared serum LTG levels across TMs to assess if preconception values were maintained. Results: Serum LTG levels (median per TM: 1st = 5.6, range 5.8; 2nd = 7.6, range 5.8; 3rd = 7.6, range 12.6) did not change significantly across TMs (X2= 1.50, p = .47). LTG dose/wt (median per TM: 1st = 8.6 mg/kg, range 5.9 mg/kg; 2nd = 12.5 mg/kg, range 14.3 mg/kg; 3rd = 14.3 mg/kg, range 12.9 mg/kg) was significantly different across TMs (X2= 8.0, p = .02). Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant increase in LTG dose/wt from 1st to 2nd TM (Z =?1.83, p = .03 one-tailed) and between 2nd and 3rd TM (Z =?1.83, p = .03 one-tailed). Median increase in dose/wt from 1st to 2nd TM was 3.91 mg/kg/day (range = 8.4), and median increase from 2nd to 3rd TM was 1.96 mg/kg/day (range = 1.61). Conclusions: Increments of LTG dose across TMs can maintain preconception LTG levels throughout pregnancy. The required increase appeared greater between the 1st and 2nd TM than between the 2nd and 3rd TM, although our limited sample size precludes formal statistical analysis of these differences. This may appear counterintuitive as increased blood volume in the 3rd TM would seem to necessitate a larger increase in LTG dose. However, we controlled for this by normalizing LTG dose for wt. (LTG/wt). These results suggest that significant increases in LTG dose/wt are required to maintain preconception LTG serum levels across TM. Presently prospective data is being collected to expand on these findings. 1 Sandra S. Funayama, 1 Edna A. Monteiro, 1 Vera C. Terra-Bustamante, 1 Ricardo Guarnieri, 1 Otávio I. De Faria, 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 1 Veriano Alexandre Jr., 1 Lauro Wichert-Ana, 1 Jo?o A. Assirati Jr., 1 Carlos G. Carlotti Jr., 2 Li Li Min, 1 Marino M. Bianchin, 1 Jaime E. Hallak, and 1 Américo C. Sakamoto ( 1 Department of CIREP-Neurology, Psychiatry, and Medical Psychology, Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine, University of S?o Paulo at Ribeir?o, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Department of Neurology, UNICAMP-State University of Campinas, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: A large proportion of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) can be rendered seizure-free after surgery. In these patients, the benefit of surgical treatment seems to extend beyond seizure control, affecting many other aspects of their health and quality of life. Some of these benefits might be quite subjective and because of that might remain underevaluated. Recently, we have validated the Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy scale (SHE) for Brazilian patients. Here, we use SHE scale as a tool to further evaluate the benefits of surgical seizure control in refractory MTLE-HS. Methods: A validated version for Brazilian patients of the SHE scale was administered to 74 patients with refractory MTLE-HS during the presurgical evaluation, and to another 89 surgically treated MTLE-HS patients with good seizure control, in a case-control study. To assess seizure outcome we applied Engel's scale and we definied good seizure control as patients with Engel classes 1. The patients were matched by pre-surgical age, neurophysiological data, and neuroimaging variables. They were also matched by socio-economic level. For numeric variables, we used Mann-Whitney test. For categorical variables we applied Fisher's exact test. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with Wilks' Lambda multivariate test was used to assess mean differences of the six sub-scales scores of SHE scale. For those, results are expressed in mean (95% C.I.), and were significant if p < 0.05.

The mean results [95 C.I.] of the six sub-scales scores of SHE scale is presented in Table. Conclusions: Post-surgical good seizure control improves all the six sub-scales scores of SHE in refractory MTLE-HS. Our results strongly support that good post-surgical seizure control in medically refractory MTLE-HS improves health quality of life. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 Helena Gauffin, 1 Lena Raty, and 1 Birgitta Axelsson-Soderfeldt ( 1 Department of Neurology and Locomotion, Division of Neurology, Faculty of Health Sciences,Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden ) Rationale: The aim of this study was to compare seizure frequency and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment with the situation five years earlier in a group of young people with uncomplicated epilepsy. Methods: We followed 99 young people with uncomplicated epilepsy from 1999 to 2004. Data was collected from medical records from swedish hospitals and from self-reported questionnaires.We collected data about medication and seizure frequency. Results: One third of the patients were still using old anti-epileptic drugs (Phenytoin, Karbamazepin or Valproate) compared to 67% five years earlier. The number of patients using new antiepileptic drugs or a combination of drugs had increased from 23 to 41%. Despite of these changes of medication the seizure frequency had not improven significantly. However, the number of patients not using antiepileptic drugs had increased from 9 to 19% during these five years.These patients were also seizure free. Conclusions: There have been considerable changes in the use of anti-epileptic drugs during the last few years in this group and that reflects a shift in AED use in Sweden during this period. In this study we could not demonstrate that these changes of medication have improved the seizure frequency for young people with uncomplicated epilepsy. 1 Ian L. Goldsmith, and 1 Amit Verma ( 1 Department of Neurology, Peter Kelleway Section of Neurophysiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) remains an important part of presurgical evaluation. The initial doses of amobarbital required to induce an adequate clinical response varies in adults. Variation in dosing in 2 patients with diffuse unilateral hemispheric abnormalities, who underwent IAP as part of a presurgical evaluation, is reported. Methods: 5 intracarotid amobarbital injections were performed in 2 adult presurgical patients with diffuse unilateral hemispheric abnormalities. The patients had previously undergone prolonged video EEG monitoring, MRI head imaging and neuropsychological testing. Angiography was performed first to determine the degree of crossfilling. EEG monitoring was performed throughout the procedure. Injected doses of amobarbital ranged from 62.5 to 150 mg. Effectiveness of dosing was determined by the presence of a contralateral hemiplegia, ipsilateral slowing on EEG and the absence of obtundation that precluded adequate clinical testing. Testing was performed to determine lateralization of language and memory function. Results: The 2 patients studied had previously performed MRI imaging demonstrating diffuse left hemispheric abnormalites. In the first a multilobar neuronal migration abnormality was seen and in the second multilobar encephalomalacia was present. Neuropsychological testing in both patients was nonlateralizing. In both patients the IAP was performed with injection of the affected hemisphere first. An initial injection of 100 mg was increased to 125 mg in the first patient and to 150 mg in the second in order to achieve an effective dose. In injecting the contralateral, unaffected hemisphere, the first patient had an inital dose of 100 mg given that resulted in obtundation that precluded any clinical testing. This injection was later repeated at an initial dose of 50 mg that was then increased to 62.5 mg to achieve the desired effect with only brief obtundation. The second patient was given an initial dose of 75 mg that was effective with minimal obtundation. Conclusions: In the 2 patients with diffuse unilateral hemispheric abnormalities who underwent a bilateral IAP a significant difference in the required amobarbital dosing was observed. The effective dose of amobarbital was significantly less for the uninvolved hemisphere and was significantly higher for the affected hemisphere. 1 Zakaria Hakma, 1 Mercedes P. Jacobson, and 1 Ausim Azizi ( 1 Neurology, Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the parenchyma of the brain that may extend into the ventricles and, in rare cases, the subarachnoid space. Each year, approximately 37,000 to 52,400 people in the United States have an intracerebral hemorrhage. Seizures associated with nontraumatic ICH have not been fully characterized. There is little information relating seizures to clinical presentation, course, or outcome in ICH and the existing data do not define the role of anticonvulsants during the acute hospitalization for ICH. This study addresses these issues through a retrospective evaluation of patients with hypertensive ICH. Methods: We analyzed 123 consecutive admissions to our NICU between 12/2005 and 5/2006. Subjects with head trauma, brain neoplasm, aneurysms or any etiology to explain the ICH besides hypertension (HTN) were excluded. 78 ICH met the criteria. Clinical features, timing of seizures relative to hemorrhage onset, factors predisposing to ICH, including HTN, bleeding diathesis (thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation therapy), worsening of clinical and radiographic findings after the seizure were assessed. Results: Demographics: Median age 62.8, range 35 to 90 years. Ethnicity: African American 59%, Caucasian 25%, Hispanic 11.5% and Asian 4% . 85.9% had Chronic HTN and 33% had prior CVA; 4 subjects had history of seizures. Average BP on admission was 170/95. Fourteen patients were coagulopathic. Clinical presenting features were: change in mental status 35%, Hemiparesis 25.6%, Headache18%, Aphasia 5%, and Seizure 2.5%. ICH location: Basal ganglia/thalamus 51.2%, Lobar 41%, Cerebellar 2.5%, and Pons 3.8%. Intraventricular extension occurred in 38.4%. Of 78 subjects, 2 had seizures, both upon presentation, both with prior seizures. 75 subjects were evaluated for AED prophylaxis (AEDP). 23 (30%) received AEDP. Lobar hemorrhages comprised 46% of AEDP but only 32% of the no AEDP group. Average ICU stay for all subjects was 7.8 days compared to subjects who received AED 10.6 days and subjects who did not receive AED 6.2 days. Adverse effects attributed to AEDP included fever, abnormal liver functions and hypotension. Based on one-way ANOVA there was a significant difference on length of stay between subjects who did not receive AED prophylactic and those who did (F = 5.52, p = 0.022). Conclusions: In this series of HTN ICH, the incidence of acute seizures was 2.6% and those subjects with seizures had antecedent epilepsy. This contrasts to previous reports. Features of our population would suggest a greater tendency to seizure. Subjects with seizures had their ictal event at or shortly after, hemorrhage onset, a finding previously reported. In our series 23 subjects received prophylactic AED therapy; however none of the remaining 55 subjects had clinical seizures during their hospital stay. Additionally, those who received AEDs had longer ICU stays and increased non-neurologic complications. 1 Nathan C. Hantke, 1 Michael J. Doherty, and 1 Alan M. Haltiner ( 1 Neuroscience Institute/Epilepsy Center, Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: The incidence of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) varies with demographic, psychological and clinical history variables (i.e. gender, MMPI profiles, age of seizure onset, etc). Medication use may also differ; PNES patients generally take fewer AEDS than patients with epileptic seizures (ES). Few studies have explored the utilization of other medications within these two populations. This study evaluated the types of medications used by patients with PNES and ES. Methods: Hospital records of a consecutive series of adult patients who completed video-EEG monitoring and were diagnosed with ES (n = 178) or PNES (n = 170) were prospectively reviewed. Patients with both pseudoseizure and an epilepsy diagnosis were excluded. Medication variables examined include: the type and number of different prescribed medications, including current AEDs, previously tried AEDs, medications for psychiatric symptoms (typical and atypical SSRI, tricyclics, anti-psychotics, anxiolytics), pain medications (both narcotic and non-narcotic), and others. Results: PNES patients were on nearly twice as many total medications at the time of admission (M = 6.0) than ES patients (M = 3.2, p < .01). PNES patients were more likely to be taking psychiatric medications, anti-hypertensives, inhalers, gastric-reflux medications, and analgesics(all p < 0.01). Nearly half of the PNES group took analgesics (46%) compared to only 11% of patients with ES (p < 0.01). Narcotic pain medication use was common in the PNES (32%) population but rare in the ES group (3.4%, p < 0.01). Patients with epilepsy were currently taking more AEDS and were tried on more in the past than PNES patients (p < 0.01). However, the duration of illness was longer in the ES group (p < 0.01). When the total number of AEDS tried was divided by the duration of the disorder, PNES patients tried more AEDS per unit of time than ES patients (p < 0.05). 28% of all PNES patients took benzodiazepines compared to only 7% of ES patients (p < .01). Benzodiazapine monotherapy for ?seizures? was reported exclusively in the PNES group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate increased utilization of a variety of different medications by patients with PNES as compared to ES. The increased medication usage might reflect increased physician utilization, drug intolerance by psychogenic patients, and other markers of somatization. PNES patients were not only taking more AEDS per duration of their ?epilepsy?, but also more commonly use benzodiazepines as monotherapy. The increased benzodiazepine usage among PNES patients could reflect physicians' attempts to treat both psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and presumed epilepsy. In combination with other clinic data, the medication profiles may provide clues about the likelihood of diagnosing PNES or ES. 1 Nicole C. Hank, and 1 Steve S. Chung ( 1 Barrow Neurological Institute, Neurology, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: Patients who volunteer for phase II and phase III clinical trials can gain access to investigated drugs long before these compounds are approved by the FDA. Patients participating in double blind, placebo-controlled trials of new medications are invited to partake in an open label extension study. Patients are openly given the active medication at this stage, regardless of their assignment in the initial trial, as long as the study permits. In order to determine if the open label extension phase has an impact on patient enrollment, we surveyed study participants who are currently participating in open label extension trials at our epilepsy center. Methods: All epilepsy patients who are currently participating in one out of 6 phase II or III trials at the Barrow Neurological Institute were included in the study. Questionnaires were administered to patients during their clinic visits or via email. Participating patients were asked questions regarding how open-label extension trials impacted their decision on participation and continuation in a study. In addition, patients were asked to rate their reasons on a 1?5 scale (5 being the most influential) why they would remain in the study in case of potential adverse events or no benefit in the initial placebo-controlled phase. Results: All 41 patients replied to questionnaires. The median age of patients was 32, ranging from 19 to 64 years old. Almost two-third of them were female (68% compared to 32% of males). Thirty-seven of the 41 study participants (90%) answered that they decided to participate in a trial because of the offered open label extension phase. Ninety-Five percent (35 out of 37) admitted that they would have not participated in a research trial if an open label extension had not been offered. Despite 56% (23 out of 41) of patients experienced medication related adverse events (AEs), 87% of them participated in the open label extension phase. All the patients who experienced little or no medication related AEs also proceeded to an open extension. Even though 15 out of 41 patients experienced no significant seizure improvement during the initial placebo controlled phase, all of them participated in the open extension phase. The majority of the patients (83%) identified that the available open label extension phase was one of most influential reasons for remaining in clinical trials (X = 4.2). Conclusions: Open label extension phase is an important and motivating factor why patients would initially participate in clinical trials. Regardless of success of the initial placebo controlled phase, the majority of patients would participate in an open label extension phases. Thus, offering open label phase could significantly increase the patient recruitment in the early phase of clinical trials. 1 Cynthia Harden, 1 Blagovest Nikolov, 1 Douglas Labar, 2 Kristen Fowler, 3 Michael Sperling, 3 Joyce Liporace, 4 Page Pennell, 2 Donald Schomer, 4 Melanee Newman, 3 Gwen Taylor, and 2 Andrew Herzog ( 1 Neurology, Weill Medical Collage of Cornell University, New York, NY ; 2 Harvard Neuroendocrine Unit, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ; 3 Neurology, Thomas Jefferson Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ; and 4 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Seizure severity is an important aspect of epilepsy, however the relationship between quality of life in epilepsy and seizure severity has been incompletely explored. Further, since various seizure severity scales have been used in clinical research, this association is limited by the scope of the seizure severity scale. Using a dataset from the baseline phase of clinical treatment trial, the relationship between seizure severity and aspects of quality of life were evaluated. Methods: Data obtained at the initial visit of the baseline phase of subjects enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial entitled ?Progesterone Therapy for Women with Epilepsy? were used. Seizure severity was assessed using the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3) which consists of 7 questions with 2?4 degrees of responses and scores that range from 1?27 (higher is more severe). This scale focuses on events that occur during the seizure and injuries, rather than postictal recovery. Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-31. Statistical methods were Spearman's bivariate correlations and linear regression. Results: One hundred eighteen subjects were evaluated; all were women between the ages 18?45 years. Domains of the QOLIE-31 that significantly correlated with seizure severity were seizure worry (r = 0.265, p = 0.004) and social functioning (r = 0.280, p = 0.002). The overall QOL and cognitive domain each slightly correlated with seizure severity (r = 0.212, p = 0.021; r = 0.205, p = 0.026, respectively). When controlling for the effect of a potential confounding variable, the Beck Depression Inventory, the regression of seizure severity with the QOLIE seizure worry and social functioning remained significant (p = 0.004; p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Seizure severity using the NHS3 correlated with the seizure worry and social functioning domains of the QOLIE-31. These findings indicate that severe and potentially injurious seizure behaviors affect specific aspects of quality of life in epilepsy. Furthermore, these effects of seizure severity on quality of life persist even after accounting for the influence of depression and likely contribute to anxiety and socially avoidant behavior for persons with epilepsy.

Fowler, and Progesterone Trial Study Group ( 1 Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; and 2 Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Harvard University, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Estimates of the prevalence of catamenial epilepsy differ in definitions used to designate catamenial epilepsy. Past investigations have focused on the relationship between seizure occurrence and either menstrual phase or reproductive hormone levels. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the periodicity of seizures in women to test the hypothesis that they have circalunar or ultralunar patterns of occurrence independent of a priori hormonal considerations. In the present study we determined seizure periodicity according to a ?menstrual clock? provided by a common phase marker of the onset of menstrual bleeding. Methods: Baseline, pretreatment data from seizure and menstrual diaries of ?3 months duration were obtained from women enrolled in a trial of hormonal therapy for localization-related epilepsy. Midluteal serum progesterone levels classified each cycle as ovulatory (>5ng/ml) (OC) or anovulatory (AC). To group seizure data, durations of individual cycles were normalized to a common menstrual phase and period. The start for each cycle was identified as the onset on menstrual bleeding (day 1). Intervening days were then converted to 28 normalized cycle days. Normalized time series were then combined to create mean seizures per menstrual day divided between OC and AC. Rhythms of seizure occurrence were then characterized with cosinor-nonlinear least squares analysis that iteratively tested all potential rhythms for best-fit described by period, amplitude, phase, and mean within designated confidence limits. Rhythms were designated significant when the lower confidence limit of the amplitude > 0 by single-tailed p-value < 0.05. Results: 100 patients provided 3344 seizures within 293 cycles. The duration of cycles before normalization ranged from 20?37 days (mean ± standard deviation, 27.92 ± 2.89). 77% cycles were OC (2587/3344); 20% were AC (673/3344). 3% of seizures occurred during cycles with indeterminate status and were discarded. Seizures during OC displayed a significant circalunar rhythm of occurrence of 31.7 days (26.9?36.5, 90% confidence interval) with peak phase of occurrence at onset of menses. Seizures during AC not only featured a circalunar rhythm of 28.6 (26.4?30.7) days that peaked at menses onset but were also characterized with ultralunar rhythms of 14.0 (13.6?14.3) days and 9.0 (8.9?9.1) days. Conclusions: This study determined that seizures in women with localization-related epilepsy occur in a circalunar rhythm during both ovulatory and anovulatory menstrual cycles. Ovulatory and anovulatory cycles differ in seizure timing with the seizures in the latter occurring in ultralunar rhythms in addition to the predominant circalunar rhythm. This finding supports the existence of catamenial epilepsy and differences in patterns of seizure occurrence between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. 1 Yue-Loong Hsin, 1 Min-Fei Chuang, and 2 Tomor Harnod ( 1 Department of Neurology, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan ) Rationale: To study the clinical grounds, neuroimaing and EEG activity from a three-generation of family with autosomal dominance of adult-onset myoclonic epilepsy. Methods: A 3-generation family of 10 affected members in east-Taiwan was studied with video-EEG and brain MRI. Results: Autosomal dominant hereditary was showed. The myoclonic seizure semiology is characterized by bilaterally symmetric jerks of the shoulders, arms, or legs. Ictally, the consciousness is not affected. The ictal EEG demonstrated polyspike-wave. Rare generalized tonic-clonic seizures occur in 2 patients. No absence is reported. The myoclonic seizures do not related to sleepiness. And no involuntary movement, such as chreoasthetosis or astasia was accompanied. No structural disorder was demonstrated. A lower dose of valproic acid (200 to 500 mg/D) is required to stop the myoclonic seizure. Conclusions: Mutations of the GABRA1 gene, CACNB4 gene and CLCN2 gene have been described in the autosomal dominance inheritance patterns of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (range, 10 to 20 years). Late-adult onset of myoclonic epilepsy is not a recognized epileptic syndrome. This is a distinct familial epileptic syndrome different from recognized myoclonic epilepsies in infancy and early childhood, or myoclonias and absences in childhood and adolescence. 1 Kerry L. Hulsing, 1 Linda Selwa, and 1 Karuna Mandava ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ) Rationale: Employment status is a significant issue for people with epilepsy. Employment has been described as an important factor in their quality of life, yet high unemployment rates have been previously reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate employment status and factors associated with employment in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Data were collected from 44 adult epilepsy patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery at the University of Michigan. Data was obtained via self-completed questionaire and from the patient's medical record. Students were excluded. Results: The unemployment rate in this population was 72%. Overall quality of life was rated higher in the employed group, but did not reach statistical significance. There was not a significant difference in age of onset of seizures or seizure frequency between the employed and unemployed. Those that were employed had attained a higher level of education on average, with 40% having a college degree, compared to 11% in the unemployed population. The importance of employment to quality of life was rated highly, with 75% of the population reporting it as very important. 17% of the population reported that they continued to drive. Lack of seizure control was ranked as the primary variable hindering employment by 96% of the unemployed. Driving status alone had the highest odds of predicting employment status (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Employment status is an important quality of life issue for people with epilepsy, yet the unemployment rate in those with medically refractory epilepsy is much higher than that of the general population. Awareness of this issue may be helpful to epileptologists in caring for this patient population. 1 Jaromir Janousek, 1 Arkady Barber, and 1 Pavel Klein ( 1 Epilepsy, Mid-Atlantic Epilepsy and Sleep Center, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Estrogens are generally thought to have a proconvulsant effect.In animals, estrogens activate spike discharges and lower seizure threshold. In humans, catamenial seizure exacerbation at the time of ovulation has been suggested to be due to a peri-ovulatory surge of serum estradiol level (Herzog AG et al., Epilepsia 1997). In the only such study in humans, intravenous administration of conjugated estrogens (premarin) was reported to activate epileptiform discharges and seizures in some women with epilepsy (Logothesis J, et al., Neurol 1959). More recently, oral administration of premarin in perimenopausal women with epilepsy indicated dose-related seizure exacerbation with premarin (Harden C, et al., Epilepsia 2004). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reported proconvulsant effect of estrogens could be used to activate seizures in women with epilepsy undergoing EEG monitoring for pre-surgical work up. Methods: Women of reproductive age with medically refractory localization related epilepsy (LRE) were evaluated. Subjects undergoing in-patient long term video-scalp EEG (LTVEEG) monitoring were injected with 10 mg premarin i.v. at 8 am during the first or second day of monitoring, before AED discontinuation. No changes in AEDs were made for 24 hours after premarin injection. In two subjects, a second injection of 50 mg was given 24 hours after the 10 mg injection. All subjects had been evaluated for presence of catamenial seizure exacerbation using both subjects' subjective impression and previously described criteria (Herzog AG et al., Ann Neurol 2004). Serum levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone were measured immediately before and 1 and 2 hours after premarin injection. EEG was recorded continuously and stored for manual and automated spike and seizure analysis. EEG was analysed for spike and seizure frequency using 30 minute bins during 12 hours before and 24 hours after the injection. Results: 6 women (age range 23?45) were evaluated. 4 women had subjective impression of catamenial seizure exacerbation, (3 Type I, perimenstrual exacerbation, 1 Type 1 and 2, perimenstrual and periovulatory exacerbation), but this could be confirmed with prospective seizure diary documentation in only 1. 4 subjects had TLE (left, n = 2; right, n = 1; bitemporal, n = 1), 2 had extratemporal LRE. 0/6 women had a seizure during 24 hours after premarin injection with either 10 mg (n = 6) or 50 mg (n = 2 of the initial 6). There was no change in interictal spike frequency following premarin injection, including absence of spikes for 24 hours after premarin injection in 2 women. Conclusions: Intravenous injection of conjugated estrogens did not activate ictal or interictal epileptiform activity in this small study of women with medically refractory epilepsy. Estrogen injection may not be a useful activating procedure in these patients. A larger study is needed to confirm these preliminary findings. 1 Sigmund Jenssen, 1 Eve Khlyavich, and 1 Jyoti Pillai ( 1 Neurology, Drexel Medical College, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Some patients whose seizures routinely is preceded by an aura claim they are able at times to delay or abort the seizure. It is unclear if this subjective experience is real or if the experience somehow is caused by the seizure itself. We wanted to explore if there is any relationship between this claim and seizure type, the presumed seizure focus and the aura. Methods: After approval by IRB was obtained patients answered a questionnaire in the presence of the doctor and their charts were reviewed. Only patients with verified epilepsy were included and all had to have a reliable aura. We correlated the claim of influence over seizures with the epileptic focus according to EEG and/or brain MRI, duration and quality of aura and presence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures using Chi Square. Results: 65 patients were included. Mean age was 45 years (range 20 to 70) of which 20 were males. 28 patients (43%) reported that they some times could delay or abort seizures voluntarily. The methods included directing the thought content (20 patients), moving the body (16 patients) or stimulating the body (14 patients). More patients who reported some influence had extratemporal focus (p < 0.001). No correlation was found with type and duration of aura or presence of generalized tonic clonic seizures. Conclusions: A substantial portion of patients who have seizures with aura claim they are able to influence the progression of their seizures. This claim was more common among patients with extratemporal focus. A possible explanation could be that afferent inputs into the cerebral cortex exert an inhibitory effect thereby delaying the propagation of an exitatory epileptic focus. Further research may provide insight into the mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon. 1 Barbara C. Jobst, 1 Karen L. Gilbert, 1 Vijay M. Thadani, and 1 Gregory L. Holmes ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Pregnancy registries are increasingly established to correlate malformation rate with use of AEDs in women with epilepsy. Other seizure and AED related problems remain unanswered in the treatment of epileptic pregnant women. Seizures during pregnancy are assumed to be detrimental, but significantly increased adverse outcomes have not been systematically studied. Methods: Retrospective review of 35 pregnancies that were followed in a highly specialized pregnancy and seizure clinic in an academic institution. Seizure occurrence, complication rate, abortion rate, malformation rate, preconceptive counseling and AED adjustments and levels were recorded during pregnancy. Results: Of 35 pregnancies in 34 women, there were 22 deliveries, one first-trimester abortion and one 20-week abortion due to severe neural tube defect in a pregnancy on lamotrigine monotherapy (LTG). 11 women have not delivered yet. There were 2/35 (5.7%) true malformations (neural tube defect, craniosynostosis) and 11/33 viable pregnancies were complicated by other than seizures (oliohydramion/low birth weight in three, rash due to AEDs in three, HELLP syndrome, bleeding, severe migraines, prematurity). 23 of 35 (65%) of all and 14 of 22 (63%) of completed pregnancies were complicated by seizures. This reflects the specialized referral pattern. Seizure occurred equally in the first, second or third trimester (p > 0.05). Of the six pregnancies with malformations, prematurity or low birth weight, four had seizures during pregnancy, two had generalized tonic-clonic convulsions (GTC). Overall 7/35 (20%) pregnancies were complicated by GTCs with two off-spring related complications (low-birth weight and neural tube defect). Only one patient had seizures during delivery (4.5%). Three previously well controlled patients had reoccurrence of myoclonic seizures when switched to lamotrigine monotherapy prepregnancy. In 17/35 (48.5%) of pregnancies, AEDs needed to be changed either due to seizure exacerbation, side effects or decreasing levels. LTG (n = 10) required regular adjustment of dosing due to decreasing levels, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, levetiracetam and topiramate levels were more stable. Data on oxcarbazepine was insufficient. Three patients had their first seizure during pregnancy and all of those patients were not treated with AEDs. 12 (34.2%) of patients underwent prepregnancy counseling. Conclusions: Management of seizures during pregnancy remains challenging. The impact of seizures in pregnancies with or without AEDs needs to be studied in larger studies. Systematic investigation of AED adjustments during pregnancy is required to assess utility. Myoclonic epilepsies treated with LTG alone can be problematic in pregnancy. Specialized clinics can increase preconceptive intervention and improve AED management. 1 Luydmila Jovine, 1 Blagovest Nikolov, 1 Douglas Labar, 2 Stephen Ferrando, 1 Padmaja Kandula, 1 Sona Narula, and 1 Cynthia Harden ( 1 Neurology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ; and 2 Psychiatry, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Patients with non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (NES) frequently have affective disorders, anxiety disorders and personality disorders. Further, the presence of personality disorders in NES patients is associated with intractability. However, the personality disorders of NES patients that impair coping skills and contribute to the occurrence of NES are not fully understood. We sought to determine the type of personality disorders associated with NES patients compared to epilepsy patients by prospectively evaluating adult patients admitted for video-EEG. Methods: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the hospital for video-EEG monitoring found to have NES were studied; the epilepsy comparator group was derived using a simultaneously admitted patient with findings on video-EEG confirming the diagnosis of epilepsy. No patients who had findings of both disorders on video-EEG were studied. Patients who could communicate in English and without significant cognitive impairment were included. Personality was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders. Personality disorders were then divided into personality clusters described in the DSM-IV, which are based on functional status: A (paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid), B (borderline, histrionic, antisocial, narcissistic) or C (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive). Results: Sixteen NES subjects were studied, 15 were women. Sixteen epilepsy subjects were studied, 10 were women. Three subjects in the NES group had no personality disorder, compared to four in the epilepsy group. Twelve subjects in the NES group met criteria for either Cluster A or B type personality disorders, or both, compared to six in the epilepsy group. However, only one NES patient met criteria for Cluster C personality disorder, compared to six in the epilepsy group. The distribution of having a Cluster A and/or B personality disorder compared to Cluster C or no personality disorder was significantly different between NES and epilepsy groups (chi-square p = 0.03). Conclusions: NES patients are more likely meet criteria for a personality disorder that is more dysfunctional, in the Cluster A or B group, compared to epilepsy patients, who are more likely to have Cluster C personality disorders, predominantly obsessive-compulsive and avoidant. We suggest that the Cluster A or B personality features contribute to the occurrence of NES, while Cluster C behaviors in epilepsy patients may be in part a reaction to the experience of having chronic recurrent seizures. 1 Eleanor B. Justen, 1 Glenn Catalano, and 1 William O. Tatum IV ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ; Department of Psychiatry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL; and Department of Neurology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: Psychiatric profiles of patients with PNES have been described. Limited comparison exists between historical self-reported psychiatric profiles with formal in-patient assessment. We compared patient self-reported psychiatric diagnosis with formal in-patient psychiatric evaluations preformed at the time of PNES diagnosis. Methods: Twenty six patients with confirmed PNES by inpatient VEEG done at a tertiary care epilepsy center were reviewed. The patients demographic information, history of headaches, suicide attempts, history of abuse, insomnia, chronic pain, self reported psychiatric problems, psychiatric medications, Anti-epileptic drugs, and psychiatric evaluation were collected and compared. Axis I diagnosis was made according to DSM-IV TR criteria. Statistical comparison was done looking at relative frequency of symptoms. The number of patients that self reported depression was compared to the number of patients to receive an Axis I diagnosis using the Mann-Whitney test. Data is reported as median (mean ± SD). Results: The patients were 42.3% males and had a median age of 43.5 years (40.4 ± 15.5). Only 19 of 26 patient received formal psychiatric evaluations while in hospital. Of the 19 patients, 89.5% had self reported mood disorder compared to 84.2% that received a formal inpatient Axis I diagnosis showing no statistical difference (p = 0.783). 76.9% of all patients self reported a history of psychiatric symptoms. Vegetative symptoms such as headaches and insomnia were reported in 73% and 58% respectively. Seven patients (27%) reported suicide attempts in their lifetime. 18 of the 26 (69%) were already taking SSRIs at the time of evaluation, with 53.8% having been exposed to multiple psychiatric medications. Only 4% required altered medications during their hospitalization. Conclusions: We conclude that self-reported psychiatric diagnoses are concordant with psychiatric evaluation in patient PNES diagnoses. The majority of PNES patients were currently taking psychotropic medication at the time of in-patient diagnosis, and required no modification following formal psychiatric evaluation. The primary focus for ongoing psychiatric treatment in PNES patient should be provided on an outpatient basis. 3 Buchwaldt Fredrik, 2 Jan-Anders Ahnlide, 2 Ingmar Rosén, and 1 Kristina Källén ( 1 Neurology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden ; 2 Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden ; and 3 Neurology, University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden ) Rationale: To assess the additional value of subtraction ictal SPECT co-registrated to MRI (SISCOM) for localisation of the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy surgery. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 49 consecutive epilepsy patients who had undergone invasive monitoring between January 2000 and Mars 2006 and had presurgical examination with high resolution 1.5T MRI or higher field strength. Attempts for ictal SPECT as part of the pre-surgical work-up was made for 29 patients, two patients had no seizures during ictal SPECT preparedness, SISCOM analysis showed areas with significant hyperperfusions in 26 patients. By SISCOM analysis interictal and ictal images were normalized, subtracted and coregistered with MRI. The standard deviation of the ictal hyperperfusion was measured in each hemisphere and the hemisphere with the least standard deviation was used as reference. Hyperperfusions exceeding 3.5 SD were considered significant. Two independent epileptologists evaluated if SISCOM results (A) altered the hypothesis and extended the strategy for electrode placement at invasive recording, or (B) did not alter the strategy. We defined that SISCOM had an impact on seizure outcome if the seizure onset zone was seen in electrodes overlying a brain region with a significant hyperperfusion. Engel class I-II was considered favorable outcome at one-year postoperative follow-up. SISCOM was considered a prerequisite for favorable outcome when concordant with invasive ictal onset in extended electrodes. Results: Twenty-six patients were offered surgery; 20 had localizing data from SISCOM and > 1 y follow-up whereof 40% had favorable outcome. A. SISCOM findings were complementary to other localizing non-invasive findings and altered and extended the strategy for electrode placement at invasive recording in 15 patients. SISCOM was a prerequisite for seizure outcome in all 6 patients with favorable outcome. Nine patients had poor results from surgery; SISCOM was concordant with invasive EEG in 6 patients, and discordant with invasive EEG with no impact on outcome in 3 patients. B. SISCOM findings did not change the hypothesis for electrode placement at invasive recording in 5 patients, but SISCOM was confirmatory with other localizing data in the 2 patients with favorable outcome. Three patients had poor results from surgery; SISCOM was concordant with invasive EEG in 1 patient, and discordant with invasive EEG and with no impact on results in 2 patients. When SISCOM was concordant with invasive EEG the predictive value for favorable outcome was 53%. Conclusions: SISCOM is valuable for the identification of the epileptogenic zone in patients with drug resistant epilepsy scheduled for invasive video-EEG. In all patients with favorable seizure outcome at one year follow-up SISCOM analysis was either a prerequisite for the favorable result or concordant with other localizing data. 1,2 Maria Kaartinen, 3 Anna-Maija Haapala, 5 Markku Maki, 4 Jani Raitanen, 1 Tapani Keranen, 6 Katri Kaukinen, and 1 Jukka Peltola ( 1 Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland ; 2 Medical School, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland ; 3 Department of Clinical Microbiology, Center for Laboratory Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland ; 4 School of Public Health, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland ; 5 Department of Pediatrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland ; and 6 Department of Gastroenterology and Alimentary Tract Surgery, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland ) Rationale: Previously, several studies have shown an increased prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies in patients with refractory localization-related epilepsy (RLRE). Gliadin antibodies (AGA) have been associated with brain pathology, most commonly in patients with cerebellar degeneration. We have recently described an association between AGA antibodies, gluten sensitivity and temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. The first objective of the present study is to compare the frequencies of aPL or GAD antibodies in epilepsy patients with and without AGA. The secondary objective is to compare the frequencies of celiac disease (CD) related antibodies between RLRE and generalized epilepsy (GE). Methods: We measured CD related antibodies [AGA, anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies] in 50 consecutive patients with GE syndromes and 48 consecutive patients with RLRE. The frequencies of aPL and GAD antibodies have been reported previously. Results: Patients with AGA-positivity had a greater prevalence of aPL antibodies and GAD-antibodies. IgG-class AGA were significantly associated with GAD-antibodies (p = 0,042) and IgG-class aPL (p = 0,018). IgA-class AGA were associated with IgG-class aPL (p = 0,029). 50% of the patients with IgG-class AGA harbour also IgG-class aPL, which is five times more than in AGA-negative patients. In patients with IgG-class AGA-positivity 33% (nine times more common than in AGA-negative patients) had also antibodies against GAD. In multiple regression analysis, age, sex, and duration of epilepsy were not associated with the prevalence of antibodies in patients with AGA-positivity. The frequencies of all measured antibodies were higher in RLRE compared with GE except with AGA-antibodies, which were more common in GE group. Conclusions: In the present study we demonstrated that both aPL antibodies and GAD antibodies were strongly associated with AGA. The co-expression of CD related autoantibodies and anti-GAD autoantibodies is of special interest, because increased expression of various autoantibodies including anti-GAD autoantibodies has been reported in patients with CD and moreover, in patients with cerebellar degeneration and AGA. This study provides additional evidence of immunological activation in epilepsy: sensitivity to dietary gluten may explain partly the presence of antineuronal antibodies such as aPL and GAD. 1 Joong Koo Kang, 1 Eun Mi Lee, 2 Jung Kyo Lee, 2 Seok Ho Hong, and 1 Sang Ahm Lee ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: Although all patterns and frequencies of seizure onset were recorded in both temporal and extratemporal locations, some specific ictal patterns during intracranial recordings may help to predict surgical outcome. The purpose of this study is to compare the intracranial ictal EEG (ictal EEG) patterns in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to find the ictal patterns suggesting good surgical outcome. Methods: We analyzed total 128 seizures in 33 TLE patient underwent invasive intracranial study using bilateral temporal depth and subdural electrodes. Of the 33 patents, 26 were underwent temporal lobectmy with amygdallohippocampectomy, in whom 21 were ?seizure-free? and 5 were ?not seizure-free? with minimum 1 year follow-up. Seven were not operated. We divided the patients into 3 groups as ?seizure-free?, ?not seizure-free? and ?non-operation?. We analyzed each ictal EEG charicteristics based on presence or absence of peri-ictal discharges, ictal distribution, involved number of electrodes, waveform pattern, onset frequency and interhemispheric propagation time (IHPT). Statistical analysis used chai-squre, Fisher's exact test and ANOVA test using SPSS 12.0 version. Results: There are no differences in dermographic data including sex, onset age, duration of epilepsy, risk factor and hippocampal atrophy on MRI among 3 groups. But all analyzed ictal EEG charicteristics have statistically significant difference among 3 groups. The presence of peri-ictal discharges was exclusively observed in ?seizure-free?. The lesser number of involved elcetrodes with ictal distribution of ?depth only? or ?depth and medial strip electrode? were associated with ?seizure-free? but ?non-operation? had spatially wider distribution of ictal onset involving ?diffuse strip and depth? or ?strip only?. Higher onset frequency above beta range more correlated to ?seizure-free? while slow onset frequency lesser than alpha in others. Ictal onset patterns with fast spike trains were exclusively observed in ?seizure-free?, whereas pattern with rhythmic activity was common in ?not-seizure-free? and ?non-operation?. IHPT was 22. 46 ± 19.44 seconds(s) in ?seizure-free?, 18.56 ± 16.74 s in ?not seizure-free?, but 5.96 ± 8.04 s in ?non-operation. IHPT was signifiantly shorter in ?non-operation?. Conclusions: Intracranial ictal EEG patterns are significantly different among ?seizure-free?,??not seizure-free? and ?non-operation?. These findings suggest that analysis of ictal EEG patterns help to predict surgical outcome. 1 Makoto Kawai, 2 Daniel Yoshor, 1 Ian L. Goldsmith, and 1 Amit Verma ( 1 Peter Kellaway Section of Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been reported to improve daytime sleepiness in patients with epilepsy when measured at 3 months post-treatment, however the long term effects of VNS on excessive sleepiness are unknown. To assess whether VNS results in sustained and clinically relevant improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), we measured patients' daytime sleepiness levels before and after the use of VNS. Methods: Patients seen by a single epileptologist (AV) in the Baylor Comprehensive Epilepsy Center completed questionnaires for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) prior to beginning VNS and at periodic intervals thereafter. The ESS is a standardized and validated scale used to assess sleepiness. A score of greater than 10 is indicative of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). To determine if VNS results in a clinically significant improvement in daytime functioning, we examined the effect of VNS on sleepiness in patients who suffered from EDS prior to VNS. Only improvements in the ESS to levels less than 10 were considered clinically meaningful. Medication dosage and seizure frequency were evaluated to determine if they influenced ESS scores. Results: Eighteen consecutive patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator were asked to participate in this study and 14 complied. The mean age of patients who participated in the study was 32 years (range 17?63; Male:5, Female:9). Mean follow-up period was 13 months (range 3?32 months). The mean pre-implantation ESS score for all enrolled patients was 11.8. The mean post-implantation scores at approximately 3 months, 6 months and 12 months were 9.8, 9.6 and 10.1 respectively. Eight of the 14 patients had pre-implantation EDS (ESS score greater than 10). Of these eight EDS patients, four never exhibited meaningful improvement in their ESS at any time-point after VNS was initiated, while two had transient improvements and only two had sustained improvement at last follow-up. This could not be explained by medication changes or changes in seizure frequency. Conclusions: VNS may reduce daytime sleepiness in patients with epilepsy. The effects in our patients were not as robust as have been previously reported and the effects may also not be sustained. (Supported by Peter Kellaway, PhD Foundation for Research.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and clinical factors to predict acute symptomatic seizures with CNS infections. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with CNS infections from 2000 to 2005. We excluded patients with brain abscess, neurocysticercosis, and undetermined CNS infections, and 147 patients were finally included for this study. The clinical variables were analyzed between with and without acute symptomatic seizures. Results: Of 147 patients, 23.2% (34/147) had acute symptomatic seizures. Univariate analysis revealed a significant relation between clinical variables and occurrence of acute symptomatic seizure; encephalitis as etiology of CNS infection [73.5%(25/34) vs 16.8%(19/113), p < 0.0001 by X2 test], Glasgow coma scale (GCS) ≤ 12 at admission [73.5% (25/34) vs 28.3% (32/113), p < 0.0001 by X2 test], GCS ≤ 14 at discharge [44.1% (15/34) vs 18.6% (21/113), p = 0.005 by X2 test] and abnormal neurologic examination at discharge [44.1%(15/34) vs 22.1% (25/113), p = 0.02 by X2 test]. By multivariate analysis, age of onset > 42 years {OR 4.4, [95% CI (1.26?15.66)], p = 0.02}, encephalitis {OR 13.9, [95% CI (4.60?42.25)], p < 0.0001}, and GCS ≤12 at admission {OR 10.3, [95% CI (3.12?34.28)], p = 0.0001} were still significant clinical variables to predict the occurrence of acute symptomatic seizures. Conclusions: Encephalitis and GCS ≤12 at admission are the significant clinical variables to predict the occurrence of acute symptomatic seizures in CNS infection, suggesting that the more parenchymal damaged, the more vulnerable to acute symptomatic seizures occur. 1 Beth Korby, 1 Gerald L. Moriarty, 1 Deanna L. Dickens, 1 El-Hadi Mouderres, and 1 Patricia E. Penovich ( 1 Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Young women with epilepsy are eager to enjoy full productive lives including bearing children. There has long been a fear regarding the effect of the pregnancy on seizures and the effect of epilepsy and its treatment on the fetus/infant. Over the last five years numerous registries have been developed within the USA and globally to evaluate the effects of AEDs on pregnancy outcomes (North American Registry, EURAP, Australian and UK Registries). We evaluated our pregnancy outcomes before and after the approval of the new AEDs. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to women in our practice who were pregnant between 1995 and the present. Questions and information were given in written format and by telephone communication. Women who wished to participate signed consents and returned the information in pre-stamped return packets. Also included was a self-addressed, prepaid envelope to receive a complete report from the authors when the project is finished. Questions regarding all pregnancies were asked including age, folate use, AED use, seizures during pregnancy, delivery type, any birth/delivery complications, fetal loss, ultrasound results, and developmental status of the child with each pregnancy. For this study, ?old AEDs? were defined as those approved prior to 1990 and ?new AEDs? were those approved after 1990. Results: 98 questionnaires were sent out 38% have been returned thus far. 24 patients have reported information on 32 pregnancies, one with twins. 16 babies (48%) were exposed to old AEDs, 13 (39%) to new AEDs; 4 to polytherapy with old AEDs (12%). AEDs were CBZ 30%, PB 3%, PHT 3%, VPA 3%, GBP 3%, LTG 15%, LEV 12%, OXC 3%, TPM 3%. Polytherapy was PB + VPA in 2, CBZ + LTG in 1, CBZ + PB in 1. There were 29 (88%) live births. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 2 of 4 unsuccessful pregnancies: 1 tubal (CBZ + PB), 1 stillbirth (CBZ), and 2 miscarriages (CBZ, LEV)). 13 women had seizures at some time during pregnancy: 3 had a single GTC, 8 had CPS ± SPS, 2 had only SPS. There were no cases of status. There were no major congenital abnormalities. Folate was supplemented in 62% of live births at doses between 1?4 mg/day. There were 8 (28%) abnormal outcomes in the live birth group defined as delayed development for speech or motor milestones, requiring therapy and special programming. All abnormal outcomes were seen in mothers on monotherapy and occurred with folate supplementation: 5 (62%) were with old AEDs and 3 (37%) were with new AEDs: 3 with CBZ, 3 with LTG, 1 with PB, 1 with VPA. Conclusions: Women with epilepsy can have successful pregnancies without fear of major malformations. More subtle developmental delays and need for early special services and therapy for the child may be more prevalent than previously recognized with both old and new AEDs. Awareness of this potential concern may direct a choice in AED(s), as well as allow the parents to advocate for the child earlier. 1 Vitaliy Koss, 1 Peyman Andalib, 1 Sigmund Jenssen, and 1 Jyoti Pillai ( 1 Neurology, Drexel Medical College Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The elderly in United States are representing a greater percentage of the general population than before. This age group has increased risk of developing epilepsy as compared to those who are younger. Previous reports indicate that in this age group the clinical presentation of new onset epilepsy is frequently varied and obvious epileptic seizures are sometimes not reported. Epileptiform activity in the EEG (EA) is highly specific for epilepsy when acute symptomatic conditions and PLEDS are excluded. Methods: We reviewed chief complaint (CC) and EEG findings in patients minimum 65 years old with EA referred to the neurophysiology laboratory at Hahnemann University Hospital between October 2004 and April 2006 for possible new onset seizures. We compared them to control group (patients younger then 65 years). Patients with known additional acute CNS event, PLEDS, recent medication change, severe metabolic derangement or prior history of epilepsy were excluded. Results: See Table for results. Fall, electrographic diffuse slowing, organic brain syndrome and medical comorbidities was more frequent (p < 0.05) in the elderly group, while there was a trend (p < 0.10) of confusion and temporal lobe spikes to be more frequent in this group as compared to controls. Conclusions: Fall, confusion, diffuse slowing in the EEG and temporal lobe spikes are more common with onset of epilepsy in the elderly compared to younger adults. Organic brain syndrome and medical comorbidities are also more common.

We aimed to assess the frequency and significance of this clinical sign in a well-defined cohort of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with MRI findings consistent with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and concordant electroclinical data underwent facial motor examination at rest, with voluntary expression and spontaneous smiling. Hippocampal, amygdaloid and temporal pole volumetric measures were acquired in these exams. Thirty healthy subjects, matched through age and sex, were taken as controls. Results: Facial paresis was found in 46 patients. In 41 (89.13%) of them it was visualized at rest, with voluntary and emotional expression, characterizing true facial motor paresis (FP). In 33/46 (71.74%) patients, FP was contralateral to the side of MTS. There was no correlation between presence and lateralization of FP and neither hippocampal, amygdaloid nor temporal pole volumes. Simple febrile seizures as initial precipitating injury (IPI) were observed in 11 (68.75%) of patients without FP while complex febrile seizures occurred in 12 (70.59%) of patients with FP (p = 0.03). Also, presence of FP was positively associated with age of onset of secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) and their duration. Conclusions: FP is useful as a clinical sign with lateralizing value in MTLE and was significantly associated with history of complex febrile seizures as IPI and a longer duration of GTCS, indicating probably more widespread disease.

Although researchers continue to accrue data through pregnancy registries, practitioner's caring for women of childbearing age may benefit from preliminary data. This case series summarizes the clinical and developmental outcomes in five offspring of women with epilepsy, all of whom took levetiracetam monotherapy during pregnancy. Offspring ages range from 4 months to 4 years. Methods: A retrospective chart review from maternal and pediatric medical records regarding clinical outcomes in the offspring of women taking levetiracetam monotherapy was conducted. Developmental, cognitive and physical milestone data were collected. Maternal information included gestational seizure frequency, serum concentration levels and other relevant data. Results: Developmental milestones in five offspring of pregnant women with epilepsy taking levetiracetam monotherapy were reported. The women with epilepsy were seizure free during pregnancy. Maternal serum concentrations were therapeutic. All women took folic acid preconception and throughout their pregnancy. Data analysis revealed no cognitive or developmental abnormalities. Two siblings were diagnosed with cryptorchidism. No malignancies or additional physical or cognitive abnormalities were noted. No major or minor birth defects were recorded. Conclusions: This case series provides preliminary data. Due to the retrospective nature and small sample size, caution should be taken when interpreting the above outcomes. While future prospective studies with an adequate sample are mandatory, this case series may be encouraging for those seeking preliminary data on developmental outcomes in the offspring of pregnant women with epilepsy taking levetiracetam. 1,2,3 Morten I. Lossius, 4 Jan E. Erikssen, 5 Petter Mowinckel, and 6 Leif Gjerstad ( 1 Research and Education, National Centre for Epilepsy Rikshospitalet, Sandvika, Norway ; 2 Helse ?st Health Services Centre, Akershus University Hospital, Lorenskog, Norway ; 3 Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, Lorenskog, Norway ; 4 Department of Preventive Medicine, Akershus University Hospital, Lorenskog, Norway ; 5 Department of Paediatrics, Division Woman and Child, Ulleval University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ; and 6 Department of Neurology, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) may be related to impaired autonomic cardiac control. The cause of such impairment is not known: is it the specific type of epilepsy, ictal or interictal epileptiform discharges or the treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)? The aim of our study was to assess heart rate variability (HRV) by spectral analysis in patients with epilepsy before and after withdrawal of AEDs. Methods: The study was a prospective randomised and double blinded withdrawal study of seizure free patients on AED monotherapy. 24 h ambulatory ECG was performed before AED withdrawal and 4 months after withdrawal. Mean of the standard deviation of all filtered RR intervals for all 5 minute segments of the analyses (SDNN-i) and different power analysis were studied. Results: HRV at the baseline did not differ significantly between the withdrawal group (n = 57) and the non-withdrawal (n = 69). The SDNN-i in the withdrawal group improved significantly in patients < 45 years (6.2ms, p = 0.05). Apart from high frequency power the other power variables also increased after withdrawal, but not to a statistically significant extent. The heart rate variability decreased with age in both groups, but less in the withdrawal group. Interictal epileptiform activity did not significantly influence the heart rate variability. Conclusions: We found a significant increase in SDNN-i in the patients below 45 years after AED withdrawal. This indicates a potential positive effect of AED-withdrawal in this age group. This finding may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of SUDEP which occurs most frequently in the age group 20- 45 years.

Maa, and 1 Mark C. Spitz ( 1 Neurology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: Twenty million people vacation in the American Rockies and Sierras annually. The physiologic consequences of transient environmental hypoxia have been responsible for everything from poor sleep to pulmonary edema. And on occasion, a first-time seizure or worsening of well controlled epilepsy erupts in this setting. Epidemiologic data for high altitude seizures at the moderate altitudes (>8000 ft) of our American resort towns does not exist. Methods: A retrospective chart review examining the risk factors in subjects with new or worsening seizures upon arrival to the moderate altitudes of Colorado resort towns was performed. Electronic records from Summit County Emergency Department (a cachement area including Breckenridge, Arapahoe Basin, and Keystone ski resorts) were reviewed from January 2001 to October 2005 for the ICD9 diagnosis codes for seizures and epilepsy. Results: A total of 64 individual subjects suffered one or more seizures, 28 (43%) of which occurred in subjects visiting from elevations less than 8000 ft. Sixteen of the 28 (57%) subjects from lower elevations had an average POx reading of 82.6%. Twelve of the 36 (33%) subjects from Summit County averaged POx of 87.3%. Alcohol abuse was noted in 3/28 low elevation subjects and 6/36 Summit County subjects. Headaches, sleep disturbances, and tachycardia at presentation were more frequent in low elevation subjects. CT abnormalities were seen more frequently in Summit County subjects and more commonly associated with EtOH abuse. Newly found CT lesions in low elevation subjects without a history of prior seizure was not seen. CXR abnormalities were seen in 2/28 low elevation subjects and 1/36 Summit County subjects. Electrolyte disturbances, infections, and pharmaco-nonadherence did not appear to show any differences between the two groups. Conclusions: Subjects who experienced new or worsening seizures, from elevations less than 8000 ft, were more likely to show signs of hypoxia-related physiologic changes. Compared with subjects from elevations of 8000 ft or greater, these subjects demonstrated lower average oxygen saturations, increased tachycardia, and more sleep disturbances and headaches. Transient exposure to hypobaric hypoxia is suspected of altering cerebral physiology in such a way as to increase the risk of developing a seizure. Mechanisms are yet unknown, and further research, including a prospective collection of epidemiologic data is required. 1 Debra MacGarvie, 1 Nina Politzer, 1 Mary Pat MacAndrews, and 1 Martin Del Campo ( 1 Epilepsy Clinic, University Health Network, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: The purpose of this study is to determine if dietary intervention can be an effective and sustainable method of seizure reduction when used in addition to standard drug therapy. The ketogenic diet (KD)has been used in children with varying degrees of success; however, the diet has been very difficult for adults to follow due its unpalatable nature. The Atkins Diet (AD) which like the (KD), achieves a state of ketosis may be an alternative. Methods: Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were randomized into one of two treatment groups- either basic or intensive dietary counselling and initiated with a 20 gram carbohydrate diet. Menu plans and AD guidelines were provided. A control group was aged-matched to groups 1 and 2 and consisted of patients who were unable to follow the AD. Patients were assessed by dietitian, physician, psychologist and nurse. Cholesterol, triglicerides and fasting blood sugar were measured at baseline and at 6 months. Food intake records, ketosis, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) were evaluated. Various aspects of seizure quality were collected, including seizure frequency, severity and recovery time. In addition, we measured cognitive status and health-related quality oif life (QOLIE-31). Results: Seven patients in the treatment groups have completed 6 months on the AD. All patients completed food records that showed 90% compliance with diet and acceptable caloric intake. All patients who had BMI over 30 achieved a healthier BMI of under 30. Cholesterol and trigliceride levels remained in acceptable ranges. All patients achieved ketosis. More than half reported a reduction in seizure intensity as well as a shorter recovery time after a seizure. There was a moderate improvement in attention and learning efficiency, both below average at baseline and at the six month follow-up, but no change in quality of life ratings. Conclusions: The AD can achieve sustainable ketosis over time. The great majority of patients showed acceptable compliance. Fifty percent of the cohort studied showed worthwhile improvement in their seizure disorder. Although results are preliminary given the small sample completing the protocol at this point, they suggest the AD may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. 1 Fumisuke Matsuo ( 1 Neurology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Epilepsy is defined by unprovoked recurrences of epileptic seizures, but its natural history varies widely. Even within the same epilepsy syndrome, some patients will remit and can discontinue AED (antiepileptic drug) treatment, while others will prove refractory. Prompt control of seizure recurrences has been recognized as the most significant predictor of remission, but some can enjoy clinical seizure control, only when AED prophylaxis is continued. The latter group of patients is not well characterized, even though they benefit most from the epileptologist's expertise. Methods: The author's epileptology practice data were reviewed for patients with the following characteristics: 1) follow-up record spanning a period longer than 10 years, 2) the diagnosis of epilepsy has been based not only on clinical semiology, often confirmed by EEG findings, but also on sporadic clinical recurrences, when AED treatment is interrupted, and 3) interative AED trials led to a terminal prophylactic single AED regimen. Results: A total of 6530 adult patients had been screened prior to 1996 by the author, based at a University Hospital. Also generated were a total of 43101 AED treatment history entries for 916 patients, in 377of whom computer medical record was accessible for the most recent visit. The 10-year time span criterion narrowed the list down to 87. After patients with multiple developmental handicaps or unconfirmed epilepsy diagnosis, and those having undergone resection brain surgery were excluded, there remained 31 patients (31/377 = 8.2%). Their terminal AED regimens consisted of phenytoin (15 patients), carbamazepine (12), phenobarbital (3) or valproic acid (2). Conclusions: As a consultative service, the clinic has not consistently extended clinical follow-up, once a degree of seizure control was attained. The result (8.2%) is therefore assumed to underestimate the prevalence of this significant group of patients. The time span criterion, not the lack of efficacy, excluded monotherapy with a second generation AED. Also excluded was a group of patients on 2 AED with an essentially similar degree of excellent clinical control. This may explain a smaller group size of valproic acid monotherapy. This group of patients does not seem to require aggressive AED dosing nor report AED-related adverse symptoms, but represents the failure of efforts to wean off AED. They come to recognize, and fear, inevitable clinical recurrences off AED. They are typically protective of their AED regimen, and may well opt not to continue to work with the epileptologist. Sporadic seizure recurrences seem to occur often during attempts to replace AED with a second generation agent. 1 Paul H. McCabe, 1 Daniel Chehebar, and 1 Matthew Eccher ( 1 Neurology, Penn State, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA ) Rationale: With the exception of pregabalin, all of the second generation antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) have been available for over 6 years. Many reports on retention and seizure response are done on an individual basis for the different AEDs from different institutions/authors. This makes comparison of the different AEDs difficult, as variation in reporting styles, differences in use of the drugs, and differences in methods can vary significantly from one center to another. It is also unlikely that a large study doing a direct side-to-side comparison of all the newer AEDs will be performed. We present the overall results of use of the newer AEDs from the same institution by the same authors. Methods: All patients treated at Penn State, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center were included. Charts of patients treated from January 1st, 1993 ? June 30th, 2005 were reviewed from the time of the first exposure to each drug until the final visit for each patient. Patients treated less than 6 months for any of the drugs (aside from discontinuation) were excluded. The following drugs were investigated: gabapentin (GPN), lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate (TPM), oxcarbazepine (OXC), levetiracetam (LEV), and zonisamide (ZNS). Many patients were exposed to several of the newer AEDs and therefore data from each drug is expressed as patient exposures, rather than patients. Results: During the study, there were a total of 1262 patient exposures to the second generation AEDs. Breakdown is as follows: GPN-96 patients, LTG-494 patients, TPM-232 patients, OXC-146 patients, LEV-294 patients, and ZNS-133 patients. Seizure-freedom was most likely to occur with LTG, TPM, or LEV, and least likely with GPN; ranging from 5% to 32%. Response varied in part depending on seizure type and how early in the treatment regimen patients were exposed to each drug. Despite many patients not becoming seizure-free, the majority chose to remain on the newer agents. Retention rates by the end of the study varied from 27% to 84% with 27% of patients remaining on GPB, 84.4% remaining on LTG, 84.1% remaining on TPM, 61.6% remaining on OXC, 66.3% on LEV, and 84.2% on ZNS. This suggests better tolerance with the newer AEDs, although this could have been better supported had Quality of Life studies been included in our study. Conclusions: Despite studies suggesting that the chance of becoming seizure-free after failing 2 AEDs is very low (roughly 3%), our study does demonstate that several of the newer AEDs carry a much higher likelihood of patients becoming seizure-free. Despite many patients not becoming seizure-free, retention rates at our center were also higher than other reports, suggesting better tolerance to the newer AEDs. Since all patients were under the care of the same authors at the same institution, there is less variability than comparing trials from different patients groups/centers. Despite this, the authors acknowledge that bias can still exist. 1 Romila Mushtaq ( 1 Department of Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: Sexual dysfunction in women can be categorized into four major categories: sexual desire disorders, sexual arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders (either primary or secondary), and sexual pain disorders. Current evidence supports the idea that women with epilepsy have sexual dysfunction. We propose to assess the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women who have epilepsy and further analyze types of sexual disorders and relation to types of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and use of antiepileptic medications. Methods: A prospective study was initiated in the outpatient epilepsy clinic of the author. All female patients were instructed to complete a questionnaire as a part of a comprehensive evaluation of review of systems pertaining to women with epilepsy. The patients were specifically questioned regarding: 1) age of onset of epilepsy, 2) type of epilepsy 3) antiepileptic medications currently being prescribed 4) frequency of seizures, and 5) whether the patient was sexually active. All patients were also questioned regarding symptoms of: 1) decreased libido, 2) pain during intercourse, 3) difficulty becoming aroused, and 4) difficulty or inability to reach orgasm. Results: A total of 109/160 patients completed the questions pertaining to sexuality, and 62 (57%) reported being sexually active at the time of the office visit. Of those women who were sexually active, 46(74%) denied symptoms of sexual dysfunction. The other 26% of women reported difficulty or inability to reach orgasm and decreased libido as the most frequent complaints of sexual dysfunction. A total of 47(43%) women were not sexually active, and 34 (72%) of these patients denied symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Of the 28% of women with sexual dysfunction in this group, decreased libido was the most common symptom. Poorly controlled seizures was the only statistically significant factor seen in patients who were not sexually active compared to the women who were sexually active. Note: data collection is ongoing at the time of the submission of this abstract. Conclusions: Women with epilepsy may have sexual dysfunction, the etiology of which has been proposed to be due to complex factors such as disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, effects of anti-epileptic medications, effects of seizures, psychological issues, and social influences. Our study shows that whether a woman with epilepsy is sexually active or not, approximately 26?28% report symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Women with poorly controlled seizures were less likely to be sexually active. Symptoms of sexual arousal and orgasmic disorders were the most commonly reported symptoms amongst both groups of women. No statistical significance was present to correlate factors of type of epilepsy or antiepileptic medications utilized with women who reported sexual dysfunction. 1 Ruth E. Nemire, 2 Marinelli Vega, 2 Dalia Lorenzo, and 2 R. Eugene Ramsay ( 1 Pharmacy Practice, Nova Southeastern University, Ft. Lauderdale, FL ; and 2 Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL ) Rationale: Pregabalin (PGB) is approved for add on therapy for the treatment of partial onset epilepsy. Three double blind placebo controlled trials were completed in over 1052 patients. This report from one epilepsy center provides long term outcome information on patients with refractory seizures treated with PGB. Methods: Patients were entered into an open label treatment protocol to obtain information on long term safety and efficacy of PGB. Patients entered the study either after completing a double blind controlled efficacy trial or as de novo patients. During the open label trial patients were requalified to continue if they had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures. The dose of pregabalin could be titrated to a total maintenance dose of 600mg per day. Patients were allowed to continue treatment with 1?3 other medications in addition to the pregabalin. Doses of other antiepileptic medications could be adjusted during treatment. Results: Thirty six total patients were entered into an open label trial. Twenty three (64%) patients dropped for reasons of lack of efficacy, withdrew consent, or adverse events. Thirteen patients (36%) continued in the open label trial. During the trial 6 (16%) patients did not meet requalification criteria and 1 patient dropped out. Six patients were followed until the close of the study in 2005. Three males and three females completed the open label trial. Ages ranged from 28 y.o. to 62 y.o.; two patients were of Hispanic descent, three Caucasian and 1 African American. Seizures began in all patients between age 1 and age 18. Patients had been treated for epilepsy between 4 and 48 years with the majority over 40 years of treatment. Four patients were on 2 antiepileptic drugs when starting the trial 2 patients were on lamotrigine only at enrollment. Patients completing the trial were followed from four to six years total treatment. Three patients were seizure free and the others a marked reduction of seizures ranging from fifty to ninety percent per month. Two patients had an increase in seizure free months. Sixty seven percent of the patients completing the trial continued to have a further reduction in seizures from 48% to 100%. Adverse events reported were few and coincide with data reported from double blind placebo controlled trials. Two patients reported no adverse events, one reported weight gain and double vision was reported by 3 patients at some point during the course of the trial but they continued on drug. Conclusions: Patients maintained on pregablin for greater than 4 years continued to have a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, elimination of other antiepileptic drug doses were achieved during this time period, and patients had few or no adverse effects. 1 Mordekhay Medvedovsky, 1,2 Svetlana Kipervasser, 3 Batya B. Davidovici, 4 Tatiana Vander, and 1,2 Miri Y. Neufeld ( 1 EEG and Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neurology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel ; 2 Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel ; 3 Department of Dermatology, Kaplan Medical Center, Rechovot, Israel ; and 4 Rehabilitation Center, Beit Loevenstein, Raanana, Israel ) Rationale: Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is a vital diagnostic tool in the pre-operative work-up of patients suffering from intractable focal epilepsy. During VEM, anti-epileptic drug (AED) dosages are often reduced in order to induce focal seizures in patients; an unavoidable side effect can sometimes be generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The goal of this study was to answer two questions: 1) What are the risk factors for GTCS in patients with focal epilepsy during VEM? 2) At what stage in the reduction of AEDs will GTCS most likely occur? Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all adult patients (>18y) hospitalized in the VEM Unit in the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center from 2002?2005, with focal epilepsy who also had GTCS. A comparative group was created by reviewing the records of the first patient of each month who had focal epilepsy but who did not have a GTCS during VEM hospitalization. The drug reduction in both groups was done using identical protocol. Results: Fifty-one patients with GTCS were identified and compared with 48 patients in the control group. Men were more prevalent in the group with GTCS ? 34 (61%) ? than in the control group ? 22 (39%) (p = 0.037). More patients with GTCS during VEM also had a history of GTCS ? 45 (58%)/33 (42%) (p = 0.018); a history of simple partial seizures (SPS) was less prevalent in the group with GTCS ? 33 (45%)/40 (54.8%) p = 0.035). There was a clustering of GTCS on the seventh day from the start of AED reduction (8 patients). Women had GTCS earlier (5.75 days, SD 3.53) than men (8.15 days, SD 6.083) (p = 0.033). Patients with a history of febrile convulsions had GTCS later (9.35 days, SD 7.71) compared with patients with no history of febrile convulsions (6.79 days, SD 4.59) (p = 0.027). Conclusions: The risk factors for GTCS in patients with focal epilepsy during VEM were shown to be: male gender, history of GTCS and absence of history of SPS; women and patients with no history of febrile convulsions have GTCS earlier, and the risk of GTCS is highest on the seventh day from the onset of AED reduction. These results provide a helpful tool in predicting risk factors for GTCS during drug dosage reduction in VEM. 1 Young Joo No, 1 Sang-Ahm Lee, and 1 Joong Koo Kang ( 1 Neurology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: Several studies have revealed the increased incidence of atypical language dominance in patients with left hemisphere epileptic foci. We retrospectively investigated the incidence and related factors for language dominance shift, determined by intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP), in patients with hemispheric focal epilepsies. Methods: We included 222 left epileptic patients whose language dominance was determined by IAP at Asan Medical Center from 1994 to 2004. The items of language test in IAP included spontaneous speech (6 items), understanding (2 items), and repetition (2 items). Language lateralization index (LI) was computed according to the formula L = (Score IAP right ?Score IAP left)/(Score IAP right + Score IAP left). Clinical information was obtained from medical records including age, gender, age at onset of epilepsy, duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures, risk factors, onset age of risk factors, and lateralization of MRI or EEG. Results: Of the 222 patients (male 110 patients, 49.5%), complete left language dominance was 142 patients (64.0%), and complete right hemispheric language dominance was 29 patients (13.1%). Seizure onset age, onset age of risk factors, handedness and MRI lesions (hippocampal atrophy or left extensive lesion) had statistically significant association with atypical language dominance. On a linear regression analysis, the significant predictors of the atypical language dominancy were handedness and left extensive lesion (R2= .64). Conclusions: Atypical language dominancy in patients with left epileptic foci was highly correlated with non-right handedness and extensive lesion on the left hemisphere. 1 Ketil B. Olsen, 1 Erik Tauboll, and 1 Leif Gjerstad ( 1 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Intravenous VPA has been approved for treatment of benzodiazepine-resistant status epilepticus (SE) in Norway. We are now performing a prospective registration of the effect of i.v. VPA in SE and serial attacks (SA) from 6 Norwegian hospitals. Methods: Data have been obtained from the first 41 adult patients, 23 women and 18 men, treated with i.v. VPA after having been unsuccessfully treated with benzodiazepines for SE/SA. The protocol suggested a VPA loading dose of 25 mg/kg over 30 min, followed by continuous infusion of 100 mg/hour for 24 hours. Results: 29 patients were diagnosed with SE, 12 with SA. 19 had generalised tonic-clonic while 16 had complex-partial seizures as their main SE/SA seizure type. 6 had mixed or other type of seizures. Median VPA bolus dose was 1800 mg (range 700?2500). Median time to treatment of SE/SA for all patients was 3 h (range 0.3?72 h). For patients with complex partial SE/SA, median time to start of VPA was 4 h (range 0?72 h). Effect, defined as the lack of need of anaesthesia (barbiturates or propofol), showed that VPA was effective in 31 of 41 cases (76%). Of the 10 cases requiring anaesthesia, 5 had a significant delay before starting treatment (20 to 72 hours). Moderate hypotension during bolus dose infusion was seen in one patient, but corrected easily with i.v. saline without complications. Otherwise, no side-effects were reported. Conclusions: VPA is safe and effective in the treatment of benzodiazepine-resistant SE/SA. SE/SA was stopped in 31 of 41 cases (76%). Lack of effect may be related to delayed treatment and too low loading dose. 1 Alison M. Pack, 2 Anne R. Davis, 2 Jordana Kritzer, 1 Ava Yoon, 2 Adele Camus, and 1 Silvia Done ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Pre-pregnancy planning is important for women with epilepsy to optimize fetal outcome. In addition, women with epilepsy experience higher pregnancy-related risks than their healthy peers. Published guidelines recommend highly effective contraception; however, no published data describes contraceptive practices in this population. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study among a convenience sample of reproductive-age women (18 to 44) with epilepsy attending outpatient clinics at an urban, academic medical center. Questionnaires were administered at 3 clinics. Two included patients in a private office with predominantly commercial insurance and 1 was a multi-provider clinic of mostly Medicaid insurance. Our questionnaire assessed demographics, reproductive history, antiepileptic drug use, sexual behavior, and contraceptive use. The questionnaire was offered in both English and Spanish and conducted in a private area. Results: We approached 425 women to obtain 148 (35%) completed questionnaires; many were excluded due to age (n = 198). Participants had a mean age of 32 years (SD ± 8), 32% spoke Spanish and 32% described themselves as Hispanic. Insurance included commercial (55%), Medicaid/Medicare (41%), and self-pay (6%). Participants reported a wide range of educational attainment and income. Fifty-five percent (n = 78) reported having vaginal intercourse in the last 30 days. Of these sexually active women, 59 (76%) used contraception, 11 (14%) were pregnant, and 2 (3%) sought pregnancy. Contraceptive methods included male condoms (n = 21, 36%), withdrawal (n = 18, 31%), oral contraception (n = 16, 27%), male or female sterilization (n = 10, 17%), patch (n = 3, 5%), rhythm (n = 3, 5%), intrauterine device (n = 1, 2%), depo-provera (n = 1, 2%), and other (n = 11, 19%). Some women used multiple methods. Of those using hormonal methods (oral contraception, patch, depo-provera) (n = 21), 6 (29%) concomitantly took an enzyme inducing antiepileptic drug with known increasing susceptibility to pregnancy. Women reported 181 pregnancies and 91 (50%) were unplanned. Conclusions: In this sample, many women with epilepsy at risk for getting pregnant rely on low-efficacy contraceptive methods. Similar to the general population, 50% of their pregnancies were unplanned. These findings illustrate the need for continued education of women with epilepsy regarding effective contraception. 1 Erin Phillip, 1 Shahram Shahrokshi, and 1 Neelan Pillay ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Psychosis in epilepsy is more commonly postictal and less often ictal or related to treatment. However de novo psychosis upon administration of antiepileptic medications is not uncommon. De novo psychosis on rapid withdrawal of antiepileptic medications in patients with epilepsy in the seizure monitoring unit (SMU) has not been reported. The purpose of this article is to investigate a possible link between withdrawal of carbamazepine and the onset of psychotic symptoms. Methods: We describe the clinical course of two patients in whom rapid or abrupt withdrawal of carbamazepine was followed by new onset of psychotic symptoms. We analysed patient specific factors such as history, age, gender, date/time since last seizure and length of use of carbamazepine as well as the rate of withdrawal and related these to the onset of symptoms. The symptoms displayed included aggression, disorientation, delusions/hallucinations and violent behaviour. Neither patient had a previous psychiatric history. One patient has frontal lobe epilepsy with nocturnal complex partial seizures. This patient was admitted to the SMU unit for further localization of seizure foci using invasive subdural and depth electrode monitoring. During the admission carbamazepine was withdrawn rapidly over 4 days from 1200 mg/day to zero. The second patient has temporal lobe epilepsy with complex partial seizures and has had previous left temporal lobectomy. This patient abruptly stopped taking carbamazepine on her own and was admitted to the SMU immediately following onset of psychosis. There were also 2 previous admissions for psychosis on abrupt withdrawal of carbamazepine. Results: Carbamazepine was withdrawn rapidly in 1 patient and abruptly in the 2nd patient. Both patients became aggressive, disoriented and delusional and did not return to baseline behaviour for several days. At onset of psychosis neither of the patients was on any other anti epileptic medications. No clinical or subclinical seizures were recorded before, during or after the psychosis on video EEG telemetry. MRI scans were normal. Conclusions: We believe that these cases indicate a possible link between withdrawal of carbamazepine and new onset of psychotic symptoms. Carbamazepine withdrawal followed by de novo psychosis in epilepsy patients has not been reported. These cases indicate a need for extra caution when withdrawing carbamazepine rapidly in the seizure monitoring unit or for other reasons. 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 Jose Zenteno-Tellez, 1 Sam Wiebe, and 1 Paolo Federico ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: General neurologists, and epileptologists, need to interpret and apply driving guidelines for patients with seizures and epilepsy. Physicians are expected to know and follow provincial regulations, which have variable reporting requirements. Our purpose was to determine clinicians' familiarity with driver guideline restrictions, and the differences in application of restrictions between epileptologists and general neurologists. Methods: A modified motor vehicle driving questionnaire based on the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Guidelines was mailed out to 33 neurologists in Calgary, Canada. The conditions listed were syncope with no obvious neurological or cardiac cause; aura or simple partial seizure unchanged for more than one year; unprovoked first seizure; epilepsy on treatment and seizure free; seizure during sleep or awakening with normal EEG; simple partial seizures (aura); seizure recurrence on medication withdrawal or change under medical direction; alcohol withdrawal seizures. The questionnaire asked to recommend duration of driving restrictions for various license classes (class 5 = private car or small truck and 1?4 = professional). Auras and simple partial seizures were categorized separately but defined as non disabling sensory or motor seizures. Results are expressed as median and range. Groups are compared with the rank-sum test. Results: 76% (25/33) of the questionnaires were returned. The responses were analyzed for the entire group and for epileptologist separately. For syncope, the entire group's responses were concordant with the CMA guidelines, but epileptologists recommended driving earlier (within 1 month) if the examination and investigations were normal. Neurologists and epileptologists agreed with CMA guidelines in patients with a solitary seizure and in those with only auras. However, both groups would restrict driving for 12 months, as opposed to the recommended 6 month. There is consensus for AED withdrawal seizures, alcohol related seizures. Interestingly, both groups would not restrict driving for an aura but would restrict driving for 12 months for ?simple partial seizures?. More disagreement between neurologists and epileptologists occurred in restriction for commercial licenses, but these were not statistically significant. Conclusions: In an unprovoked first seizure general neurologists and epileptologists agree with guidelines' restrictions, but in cases of syncope, epileptologists are less restrictive. Neurologists and epileptologists interpreted an aura to be different from a simple partial seizure. In general, neurologists and epileptologists are more restrictive for epilepsy than the recommended CMA guidelines. Differences between neurologists and epileptologists were not significant. 1 Annkathrin Poepel, 1 Christian Hoppe, 1 Déirdre Cooper-Mahkorn, and 1 Christian E. Elger ( 1 Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; and Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ) Rationale: To compare patients' seizure documentation with seizure diaries and seizure count documented by in-patient video-EEG-monitoring. In addition, the benefit of daily reminding patients to carefully document all seizures was assessed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Prospective investigation of all in-patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy who received video-EEG-monitoring for at least 24 hours (Oct 2004 ? Jul 2005). In a RCT patients received a conventional seizure diary without (group A) or including daily personal reminding (B). Based on video documented semiology and EEG data all monitored seizures were classified as simple-partial seizures (SPS, including auras), complex-partial seizures (CPS) and generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS). Pre-ictal EEG-periods were classified regarding the patient's state of vigilance. Results: We recorded a total of 613 classifiable seizures (190 SPS, 371 CPS, 52 GTCS) in 95 patients (mean age 39.3 years, 43 female). Seizure documentation quality of patients was different depending on seizure type and pre-ictal state of vigilance. Particularly, CPS (72%) and seizures beginning in sleep (86%) were at risk not to be documented by the patient. 59 patients (62%) had an incomplete seizure documentation including 41 patients (43%) who documented no seizure. Incompletely documenting patients had significantly less SPS but significantly more CPS during video-EEG-monitoring as compared to completely documenting patients (Mann-Whitney, p < .01). Furthermore they had more seizures beginning in sleep, higher risk for ammonshorn sclerosis, lower educational level and lower verbal learning performance. Regarding RCT group B (with reminding) yielded a higher rate of documented seizures as compared to group A but this difference was not significant. Conclusions: In this sample of in-patients with chronic epilepsies, a high rate of patients with incomplete documentation (62%) as well as a high rate of undocumented seizures (55%) could be revealed during video-EEG-monitoring. Regarding seizure types, CPS were the most common subtype in our study (61%). These, however, were documented most unreliably (72% missing in patients' documentation). Seizures occurring from sleep were less reliably documented than seizures occurring from a waking state (86% versus 31% missing in patients documentation). Seizure frequency, particularly frequency of CPS and frequency of seizures in sleep, ammonshorn sclerosis, low educational level and low verbal learning performance were negative prognostic factors for correct seizure documentation. Although conditions in this investigation are not entirely comparable with out-patient condition at home, evaluations of the status and course of epilepsy in individual patients and clinical studies should consider that seizure diaries provide highly subjective data. 1 Nina Politzer, and 1 Peter L. Carlen ( 1 Epilepsy Program, University Health Network,Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: In our tertiary care epilepsy clinic we have many pharmacologically intractable patients that are not surgical candidates, who have failed most antiepilepsy drugs. Magnesium is known to block seizures in eclampsia. It is anticonvulsant in several in vitro models, and its mechanisms of action include decreasing neuronal excitability by decreasing membrane surface charge and blocking NMDA receptors. Therefore we decided to administer magnesium supplements to these intractable patients. Methods: This observational study was designed as a preliminary unblinded test of the hypothesis that magnesium supplementation would decrease the frequency of intractable seizures. Patients were selected on the basis of having pharmacologically intractable seizures. Patients were followed as per their routinely booked clinic visits. They were asked to purchase over the counter magnesium supplements, with preference given to magnesium oxide, 420 mg. Results: To date we have followed 20 patients taking magnesium supplements ranging from 250 mg od to 420 mg qid per day. No side effects have been noted to date from the magnesium administration. Five of the 20 patients reported greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 2 reported virtually no seizures without stressors or forgetting their medications. No patients reported worsening of seizures and some reported a calming effect, but no obvious seizure reduction. Conclusions: This safe and cheap additional pharmacotherapy deserves a serious double blinded trial in intractable epilepsy. There are many questions to be considered including the mechanism(s) of action, alterations in serum (and brain) magnesium, the best formulation (as a salt, as a chelate), the proper dosing, possible side effects, and the patient characteristics of responders and nonresponders. 1 Gulseren Aktas, 2 Kader Karli Oguz, 3 Nese Dericioglu, and 1 Serap Saygi ( 1 Neurology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Ankara, Turkey ; 2 Radiology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Ankara, Turkey ; and 3 Institute of Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Ankara, Turkey ) Rationale: Recently, abnormalities of the shape and positioning of the hippocampal formation have been recognized increasingly on MRI. The significance of this finding is not well known since it can be detected in patients investigated for various reasons. Few data exists in the literature regarding the presence of this abnormality in patients with seizures. We aimed to investigate the clinical and EEG findings in patients with seizures whose cranial MRI revealed the presence of hippocampal shape abnormalities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings of patients who were investigated at our epilepsy clinic for seizures between 1995?2006 and had cranial MRI that clearly demonstrated abnormalities of the shape of the hippocampus. Patients with any accompanying lesions (malformation of cortical development, tumor, encephalomalacia, etc) were excluded. Results: Twenty one patients [11M, 10F; age: 17?69 years (mean 33)] were included in the study. Seizure onset varied between 1?58 years (mean 21.5) and occurred in adulthood in 15 (71%) patients. Seizure characteristics were as follows: simple partial (n = 9), complex partial (n = 17) and secondary generalized tonic-clonic (n = 10). Twelve (57.1%) patients were seizure free on monotherapy with anticonvulsants. Eight (38.1%) patients reported risk factors for seizures (febrile convulsion, head trauma, perinatal injury, family history of epilepsy). Cranial MRI was initially reported as normal in 11 (52.4%) patients. Abnormal shape of the hippocampus was evident on the left side in 16 (76.1%), right side in 3 (14.3%) and bilaterally in 2 patients (9.5%). Eight (38.1%) patients had normal or non-specific EEG recordings. Pathological EEG findings were concordant with MRI results in 9 (42.8%) patients. Conclusions: Although uncommon when compared to hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal shape abnormalities may be associated with epilepsy. Seizure onset is usually late in this group and more than half of the patients are seizure free on single anticonvulsant. EEG may fail to demonstrate pathological findings in a considerable number of patients. The occurrence of this abnormality mostly on the left side may somehow be related to development of the dominant hemisphere and deserves further attention. Radiologists should be aware of hippocampal shape abnormalities since half of the cases may be overlooked on MRI. 1 Johnny Salameh, and 1 Sanjay P. Singh ( 1 The Nebraska Epilepsy Center, Deptartment of Neurological Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE ) Rationale: Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS) is the most common cause of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. It is also the one most often treated surgically, because medical treatment fails in upto75% of cases, and surgical treatment is successful in about 58%1. This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of Levetiracetam in the treatment of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in patients with Mesial Temporal Sclerosis. Methods: This is a retrospective study looking at our database of over 1000 epilepsy patients. The patients were classified as having Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Mesial Temporal Sclerosis based on the following criteria: A. Video-EEG confirmation of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy by ictal and interictal recordings and no other contradictory data and MRI showing mesial temporal sclerosis. Or B. Electroencephalogram showing epileptiform discharges consistent with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, clinical features consistent with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and MRI showing mesial temporal sclerosis. No contradictory data. Thirty patients fulfilled the above criteria and were started on Levetiracetam. The patients were followed for an average of 20 months from the time of starting Levetiracetam. No other antiepileptic drug changes were made during this period in these patients. One patient could not afford the medication after being started on Levetiracetam and three patients had no follow up after Levetiracetam was started. Therefore, the total number of patients were 26. The outcome was classified as: Class 1: Seizure free Class 2: > 50% reduction in seizure frequency Class 3: < 50% reduction in seizure frequency Patients in Class 1 and 2 were designated as responders. Results: Twenty-one of the 26 patients (80.7%) with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and MTS had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures. Ten of the 26 (38.4%) patients became seizure free. The average number of antiepileptic drugs these patients had failed is 3.13 before starting Levetiracetam. Outcome: Class 1: 10 patients (38.5%) Class 2: 11 patients (42.3%) Class 3: 5 patients (19.2%) 38.5% of patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and MTS, who had failed an average of more than 3 antiepileptic medications, became seizure free on treatment with Levetiracetam. The responder rate was 80.7%. The responder rate for Levetiracetam in all partial seizure is 39.8% to 44%2. Conclusions: This study clearly demonstrates a unique efficacy profile of Levetiracetam in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with MTS. Large randomized controlled studies are needed to study this important efficacy profile. References 1.?Spencer SS. When should temporal-lobe epilepsy be treated surgically?

Methods: In this prospective, open label, multicenter phase IV flexible dose study, elderly patients [ < 65, 65 ? 74 and ≥75 years (yrs)] with epilepsy irrespective of seizure type were included and followed for 12 months. Seizure frequency and adverse events were documented at each visit. Results: 107 patients (53% male, mean age 69 ± 7 years) were enrolled, 32 patients < 65yrs, 54 patients between 65yrs ? 74yrs and 21 patients > 74 yrs. 102 patients had at least one seizure during the retrospective baseline encompassing a 3 months period. Mean duration of epilepsy was 9.5 yrs. Most frequent seizure types at baseline were generalized tonic-clonic (58%) and complex partial (25%). Mean seizure frequency was 3.5 ± 14.6 and decreased to 1.6 ± 7.7 (p < 0.0001) versus baseline. At endpoint, the mean TPM dose was 98 mg/day in monotherapy and 153 mg/day in add-on. Mean dose was lowest (86 mg/day) and the percentage of monotherapy was highest in the oldest group. Overall, 78% of patients were responders (seizure reduction ≥50%) and 44% remained seizure-free throughout the study. The highest percentage of responders was in the youngest group (96%). 46 patients (43%) had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The number of TEAEs was highest amongst the oldest group. TEAEs ≥ 5% overall were somnolence (9.4%), dizziness (7.5%), paraesthesia (5.6%), and cognitive complaints (10.3%). Main reasons for study discontinuation (40% overall) were a TEAE (15.9%) or loss to follow-up (12.2%). Conclusions: In elderly patients with epilepsy, TPM was well tolerated among all age groups andwas associated with a significant decrease in seizure frequency. Doses used were slightly lower than the recommended target doses for adults. 1,2 Alex M. Taylor, 1 Deborah A. Cahn-Weiner, 1 David Filippi, and 1 Paul A. Garcia ( 1 Neurology, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ; and 2 CSPP, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Measures of personality functioning are frequently included in the evaluation of patients suspected of having nonepileptic seizure (NES) disorder. Previous research has indicated that the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) provides moderate discrimination between patients with NES and those with epileptic seizures (ES)1. In addition to personality assessment, evaluation of mood functioning using the Profile of Mood States ? Depression scale (POMS-D) may serve to classify patients with seizure disorders who endorse depressive symptoms2. The purpose of this study was to compare the discriminative properties of these measures in classifying patients with NES and ES. Methods: Patients were recruited upon admission to the video-EEG (v-EEG) monitoring unit, and completed the POMS and PAI prior to receiving their diagnosis. Twenty-eight patients (20 female, 8 male) with definitive diagnoses were included in the analysis. NES and ES patients were matched on age and education. v-EEG monitoring resulted in 20 diagnoses of ES and 8 diagnoses of NES. Results: There was a borderline significant difference between groups on the POMS-D (p = .08), with the NES group endorsing more depression symptoms. On the PAI, the NES and ES groups differed significantly on the Somatic Complaints-Conversion (SOM-C) subscale, Antisocial Features-Antisocial Behaviors subscale, and Aggression-Verbal Aggression subscale (all p's < .05). The only clinically elevated scale was in the NES group on SOM-C (Mean T-score 72.7). In a discriminant function analysis (DFA) correcting for group size probabilities with v-EEG confirmed diagnosis as the dependent variable, the three PAI subscales provided an overall classification accuracy of 71.4%. In a separate DFA, the POMS-D provided an overall classification accuracy of 75%. When entered jointly, the PAI subscales and POMS provided an overall classification accuracy of 82.1% Conclusions: Theories addressing the underlying etiology of NES have included both personality and mood factors. Psychological measures such as the PAI and POMS are routinely used in the work-up of both NES and ES patients when psychiatric features are suspected. These results suggest that used jointly, these measures can provide fairly accurate discrimination between these patient groups and may serve as useful screening instruments. 1 Wagner et al.

Tellez-Zenteno, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Quality of life is lower in people with epilepsy than in the general population. Its association with seizures, adverse drug effects and mood disorders has been documented. Despite a high level of somatic comorbidity in epilepsy, its contribution to Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) has not been studied. The objective of this study is to asses the impact of comorbid chronic conditions (eg., heart diseases, diabetes, arthritis and migraine) on HRQOL in people with epilepsy in the general population. Methods: Data were collected as part of the 19996?1997 Canadian Community Health Survey. HRQOL was assessed using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3). The HUI3 maps any one of the vectors of eight health attribute levels into a summary health value ranging between ?0.36 and 1.0. The most preferred health level (perfect health) is rated as 1.0 and death is rated 0.0, while negative scores reflect health states considered worse than death. Respondents (n = 129921) were classified based on the presence or absence of epilepsy, diabetes, migraine, arthritis, and possible combinations. Results: The overall HUI-3 score for the general population (n = 129921) was 0.86, and it was significantly higher than that of the studied chronic conditions (p < 0.05). The mean HUI-3 score was 0.70 (CI95 0.67?0.73) in persons with epilepsy (n = 803), 0.74 (CI95 0.73?0.75) in diabetes (n = 6180), 0.79 (CI95 0.78?0.80) in migraine (n = 11915), 0.72 (CI95 0.71?0.73) in arthritis (n = 23908) and 0.71 (CI95 0.70?0.72) in heart disease (n = 7725). The HUI-3 score was 0.45 (CI95 0.31?0.59) in persons with epilepsy and diabetes (n = 46), 0.59 (CI95 0.49?0.69) in epilepsy and heart disease (n = 87), 0.60 (CI95 0.52?0.68) in epilepsy and migraine (n = 146), and 0.56 (CI95 0.49?0.63) in epilepsy and arthritis (n = 199). All were significantly lower than in the overall epilepsy population. Conclusions: In addition to the effect of epilepsy on quality of life, the presence of common, chronic somatic comorbid conditions has a major impact on the quality of life of persons with epilepsy. This is important when reporting HRQOL of patients with epilepsy, and when assessing the impact of epilepsy therapies on HRQOL. 1 Annamaria M. Terracciano, 2 Gennaro Barbato, 2 Pasquale Alfieri, 2 Rossana Arlomede, 1 Loredana Nargi, and 2 Giacomo Visco ( 1 Neurologic Rehabilitation, Clinica ?S.Maria del Pozzo?, Somma Vesuviana, Napoli, Italy ; and 2 Neurology, ASL NA 1, Naples, Naples, Italy ) Rationale: To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of LEV in elderly patients with newly diagnosed seizures and neuroradiologic findings of Chronic Cerebrovascular Disease (previously asymptomatic). Methods: -? elderly patients with onset Epilepsy at onset (Partial seizures). -? LEV as Monotherapy. -? Lev commenced at 250 mg/die,titrated weekly by 250 mg to the final dose. -? 12 months follow-up: visit every two montlhs, seizure diary check,EEG, complete blood sampling,Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE), Short Form Health Survey (SF12)and caregiver Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaires. Outcome assessments. -? Change in seizure frequency. -? Quality of life (by MMSE,SF12 e NPI). -? Tolerability by evaluating LEV-related AEs. Results: 33 patients were included and all of them completed the 12 months study and achieved seizure freedom. 27(81.8%) with LEV dose 1000?1500mg daily. 6 (18.1%) needed add-on therapy with other AED: Topiramate, Lamotrigine, Oxcarbazepine. LEV showed no interactions with any concomitant drug used for other patologies(Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension,Mood Depression,etc) MMSE, SF12 and NPI score did not worsen. 31 patients showed AEs during the titration phase: somnolence(n = 5), headache(n = 23), dizziness(n = 2),mental confusion(n = 1). Conclusions: LEV showed god efficacy and tolerability in treatment of Epilepsy in elderly patients with Chronic Cerebrovascular Disease. 1 Farrah M. Thomas, 2 Noah Webster, 1 Peggy Crawford, and 1 Nancy Foldvary ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Sociology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy experience varying types of sleep difficulties including increased latency to sleep onset, increased number and duration of awakenings, decreased sleep efficiency, and sleep apnea that contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), known to negatively affect quality of life. EDS is commonly attributed to the effects of seizures and/or anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). It is possible that individuals attempt to compensate for EDS by using caffeine, a mild stimulant and the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors associated with caffeine consumption in individuals with epilepsy. Methods: Participants are two hundred and twenty-five adults (44% male, 88% Caucasian, 44% married) aged 18?75 with medically intractable epilepsy referred for surgery evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic. They participated in a health psychology evaluation that included chart review for demographic, disease, and health-related information; clinical interview concerning current and past psychological status; and self-report measures of mood, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness. Results: Daily caffeine consumption ranges from 0 to 320 oz, with 20% consuming no caffeine, 38% 24 oz or more, and 3% 100 oz or more. Fifteen percent of participants are on one AED, 64% two AEDs, 18% three, and 2% four or more. Sleep ranges from 2 to 11hrs, with an average of 7hrs/night. On a subset of 49 patients, mean scores on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are 4 and 8, respectively. Quantity of caffeine consumption is not associated with gender, the number of AEDs, hours of sleep/night, fatigue level, or daytime sleepiness. Greater caffeine consumption is associated with regular use of nicotine and alcohol but not with illicit drug use (current or past) or exercise. Lastly, individuals who are currently employed full/part-time (42%) are more likely to consume larger quantities of caffeine. Conclusions: These results suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine is common among individuals with medically intractable epilepsy, particularly those who use other substances or are employed. Surprisingly, caffeine use is not associated with the number of AEDs, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, or the number of hours of sleep/night suggesting large quantities of caffeine are consumed for reasons other than fatigue or daytime sleepiness. For example, there is a strong behavioral association among caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol use. Individuals may also use large quantities of caffeine in an attempt to counteract perceived mental fatigue. In future studies, it may be helpful to ask patients why they consume caffeine. Subsequent analyses will examine the association between specific AEDs and caffeine use. We will continue to examine the association between fatigue, daytime sleepiness, sleep characteristics (i.e., sleep onset and disruptions), and caffeine as additional data becomes available. 1 Paolo Tinuper, 1 Francesca Bisulli, 1 Luca Vignatelli, 1 Francesca Pittau, 1 Sara Musho-Ilbeh, 1 Federica Provini, 1 Ilaria Naldi, and 1 Pasquale Montagna ( 1 Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy ) Rationale: Video EEG-polysomnography is the reference standard in the differential diagnosis between nocturnal frontal lobe seizures (NFLS) and non-epileptic paroxysmal sleep disorders. Nevertheless it is expensive and useful only in case of frequent attacks. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of clinical history, that could be useful in patients with rare events, is unknown. The aim of this study is to measure the diagnostic accuracy of clinical history in distinguishing NFLS from non-epileptic paroxysmal sleep disorders. Methods: Three categories of subjects were eligible for this study: 1) patients with NFLS; 2) patients with parasomnias; 3) patients with other sleep disorders confounding for NFLS. Clinical, neuroradiological and interictal and ictal video-polysomnographic recordings from the database of the Sleep Center of the Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Bologna, were retrospectively reviewed. Eligible subjects were classified as having ?NFLS? or ?NOT-NFLS? by sleep medicine and epilepsy experts. Moreover, 5 major and 13 minor anamnestic criteria were selected to be tested in the diagnosis of NFLS. On the basis of these criteria a questionnaire was devised and administered by telephone to 103 patients by a young newly qualified doctor blinded to the aim of the study and the final diagnosis of patients. The diagnostic parameters (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio ? DOR) were calculated for each criterion. Results: Forty-four subjects had documented NFLS; 59 subjects were classified as ?NOT-NFLS?. Generally, sensitivity appeared to be moderate (range 0.2?0.6) and specificity was high (0.9?1) for most of the possible criteria associations. The higher diagnostic accuracy, measured by the DOR, was obtained combining the first criterion (defining the semeiology of the epileptic event) with one of the following features (in decreasing order): 1. presence of vocalization (DOR 76.5), 2. less than 2 minutes' duration (42.8), 3. aura preceding motor behaviour (38.9), 4. positive personal history of tonic-clonic seizures during sleep (25.5), 5. stereotypy of motor phenomena (20.9); 6. recurrence of seizures every night for at least one month (20.4). Conclusions: From this preliminary study we selected one major and six minor clinical criteria for the anamnestic diagnosis of NFLS. The diagnostic accuracy of these criteria appeared to have moderate sensitivity and high specificity. A further prospective validation is needed. 1 Michelle Tisch, 1 Linda Allen, and 1 Romila Mushtaq ( 1 Department of Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: Menarche on average occurs 2.5 years after the onset of puberty in healthy female adolescents. The normal age range for menarche is reported from 11 to 16.5 years with an average of 13.0 to 13.5 years at onset. Catamenial epilepsy has been described as increase in seizure frequency before or during the first few days of the menstruation and/or seizures at the time of ovulation. We proposed to analyze the age of menarche in female patients diagnosed with epilepsy to assess if epilepsy may influence the age of menarche. In addition we further assessed age of menarche in those patients with catamenial epilepsy and compared the age of menarche to those patients who did not have catamenial epilepsy. Methods: A prospective study was initiated in the outpatient epilepsy clinic of senior author. All female patients were instructed to complete a questionnaire as a part of a comprehensive evaluation of review of systems for issues pertaining to women with epilepsy. The patients were specifically questioned regarding: 1)age of onset of epilepsy, 2) age of menarche, 3) if seizures occurred in the 7 days prior to the menstruation, 4)if seizures occurred during the first 3?4 days of menstruation, and 5) if seizures occurred mid-cycle. The findings were confirmed by the physician during the interview. Results: A total of 83 patients were identified with an average age of menarche of 12.68 years. Of the 83 patients, 29 (35%) had catamenial epilepsy with average age of menarche of 12.53 years. 54 patients (65%) did not have catamenial epilepsy with average of menarche of 12.78 years. There was no statistical significance in the difference of age of menarche in the two groups. Age of onset of epilepsy in patients with catamenial epilepsy was 17.37 years compared to 27.8 years in patients without catamenial epilepsy. Of the 29 patients with catamenial epilepsy, only 9 (31%) experienced onset of epilepsy prior to or during the year of menarche. Note: Data collection is ongoing at the time of the submission of this abstract and the total number of patients included in the data analysis is expected to be approximately 150. Conclusions: In our study, females with epilepsy experience an earlier age of menarche compared to reported average age of menarche in healthy female adolescents. This may be due to multiple factors influencing the neuroendocrine axis such as seizures and anti-epileptic medications. There is, however, no difference in age of menarche in women with catamenial epilepsy compared to those women who do not have catamenial epilepsy. Patients with catamenial epilepsy had younger age of onset of epilepsy as compared to those women who did not have catamenial epilepsy. There was no relationship of epilepsy onset prior to and during the year of menarche as a factor associated with the development of catamential epilepsy. 1 Heber L. Varela, 1 Denise S. Taylor, and 1 Selim R. Benbadis ( 1 Neurology  and 2 Biostatistics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciencs, Little Rock, AR ) Rationale: Sensory simple partial seizures (SSPS) were extensively studied as auras preceding complex partial (CPS) and secondarily generalized seizures (GS). However, they have not been well characterized in epilepsy patients presenting with these seizures as the predominant or only type. The objective of this study is to describe our experience with this particular group of patients. Methods: The adult epilepsy database was searched for patients diagnosed with SSPS, excluding the ones with current CPS or GS. The epileptic nature of the spells had to be supported by EEG and/or the presence of a compatible epileptogenic lesion on brain MRI. We examined whether these patients had other seizure types (CPS or GS) in the past and determined the distribution of epileptic foci between the two cerebral hemispheres. In those patients who had never experienced CPS or GS, we determined the interval between onset of symptoms and their correct characterization as epileptic. Results: Twenty one patients, nine men and 12 women, were selected. Their age ranged from 25 to 79 years. Three (14%) were included just based on the presence of clear ictal and/or interictal epileptiform discharges on EEG, nine (43%) had appropriate epileptogenic lesions on brain MRI, and the remaining nine (43%) had combined EEG and MRI abnormalities. Twelve subjects (57%) had never experienced other seizure types, while nine (43%) reported rare GS/CPS in the past. The epileptogenic focus lateralized to the right cerebral hemisphere in 15 patients (71%) and to the left in six (29%), p = 0.08. In the subjects with no history of GS or CPS, the delay to the correct diagnosis ranged from three weeks to five years (mean = 16 months), with seven of the 12 patients waiting for more than one year to be adequately diagnosed and treated. Conclusions: Practitioners should be aware of the potential for SSPS to occur as the exclusive or main seizure type in some epilepsy patients. The appropriate work up, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed in such circumstances. In addition, we noted a trend suggesting that right hemispheric foci are overrepresented in this particular population. 1 Noah Webster, 2 Peggy Crawford, and 2 Farrah M. Thomas ( 1 Sociology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy generally are discouraged from driving due to the risk of experiencing a seizure, losing control, and causing harm to themselves and/or others. Driving regulations for epilepsy patients vary across the U.S.; some states requiring physicians to report patients to motor vehicle bureaus and/or requiring patients to be seizure-free for varying periods of time, while others have no regulations at all. Few studies examine why patients with epilepsy disregard medical advice and continue to drive. The purpose of this study is to examine demographic, disease, and health-related correlates of driving status among medically intractable epilepsy patients. Methods: Participants are two hundred and twenty-five adults (44% male, 88% Caucasian, 44% married, 42% employed full or part-time) aged 18?75 with medically intractable epilepsy referred for surgery evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic. They participated in a health psychology evaluation that included a chart review for demographic, disease, and health-related information. Results: Nineteen percent of the patients continue to drive against medical advice. Current driving status is not associated with age, gender, marital or employment status, duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, or the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. However, patients on disability are less likely to be currently driving. Descriptive data on a subset of 49 patients indicate 11 of the 12 patients currently driving have never been in an epilepsy-related motor vehicle accident (MVA), while 13 of the 37 not currently driving have been in at least 1. Only 2 of the 12 (17%) currently driving report limited social support, and 11 of the 37 (30%) not driving report limited support. Conclusions: A fair number of patients with medically intractable epilepsy continue to drive against medical advice, but those in an epilepsy-related MVA are less likely to be currently driving. Do these patients drive out of necessity (i.e. limited social support or employment) or because they are generally nonadherent? Results suggest the answer is not that straightforward. While employment status is not associated, patients on disability are less likely to be driving, possibly due to the severity of seizures. What would increase epilepsy patients' adherence to the recommendation against driving? Anecdotally, our patients report community neurologists are less restrictive about driving than neurologists affiliated with epilepsy centers. This suggests more consistent guidelines and follow-up are needed. Ideally an epilepsy-related MVA should not be needed for adherence. Subsequent analyses will examine how personality factors (i.e. anti-social or risk taking characteristics) are related to driving status, and when data are available we will re-examine how driving status relates to epilepsy-related MVAs and social support. 1 David Wheeler, 1 John O. Elliott, 2 Mercedes P. Jacobson, and 2 Jose Cabassa ( 1 Public Health, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; and 2 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: In 1997 the Centers for Disease Control defined epilepsy as a public health issue and specific goals related to access, quality of care, surveillance and public education were developed. These continue to be issues where progress has been slow. A 2005 health disparities report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality revealed that significant gaps still exist in non-Caucasians for many chronic health conditions. The US government report Healthy People 2010 recommended that 90% of all major National, State and local health systems promote nationwide use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map health related data. The process of geocoding (assigning map coordinates) allows researchers to examine where people reside in relation to distribution of health, socioeconomic conditions and proximity to environmental hazards. This is the first use of GIS technology to map epilepsy related health data. Methods: Three years (2002?2004) of inpatient/outpatient data were obtained from the 5 hospitals within the Temple University Health System (TUHS). The catchment is primarily North and Northeast Philadelphia ? an area of significant ethnic diversity and varying socio-economic status. The dataset included 24,406 contacts with the TUHS. Data included demographics, address, up to 5 ICD-9 codes and insurance type. Results: Fifty-four percent of patient contacts were males (mean age = 47.4) and 46% were female (mean age = 48.9). Thirty-two percent were Caucasian, 47% African American, 20% Unknown and < 1% were Asian/PI/Other. Seventeen percent were listed as Spanish speaking. The catchment area for TUHS reveals highly segregated communities based on the 2000 US Census data. Six zip codes had between 55?84% Caucasians, 6 zip codes had 44?97% African Americans, and 4 had > 33% Latino residents. There were 665 patient contacts within the ICD-9 codes 345 to 345.81 and 817 with a diagnosis of 345.9. There 22,207 patient contacts (91%) coded for seizure NOS code (780.39). The most frequent co-morbidities were hypertension (n = 2322), diabetes (n = 1158), heart failure (n = 794), other urinary problems (n = 774), non-compliance with medical treatment (n = 707), COPD (n = 545), volume depletion (n = 522), asthma (n = 494) and depression NOS (n = 459). Conclusions: This study adds to the understanding of co-morbidities in persons with seizures/epilepsy. Statistical modeling will be used to explain similarities and differences. Culturally relevant outreach to these populations is critical and GIS technology is useful in demonstrating where educational programs for patients and health professionals should be focused. Materials based on medical terms foreign to the lay public are less effective and tend to be written at a level that exceeds the readability of most patients. Since patients of low socioeconomic status are less likely to access internet resources, other community-based outreach needs to be investigated. 1 Tarakad Ramachandran, 1 Robert Beach, and 1 Alireza Yarahmadi ( 1 Neurology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY ) Rationale: Seizure is one of the most common serious neurological conditions encountered in the emergency departments. There is limited information about current use of emergent Brain CT in the evaluation of breakthrough seizure and its yield. Methods: Retrospective review, over a period of two years, of medical records of 250 emergency room admissions of adult patients (ages 18?59) with known history of epilepsy and breakthrough seizure(s) while on antiepileptic medications.The patients with diagnosis of status epilepticus have been excluded. Results: Of the 250 patients with epilepsy, emergent brain CT was performed in 130(52%) cases. The indication for emergent brain CT in addition to epilepsy were fall in 56 (43.1%), altered mental status in 24 (18.5%), lethargy in 19(14.6%), prolonged seizure in 18 (13.8%), recurrent seizures in 11 (8.5%), and headaches in 2 patients (1.5%). Type of seizures included 87 (66.9%) patients with generalized tonic clonic, 33 (25.4%) complex partial with secondary generalization, 2 (1.5%) myoclonic, and 8 (6.1%) had different types of seizures. 98 (75.4%) patients had previous emergent brain CT(s) in our institution. Of the 130 patients scanned 86 (66%) had a normal CT brain, evidence of an old stroke was evident in 8 (6%), small vessel disease in 9 (6.9%), post operative changes in 11 (8.4%), remote trauma in 5 (3.8%), previously diagnosed primary brain tumor in 4 (3%), and nonspecific findings in 7 (5.3%) patients. Emergent brain CT had minor or no impact on the therapy decision-making in any of the 130 patients. Conclusions: The cost of multiple brain CTs in patients with established diagnosis of epilepsy is not trivial, and the benefits have not been determined. The potential cost savings of a more rational approach, multiplied by the large number of patients present to ED with breakthrough seizure, could be huge. Development of criteria or evidence-based guidelines is needed to justify necessity and value of emergent brain CT in this patient group. 1 Amir M. Arain, 1 Aley M. Hamadani, and 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: To evaluate the predictors of seizure remission after the diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is made with Video EEG monitoring. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records (2000?2005) of 39 patients with psychogenic seizures who returned for follow up after diagnosis on video EEG monitoring. They represented 24% of 165 who received this diagnosis on video EEG monitoring, even though all patients were asked to return for follow-up. Neuropsychological testing was ordered in all patients, but only 9 had this testing. The status of seizure control was determined at follow up (1 week-4years, mean 7months). We compared the group with residual seizures at follow up and the seizure-free group for the following variables: demographic variables, age at spell onset, level of education, marital status, history of abuse, type and number of recorded events, history of drug abuse, and evidence of social support as suggested by an accompanying family member. We used Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables. Results: There were 17 males and 22 females with an age range from 20?82 years (mean 39.5 years). Ten patients (26%) had achieved seizure remission, while 74% continued to have psychogenic seizures. Patients who were seizure-free at follow up were more likely to be accompanied by a family member to their first clinic visit. No other variables distinguished the two groups. Conclusions: Patients with psychogenic seizures have poor compliance with follow up after their diagnosis. The majority continue to have spells at follow up. Patients with a better outcome had evidence of greater psychosocial support. 1 Jorge J. Asconapé, and 1 Jan C. McGee ( 1 Neurology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL ) Rationale: Humans have individual differences in the timing of their daily activities falling between two extremes: morning types (larks) and evening types (owls). The normal work schedules, determined by light/dark cycles, tend to favor morning types and could lead to chronic sleep deprivation in evening types. As a group, patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) show a tendency for being ?owls?. This particular circadian sleep pattern is often not recognized by treating physicians but can have important implications in the diagnosis and managment of these patients. Methods: We adminstered the English version of the Horne-Östberg self-assesment questionnaire1 to 12 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy to determine their morningness and eveningness chronotypes. All patients included had both clinical and EEG findings consistent with IGE. Results: Of the 12 patients, 7 had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 3 had IGE with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only, and 2 had juvenile absence epilepsy. Mean age at the time of testing was 19.6 years (r: 15?25 years). The mean test score was 39.1 (r: 25?64) which corresponds to a moderately evening type. Two patients (16.7%) were scored as definitely evening type, 5 (41.7%) as moderately evening type, 4 (33.3%) as neither and 1 (8.3%) as a moderately morning type. When patients were asked to classify themselves as either a ?morning? versus ?evening? type, 7 (58.3%) indicated a definitely evening type, 4 (33.3%) a moderately evening type and 1 (8.3%) a moderately morning type. Conclusions: Data from this preliminary series suggests that the evening chronotype predominates in patients with IGE. Inquiring about chronotypes may be helpful in the initial diagnosis of IGE. More important, eveningness has been associated with chronic sleep deprivation, a well-known seizure precipitating factor in IGE, so its recognition may be important for clinical management. Reference 1.?Horne JA, Östberg O. A self-assessment questionnaire to determine morningness-eveningness in human circadian rhythms. Int J Chronobiol 1976;4:97?110. 1 Olga Bogdanova, 2 Henry Buchtel, and 1 Daniela Minecan ( 1 Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ; and 2 Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ) Rationale: The Intracarotid Amytal testing (WADA test) has been used as part of the presurgical evaluation of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy(TLE). The purpose is to confirm language lateralization and identify patients at risk for memory impairment after the resective surgery. The ideal surgical candidate has better memory scores in the hemisphere contralateral to the expected surgery side. The concern is in cases with reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores. The memory outcome has been previously analyzed for patients with left anterior temporal lobectomies(ATL) and reversed scores. The significance of symmetrical WADA memory scores(irrespective of the side of surgery) and reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores for patients who undergo right ATL has not been previously evaluated. Methods: Patients were selected from those with temporal lobe epilepsy and who underwent complete presurgical evaluation at the University of Michigan Medical Center between 2000 and 2005. We included patients who had symmetrical and reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores and who were seizure free at least at one year follow up after the resective surgery. A total of 14 patients were identified. Age range was between 9 and 56 years at the time of the WADA test. Six patients were males. All patients underwent neuropsychometric evaluation as part of the presurgical evaluation and at three months after the resective surgery. Seven patients also had another set of neuropsychometric evaluation performed 12 to 13 months after the surgery date. Nine patients had symmetrical WADA memory scores and two of these patients had right temporal lobectomies. The other five patients had reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores. In this group, four patients underwent left temporal lobectomies. We compared 3 month post-operative verbal and pictorial memory change scores. Results: None of the patients with symmetrical WADA memory scores(n = 9) have shown any significant change in the memory outcome at the post-surgical neuropsychometric evaluation, irrespective of their site of resection. One patient with left temporal lobectomy showed slightly improved pictorial memory. All patients with reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores (n = 5) had a poorer verbal and/or pictorial memory outcome, despite the fact that they were also seizure free. The decline was considered statistically significant in all of them, again irrespective of the site of surgery. Conclusions: Dominant or non-dominant anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) patients with reversed WADA memory asymmetry scores are at significant risk for post-operative memory deficits, despite complete seizure control. However, symmetrical WADA memory scores do not pose a threat for either the verbal or the pictorial memory scores of the ATL patients. A larger cohort of patients and longer post-operative follow up may be useful to confirm these results. 1 Christine Dong, 1 Eric Pina-Garza, and 1 Bassel Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Neurology, Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, TN; and Neurology, Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Pentobarbital is a widely used for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. The EEG is usually continuously monitored during pentobarbital administration and during the withdrawal period and is the basis for the decision to resume pentobarbital or continue its withdrawal. We observed a pattern of periodic sharp EEG discharges related to pentobarbital withdrawal. This pattern is transient with continued withdrawal. It is not associated with clinical seizure activity and is not predictive of recurrence of status epilepticus. This pattern is important to describe and recognize because it may result in unnecessary resumption of pentobarbital. Methods: We recognized a periodic pattern during recovery from pentobarbital coma in 5 patients. EEG was recorded intermittently in all, for 20?30 minutes every 8 hours in the first patient, using paper EEG, and for 5 minutes every 30 minutes for the remaining patients (using digital EEG recording). We reviewed the EEG pattern during pentobarbital withdrawal. We also reviewed the clinical history, including outcome in all patients. Results: The first patient received pentobarbital for increased intracranial pressure after traumatic brain injury and the other four received pentobarbital for refractory status epilepticus. During pentobarbital withdrawal all developed a pattern of sharply contoured periodic complexes, typically with a recurrence rate of one every 1?2 seconds. In the first patient, this was interpreted as electrographic status epilepticus. However, after several repeated trials of pentobarbital, it was realized that this may not be a seizure pattern and pentobarbital was fully withdrawn with no clinical seizure activity. With the remaining patients, the pattern was recognized earlier, thus avoiding prolonged pentobarbital treatment. In all patients, the periodic pattern evolved into more continuous EEG activity that was not ictal. This was associated with clinical recovery, though not necessarily to pre-status baseline. Conclusions: A periodic EEG pattern may occur in association with pentobarbital withdrawal. When such a pattern is not associated with clinical seizure activity, it should not be a reason to resume pentobarbital since it is usually not an ictal pattern. [figure 1] 1 Fariba Farhidvash, 1 Amir M. Arain, 2 Pradumna P. Singh, and 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN ; and 2 Neurology, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Access to healthcare is unsatisfactory in indigent patients with epilepsy. Multiple factors hinder in the access to healthcare including absence of insurance. Many epilepsy patients use the hospital emergency room as a primary or secondary source of care for their seizure disorder. Many indigent patients do not see an epilepsy specialist for long term care. We wished to find the factors that affect the access to healthcare in these indigent epilepsy patients. Methods: We obtained data of patients seen in the ER for seizures in 2002 and 2003, in two institutions, Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) and Metro Nashville General Hospital (MNGH), seeking to identify patients who had visited the emergency room more than once. Vanderbilt is a tertiary care institution while MNGH serves the more underserved population. We also collected insurance information of these patients, and compared them to the outpatient VUH epilepsy clinic data. We did a chart review to identify these patients who finally followed up in the epilepsy clinic. Results: A total of 702 patients visited the VUH ER and 446 patients visited the MNGH ER for seizures. Of the VUH patients, 125 patients visited the ER more than once. Of these patients who visited ER multiple times, 69 (55.2%) finally followed up in the epilepsy clinic and of those, 24 patients (34.8%) were already followed by an epileptologist. Patients who visited the ER mulitple times, 31 (25%) carried private or commercial insurance, 91 (73%) carried Medicare or Medicaid, and 3 had no insurance. The 69 patients who followed up in the clinic, 19 (61.3%) carried private insurance, 50 (55%) carried Medicare/Medicaid. The average duration between the first ER visit to the first clinic visit was 196 days with those who carried private insurance averaged 91 days and those with Medicare/Medicaid averaged 236 days. Of the 446 MGNH patients, 157 (35%) visited the ER more than once. Of these 157 patients, 36 (23%) finally followed up in the outpatient Neurology clinic. Of these patients who made multiple ER visits, 0.9% patients had commercial insurance, 38% carried Medicaid, 12% Medicare and 36% were self pay. None of the commercial insurance carriers followed up in clinic while 31 (86%) of the Medicaid/Medicare carriers and 3 (8%) of the uninsured patients had. The average duration of time between the first ER visit and the first clinic visit was 73 days, 71 days for the Medcare/Medicaid carriers and 84 days for the uninsured Conclusions: Among indegent patients using ER for treatment of epilepsy is not adequate and there is still considerable lack of long term follow up of seizures in outpatient setting. Overall this results in disparity of care in indigent patients and adds tremendous cost to society. This study emphasizes the importance of better epilepsy management and educational and social programs for those with epilepsy. 1 Jacqueline A. French, 2 Nancy R. Temkin, 3 Jeffrey S. Nye, and 3 Filip De Ridder ( 1 Department of Neurology, Hospital of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; and 3 Johnson  2) a simulation study with a model based on TPM data. Data were from six randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with topiramate as adjunctive therapy (200?1000 mg/day) in refractory partial-onset seizures. Tn for 3, 6, 9, and 12 seizures (T3, T6, T9, T12) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Cox proportional hazard regression, stratified by baseline 28-day seizure frequency (<6, 6?22, > 22), was used to estimate the hazard ratio for each study arm (dose) vs placebo. Simulation study was performed as 12-wk dose-ranging trial with 4-wk baseline assessing 6 doses to yield treatment effects (difference from placebo in median% seizure reduction) of 0?50%. Results: Tn analysis showed superiority of TPM over placebo, consistent with original analyses of median% seizure reduction. Simulation study results showed a linear relationship between Tn hazard ratio and median% seizure reduction. Tn analysis was generally less powerful than seizure rate analysis, although power increased with number of seizures (n≥6) and with stratification according to baseline seizure frequency. Adequate power of the stratified T6 analysis for detecting clinically meaningful treatment effects (30% difference from placebo) could be attained with a reasonable sample size (80 patients/arm). A study with a prospective baseline and 12-wk follow-up would require 36 subjects to achieve the same power. In TPM clinical trials, 80% of patients experienced their 6th seizure within 6 wks of study initiation. Conclusions: Stratified Tn analysis, with n = 6, can provide adequate power to detect clinically relevant effect sizes of an AED as adjunctive therapy in a sample of 80 patients with refractory partial-onset seizures. The potential advantages of reducing clinical trial duration from 16 wks to 6 wks and potentially eliminating the prospective baseline period must be weighed against potential disadvantages such as need for larger sample sizes. (Supported by Johnson  and 2 Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth Unversity, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but devastating late neurological complication of measles infection characterized by a progressive encephalopathy, myoclonus, and focal neurologic deficits occuring 7?10 years after initial infection. Survival from onset is typically 1?3 years. There is no proven effective therapy. We report a 15-year old girl with SSPE who had marked improvement in atonic seizures and neurocognitive status with zonisamide and interferon-beta 1a. Methods: Case report. Results: A 15-year-old girl presented to our epilepsy center with seizures and cognitive decline. At 19 months, a febrile exanthem illness diagnosed as Kawasaki disease was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. At age 13 she developed nocturnal frontal lobe complex partial seizures, successfully controlled with lamotrigine. Eighteen months later, her family noticed personality changes and inattentiveness. Cognitive decline continued over the next 8 months; full scale IQ decreased from 101 to 77. At age 15, she began to have atonic seizures and falls. Video EEG monitoring showed frequent atonic episodes, brief behavioral arrests with slow eye blinks, and myoclonic jerks, concurrent with periodic generalized high-voltage slow wave complexes occurring once every 5 ? 6 seconds. Laboratory data included markedly elevated IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate with positive CSF oligoclonal bands. Serum and CSF measles IgG were significantly elevated. MRI of the brain revealed subtle bilateral occipital white matter T2 hyperintensities. Functional MRI synchronized to the abnormal blinks showed increased BOLD signal and perfusion in bilateral putamina and cingulate cortex. Zonisamide 250 mg daily was added to her regimen. Atonic episodes remitted completely, and EEG 1 month later showed no periodic slow wave complexes. On isoprinosine 3000 mg/day, neurologic status remained stable for 6 months. Cognitive status then declined again (FSIQ 40, modified mini-mental status exam (MMSE) 20/57) and new MRI T2 hyperintense lesions appeared in bilateral basal ganglia. She was started on interferon-beta 1a 44mcg subcutaneously three times weekly. Her Neurologic Disability Index declined from 24% to 6%, and MMSE improved to 36/57. She continues to improve 1 year after subcutaneous interferon was initiated. Conclusions: Myoclonic and atonic seizures, hallmarks of SSPE, are usually refractory to standard antiepileptic drugs. Our case demonstrates a rapid and complete response to zonisamide which was sustained over nearly two years, suggesting a new avenue for therapy of these refractory seizures. In addition, our patient showed sustained improvement in neurocognitive function with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a. This therapy should be considered in SSPE patients who have the failed the current standards of care. 1 Christian P. Hansen, 1 René Mathiasen, 1 J?rgen Alving, 1 Birgitte H. Jensen, 1 Ellen H. Jensen, and 1 Signe Madsen ( 1 Management, Danish Epilepsy Centre, Dianalund, Dianalund, Denmark ) Rationale: Patient safety is of increasing concern in epilepsy centres. Various devices for detetction of epileptic seizures are available on the market. We decided to test the clinical value of bed alarms and pulse oxymeters in the Danish Epilepsy Centre, Dianalund. Methods: In-patients at increased risk of generalized convulsive seizures were supervised by video-cameras during the time spent in bed. The signals from the video-cameras were transmitted to a central supervision unit where a nurse was watching the screens with patients under supervision. In case of seizure, the supervising nurse notified the ward with the patient. The patient under supervision in bed carried a pulse oxymeter, and the bed was equipped with a seizure alarm. The staff in the ward registered alarms and compared with the messages from the nurse watching the patient on the screen. The sensitivity of the alarm (probability of alarming in case of seizure) and the occurrence of false alarms were registered. Patients were included from April 2004 to September 2005. In a second inclusion period from October 2005 to April 2006 we tried to improve the use of bed alarms by adjustment of alarm parameters. Results: In the first period 83 patients, aged 1?63 years, had 1332 epileptic seizures. The sensitivity of bed alarms was 18.7% in case of tonic-clonic seizures, 1.2% with tonic seizures, and 3.6% with focal motor seizures. The sensitivity of pulse oxymeters was 22.5% in tonic-clonic seizures, and 9.2% in tonic seizures. The sensitivity of both alarms were lower for other seizure types. The combined sensitivity of pulse oxymeters and bed alarms was 26% for tonic-clonic seizures and smaller for other seizure types. In average, there were 0.75 false alarms from the bed alarm per 24 hours, and 2.19 false alarms from the pulse oxymeters per 24 hours. In the second inclusion period it was not possible to improve the sensitivity or specificity of either alarm type. Conclusions: In our hands the combined use of bed alarms and pulse oxymeters detects a quarter of tonic-clonic seizures in epilepsy patients at increased seizure risk and a smaller fraction of other seizure types. There is a need for development of better technology for the provision of safety for epilepsy patients. 1 Lara E. Jeha, 1 Imad Najm, 2 Bill Bingaman, 1 Peter Widdess-Walsh, and 1 Hans Luders ( 1 Neurology, Section of Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) is the second most common cause of intractable focal epilepsy. Yet, little is known about the predictors of surgical success with frontal lobectomy. Methods: We reviewed patients who underwent a frontal lobectomy at our institution between 1995 and 2003 for the treatment of intractable FLE. Endpoints included Engel score at last follow-up, and time to any seizure recurrence. Overall seizure freedom was assessed using a Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis, and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy patients were identified. Thirty (43%) were female. Age at surgery ranged from one to 57 yrs(median 18.5 yrs), with a median of age at seizure onset of 6 yrs. Duration of follow-up ranged from one to 15 yrs (median 3.1 yrs). MRI showed frontal lobe lesions in 58%, and was normal in 26%. In 16% of the cases, MRI lesions extended beyond the frontal lobe, showing mesial temporal sclerosis in 8(12%). The most common etiology was a malformation of cortical development seen in 60% (with normal imaging in 29% of those), followed by tumor (19%), encephalomalacea from stroke or trauma (10%), cryptogenic with normal MRI and pathology (10%), and vascular malformation (1%). Thirty nine patients had at least one seizure recurrence during the whole duration of follow-up. Kaplan Meyer survival analysis estimated a 56% probability of seizure-freedom at 1 year, 45% at 3 years, and 30% at 5 years. [figure 1]Engel scores at the last follow-up were Engel 1 in 56%, Engel 2 in 7%, Engel 3 in 16%, and Engel 4 in 21%. Univariate screening identified mesial temporal sclerosis on preoperative MRI, extrafrontal MRI abnormalities, etiology, use of subdural electrodes, and immediate postoperative seizures as predictors of postoperative seizure recurrence. Predictors of seizure recurrence after frontal lobectomy Rate of Recurrence p-value MTS on MRI present 87.5% 0.04? absent 52.5% Extrafrontal MRI abnormality present 77.3% 0.015 absent 46.8% Etiology MCD with abnormal MRI 48.3% 0.033 MCD with normal MRI 91.7% Tumor 38.5% Cryptogenic 71.4% Encephalomalacea 57.4% Subdural electrodes used 63.8% 0.05? not used 39.1% Immediate postoperative seizures present 44.9% 0.007 absent 80.0% Only extrafrontal MRI abnormalities and immediate postoperative seizures remained significant upon using multiple logistic regression. Conclusions: Frontal lobectomy is an effective treatment in intractable FLE. Extrafrontal MRI abnormalities and immediate postoperative seizures identify the patient population with the worst outcome. 1 Sam A. Kabbani ( 1 Neurology, East Tennessee Neurology Clinic, P.C., Knoxville, TN ) Rationale: Use of a single broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) that is both efficacious and safe is optimal in epileptic patients. An AED displaying these properties and given as a first-line agent could eliminate trial and error of multiple therapies which often must be tried before the most effective therapy is determined. Levetiracetam (LEV) has previously shown efficacy and safety when used as monotherapy. Methods: Single-center, retrospective review of 98 epileptic patients (69 females, 29 males; mean age 39.5 years, rage 15?75 years) who were treated with LEV monotherapy over a one-year period. Medical records were reviewed for seizure type and etiology, history of prior AED use, imaging results, and LEV dosage. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed by reduction in seizure frequency and by reported adverse effects. Results: The most common seizure types were generalized (n = 49) and complex partial (with or without secondary generalization, n = 45). Fifty-one patients (52%) were given LEV as the first-line AED; 34 wre taking 1 AED and 13 were taking 2 AEDs at study initiation. The most frequently used AEDs included divalproex sodium (11%) and phenytoin (9%). LEV dosage was 3000 mg/day in 46 patients (47%) and 1500 mg/day in 36 (37%); titration to this dosage occurred over 1 week. The mean seizure reduction rate was 87.3%, with 53 patients becoming seizure free. An overall responder rate (≥50% seizure reduction) of 95% was noted. Thirty-four patients (35%) were able to discontinue 1 or more AEDs and were converted to LEV monotherapy. Clinical impression was good or excellent in 83 patients (85%). Of patients given LEV as first-line monothrapy, a mean seizure reduction of 87.6% was noted, with 32 patients becoming seizure free. The responder rate in the sub-group was 94% with 44 patients with a good or excellent clinical impression. Adverse events were reported in 7 patients overall (7%); 3 required discontinuation for itching/rash (1), dizziness/ataxia (1) or nausea (1). Conclusions: LEV showed excellent efficacy and tolerability in this group of patients when used as monotherapy. Further studies should explore the use of LEV in monotherapy, particularly as a first-line agent. (Supported by UCB Pharma, Inc.) 1 Peter Widdess-Walsh, 1 Prakash Kotagal, 2 Guiyun Wu, 1 Jeha Lara, and 1 Richard Burgess ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Epileptic auras provide important information about focal epilepsy and its location. Patients with focal epilepsy also report multiple aura types but limited data exists as to the significance of the occurence of multiple auras in the same patient. If multiple auras represent multiple seizure types or ictal onset zones, surgical treatment may not prove successful. Methods: The epilepsy monitoring unit database of the Cleveland Clinic was searched for patients with more than one aura type classified according to the Cleveland Clnic seizure classification system between the years 1989 and 2005. Clinical, EEG, and imaging data was analyzed to determine the location of the epileptogenic lesion, and explore possible mechanisms for the phenomenon of multiple auras. Results: Thirty one patients were identified who experienced multiple auras during a given seizure. 90% of patients with more than one aura had seizures arising from the right/non-dominant hemisphere (n = 31). 100% of patients with at least 3 auras had seizures arising from the right/non-dominant hemisphere (n = 12). In two thirds of cases, the auras occurred as a sequence in the same seizure, and in one third the auras occurred simultaneously. 30/31 patients had seizures with preservation of awareness. EEG seizures remained restricted. Twenty of the patients had resective epilepsy surgery with a good outcome in 59%. Patients who did not have surgery were either not drug-resistant, lost to follow-up, or had tumor-related epilepsy. In one patient with seizures from both temporal lobes, right sided seizures were associated with multiple auras, and left sided seizures were associated with aphasic seizures with loss of awareness. Subdural EEG recordings in 6 patients showed either a ?jacksonian march? of sequential auras, or in one case, several ictal onset zones resulting in separate isolated auras. Ictal SPECT images in 6 patients with right-sided seizures showed a lack of activation of the basal ganglia and brainstem. Conclusions: Most patients who report multiple aura types have localized epilepsy in the non-dominant hemisphere, and are good surgical candidates. The most common mechanism for multiple auras may be a spreading but restricted EEG seizure activating sequential symptomatogenic zones, but without the ictal activation of deeper structures or contralateral spread to cause loss of awareness and amnesia for the auras. 1 Ki Hyeong Lee, 1 Yong D. Park, 2 Joseph R. Smith, and 2 Mark R. Lee ( 1 Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ) Rationale: Functional Hemispherectomy (FH) is performed in patients with intractable epilepsy and disabling hemiparesis due to diffuse hemispheric pathology such as perinatal stroke or diffuse cortical dysplasia (CD). EEG finding in relation to post-op outcome of FH has not been systematically evaluated in the previous reports. Methods: A retrospective analysis included all patients who underwent FH from Sep 91 to June 05 at the Medical College of Georgia. Surgery was performed exclusively by two authors (JRS and MRL) who shared the same surgical technique. Patients were followed at least one yr post-op. Seizure outcome was classified as seizure-free (SF) vs. non seizure-free (NSF). Interictal and ictal EEGs were classified as lateralizing (L) (ipsilateral to the pathology) vs. non-lateralizing (NL) (unlocalizing, contralateral to the pathology, or bilateral-independent onset). Demographic characteristics, etiology, MRI/PET, outcome, and complication were collected from the medical record. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13 package. This study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: Total of 37 patients were included: M 18, F 19. Mean age of seizure onset was 3.4 yrs (0?26 yrs) while mean age of FH was 13.82 yrs (1?40 yrs). Most common etiology was perinatal stroke (40.5%, n = 15) followed by diffuse CD (32.4%, 12), RS (21.6%, 8), head trauma (2.7%, 1), and Sturge-Weber Syndrome (2.7%, 1). Overall surgical outcome was excellent: 81.1% (30/37) SF vs. 18.9% (7/37) NSF. SF outcome was not different between the different etiologies: stroke 73.3% SF (11/5) vs. CD 83.3% SF (10/12) vs. RS 100% SF (8/8). Interictal EEG was nonlateralizing (NL) in 18.9% (7/37) while ictal EEG in 35.1% (13/37). Iinterictal EEG pattern did not predict SF outcome: L 87.5% (21/24) vs. NL 69.2% (9/13), Fisher's Exact Test; p = 0.6. Ictal EEG pattern did not predict SF outcome either: L 87.5% (21/24) vs. 69.2% (9/13), p = 0.18. In addition, within the specific etiologic groups, interictal or ictal EEG did not predict the outcome. Age at the time of surgery tended to be younger in the SF group: 13.1 ± 11.2 (SF) vs. 16.8 ± 5.8 (NSF), t-test p = 0.087. Conclusions: Our data showed that interictal or ictal EEG pattern does not predict the surgical outcome. Our study suggests that selection of candidiates for functional hemispherectomy should be based on clinical and radiological evidence, rather than scalp EEG. 1 Anthony Marson, 2 David Smith, 1 Catrin Tudur Smith, 1 Paula Williamson, 1 Ann Jacoby, and 1 David Chadwick ( 1 Division of Neurological Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom ; and 2 Department of Neurology, The Walton Centre for Neurology  and 2 Epileptology, Kempenhaeghe Epilepsy Centre, Heeze, Brabant, Netherlands ) Rationale: Ictal asystole has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for SUDEP. The aim of this study is to analyse the presence of risk factors for SUDEP in a population of patients with a history of ictal asystole. Methods: Risk factors for SUDEP were determined in a submitted systematic review: young age, male sex, early onset, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and the presence of brain lesion. We than performed a literature search (pubmed, embase, cochrane library and references) for cases of ictal asystole and checked them for the presence of these risk factors.

Male sex: n = 39, 71%. Young age n = 33, 66%. Generalized seizures n = 10, 70%. Early onset n = 20, 80%. Structural brainlesion n = 31, 54%. Conclusions: The occurrence of the risk factors is similar in both populations. The statistical significance wil be discussed using a population of epilepsy patients, a population of patients known with ictal bradycardia and a population of patients with a history of asystole. 1 Kathryn A. O'Hara, 1 Tom Boro, and 1 John M. Pellock ( 1 Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: The emergency outpatient management of seizures varies significantly among EMS providers, depending on established protocols and levels of training/experience. To establish the clinical care provided by a highly trained EMS unit we reviewed records of the Richmond Ambulance Authority (RAA). Methods: The RAA is an all Advanced Life Support service operating in an urban environment. Using a dynamic deployment method matching resources to demand, they field up to 22 units within Richmond. In 2005 31,100 patients were transported including 1,159 seizures. All seizure related calls were reviewed. Of the 1,159 calls there were 539 unique social security numbers. Transports per person ranged from 1 (67%) to 17 (0.2%). Diazepam (IV) is the recommended 1st line therapy. IV attempts on pediatric (<15 years) and adult (>15years) patients that required medication were compared. Results: Priority 1 calls averaged 40 minutes from dispatched time to arrival at the emergency department(ED). The average time from the scene to the ED was 7 minutes. Of the 1,159 seizure calls, 625 patients (54%) were transported to the ED; 85 patients (13.6% of those transported) were under the age of 15. The success rate for starting an IV on seizure patients requiring diazepam was 62% on the 1st attempt, 16% on the second attempt and 19% on the 3rd attempt. In 3% of seizing patients an IV could not be established. There was no difference between adult and pediatric IV success rate. Conclusions: Rapid IV access is not always possible in patients who are actively seizing. Alternative forms of anticonvulsant treatment need to be available for EMS. 1 Juan G. Ochoa ( 1 Neurology, University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL ) Rationale: Alteration of extracellular volume, ion concentration and osmolarity may affect the epileptogenic process. Oral hydration with a slight hypotonic solution helps to mantain cerebral perfusion and may prevent abrupt changes in the intersticial electrolyte concentration that may trigger epileptic activity. This therapy may help stabilize the nonsynaptic mechanisms associated with seizure activity. Methods: We treated empirically eight patients with refractory focal or generalized epilepsy using a rice-based oral electrolyte solution therapy at a dose ranging between one to two liters per day, in addition to the standard AEDs. Six other patients fail to comply with therapy or seizure record keeping and were excluded from this report. Concomittant AEDs were either adjusted or discontinued at discretion of the treating physician. Serum electrolytes were obtained both at baseline and during electrolyte therapy. Results: Three children with familial dysautonomia and refractory absence epilepsy became seizure free for one year after therapy with Ceralyte90. All three patients remain on Ceralyte90 therapy for four years. There were occassional absence seizures after AED discontinuation.One patient with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy not able to tolerate traditional AEDs became seizure free on electrolyte therapy for at least one year. One patient with symptomatic generalized refractory epilepsy had over 90% seizure reduction over one year after electrolyte therapy. One child with refractory symptomatic generalized epilesy stpped atypical absence seizures but persist with uncontrolled generalized convultions. One patient with symptomatic generalized epilesy had reduction of cluster seizures preventing hospital admissions after electrolyte therapy through his gastric tube. One patient with symptomatic generalized epilepsy did not improve and discontinued treatment after three weeks of therapy. No significant side effects or complications have been observed during therapy in any of these patients. Conclusions: Rice-based oral electrolyte hydration is a safe novel therapy that may help control seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy. A controlled study is needed to validate this finding. Seizure freedom with empirical treatment in four patients with atypical absences suggests a possible stronger effect in this type of seizures. 1 Zhiyi Sha, 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Cammy Chicota, 1 Steve Rogers, 1 Jerome Engel, and 1 Susan Bookheimer ( 1 Neurology, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Language and memory preferentially develop in the same hemisphere; thus, verbal memory impairment is typically associated with left medial temporal lobe dysfunction while non-verbal memory impairment suggests a right hemisphere focus. However, in patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, this association may not be well established. Occasionally patients with a clear left hippocampus seizure focus and an apparently normal right hippocampus fail the Wada test with left side injection. We hypothesized that in left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, a late age of onset may account for these unpredicted Wada failures. Specifically, we reasoned that during the critical years when language develops and becomes established in the left hemisphere, strong connections with the left hippocampus are formed preferentially; in early onset left temporal lobe epilepsy, connections are strengthened with the right hippocampus when the left is dysfunctional. After the critical period of language development (generally accepted as ≤ 7 years old), we hypothesized that connections from left hemisphere language cortex to right medial temporal lobe would be more difficult to establish, and this connection is necessary for verbal encoding of non-verbal items. Therefore, in patients with late onset (≥ 8 years old) left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, we predicted that the right hippocampus may not be able to support memory after the left hippocampus loses its function secondary to longstanding seizures. To test this hypothesis we studied the relationship between left hemisphere Wada failures and age of seizure onset. Methods: We reviewed data on 69 patients who were admitted for pre-surgical evaluations for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Wada tests were performed as part of the pre-surgical evaluation. Forty-two patients had left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 27 patients had right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: Of the 42 left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, 18 had an early onset (≤ 7 years old) and 24 had a late onset (≥ 8 years old). All 18 early onset patient passed the Wada test with left sided injection. Nineteen of the 24 late onset patient passed the Wada test and 5 of the 24 failed (less than 60% recognition memory). The passing rate of the Wada test in early onset left mesial temporal lobe cases was significantly higher than the late onset group (p < 0.05). In the right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients, there was no significant difference between the early and late onset groups (1 out of 10 in the early onset and 1 out of 17 in the late onset did not pass the Wada test). Conclusions: Age of seizure onset may help to predict the Wada failure in left temporal lobe epilepsy. A greater incidence of Wada failures in late onset patients with left mesial temporal epilepsy compared to early onset patients suggests that memory laterality develops in concert with language development. 1 David Smith, 2 Anthony Marson, 2 Catrin Tudur Smith, 2 Paula Williamson, 2 Ann Jacoby, and 2 David Chadwick ( 1 Department of Neurology, The Walton Centre for Neurology  and 2 Division of Neurological Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Valproate is widely accepted as a drug of first choice for patients with generalised onset seizures and is recommended for patients with seizures that are difficult to classify because of its broad spectrum of efficacy. It is thought that lamotrigine and topiramate also possess broad spectrum activity. SANAD is the first study to compare the longer term effects of these drugs. Methods: SANAD is an NHS HTA sponsored un-blinded randomized controlled trial. Arm B recruited patients for whom valproate was considered to be standard treatment and were randomized to valproate, lamotrigine or topiramate. Outcomes were time to treatment failure and time to 1-year remission. Results: 716 patients were recruited. At randomization the percentages with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE), unclassified epilepsy, partial epilepsy and other generalised syndromes were 62%, 27%, 7% and 4% respectively. 239, 239, 238 children and adults were randomized to lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate respectively. Overall, for time to treatment failure valproate was significantly superior to topiramate Hazard ratio (HR 95% CI) 0.64 (0.48, 0.84), but there was no significant difference between valproate and lamotrigine 0.80 (0.60, 1.07). For patients with an IGE valproate was significantly superior to both lamotrigine 0.65 (0.45, 0.95) and topiramate 0.53 (0.37, 0.76). For time to 12 month remission valproate was significantly superior to lamotrigine overall 1.31 (1.06, 1.62) and for the subgroup with an IGE 1.48 (1.14, 1.93). But there was no significant difference between valproate and topiramate in either analysis. Conclusions: Valproate is better tolerated than topiramate and more efficacious than lamotrigine. Valproate is the drug of first choice for patients with generalised and unclassified epilepsies. (Supported by NHS HTA Programme.) 1 Andrea Sneider, 1 Marianna V. Spanaki-Varelas, 1 Lori A. Schuh, 1 Brien J. Smith, and 2 Lonni Schultz ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: There is a delay from the onset of epilepsy to epilepsy surgery of approximately 20 years. The aim of this study was to indentify if a delay in referring patients for epilepsy sugery is attributed to different views that neurologists have for refractory epilepsy. Through a survey, we assessed neurologists' definition of medically refractory epilepsy and their decision-making process on when to refer their patients for epilepsy surgery. Methods: A 10-item survey was developed and mailed to all practicing Michigan neurologists outside our institution. Surveys were anonymous but coded for tracking purposes. A nominal incentive was offered to respondents. Descriptive statistics were used in analysis. Results: Surveys were sent to 415 neurologists, 84 neurologists responded for a response rate of 20.24%. The majority of respondents defined medically refractory epilepsy as failing 3 monotherapy antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) trials and at least 2 polytherapy trials. Nineteen percent said that all approved AEDs had to be failed before considering a patient medically refractory. The vast majority (85%) of respondents did not feel failure of a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) was required before labeling a patient refractory. However, the majority (62%) of the respondents thought that VNS offers a > 10% chance of seizure-freedom. Our survey showed that 82% of the participants had referred patients for surgery and 73% of respondents felt that epilepsy surgery is under recommended overall. The majority (70%) of neurologists would not consider patients < 10 or > 60 years old as appropriate surgical candidates. The majority stated that their patients should not be considered for surgery unless seizures have been present for a minimum of two years and have a frequency of monthly or greater. Almost 50% percent of respondents were not satisfied with the level of communication from epilepsy centers, and one-third did not have their patients returned to their care in a timely fashion. Another third reported serious complications resulting from surgery. Conclusions: These results provide further insight into the delay seen between onset of epilepsy and time to surgery. The majority of respondents concluded that children less than 10 years of age are inappropriate surgical candidates. In addition, nearly 50% percent of respondents were not satisfied with the level of communication from epilepsy centers, and one-third did not have their patients returned in a timely fashion. Better education of neurologists, as well as better communication from comprehensive epilepsy centers could shorten the time to referral, increase the number of referrals and ultimately improve the lives of our patients.

Van Woensel ( 1 Unidad de Neurologia, Hospital Domingo Luciani, El Llanito, Caracas, Venezuela ; and 2 Epilepsy Department, Cyberonics Europe, Zaventem, Belgium ) Rationale: The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is widely known as one of the most severe and prognostically unfavourable epileptic conditions. When medications fail, nonpharmacologic treatments should be considered such as the ketogenic diet, epilepsy surgery (corpus callosotomy), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Therapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data from Cyberonics' International Patient Registry showed 29 patients (18 male, 11 female) with LGS who were treated with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Therapy between May 1994 and September 2001. Patients had a mean age of 16.6 years (range, 4?34). A total of 5 patients were institutionalized, and 7 patients had a history of callosotomy. Twenty-six patients (89.6%) were mentally retarded/developmentally delayed. Patients were taking an average of 2.45 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) per patient. Mean follow-up was 48.6 months. Data related to seizure reduction, AEDs and quality of life (QoL) were analysed. Results: There was a total median seizure reduction of 60%, and a total mean seizure reduction of 45.9% (p < 0.0001). A total of 41.4% of the patients (n = 12) had ≥ 50% seizure reduction. A reduction in the total number of AEDs was also observed (?0.52 AEDs/patient; p = 0.0293). Median stimulation parameters at last follow-up visit were: output current, 1.25 mA; pulse width, 500 ?s; frequency, 30 Hz; time ?on?, 30 sec; time ?off?, 5 minutes. Six patients (20.7%) reported that the magnet was always or most of the time effective in aborting or reducing the intensity and/or duration of their seizures. QoL improvements were more pronounced for alertness (48.3%), post-ictal state (37.9%) and cluster seizures (34.5%). Conclusions: These results show that VNS Therapy allowed a significant reduction in seizure frequency and in total number of AEDs in this patient population with LGS. VNS Therapy was also associated with QoL improvements. 1 Michael J. Van Putten, and 1 Maurice H. Van Putten ( 1 Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Medisch Spectrum Twente/University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; and Massachusetts Institute of Technology?Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, MIT, NW17?161, Cambridge, MA ) Rationale: Increased insight into the ictal phenomena that occur in epilepsy, such as the characterization of dynamic regimes during status epilepticus, adds to the store of knowledge of abnormal brain behavior and may assist in improved patient care, including appropriate seizure termination paradigms. We present a detailed quantitative analysis of ictal phenomena in four patients suffering from a non-convulsive status epilepticus (SE), in whom the EEG shows burst-like patterns of epileptiform discharges (durations 2?30 s) punctuated by low-voltage ?flat periods' with a duration of 1?60 s. Methods: Epileptiform burst-like transients were identified from the power envelope of the EEG signal. Subsequently, correlations between initial phases of all possible combinations of the epileptiform burst-like transients were determined. In addition, histograms of the durations of the ictal events and the interictal periods were created. Quantitative analysis of burst duration and inter-burst intervals was performed by evaluation of the distribution of the burst durations and inter-burst intervals. Given the assumed nonlinear nature of the ictal state and the discrete nature of the bursts and the IBI, potential power law behavior was studied. Results: Histograms of the duration of the epileptiform discharges showed a power-law (n = 2) or bimodal (n = 2) distribution of burst durations, with power-law behavior for the inter-burst intervals, with slopes between ?1 and ?2, suggesting the presence of type III or on-off intermittency. Analysis of the epileptiform bursts indicates the presence of different, isolated brain states (bursts), that often recur in time (45?99% recurrence rate). Figure 1 illustrates the morphology of various pairs of recurrent epileptiform discharges. Left (A-C): data from patient G and Right (D-F) from patient W. The initial portions of the pairs of traces shown are similar, with divergence of later waveforms (red and blue, respectively). These tracings illustrate qualitatively the sensitive dependence on the initial conditions, ? one of the characteristics of nonlinear systems. Conclusions: The presence of intermittency and the power-law distribution of the inter-burst intervals during non-convulsive status epilepticus are indications of nonlinear dynamics. Bursts of epileptiform discharges during a non-convulsive SE are manifestations of intermittency with multiple, recurring, brain states. [figure 1] 1 Dominique Parain, and 2 Renata Dias de Carvalho Van Woensel ( 1 Service de Neurophysiologie, Hopital Charles-Nicolle, Rouen, France ; and 2 Cyberonics, Europe ) Rationale: Epilepsy is very common in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and occurs in 80 to 90% of affected individuals during their lifetime. Although not completely understood, the incidence of epilepsy is thought to relate to the neuropathologic features of the disorder, including cortical tubers and other dysgenetic features. Methods: Analysis of data from Cyberonics' International Patient Registry showed 90 patients (53 male, 37 female) with TSC and medically refractory epilepsy who were treated with adjunctive VNS Therapy. Patients had a mean age of 16.7 (±12.00) years. Six (6.7%) patients were institutionalized. Five (5.5%) patients had a prior callosotomy, and 8 (8.9%) patients had a history of lobectomy. Mean follow-up was 32.7 ± 15.37 months (median: 34.05 months). Epilepsy was localized in 47 (52.2%) cases; 20 patients (22.2%) had generalized seizures, and 14 (15.5%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Other types of seizures occurred in 22 (24.4%) patients. Data on seizure reductions, magnet use and quality of life (QoL) were collected. Results: There was a median seizure reduction of 59.4% for the entire patient population at the last follow-up visit (p-value < 0.0001; Wilcoxon's paired signed rank test). Seizure reductions ≥ 50% occurred in 56.7% of the patients. Magnet use was reported in 67.8% of the cases (n = 61). According to 23 patients (25.5%), the magnet was always or most of the time effective in aborting or reducing the intensity and/or duration of their seizures. Another 26.7% of the patients (n = 24) reported that the magnet had some effectiveness. More than 50% of the patients reported improvements in alertness and post-ictal state. Conclusions: Adjunctive VNS Therapy was effective for the treatment of medically refractory seizures associated with TSC, with a significant median seizure reduction of 59.4%. Seizure reductions ≥ 50% were reported in 56.7% of the patients. QoL improvements were most pronounced for alertness and post-ictal state. 1 Imran I. Ali, 1 Nabeel A. Herial, 2 Terrance Horrigan, 1 Leah Kellough, and 1 Gretchen E. Tietjen ( 1 Neurology, Medical University of Ohio, Toledo, OH ; and 2 Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Ohio, Toledo, OH ) Rationale: There is considerable evidence that older antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenobarbital and phenytoin adversely affect bone health. However, data regarding newer AEDs such as levetiracetam is lacking. We, therefore, studied the effects of levetirecetam on bone density, vitamin D and osteocalcin levels. Methods: After IRB approval patients on levetiracetam monotherapy for greater than six months were enrolled. Sixteen patients (eight men and eight women) agreed to participate in the study. A detailed questionnaire was used to review medical history. Osteocalcin were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay and and 1, 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels by a radioimmunoassay. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed using Hologic System. Results: The mean age of these patients was 37 years (range 20?66 years). Mean duration of therapy with levetirecetam as monotherapy was 27 months (range 6?60 months). The mean serum 1, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D level was 42.5 pg/mL (range 17?100 pg/mL). None of these patients had an abnormally low vitamin D level noted. Mean serum osteocalcin level was 6.4 ng/mL (range 1.8?14.1). Four of the sixteen (25%) of the patients had elevated osteocalcin levels.Two of these had mildly abnormal bone density measurements when compared to normal young adults matched for gender (t score). All four had previous exposure to other AEDs including phenytoin, sodium valproate, carbamazepine and phenobarbital. All sixteen patients underwent DEXA scan. None of the patients had evidence of osteopenia or osteoporosis when compared to age and sex matched controls (z score > -2.0). Borderline abnormal t scores were noted in two patients at lumbar spine level who also had elevated osteocalcin levels. However, these patients had been treated with multiple AEDs prior to being on keppra monotherapy. A significant positive linear correlation was noted between serum 1, 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels and bone mineral density. (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Levetiracetam does not appear to be associated with a significant decrease in vitamin D levels or bone mineral density. Elevation of osteocalcin levels, implying increased bone turnover was noted in four patients but this finding alone is of unclear clinical significance and requires further study. Slight reduction in BMD in two patients can potentially be explained by previous, prolonged exposure to other AEDs known to cause bone loss. This confounding variable needs to be considered in all cross-sectional studies such as ours in assessing bone mineral density with newer AEDs. Controlled prospective studies in patients with new onset seizures may be a better method of studying effects of newer AEDs on bone mineral density. (Supported by UCB Pharmaceuticals.) 1 Carl W. Bazil, 1 Timothy DaGiau, and 1 Elisa A. Salerni ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Sleep disturbances may be more common in epilepsy patients, potentially resulting in decreased memory, attention, and alertness as well as increased seizures. However, sleep problems are frequently overlooked, and the actual prevalence of sleep problems (in general and in epilepsy) is not well understood. This prospective study looked at sleep problems in an epilepsy referral center using a standardized questionairre, and compared scores with subjects accompanying epilepsy patients who did not have epilepsy. Methods: All patients with epilepsy (PWE) seen as inpatients or outpatients at an epilepsy referral center were invited to participate. Questionnaires included basic demographic information, the MOS sleep scale, and questions about sleep hygiene. Companions without epilepsy were also surveyed as controls. PWE had seizure diagnosis verified by treating physicians. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: 187 surveys were returned. Average age was 45 years for PWE, 47 years for controls. 50% of PWE were women compared with 62% of controls. Nearly all PWE were being treated with anticonvulsant drugs. PWE scored significantly higher on the sleep adequacy subscale of the MOS sleep scale, reflecting worse sleep (53 ± 2 vs. 43 ± 3). There were no significant differences in subscales measuring sleep somnolence, optimal sleep, awakening short of breath, or overall sleep problems index although subjects with epilepsy scored worse in all of these. Subjects with epilepsy more commonly reported signs of insomnia (43% vs 34%), restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movements (37% vs 25%), and sleep apnea (43% vs 34%) than control subjects, but controls more commonly reports excessive daytime sleepiness (46% for control vs 37% for PWE). None of these differences were statistically significant. PWE slept significantly longer than controls during the week (6.9 ± 0.1 vs. 6.2 ± .22 hrs) but not on weekends. Subjects in both groups had signs of poor sleep hygiene, particularly including use of alcohol shortly before bedtime. Conclusions: In this relatively small sample, sleep adequacy was more impaired in epilepsy patients than in their companions without epilepsy. Other measures suggested increased sleep problems in PWE but did not reach statistical significance. It may be that, with a larger sample, differences between these two groups can be clarified. More objective evaluations, including evaluation by sleep specialists and polysomnography would be needed to idenify the actual frequency of specific sleep disorders. PWE slept longer on average; it was not clear whether this was due to medication, employment status, or other factors. Both groups had signs of poor sleep hygiene, suggesting the need for education regarding sleep in PWE and in the general population. 1 Annette M. Chihorek, 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil, and 1 Beth A. Malow ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Although the incidence of new-onset seizures is much higher in older adults than in any other age group, the etiology remains unknown in about 45% (Epilepsia, 34(3): 453?68, 1993). One possible etiological factor is untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can lead to sleep fragmentation and chronic sleep deprivation, potentially facilitating seizures in susceptible individuals (Neurology, 48(5):1389?94, 1997). Methods: To determine whether OSA is more common in individuals with later-onset seizures or worsening of seizure control in later life, we performed a cross-sectional study of adults 50 years or older presenting to a tertiary center epilepsy clinic. Patients with provoked seizures, associated neurological disease, or unreliable seizure histories were excluded. An epilepsy specialist blinded to the study results classified each subject into one of two groups. Group 1: -? Seizure-onset before age 50 with stable or improved seizure frequency at or after age 50 Group 2: -? Seizure-onset before age 50 with increased seizure frequency at or after age 50 OR -? Seizure-onset at age 50 or older Each subject underwent one-night polysomnography. The studies were reviewed by a sleep specialist blinded to the epilepsy histories. The number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (apnea-hypopnea index; AHI) was calculated. Results: Of 290 patients screened, 135 met inclusion criteria, and 21 consented to participate. Epilepsy syndromes included partial epilepsy of temporal lobe (15) or frontal lobe (3) origin, idiopathic generalized (2), and unspecified (1). 1 Comparison of Means for Group 1 (Stable Seizures) and Group 2 (New or Worsening Seizures) Group 1 n = 10 Group 2 n = 11 p AHI 3.1 (1.8) 23.2 (26.2) .002* Age 57.1 (7.0) 58.0 (9.7) .81 Gender (%Male) 20 (42) 82 (40) .003* BMI 26.6 (6.0) 27.6 (5.3) .67 Neck Circum (in) 14.8 (1.8) 16.1 (1.5) .09 #AEDs 1.8 (0.6) 1.5 (0.5) .32 Mostly Nocturnal Sz's 4 2 .36 ESS 5.9 (5.3) 11.6 (3.6) .009* SA-SDQ score 12.6 (3.7) 16.3 (4.1) .04* () = SD The two groups were similar in age, BMI, number of AEDs currently used, and frequency of nocturnal seizures. Group 2 had more men and a higher neck circumference. Group 2 had significantly higher AHIs, as well as higher scores on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Sleep Apnea section of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ). [figure 1] Conclusions: The AHI was higher in the group with either new seizures or increased seizures, suggesting that OSA may play a role in facilitating seizures in this older population.

Kanner ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Chilean League Against Epilepsy, Santiago, Chile ; 2 Faculty of Medicine, University of the Andes, Santiago, Chile ; 3 Faculty of Medicine, Clinica Alemana ? Development University, Santiago, Chile ; and 4 Department of Neurology, Rush Medical Center, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy, with major impact in quality of life. Recent publications raise concerns of underrecognition of depression in patients with epilepsy. This issues have not been systematically assesed in chilean patients with epilepsy. We evaluate the prevalence and underrecognition of depression in patients with epilepsy attending the epilepsy clinic of the Chilean League Against Epilepsy Methods: We evaluated 200 consecutive adult patients with epilepsy. Depression was diagnosed using a validated CIDI diagnostic interview. The clinical recognition of depression was determined by inspection of medical records. All patients gave their written informed consent. Results: A diagnosis of Major Depression was established in 44/200 patients (22%). In 33/44 (75%) depression was unrecognized. 21/44 (47.7%) have been seizure free for the last year. Conclusions: Depression is highly prevalent and underrecognized in chilean patients with epilepsy. Validated, simple and cost effective screening instruments for the detection of depression would be a major contribution to improve quality of life of patients with epilepsy. 1 A. James Fessler, 1 Robert A. Gross, and 1 John T. Langfitt ( 1 Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY ) Rationale: The SCL-90-R is a self-report inventory that assesses the severity of a number of different types of psychiatric symptoms. We have previously shown that patients with psychogenic, non-epileptic attacks (PNEA) have higher scores on somatization and anxiety indices as measured by this inventory compared to patients with epilepsy. There were no differences between these two groups on measures of paranoia (PA) and psychoticism (PS). These differences may have been underestimated because of the degree of symptom reporting. Patients with epilepsy may have higher scores on these indices, as peri-ictal symptoms may mimic psychiatric disease in select patients. Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive, adult patients (>17 years of age) who were evaluated at the Strong Epilepsy Center. Two hundred and ninety-two patients completed the SCL-90-R prior to an initial clinic visit between 2001 and 2004 and underwent subsequent video-EEG monitoring. All patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist or psychologist during the admission. One hundred and sixty-six patients were female. One hundred and seventy-six (63.7%) patients were diagnosed with epilepsy and 94 (32.2%) with PNEA. Patients with other non-epileptic events or both PNEA and seizures were excluded. To control for patients who reported multiple somatic symptoms, patients with high positive symptoms total (PST) scores (>65) were excluded from this analysis. Results: One hundred and twenty-four patients with epilepsy and 56 patients with PNEA were identified. Of the psychogenic patients, 6 (10.7%) had an elevated (≥65) PS score, 3 (5.4%) had an elevated (≥65) PA score and in 3 (5.4%) patients, both were elevated. Nineteen (15.3%) epilepsy patients had an elevated PS score and 10 (8.1%) had an elevated PA score. In 4 (3.2%) patients, both indices were elevated. All of the patients with an elevated PS score had partial onset seizures with 14/19 (73.7%) having temporal lobe epilepsy, 1 (5.3%) with frontal lobe epilepsy and 4 (21.1%) with hemispheric onset seizures without further localization. Three patients had ictal hallucinations, 2 had fear as a prominent component of the aura and 2 had post-ictal psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations and aggression. Conclusions: No statistically significant differences between patients with epilepsy and PNEA were seen on psychoticism and paranoia indices when patients with high symptoms reporting were excluded. Care must be taken in patients with epilepsy when administering psychiatric batteries, as associated ictal and peri-ictal symptoms may be mistaken for underlying psychiatric disease. 1,2 James D. Geyer, 3 Paul R. Carney, and 1 Stephenie C. Dillard ( 1 The Sleep Program, Southern Sleep Specialists, Tuscaloosa, AL ; 2 Department of Neurology and Sleep Medicine, The University of Alabama College of Community Health Sciences, Tuscaloosa, AL ; and 3 Department of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neuroscience, and Bioengineering, The University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder occurring in 10?15% of the general population. The prevalence of RLS increases with advancing age and is more common in several neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Epilepsy is also a common neurological disorder with significant associated morbidity and impact on quality of life. Any disorder which adversely affects quality of life may further compound the problems associated with epilepsy. We report the severity and frequency of RLS in patients with localization-related epilepsy. Methods: All epilepsy patients seen in the outpatient clinic over a one month period were screened for movement disorders. Patients with severe language impairment, cognitive impairment and stroke were excluded from this study population. Fifty-one consecutive patients with localization-related (complex partial) epilepsy who met inclusion criteria were seen in the outpatient clinic during this period. Each patient was evaluated with the International Restless Legs Study Group (IRSLSG) questionnaire, NIH RLS diagnostic criteria and comprehensive sleep screening. Restless legs syndrome quality of life questionnaires were also administered to a subset of those patients. Results: Restless legs occurred in 14 of 51 (28%) of the localization-related epilepsy patients. Thirteen of the 14 patients reported at least moderate impact on quality of life parameters related to RLS. An insufficient number of patients with primary generalized epilepsy were screened for adequate statistical analysis during the study period. A number of anti-epileptic agents were used in this study population. Based on patient reported histories, there appears to be a trend toward improvement of RLS symptoms following treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabilin, and lamotrigine. Some patients reported worsening of symptoms with valproate and phenytoin. Since a number of anti-epileptic drugs were used in this patient population, there were insufficient numbers of patients treated with each medication for reliable statistical analysis. Conclusions: We identified RLS in patients with epilepsy at a frequency that exceeds the general population. Furthermore, these patients were more likely to have moderate to severe RLS than would typically be seen in patients of similar age, and most reported at least moderate impact on quality of life. It is likely that there are differences in the interaction between RLS and various anti-epileptic medications. More detailed analysis of the effect of medication selection as well as quality of life parameters related to RLS is needed. 1,2 Sheryl R. Haut, 1,2 Jonathan H. Masur, 3 Mindy Katz, 1,2 Edith Miller, and 2,3 Richard B. Lipton ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY ; 2 Department of Neurology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstien College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: The age specific incidence of epilepsy appears to be highest during old age. Comorbidities of seizures in the elderly are expected to differ from those in younger patients. To explore these differences, we examined the prevalence of cognitive loss, depression and sleep disorders in elderly patients with epilepsy. Methods: Subjects were recruited from the Epilepsy Management Center at Montefiore Medical Center, and the Einstein Aging Study, an NIH-funded longitudinal study of elderly individuals. Cases were > = 65 years of age with a diagnosis of epilepsy confirmed by an epileptologist, and were paired with age and gender matched controls without a history of seizures. Testing administered to all subjects included the Blessed Information Memory and Concentration (BIMC) test; Prime-MD Depression and Anxiety Scale; and Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. Results: Data were analyzed for 64 subjects. Cases with epilepsy had significantly higher mean BIMC scores (6.3) than controls (1.2) (p < 0.0001). Mean Prime-MD Depression scores were significantly worse for cases (4.2) than controls (.79) (p = 0.006) with six of 32 cases (18%) meeting screening criteria for depression, while anxiety scores were not significantly different. Cases demonstrated significantly poorer sleep scores than controls in the categories of somnolence (p = 0.009) and shortness of breath/headache (p = 0.021) scales. Conclusions: In our population, elderly individuals with epilepsy had reduced cognitive function, a higher prevalence of depression, and poor sleep health when compared with their age mates without epilepsy. This cross-sectional study could not determine the temporal course of epilepsy and co-morbidities, and further investigation will explore these associations prospectively.

Sheline, 5 Mark A. Mintun, 6 Joseph L. Price, 3 Jewell Carter, 3 Victoria Vahle, 4 Abraham Z. Snyder, and 1 Frank Gilliam ( 1 The Neurological Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Zagreb Epilepsy Center, University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia ; 3 Department of Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ; 4 Department of Psychiatry, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ; 5 Department of Radiology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ; and 6 Department of Neuroanatomy, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) Rationale: Neurologically normal patients with primary depression have hippocampal volumes smaller than controls. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients have a wider range of abnormalities in the mesial temporal structures, which allows investigation of the association of hippocampal volume with severity of depressive symptoms. Based on the hyperexcitable hippocampal efferents to limbic structures, we hypothesized that TLE patients will express increased symptoms of depression. In addition, we speculated that severe hippocampal atrophy will not support the hyperexcitable network required to maintain clinical depression. Methods: We evaluated 28 consecutive adults with TLE using clinical variables, long-term video/EEG monitoring, high resolution MRI and tests for depression, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). On the MRI we manually delineated regions of interest in the mesial temporal (hippocampus, amygdala) and prefrontal (gyrus rectus, pregenual cortex, subgenual and subcallosal cortex) structures, based on prior human and animal studies of mood dysfunction. Distribution of the data was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Student's t-test was used to determine group differences, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software. Results: Based on a total BDI score greater than 15, 42.8% of the group were experiencing significant symptoms of depression. None of the subjects in the quartile with the smallest left hippocampal volume had a BDI score greater than 15, whereas 57.1% of the subjects in the upper three quartiles had increased symptoms of depression, p < 0.008. No other brain structure volume had an association with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with hippocampal volume loss that is consistent with severe hippocampal sclerosis had no evidence of significant symptoms of depression. This finding suggests that there is a critical number of hyperexcitable hippocampal neurons required to maintain depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. [figure 1] (Supported by NIH grants NS40808 and NS047551 and Epilepsy Foundation fellowship grant.) 1 Jennifer L. Hopp, 1 Helga Matausch, 1 Jingkun Zhu, and 1 Allan Krumholz ( 1 Neurology, University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Mood and anxiety disorders are common in patients with epilepsy and many hypotheses have been proposed to understand the relationship between emotional dysfunction and seizures. Despite the recognition of this comorbidity, psychiatric disease remains under-recognized in neurology patients. This study was designed to identify the prevalence of depression and anxiety, as well as the co-existence of these symptoms, in patients with epilepsy and examine their impact and relative contribution on health related quality of life (QOL). Methods: 110 consecutive patients in the University of Maryland Medical Center Epilepsy Outpatient Center and Inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) completed Beck Depression Inventory-II? (BDI-II?), Beck Anxiety Inventory? (BAI?) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) measures between December 1, 2005 and May 25, 2006. Patients who completed these questionnaires in the inpatient EMU did so on the day of admission before their medications were changed and prior to any seizure activity. Scores were calculated for each inventory and means were compared using standard t-test calculations. Results: 109 patients completed the BAI and anxiety was noted to be severe in 9% of patients, moderate in 9%, mild in 26%, and minimal in 56% of patients. 98 patients completed the BDI and symptoms suggestive of depression were severe in 7% of patients, moderate in 12%, mild in 16% and minimal in 65%. 88 patients had complete BAI, BDI, and QOLIE-31 data for analysis. When anxiety and depression scores were independently compared with quality of life scores in 88 patients, it was found that lower levels of anxiety and depression were correlated with higher quality of life indices. The most significant reduction in quality of life was seen when comparing BAI and BDI scores between patient groups with minimal versus mild levels of depression and anxiety (table1) (p < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval). QOLIE-31 scores Compared with Level of Anxiety or Depression Minimal Mild Moderate Severe Anxiety 72.3 54.8 54.1 35.6 Depression 72.8 43.6 42.9 36.2 all values represent mean QOLIE-31 scores for each category of symptom severity Conclusions: These findings are supportive of prior data which have noted increased prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with epilepsy. The presence of even mild symptoms of anxiety and depression have a significant impact on quality of life. When the levels of anxiety and depression were simultaneously compared to QOLIE-31 scores, there was a more significant impact on QOL by depression levels than anxiety. These data also suggest the possibility that although more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with reduced QOL, that there may be a low threshold which is important with regard to the effect of depression and anxiety on quality of life in patients with epilepsy. 1 Ruben Kuzniecky, 1 Charles K. Vorkas, 1 Kenneth Alper, 1 Chad Carlson, 1 William Barr, and 1 Orrin Devinsky ( 1 NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY ) Rationale: Postictal psychosis (PIP) is an important behavioral complication of epilepsy and its early recognition is essential for appropriate management. Yet, the risk factors for PIP remain controversial. The majority of studies to date have been relatively small and have largely focused on patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We sought to verify previous findings that correlate PIP with bilateral epileptiform interictal/ictal activity, clustering of seizures, and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a series of 140 patients with complex partial epilepsy undergoing video-EEG (VEEG) monitoring as candidates for epilepsy surgery. These patients were evaluated by structured neurologic and psychiatric interviews by a team of epileptologists and a single neuropsychiatrist (KA). Each patient had at least one MRI prior to surgery. No patient had psychotic symptoms at baseline. 55 of these patients were diagnosed with PIP using the criteria presented in Devinsky et al. [1], which were adapted from the definition provided by Logsdail and Toone [2]. Results: Age, sex, age at onset of epilepsy, and history of febrile seizures were similar in the PIP and control groups. Patients with PIP experienced more generalized slowing (19.6% v 7.0% p < 0.028) and more frequent seizure clusters (>2 seizures in 24 hours) during VEEG monitoring (45.0% v 28.2% p < 0.045). Patients with PIP had more frequent clinical secondary generalization (64.7% v 43.5% p < 0.017), bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (52.9% v 32.9% p < 0.021), and non-localized seizures (54.9% v 23.8% p < 0.001) during monitoring. MRI lesion lateralization was similar in both groups, though patients in the control group had more bilateral focal abnormalities than in the PIP group (12.3% v 4.4 p = ns). More patients in the PIP group had a nonfocal abnormality (11.8% v 2.7% p = ns). Imaging diagnosis of MTS was similar in the PIP and control groups (58.3% v 55.6% p = ns). Conclusions: This retrospective study of PIP is the largest to date. PIP was more frequent in patients with electrophysiologic evidence of bilateral cortical hyperexcitability. No significant correlation was found between PIP and structural abnormalities on MRI. Although the correlation between secondary generalization and seizure clusters suggest an association with ?epilepsy severity,? the presence of independent bilateral seizure onsets was not significant and overall baseline seizure frequency could not be formally evaluated in the population. These findings suggest PIP correlates more with neurophysiologic function than structural anatomy. 1 Devinsky O, Abramson H, Alper K, et al: Postictal psychosis; a case control series of 20 patients and 150 controls. Epilepsy Research 1995; 20(3): 247?253. 2 Logsdail SJ, Toone BK: Postictal psychoses: a clinical and phenomenological description.

Hermann ( 1 Rehabilitation Psychology  2 Psychology, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL ; and 3 Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Depression is a major comorbidity of epilepsy that contributes to unemployment, underemployment, medical expenses, and reduced self-reported quality of life (Bishop et al., 2002). The etiology of depression remains controversial and rarely have causal modeling techniques been used in this literature. The purpose of this study is to test the applicability of Lewinsohn et al.'s (1985) integrative model of depression to epilepsy. This model views depression as the end result of environmentally initiated changes in behavior, affect, and cognition as the primary triggers to episodes of depression. Methods: 100 individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy underwent structured interviews to obtain sociodemographic and epilepsy related information, and completed self-report measures of related handicap (Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy scale), Quality of Life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy-89), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). Path analysis was used to (a) evaluate the general compatibility (i.e., goodness of fit) of the model with the data, and (b) examine relationships between epilepsy related variables, disruptions in daily activities, self-perception, stress, social support, employment status, and depression among individuals with epilepsy. Results: In path analysis, acceptable fit is indicated by a nonsignificant chi-square value (i.e., p > .05; Bollen, 1989), and by comparative fit index (CFI) and normed fit index (NFI) values great than .90 (Tabachnik  2 Clinical Neuroscience, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC ; and 3 Pediatric Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC ) Rationale: The many studies of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) have yet to identify consistent risk factors for its occurrence. Further, no single mechanism has been elucidated. Mortality associated with SUDEP is population dependent. It is difficult to analyze SUDEP in that it occurs relatively infrequently. In this study, SUDEP cases were identified in a clinical practice of 30 years. Generally, all patients are known personally to the investigator (BBW) and the clinical and therapeutic information was similar. Methods: 3096 patient records were accumulated in a single practice between 1974 and 2004. Abstractions were performed on 711 cases including 26 SUDEP cases and 87 other death cases; the remainder are alive. Specific demographic, clinical, seizure, treatment and laboratory information was obtained using a developed abstracted tool. SUDEP cases were matched on gender and 5-year age intervals with 3 controls that have epilepsy and are alive. McNemar tests were performed using SAS. Results: The rate of SUDEP was 4.2 per 1000 person-years. A history of generalized tonic clonic (GTC) seizures was seen more often in the SUDEP group (RR = 5.0, 95% CI 1.90, 13.13). There was a trend towards persons who died of SUDEP being more likely to have ever experienced status epilepticus (p = 0.08). Also, persons with SUDEP were more likely to have more than 1 type of seizure (p < 0.001), be taking more than 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at last visit (p < 0.001), to have ever taken 3+ AEDs (p < 0.001), and to have had a medication change in the 3 months prior to the last visit (p < 0.001). There was also a trend towards childhood onset epilepsy in the SUDEP cohort (p = 0.07). No difference was observed in having a primary generalized epilepsy. Conclusions: The rate of SUDEP is consistent with other published findings from tertiary referral epilepsy clinics. This study included persons who attended a tertiary referral practice, and therefore likely had more severe epilepsy than general neurological populations. Results have also confirmed that cases of SUDEP are more likely to be taking more AEDs currently and in the past, have more than 1 type of seizure, and to have had a medication change within three months of death. It has been documented that type of seizure, mainly GTC, is associated with SUDEP; however, less documented is the type of epilepsy. Specifically, primary generalized epilepsy as JME was found equally in both SUDEP and matched cohorts. Trends towards ever having status epilepticus and childhood onset epilepsy should be explored further when more data is available. (Supported by Epilepsy Services  2 CERMEP, Bron, France ; and 3 EA3092, UCBL, Lyon, France ) Rationale: Depression and epilepsy are comorbid diseases that seem likely to involve common pathophysiological pathways, including serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT1A receptors. Two studies have investigated 5-HT1A receptors in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as a function of depressive symptoms and have shown a negative correlation between the binding potential (BP) of [11C]-WAY100635 (WAY) or [18F]-FCWAY and varying depression scales, though in different brain regions. The aim of our work was to study the relationships between 5-HT1A receptor density and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale in a homogeneous group of patients suffering from TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), using a PET ligand, [18F]MPPF, which affinity differs from WAY and allows displacement by endogenous serotonin. Methods: 21 patients suffering from TLE with HS underwent a [18F]MPPF-PET. Depressive symptoms were evaluated on the day of the PET study using the BDI scale. A simplified model was used to generate parametric images of 5-HT1A receptors binding potential values. Images from patients with a left HS were flipped so that HS were on the same side (right) for all patients. To investigate the association between BP values and BDI scores, we carried out SPM analyses using an ANCOVA design, considering the BDI scores as a covariable of interest, with masks that either included all limbic and paralimbic regions, or the brainstem. In addition, we placed regions of interest (ROIs) over the same brain regions. Results: SPM analyses disclosed a significant positive association between the MPPF BP values and the BDI scores in the insula contralateral to the seizure focus as well as in the raphe nuclei (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively, at the cluster level corrected for multiple comparisons). These results were confirmed by ROI analysis. Conclusions: In contrast with previous WAY-PET studies, we have shown a positive, rather than negative, association between 5-HT1A receptors BP values and the BDI scores, in regions known to be involved in depression (insula, raphe) that also differ from those reported in the previous studies (anterior cingulate, hippocampus). These differences could be partly explained by the lower affinity of MPPF as compared to that of WAY, and reflect decreased level of endogenous 5-HT in the insula and raphe in the more depressed patients.

Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Analysis of the semiology of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) is challenging. Use of the same terminology as that used for epileptic phenomema may be inappropriate for PNES. Groppel et al. suggested a classification based on the analysis of clusters of symptoms and signs. In this study we applied this classification to the analysis in order to analyze its application and possible limitations Methods: We studied the semiology of 27 patients with PNES documented by VEEG. We observed and characterized motor phenomena, classifying them as events with positive motor phenomena (clonic, hypermotor, tremors, pelvic thrusting, lateralized movements, versive, erratic and anomalous movements simulating automatisms, hypertonic posture, retropulsion with or without opistotonus) or as events with negative motor phenomena (loss of tonus, motor arrest, staring, etc). We also evaluated responsiveness, hyperventilation, sound emission and aura. Postictal phenomena and event duration were likewise evaluated. Results: Eight patients were classified as Cluster I (hypermotor and clonic movements of extremities, pelvic thrusting, head movements, tonic head posture ? motor PNES); 4, as Cluster II (limb tremor ? minor motor PNES) and 4 as Cluster III (?atonic PNES?). Six patients had more than one event, with distinct semiology, being classified in two groups. Fifteen NES could not be classified according to these criteria. Among those presenting positive motor phenomena, 4 had Cluster I phenomena associated to tremors (Cluster II), and 3 had Cluster I phenomena associated to automatisms, 2 patients had only automatic movements and 1, had subtle lateralization movements. Not all patients with negative motor phenomena had atonia; 2 had speech arrest, 1 had irresponsiveness, 1 had visual hallucinations, and 2 had irresponsiveness with eye flutter. Ten patients had hyperventilation, 12 with whimpering, and less often, wailing. Loss of responsiveness was observed in 16 patients from this group. Four patients reported aura preceding the event. Postictal confusion with agitation was observed in 6 patients. Twelve patients presented events with prolonged duration. Conclusions: Our study suggested that although the attempt of a categorical classification of PNES, such as that carried out in epileptic seizures and syndromes, may seem quite interesting, it seems to be of little practical use because of the heterogeneity of PNES. PNES do not always present as stereotyped seizures in the same patient and frequently undergoes changes in semiology during its course. Moreover, in the literature there is a tendency to overestimate motor phenomena, when other non-motor features may be just as important for diagnosis of PNES and remain undervalued. Groppel G, et al. Cluster analysis of clinical seizure semiology of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Epilepsia 2000;41(5):610?4. 1 Laura M. Moreno, 1 Gina Mapes Jetter, 1 Susan Rogers, 1 Elizabeth Clark, 1 Jan M. Bruder, and 1 Jose E. Cavazos ( 1 Medicine (Neurology) and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX ) Rationale: Recent studies have shown that some enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) are associated with osteoporosis and an excess number of fractures. 3A4 is the main CYP450 isoenzyme involved in the degradation of active Vitamin D (Vit D) to its inactive form. It is thought that the primary mechanism of this problem is due to an AED induction of the metabolism of Vit D through the CYP450 system. The potential development of osteoporosis might be prevented by the use of Vit D and calcium (Ca) supplements. It is uncertain as to how to treat the Vit D deficiency in epilepsy patients, who often have been taking AEDs for many years. Although maintenance therapy guidelines for those at high risk for developing osteoporosis exist, a more rapid protocol might be useful to normalize Vit D levels. The objective of this study was to determine if replenishment of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (25-OH- D3) levels by a 12-week course of weekly high-dose Ergocalciferol, vitamin D2, will normalize the 25-OH- D3 levels. Methods: The protocol took male patients on AEDs and looked at Vitamin D3, PTH and calcium levels. If the results showed the patient to be deficient in Vitamin D3 (<20 ng/ml with normal iPTH or Vitamin D < 30ng/ml and elevated iPTH), then the patient received Ca supplementation with Ergocalciferol (Ergo) 50,000 IU/week for 12 weeks. In addition, all patients were placed on Oscal 500 + D (Ca 500MG/Vitamin D 200 IU) twice daily. Labs were repeated at 16 weeks, and if Vitamin D3 levels were still low, then the 12-week course of Ergo was repeated. 58 patients, mean age 58 and mean duration of AED therapy 23 years, met this criteria. Results: Analysis showed a difference in Vit D, iPTH, and Ca levels before and after treatment with Ergo. However, only the change in Vit D levels was significant. We further divided into subgroups of EIAEDs, NEIAEDs, and valproic acid (VPA) examining Vit D only. Conclusions: Patients that took a 12-week course of Ergo had a significant increase in 25-OH- D3 levels. Although iPTH trended down and Ca levels increased after Ergo treatment, there was no significant effect seen between the before and after treatment group. Long term follow-up of these labs in this study group is needed to correlate whether the increase in Vit D will decrease the rate of osteoporosis. 1 Before Ergo After Ergo p value Difference 25-OH- D3, PTH,  2 Neurology, Veterans Healthcare System New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM ; 3 Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; and 4 CHQOER, Bedford VA Hospital, Bedford, MA ) Rationale: The incidence of epilepsy is most common in the elderly, and treatment choices may be complicated by physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Studies have not systematically examined the patterns of comorbidities in older patients with new onset epilepsy. Methods: We identified new onset epilepsy patients using national diagnostic and administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare data files and national VA pharmacy data. We first identified individuals who were 65 years or older in each year (2000?2004). Individuals with a first diagnosis (ICD-9 codes) of epilepsy (345) or convulsion (780.39) with a concomitant first prescription for an antiepileptic drug (AED) were classified as having new onset epilepsy. Of those older veterans with both a diagnosis of epilepsy and a concomitant AED (n = 69,494), 9,234 met the criteria for new onset epilepsy. We then identified the common comorbid conditions that may affect treatment patterns. Results: The cohort of new onset epilepsy patients was primarily male (98%), White (78%; 16% Black, 5% Hispanic) with a mean age of 75.1 years. On average, these individuals had 11 physical comorbidities and slightly less than one psychiatric comorbidity. Approximately 30% had a prior stroke and 16% had a history of transient ischemic attacks. This group was also substantially affected by metabolic syndrome: 92% hypertension, 52% type 2 diabetes, and 68% hypercholesterolemia. Psychiatric comorbidities included depression (22%), psychosis (18%) and anxiety (13%). On average these patients received 17 (SD = 8.8) unique classes of drugs in addition to their AEDs, including many that pose potential interactions with older AEDs (e.g. warfarin, statins). Conclusions: The comorbidity profile of this populations indicates that they have profound comorbid disease. Diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and coagulopathy are commonly treated with drugs that have been found interact with older enzyme inducing AEDs. We know that over 80% of these patients received these older, enzyme inducing AEDs (65% phenytoin; 5% phenobarbital, 10% carbamazepine) Further research is needed to determine the extent to which drug-drug interactions occurred, and the impact of these interactions. It is possible that treatment with older, less expensive AEDs is offset by hidden costs that occur as a result of drug-drug interactions (e.g. higher mortality due to subsequent stroke or MI for patients treated with statins and who receive little benefit due to the drug-drug interaction) or hip fractures that may occur due to osteoporosis that has been associated with chronic use of enzyme inducing AEDs. Much research is needed to explore these hypotheses. (Supported by Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Services Research and Development Service.) 1 Dalin T. Pulsipher, 2 Jana Jones, 1 Christian Dow, 2 Bruce Hermann, 1 Michael Seidenberg, and 2 Bell Brian ( 1 Psychology, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine  and 2 Neurology, University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison, Madison, WI ) Rationale: There is an extensive literature examining quality of life (QOL) among individuals with epilepsy. Some clinical seizure variables (eg, seizure frequency, age of onset, duration of epilepsy) have been shown to influence QOL. Psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., depression) are reliably and strongly associated with decreased QOL. Recent studies have documented high rates of medical comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, cancer) among people with epilepsy compared to healthy controls, but their impact on QOL has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between comorbidities (medical and psychiatric) and QOL in a sample of adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: 93 adult patients with TLE were administered the QOLIE-89. Medical history was obtained through structured patient/collateral interviews and chart review. All subjects underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV which provided a current DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of clinical seizure variables and comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions to QOL. Results: 49.5% (n = 46) of the TLE patients reported the presence of a medical comorbidity, psychiatric comorbidity, or both. 19 (20%) subjects had only a medical comorbidity, 16 (17%) subjects had only a current Axis I psychiatric comorbidity, and 12 (13%) subjects had both. An increased total number of comorbid conditions were significantly associated with poorer QOL. Regression analyses demonstrated that the total number of comorbidities (ß= 3.79, t = 4.06, p < .01) was the strongest predictor of overall QOL, followed by education (ß= .95, t = 2.35, p = .02). Clinical seizure variables did not significantly predict QOL. In addition, a stepwise regression analysis showed that both psychiatric (ß= 4.46, t = 2.68, t < .01) and medical comorbidities (ß= 2.97, t = 2.24, p = .03) were distinct and unique predictors of overall QOL. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, we found that comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions were common in patients with TLE. The total number of combined medical and psychiatric comorbid conditions significantly predicted QOL after accounting for basic demographic and clinical seizure variables. This is the first study to date to examine the impact of medical comorbidities on QOL in TLE. The high rates of medical comorbidity observed in this and other studies should alert clinicians to the potential significance of their impact on QOL.

Rodriguez ( 1 Department of Neurology, NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY ) Rationale: Several studies have shown that sleep complaints are more common in epilepsy patients when compared to normal controls from the general population. The specific sleep complaints of an epilepsy patient may be different than those of a person without epilepsy seen in a sleep disorder center. This difference would have significant implications to the approach of treating epilepsy patients with a sleep disorder. Comparing the sleep complaints of epilepsy and non-epilepsy patients seen in consultation at a sleep disorders center could show this difference. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients seen for initial consultation at the New York Sleep Institute over a 5 month period. All patients over 18 years of age were included. A total of 112 patients met these criteria, 39 in the epilepsy group and 73 in the control group. For each patient, information was collected from the initial consultation report written by a Board Certified Sleep Specialist. The data included basic demographic information, reason for referral, other sleep complaints, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, co-morbidities (including if they have been diagnosed with epilepsy based on the International League Against Epilepsy criteria), medication history, family history, social history and Body Mass Index (BMI). The data was analyzed using Pearson chi-square analysis for categorical data and t-test for continuous variables. Results: The chief complaint/reason for referral to the sleep institute was noted to be statistically different between the epilepsy group and the controls, via Pearson's chi-square analysis (p = 0.0035). In the epilepsy group, 48.7% had a chief complaint of insomnia, compared to 26.0% in the control group (p = 0.0157). Snoring was more common in the control group (34% vs. 18%) and subjective EDS was more common in epilepsy group (31% vs. 22%). From the interview, all sleep disturbances that were afflicting each patient were recorded. Of these sleep disturbances, only difficulty falling asleep (Insomnia subtype) was significantly different between the two groups (56% of the epilepsy patients, 25% of controls, p = 0.0012). Subjective EDS, snoring, un-refresing sleep, restlessness in legs and difficulty staying asleep were statistically equally frequent between the groups. Conclusions: Insomnia is the prevailing chief complaint in patients with epilepsy that present to a sleep disorder center. Over all complaints, difficulty failing asleep was most identifying with the epilepsy patients. Both of these problems were significantly different from the ones seen in patients without epilepsy. 1 Vivianne P. Rosa, 1 Gerardo Maria De AraújoFilho, 1 Katia Lin, 1 Luís Otávio Sales Ferreira Caboclo, and 1 Elza Márcia T. Yacubian ( 1 Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S?o Paulo/UNIFESP, S?o Paulo, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: The complex relationship between temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and psychiatric disorders (PD) has been matter of interest, and important studies have emphasized this association. PD compromise patients' quality of life. Few studies, however, studied the frequency of PD in patients presenting the same etiology of TLE. We evaluated the frequency of PD in a homogenous series of patients with refractory TLE related to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) aiming to determine the frequency of PD and possible correlations with clinical variables as well as laterality and degree of atrophy in volumetric MRI measures. Methods: Data from 106 patients with refractory TLE related to MTS accompanied at the outpatient epilepsy clinic of Universidade Federal de S?o Paulo, Brazil, from March 2005 to May 2006 were reviewed. The psychiatric evaluation was based on axis I DSM-IV criteria and on Bear and Fedio Inventory (BFI). For statistical analysis, the X2 test and Student's T test were used. P value considered significant was < 0.05. Results: Sixty-one females and 45 males were evaluated. The mean age and mean duration of the disease were 39.5 ± 13.4 and 24 ± 11.3 years, respectively. The mean age at epilepsy onset was 19.0 ± 12.8 years. MTS occurred more frequently on left side (72 cases; 68%), followed by right side (30 cases; 28.3%) and by 4 cases of bilateral MTS (3.7%). The hippocampus were significantly smaller (p < 0.05) in the side of the epileptogenic zone. Carbamazepine and phenytoin were the most used single drugs, and their association to a benzodiazepine, mostly clobazam, the most common association. PD were found in 65 patients (61.3%). Humor disorders were the most frequent (32 cases; 30%), followed by interictal (15 cases; 14%) and postictal (10 cases; 9.4%) psychosis. Twelve patients performed criteria for 2 axis I disorders, and the most frequently found association was major depression and postictal psychosis (7 cases), related to left MTS. Postictal and interictal psychosis were significantly associated with left side (p < 0.05), while PD in general and humor disorders were not associated to any side. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of PD in patients with refractory TLE associated to MTS. The most common were humor and psychotic disorders. Psychosis was significantly associated to left side. These findings are concordant with data in current literature relating the prevalence of PD in TLE, confirming the existence of anatomic alterations, and also a possible left laterality effect in the mesial temporal lobe structures in patients with epileptic psychosis.

Farias, 1 Julie Jorgensen, and 1 Masud Seyal ( 1 Neurology, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA ) Rationale: Depression in epilepsy is common and a powerful indicator of the quality of life. Yet neurologists do not routinely screen epilepsy patients for depression in the clinic setting. In a busy neurology practice, where the major focus is seizure control, it is likely that symptoms of depression may be missed. The PHQ-9 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire based on current DSM-IV criteria that has been validated in several patient populations. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or higher have high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing major depression. Utilizing the PHQ-9, we sought to determine the frequency of depression in patients with epilepsy and to correlate patient characteristics with the degree of depression. Methods: 263 patients seen in a tertiary referral epilepsy clinic over a 6-month period were asked to complete the questionnaire. Depression scores were assessed in relation to seizure frequency; epilepsy diagnosis; antidepressant and antiepileptic drug usage. Differences across patients were compared using ANOVA. Results: Nearly one-third of patients (29.3%) had scores consistent with major depression. Seizure-free patients had lower depression scores (mean score 5.1, s.d. 5.4; median score 3) than those with persistent seizures (mean score 8.1, s.d. 6.2; median score 7) (p = 0.003). Patients with non-epileptic psychogenic seizures had higher scores than those with localization related epilepsy, idiopathic generalized epilepsy or with symptomatic generalized epilepsy (Difference across groups significant p = 0.044). Depression scores were not related to the number or type of anti-epileptic drugs used. Patients currently taking antidepressant drugs had higher scores than those not on antidepressant drugs (p < 0.001). Just over one-half of patients with major depression were not on antidepressant medication. Conclusions: In patients with epilepsy, major depression was detected at a rate similar to that reported previously using ?gold-standard? instruments. The PHQ-9 is a sensitive measure of depression in this population. The brevity of this instrument is conducive to routine screening of patients with epilepsy. Depression is under-recognized in this group of patients. Over half the patients with major depression were not on antidepressant drugs. Depression is associated with persistent seizures rather than the type of epilepsy or antiepileptic drugs. [figure 1] (Supported by Department of Neurology, University of California, Davis.) 1 Sadat A. Shamim, 2 Gregor Hasler, 1 Kathleen Kelley, and 1 William H. Theodore ( 1 Clinical Epilepsy, NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD ; and 2 NIMH, NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: To evaluate the relationship between hippocampal volume loss, depression, and epilepsy. Background: There is a significantly increased incidence of depression and suicide in patients with epilepsy. Both epilepsy and depression are associated with reduced hippocampal volumes, but it is uncertain whether patients with both conditions have greater atrophy than those with epilepsy alone. Previous studies used depression measures strongly weighted to current state, and did not necessarily assess the influence of chronic major depressive disorder (?trait?), which could have a greater impact on hippocampal volume. Methods: Sixty-one epilepsy patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) confirmed by ictal video-EEG had 3D spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (spgr) with 1.5 mm slice MRI Scans. These were loaded into a linux based system, hippocampi were manually traced on each slice, and then assembled into 3 dimensional volumes. The anterior head of the hippocampus was separated from the amygdala by the appearance of the inferior limb of the lateral ventricle. The hippocampus was traced superiorly around the choroidal fissure, curving laterally along the medial border of the temporal horn, and medially along the gray matter of the hippocampus up to its junction with the parahippocampal gyrus. Depression screening was performed with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, 56 patients) and with the structured clinical inventory for DSM-IV (SCID, 36 patients). For the BDI, a score above 10 was considered mild to moderate, above 20 moderate to severe, and above 30 severe depression. MRI and clinical analysis were performed blinded to other data. Statistical analysis was performed with Systat (Point Richmond CA) using Student's T-test and analysis of variance. Results: SCID evaluation revealed 20 patients with and 16 without depression. BDI revealed 24 and 32, respectively. There was no relationship between the right or left hippocampal volumes and depression for either measure. There was a clear and expected relationship between hippocampal volume and the side of the seizure focus (p = 0.001). However, this was not affected by the presence of depression based on SCID or BDI. Conclusions: We found no significant effect of depression, using measures of train as well as state, on hippocampal volume in patients with CPS. The high rate of comorbidity may be better evaluated with measures of cellular function rather than by anatomic imaging of the hippocampus.

Miller ( 1 University of Washington Regional Epilepsy Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Comorbidity (CO) of both epileptic (ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic (PNES) seizures in the same patient is well documented. Less well studied is the effort required to reach this diagnosis, and the yield from additional days of monitoring. Methods: We identified 36 adult patients (64% female) with video-EEG confirmed ES and PNES events, from all long term monitorings performed at the UW Regional Epilepsy Center from mid-1999 to 2006. ES was defined as having definite ictal EEG abnormalities, while PNES was defined as episodes of unresponsiveness or abnormal motor activity in the absence of an electrographic seizure. For a diagnosis of CO, both types of events had to be captured during one or more video-EEG monitorings. Mean age at time of final diagnosis was 33 years (SD = 11). Results: The mean number of monitorings required to diagnose CO was 1.6 (SD = 0.9; median = 1.0; range = 1?5). Average number of required monitoring days (across one or more admissions) was 6.0 (SD = 4.0; range = 2?21). The mean number of discrete unequivocal events recorded before reaching a diagnosis of CO was 6.2 (SD = 6.9; median = 4.0; range = 2?35). Elapsed time between a patient's first recorded event and a diagnosis of CO averaged 3.8 days (SD = 4.0; range = 0?20). For the 50% of patients whose initial event was a PNES spell, elapsed time to an epileptic seizure averaged 2.6 days of additional monitoring (SD = 1.7; range = 0?5). In contrast, patients who initially experienced an epileptic seizure required nearly twice this time to convert from an exclusive diagnosis of ES to CO (M = 5.1 days; SD = 5.2; range = 1?20). Twelve of the 36 patients underwent surgery for intractable ES, with 42% experiencing their first PNES event after surgery. Conclusions: Most patients with verified comorbid diagnoses of ES and PNES events require relatively few monitorings to document both. In the current data, a comorbid diagnosis was reached in 90% of the sample in two or fewer monitoring admissions cumulatively totaling eight days or less. A full 64% of the sample was diagnosed with CO in only one monitoring admission. Perhaps of greatest clinical utility is the observation that 83% of patients who initially presented with a PNES event went on to have an unequivocal epileptic seizure within four monitoring days of their initial spell. Thus, when a diagnosis of epilepsy is strongly suspected in a patient who initially presents with a PNES event, evidence suggests that allowing several more monitoring days in selected patients can yield clinically useful data critical to appropriate patient care. Additionally, there was a subgroup of patients who developed PNES following surgical resection of an epileptic focus. Prediction of which patients warrant additional admissions or monitoring days remains to be determined, but is critical to efforts to reduce length of stay, without compromising quality of care. 1 Joanne M. Wrench, 1 Sarah J. Wilson, 2 Peter F. Bladin, and 3 David C. Reutens ( 1 School of Behavioural Science, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia ; 2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Austin Health, Melbourne, Vic, Australia ; and 3 Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Vic, Australia ) Rationale: Patients undergoing temporal lobectomy are at risk of developing de novo depression after surgery despite good seizure outcome. Neurobiological predictors of de novo depression largely remain unknown. Previous research has indicated that patients with Major Depression have smaller hippocampi than controls. We explored whether this finding was also true for epilepsy surgery patients by examining the relationships between pre-operative hippocampal volumes, seizure outcome, and de novo depression after epilepsy surgery. Methods: The sample comprised 42 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery in the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Austin Hospital (26 mesial temporal lobe resections and 16 non-mesial temporal resections). Patients were prospectively assessed pre-operatively, and at discharge, one, three, six, and 12 months post-operatively. Assessment included a semi-structured clinical interview (Austin CEP Interview) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Hippocampal volumetry was conducted on patients' preoperative T(1)-weighted MRI scans and on 41 neurologically normal controls following stereotactic normalisation of the images. Results: Post-operatively, 42% of mesial temporal patients and 19% of non-mesial patients were depressed within the first 12 months after surgery. The occurrence of depression was associated with significantly smaller hippocampi contralateral to the resection in the mesial temporal group (p = 0.003). This effect was also seen in mesial temporal patients who developed de novo depression after surgery (p = 0.027). Contralateral hippocampi were particularly small in patients suffering from both depression and seizures post-operatively (p = 0.031). Furthermore, there were significant negative correlations between contralateral hippocampal volumes and BDI-II scores at one and three months post-operatively (r =?0.46 and r =?0.42 respectively, p < 0.05). There were no significant findings between depression, seizure outcome, and hippocampal volumes in the non-mesial group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the hippocampus is a structural marker of vulnerability to post-operative depression, particularly in the presence of post-operative seizures. They also indicate that a smaller hippocampus predates the onset of depression. 1 Miya R. Asato, 1 Patricia K. Crumrine, 1 Enami Yasui, and 1 Beatriz Luna ( 1 Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; and Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institutes and Clinics, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: While the elevated risk for psychopathology in pediatric epilepsy has long been recognized, the relationship between brain function and the risk for psychiatric comorbidity has not been well studied. These initial results are from an ongoing prospective study of different seizure subtypes of well-characterized medically treated pediatric epilepsy patients and matched controls. These children performed a battery of neurocognitive tests, diagnostic psychiatric interviewing, and tasks of cognitive control of behavior using oculomotor tasks. Methods: We report results from 12 pairs of pediatric epilepsy patients and age, gender, and IQ matched control subjects. From the 12 pairs studied up to the present, the average age of the children was 11.92 years (SD 3.2), and gender was split evenly between males and females. Mean IQ of the patient group was 96.5 (SD 11.9) and duration of disease was 3.5 years. Epilepsy type in the patient group was classified as complex partial (n = 8), primary generalized (n = 2), and benign focal epilepsy (n = 2) based on EEG data and clinical semiology. All patients except one were being treated with anticonvulsants. Control subjects were free of psychiatric diagnoses, and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Participants completed cognitive control oculomotor tasks including a test of sensorimotor control (visually guided saccade task) and a test of response inhibition (antisaccade). Oculomotor tasks are objective, non-verbal measures of executive function which are easily performed by children, and have been successfully used to study cognitive and brain systems in children with typical development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Comprehensive psychiatric assessment including a diagnostic psychiatric interview (KSADs -PL) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Results: The rate of psychiatric diagnoses in the epilepsy patient group was elevated at 50% including attention deficit disorder (n = 5) and depression (n = 1). There were no psychiatric diagnoses in the control population. Preliminary results of the oculomotor tasks demonstrate that all 24 children performed well on the control task, indicating intact basic sensorimotor function. Children with epilepsy commited more response inhibition errors on the antisaccade task compared to controls (p = 0.06), indicating a deficit in response inhibition. Results from the BRIEF, a parent and teacher report of executive functioning indicate a significant correlation between poorer functioning and having psychiatric comorbidity (p < 0.001). Conclusions: As part of an ongoing study to evaluate cognitive processes at risk due to epilepsy mediated effects, these results indicate a neurobiologically linked relationship between executive functioning and psychiatric comorbidity.

Perkins ( 1 School of Nursing, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ; and 2 Division of Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Adaptive functioning refers to the physical, social, and communication skills necessary for functioning in daily life. We could find no study that described adaptive functioning in children with both epilepsy and mild intellectual disability (ID). Some authors suggest that measuring adaptive functioning is more important than measuring intelligence because adaptive functioning reflects actual behavior in the context of daily life and may be amenable to intervention. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship of adaptive functioning to behavior problems in a population of children with both epilepsy and mild developmental disability. Methods: To measure adaptive functioning, parents completed structured interviews using the Vineland Adaptive Functioning Scale (VABS). To measure behavior problems, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: The sample was 49 children (24 girls and 25 boys) ages 9?16 years (M = 12.3) who had both epilepsy and mild ID. The mean estimated IQ was 73.5 (SD = 17.8). The mean age of seizure onset was 5.3 years and the mean duration was 7.0 years. About half (53%) of the children had two seizure types and 46% were receiving more than one AED. The CBCL scores showed high rates of behavior problems; total (M = 66.36, SD = 8.86), internalizing (M = 64.21, SD = 11.26), and externalizing (M = 60.19, SD = 10.78). The mean VABS scores were approximately 2 standard deviations below the norm scores for the general population; total (M = 60.69, SD = 11.12), communication (M = 60.12, SD = 12.94), daily living (M = 68.67, SD = 16.41), and socialization (M = 68.42, SD = 15.40). There was a trend for the VABS total adaptive functioning score to be negatively correlated with CBCL total behavior problems score (p = .09). The VABS daily living skills score was negatively correlated with CBCL total behavior problems score (p = .05), and CBCL externalizing score (p = .02). VABS socialization and communication scores were not significantly correlated with CBCL total scores. Conclusions: This pilot study showed an association between more behavior problems and poorer adaptive functioning in children with epilepsy and mild intellectual disability. Specifically, total behavior scores were correlated with both total adaptive functioning and daily living skills. Our findings are similar to those in other studies of children with mild ID and chronic disorders other than epilepsy. Our pilot study provided foundational information regarding overall adaptive functioning and behavior in children with both epilepsy and mild ID. (Supported by NR 04536.) 1 Tara Clarke, 1 Bhavna Bali, 1 Lisa J. Strug, 1 Peregrine L. Murphy, and 1 Deb K. Pal ( 1 Epidemiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY ) Rationale: An association between Rolandic epilepsy and migraine headache has been suggested in previous case series (Bladin, 1987), and controlled studies are conflicting (Santucci, 1985;Giroud, 1989). It has further been suggested that the two diagnoses share etiological background. We therefore tested the hypothesis that migraine headaches are over-represented in children with Rolandic epilepsy. Methods: We performed an unmatched case-control study. We collected 44 cases of strictly defined Rolandic epilepsy with oro-facial seizures, median age 9 years, sex ratio 3:2, M:F from pediatric neurology clinics. We collected 92 control children lacking a primary brain diagnosis, median age 9 years, from other subspecialty clinics at the same hospitals. We made a clinical diagnosis of migraine using features in the history that include those required for the International Headache Society criteria, but with modifications for childhood as proposed by Maytal et al 1997. We calculated odds ratios of association, adjusted for age and sex, using multiple logistic regression. Results: 17% of cases and 17% of controls had a clinical diagnosis of migraine without aura. No subject was diagnosed with other migraine variants. When adjusted for age and sex, the odds ratio was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.57?1.52). Conclusions: The prevalence of migraine in controls was comparable to that reported in meta-analysis estimates (Scher, 1999). The prevalence of migraine in Rolandic epilepsy cases is no different than in controls without a primary brain diagnosis. Our finding of no association is in agreement with a previous controlled study (Santucci, 1985). In contrast, previous uncontrolled reports have suggested that migraine occurs in 62?80% of children with Rolandic epilepsy. Our results suggest that previous reports may have overestimated the prevalence of migraine in Rolandic epilepsy patients, and hence concluded an association. Although our findings do not support the idea that migraine is over-represented in Rolandic epilepsy, this does not exclude the possibility of an association with other focal epilepsies, or the possibility that shared etiological mechanisms pertain for migraine and epilepsy.

Davies, and 1 Susan Malmquist ( 1 Research, Autism Spectrum Treatment and Research Center, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Seattle Pacific University, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Previous research has recognized the frequent association of epilepsy and autism (7%-42%; Tuchman, 2000). Debate has ensued whether a causal relationship exists between EEG epileptiform abnormalities and autistic regression in the absence of clinical seizures. AED use with autistic children has suggested benefits in areas of hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression, and affective instability associated with autism (Hollander, 2001; Rugino, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether autistic children with EEG epileptiform abnormalities treated with levetiracetam would show improvement in certain core features of autism. Methods: Participants were 9 boys and 2 girls, ages 3 to 11 years (M= 6.43) with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and with epileptiform discharges on EEG. Multiple baseline and outcomes measures evaluating core features in autism were employed, including daily behavioral diaries assessing social interaction, emotional response, awareness, expressive language, receptive language, play/imagination, body movement, rigid/habitual behaviors, and other behaviors. Study design was a 24-week, open label, non-forced titration of levetiracetam with initial daily dose of 10 mg/kg/d and target dose of 60 mg/kg/d. Baseline concommitant medications were not considered reason for exclusion. Results: Ten (91%) children had a formal diagnosis of autism; one of Aspergers. Incidence of regressive sybtype was overrepresented (64%) compared to expected (30?39%). Early termination occured in 6 of 11, primarily due to aggression and emotionality seen at higher doses. Curvilinear analysis suggested the maximum benefit was at lower doses (5?10/mg/kg) in 7 of 11 children. No serious adverse events were observed and all side effects reversed with discontinuance of medication. Preliminary results from daily behavioral diaries indicate positive trends in awareness (10 of 11). Differential results for regressive subtype suggest benefit in the domain of play/imagination (6 of 7). Participants with EEG patterns of left focal epileptiform discharges and bifrontal sharps evidenced positive trends in the area of expressive language (5 of 6, and 2 of 2, respectively). Children with right focal discharges experienced negative effects in expressive language (3 of 3). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest levetiracetam is safe in children with ASD and EEG epileptiform abnormalities, and that certain behavioral domains of autism may benefit from low doses. Increasing dose did not correspond to increased performance, and resulted in a higher incidence of early termination from the study. Epileptiform discharges involving the dominant hemisphere may predict benefit in the domain of expressive language. These results warrant further investigation targeting concepts of EEG abnormaility and language effects with levetiracetam. (Supported by UCB Pharma, Inc.) 1 Jana E. Jones, 2 Christian Dow, 1 Raj Sheth, 3 Monica Koehn, 1 Ryann Watson, 3 Rochelle Caplan, 2 Michael Seidenberg, and 1 Bruce P. Hermann ( 1 Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ; 2 Psychology, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL ; 3 Psychiatry, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 4 Neurology, Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, WI ) Rationale: Among children with recent onset idiopathic epilepsies (age 8?18), a subset have been found to exhibit learning and education problems prior to the first recognized seizure. These children exhibit greater abnormalities in neuropsychological status as well as left hemisphere MRI volumetrics compared to children with recent onset epilepsy without problematic educational histories and healthy controls. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of children with new onset epilepsy sustained an antecedent neurobiolgical insult affecting brain function and structure. The degree to which comorbid mental health problems may also be overrepresented in this at risk cohort remains to be determined and represents the focus of this investigation. Methods: Subjects were children age 8?18 with recent onset (diagnosed within the past 12 months) epilepsy of idiopathic etiology (n = 51). Participants and their parents underwent a standardized psychiatric interview to characterize DSM-IV diagnoses (K-SADS). Structured interview identified 35 children with no history of academic problems (AP-) and 16 children with prior (pre-epilepsy onset) academic problems (AP+) that included either special education, special assistance in reading and math, mandatory summer school, tutors, or grade retention. Results: AP+ children exhibited significantly elevated rates of lifetime-to-date Axis I disorders of any type compared to AP- children (93.8% vs. 60.0%, p < .01). There were higher rates of externalizing disorders (62.5% vs. 11.4%, p < .001), including ADHD (26.4% vs. 10%) and conduct disorders (12.5% vs. 0.0%, p < .05). A majority of the AP+ children (62.5%) exhibited psychiatric comorbidity prior to the first recognized seizure. Internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety) were not overrepresented in AD+ children. Conclusions: Children with academic problems (AP+) antedating epilepsy onset also exhibit an increased rate of psychiatric comorbidity, especially externalizing disorders which includes ADHD and conduct disorders. This emerging pattern of pre-epilepsy onset learning and psychiatric disorders as well as MR volumetric abnormalities is consistent with a presumed antecedent neurobiological insult independent of seizures, epilepsy syndrome, and medication treatment. Evidence of early learning problems and psychiatric comorbidity needs to be integrated in models of the development and course of epilepsy in children and adolescents.

The single pediatric study conducted to date found NEE in 15.2% of the children (Kotagal 2002). These included stereotyped and paroxysmal movements, hypnic jerks, parasomnias, Sandifer syndrome, inattention and conversion disorder. Epilepsy was found in 19?25% of the middle childhood and adolescent cases. Methods: A chart review was conducted on all children under 18 years with NEE during long term videotelemetry at UCLA between 2000 and 2005. Patients with auras were excluded from this study since it is unclear whether these spells were NEE or not. Information gathered included ethnicity, gender, age at time of telemetry admission, history of psychiatric illness, type of medications, history of epilepsy, history of developmental delay, EEG ictal data (if the patient had a seizure), and type of NEE. Type of NEE was categorized as arousal/sleep myoclonus, abdominal complaints (reflux), apnea, psychiatric disorders (psychosis, impulse control disorder, conversion disorder), movement disorders (tics, dystonia, tremors, myoclonus) and staring. Results: 469 of the 1509 telemetry admissions had NEE. Among these 469 patients, 150 had movement disorders, 112 sleep related issues, 107 staring, 16 gastrointestinal related issues, 16 apnea (mainly breath holding spells), and 8 headaches. Many had different types of NEE noted in the same procedure. 128 patients had a psychiatric diagnosis with a conversion disorder in 31 and impulse control disorders psychosis, masturbation or enuresis in the remaining 97 children. Of those with conversion disorders, 13 were female and 18 male ranging in age from 3?18 years (mean 12.87 yrs). The ethnic distribution was similar to that of the greater Los Angeles community. 14 children had a past history of epilepsy and 3 had documented epileptic seizures during the same telemetry. Six patients had no medication treatment for epilepsy or psychiatric condition prior to the telemetry, 3 had treatment for a psychiatric condition and 25 had treatment for seizures. 12 patients had a prior psychiatric history of depression (2), bipolar disorder (1), psychosis (5), attention deficit disorder (2), and autism (2). 9 patients had a history of mild mental retardation or learning disability. Conclusions: Unlike Kotagal et al. (2002), 31% of our telemetry patients had NEE. 27% had comorbid psychiatric disorders with conversion disorder in 7% of all telemetry cases. There also was a higher rate of previous epilepsy (45%) and past psychiatric history (39%) in the NEE cases associated with conversion disorder. The high rate and marked morbidity of this disorder highlights the importance of further studies to identify neurocognitive and socioeconomic factors that increase the risk of children with epilepsy for this disease. 1 Jay A. Salpekar, 1 Marian J. Kolodgie, 1 Audrey Scully, 1 Leia Foster, 1 Andrew Renuart, and 1 Joan A. Conry ( 1 Center for Neuroscience and Behavioral Medicine, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ) Rationale: Pediatric epilepsy patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are challenging both in terms of epilepsy treatment and behavioral comorbidity. Behavioral and psychiatric characteristics in this population are also difficult to isolate given the potential masking of psychiatric symptoms by intrinsic characteristics of IDD. IDD patients have been perceived to have limited ability to swallow pills and thus have restricted treatment options. Our goal was to characterize behavioral problems in a study population with epilepsy and moderate-severe IDD and to assess behavioral outcomes through the clinical trial. Methods: Pediatric epilepsy patients with IDD were recruited to participate in a clinical trial involving transition from Depakote? sprinkle medication to extended release tablets. A clinical evaluation, CBCL, and adaptive behavior rating scales were completed initially and at the conclusion of the eight week trial. Patients underwent a protocol to instruct them on swallowing pills. Parents completed CBCLs and category scores were deemed clinically significant for t scores of 65 or greater. Results: Ten patients with pediatric epilepsy and IDD were recruited (average age 11.1; 6 male) for the dosage conversion study. Adaptive functioning scales and/or documented IQ levels revealed all participants to be well within the moderately mentally retarded range (IQ approx. 40?60). Two patients were nonverbal, but could accomplish many activities of daily living with assistance. At the initial visit, 8/10 subjects had at least one CBCL narrow band category score in the clinically significant range. Seven subjects had completed behavioral measures and one subject had dropped out at the time of this analysis. Of the seven completers, five had at least one category score that improved, and three had at least one category score that worsened. Three patients had improvement in thought problems, two had improved attention, and none of the sample worsened in these two categories. Two patients had worse scores in somatic concerns. Conclusions: We did not expect significant behavior change in this study that focused upon medication dosage form conversion; however, some specific aspects of behavior improved with the transition to once daily Depakote? extended release tablets. Thought processing and attention were improved in some subjects and did not worsen for any subject. Somatic concerns increased in two subjects and may be related to preoccupation with pill swallowing. It is notable that in this severely impaired population, once daily medication was successfully used and may have benefits for behavior function in addition to facilitating easier adherence to treatment.

Eyrl ( 1 Neurosciences, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada ; 2 Community NeuroRehab Services, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 3 Neurosciences, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada ) Rationale: ADHD is a frequent comorbid condition in pediatric epilepsy, especially in tertiary care centers. In a large sample of children with epilepsy, we aimed to determine (1) the prevalence of ADHD symptoms, (2) neurological and epilepsy-related risk factors for ADHD, 3) the influence of intellectual deficits on the expression of ADHD in epilepsy, and 4) the extent to which ADHD symptoms pose a risk for poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and restrictions in daily activities in children with epilepsy. We also explored whether there was an epilepsy-specific presentation of ADHD in children with epilepsy. Methods: Data from the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-IV) from 203 cases (mean age = 11.8, SD = 3.8) from a tertiary centre serving children with severe epilepsy were reviewed. The majority of children had focal symptomatic epilepsy, with a median seizure frequency of 3 seizures per month and median age at onset of 2.5 years. Results: Clinically significant problems with Inattention were more frequent than problems with Hyperactivity-Impulsivity (40% of children vs. 18%). About 2/3 of the sample met screening criteria for either ADHD-I or ADHD-C, with equal representation of both subtypes. Age of onset, epilepsy duration, and intractability did not predict ADHD symptoms or subtype, but ADHD-I was more prevalent in localization-related epilepsies, and there was a trend for higher medication load in this subgroup. Severity of ADHD symptoms was inversely related to HRQOL. Overall, ADHD-C children were younger, had low functional levels, had the poorest HRQOL and the most restrictions in daily activities. No gender difference in the prevalence of ADHD subtypes was seen. Conclusions: Children seen at tertiary care centres for severe epilepsy are at high risk for attention problems and ADHD. The clinical characteristics of ADHD occurring in the context of epilepsy differ significantly from the known characteristics of children with primary ADHD, raising questions about the validity of using the DSM-IV-based criteria and the notion of comorbidity to describe what may be an epilepsy-specific disturbance in children with severe epilepsy.

Ritter ( 1 Epilepsy, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, P.A. of United Hospital and Children's Hospitals and Clinics ? St. Paul, St. Paul, MN ; and 2 Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Pediatric epilepsy patients are at risk for cognitive and mental health problems. Previously, we found suicidal ideation (SI) was more prevalent in hospitalized pediatric patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or both PNES and epileptic seizures (MIX) than those with epileptic seizures alone (ES). Currently, our objective is to describe the occurrence of SI as it relates to cognitive functioning, age, and seizure diagnosis in a sample of pediatric epilepsy patients. Methods: Records of 162 children admitted to an inpatient epilepsy unit from 9/99?4/06 for video-EEG monitoring were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included evaluation by a psychologist during the hospitalization, diagnosis of ES, PNES or MIX by a neurologist, and IQ data obtained from within 5 years of the hospitalization. Those with IQ below 40 and those with physiologic nonepileptic events were excluded. All epileptic seizure types were grouped together. Data were analyzed using T-Tests for Independent Measures, ANOVAs, Chi-Squares, and Partial Correlations. Results: 47% of the sample was male. 125 had ES, 20 had PNESs, and 17 had MIX. Gender was equally distributed across seizure groups. ANOVA indicated those with ES were younger (mean = 12 yrs; p < .01) than those with MIX (mean = 14 yrs) and IQs were similar across the three seizure groups (ES mean = 79, PNES mean = 89, and MIX mean = 80). 20% of the sample reported SI. This included 18% of ES (n = 23), 24% of MIX (n = 4), and 30% of PNES (n = 6). Chi-square analyses showed a non-significant but clear trend toward higher SI in those with PNES/MIX than ES. T-Tests showed those with SI were older (mean = 13 yrs) and with higher IQ (mean = 87) than those without SI (mean age = 12 yrs, p < .05; mean IQ = 79, p < .01). Correlations confirmed the relationship between SI and IQ (p < .01) and between SI and age (p < .05). However, age and seizure group were also significantly correlated (p < .01). A partial correlation holding the seizure group constant eliminated significance from the age-SI relationship. Conclusions: In this selective sample, IQ was related to SI, with IQs closer to the average range showing higher occurrence of SI. A trend of higher SI in PNES/MIX was notable, similar to our previous study that indicated a robust relationship between SI and PNES/MIX in a larger sample. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of PNES and an average IQ may increase risk for SI in pediatric epilepsy patients. This study is limited by patient selection factors. Nonetheless, this report represents progress towards determining key factors in identifying pediatric epilepsy patients at highest risk for SI. Further study of this important issue is clearly warranted. 1 Sigride Thome-Souza, 1 Evelyn Kuczynski, 2 Patricia Rzezak, 2 Daniel Fuentes, and 1,3 Kette Valente ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology ? Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 2 Neuropsychology ? Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 3 LIM 21- Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Recent studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders (PD) in children and adolescents with epilepsy. Due to particularities of epilepsy in this age group, especially as to disease duration, it is of interest that this group be studied separately. Most studies with children approach heterogeneous groups with focal and generalized epilepsy, both symptomatic and idiopathic. We aimed to evaluate the frequency and type of PD that occurs in children and adolescents with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and to analyze possible predictive factors, concerning the epilepsy, for the occurrence of PD in these patients. Methods: A multidisciplinary team evaluated patients taking part in this study. Psychiatric interviews were carried out with KIDDIE-SADS and patients were classified according to DSM IV and CID 10. Twenty-six children and adolescents with mean age of 12 years were studied. Mean age of epilepsy onset was 3.6 years (SD 3.2) and mean duration of 8.6 years (SD 4.5). As to etiology, nineteen patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and seven, lateral temporal epilepsy (LTE). Fourteen patients were on polytherapy and fourteen were considered refractory to clinical treatment. Results: From 26 patients with TLE, 22 (84.6%) presented PD, of which 10, more than one. The diagnosed PD were: affective disorders in 13 patients (59%), behavioral disorders in 6 (27.3%); hyperkinetic disorder, mental deficiency and dissociative disorder in 4 (18.2%); and oppositional defiant disorder and bipolar disorder in 1 patient (4.5%). Of the 13 patients with affective disorders, depressive disorder was diagnosed in 9 patients (mild in 4 and moderate to severe in 5) and anxiety disorder in 4 patients. Nine families (40.9%) reported history of PD preceding the onset of epileptic seizures. Mean age of epilepsy onset in patients with PD was 3.5 years, and in those without PD of 4.3 years. As to duration of epilepsy, patients with PD had a longer duration (8.5 years) when compared to patients without PD (7.5 years). As to etiology, out of 19 patients with mesial structure lesions, 19 (100%) presented PD, and out of seven patients with lateral lesions, three (42.9%) presented PD, a statistically significant difference. Family history for PD was reported in 13 out of 22 patients (59%). Conclusions: The study of children with epilepsy enables us to study in an unusual manner the relationship between epilepsy and PD, without interference of important variables observed in adult series such as prolonged disease duration. In this series the prevalence of PD in children with TLE was as high as that observed in adults, mainly affective disorders. Patients with PD present an earlier age-onset of epilepsy and longer duration, although these differences were not significant. In this study presence of MTS was the most relevant predictive factor for PD. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 Alcy R. Torres, 2 Jane E. Whitney, 2 Sneha N. Rao, 2 Rachel M. Lobel, 2 Claire A. Tilley, and 2 Joseph M. Gonzalez-Heydrich ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 2 Psychiatry, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Twelve to 39% of children with epilepsy have Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)1, yet only methylphenidate has controlled data in this population. Methods: We reviewed medical records of pediatric patients with ADHD plus epilepsy given atomoxetine (ATM) abstracting diagnoses, clinical course, adverse events, and prospectively entered Clinical Global Impressions scores (CGI). Response at last visit is a CGI-Improvement score of 1 or 2 plus a drop of at least 1 point in CGI-Severity score compared to baseline, and continuation of ATM. Results: Twenty-seven patients (10.1 ± 4.2 years, 63% male) were treated with ATM for median 26, range 4?141 weeks. The average daily dose was 35 ± 24 mg (median 25, range 10?100mg). For the 22 patients with weights available the dose was 0.9 ± 0.4 (range 0.1?1.6) mg/kg/day. Twenty-four (90%) had been unsuccessfully treated with stimulants prior to ATM. ADHD was combined subtype in 21 (78%) patients. Twenty-one patients (88%) were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in addition to ADHD including mood disorders in 16, anxiety in 8, and psychosis in 6. Six patients had a concomitant antipsychotic when they began treatment with ATM and 11 patients (41%) were treated with an antipsychotic at the last visit on ATM. Average seizure frequency at baseline was 9 ± 37 per month (median 0, range 0 to 90). Epilepsy etiology was idiopathic (n = 18, 67%), cryptogenic (n = 8, 30%) or symptomatic (n = 1, 4%). Seizure onset was strictly partial (n = 4, 15%), generalized (n = 9, 33%), or mixed partial and generalized (n = 13, 48%). Twenty-three patients (85%) were on antiepileptic medications (AED) at baseline, and 21 (78%) at the last visit on ATM. Four patients increased and two patients decreased their AED regimens during ATM treatment. There were no serious adverse events and no patients discontinued ATM due to an increase or worsening of seizures. Seventeen of 27 patients (63%) discontinued ATM. The reasons were: inadequate response (n = 7, 23%), increased irritability/activation (n = 8, 30%), appetite decrease and tremor (n = 1, 4%), or noncompliance (n = 1, 4%). Eight patients (30%) met criteria for response. ATM dose, epilepsy type, and comorbid psychiatric disorders did not predict response or discontinuation. Conclusions: The modest response rate (30%) and high discontinuation rate (63%) on ATM could be due to the high percentage of stimulant non-responders in this sample. The absence of serious adverse events or discontinuations for seizure exacerbation indicates that prospective studies should be planned. Limitations of this study include its small sample size, retrospective nature, and lack of randomization and placebo control. Reference 1.?Dunn DW, et al.

Methods: Patients 5?17 years, with a ≥3 month history of epilepsy, a development quotient ≥80, no major motor or sensory impairments, and at least one non-epileptic sibling in a similar age range, were identified from the neurology clinic database or at the time of clinic visit. Parents completed a questionnaire regarding sedentary activities and group, individual and total sports activities. Children aged 11?15 years also completed the physical activity portion of the Health Behavior in School Aged Children questionnaire. Clinic charts were reviewed for seizure type, etiology, frequency, duration of epilepsy and number of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) ever taken. Results: Teens with epilepsy participated in less group and total sports activities than controls and were more likely to be potentially overweight or overweight. Receiving three or more AEDs in the past showed a significant negative correlation with sports participation. While there was a trend for those with higher seizure frequency to be less active, no other epilepsy specific factors nor prior seizures or seizure-related injury during a sports event correlated with participation in physical activity. Conclusions: Programs that promote exercise in adolescents with epilepsy should be encouraged to improve their physical, psychological, and social well-being. 1 Jerry J. Shih, and 1 David R. Chabolla ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL ) Rationale: Ictal asystole or bradyarrythmias are recognized cardiac processes associated with certain epilepsies and are the subject of case reports and case series. Less is known about the incidence of patients originally thought to have epilepsy who ultimately are diagnosed with asystole or bradyarrythmias not associated with any seizure manifestation. Methods: All patients admitted to epilepsy monitoring units from two hospitals from 2000?2005 were retrospectively evaluated for clinically significant bradyarrythmias which explained their paroxysmal episodes of alteration of consciousness or ?convulsions?. 550 subjects ranging from age 5 months to 81 years-old were included in the analysis. All subjects analyzed had one or more events documented with concomitant video, electroencephalographic, and electrocardiographic data. Total recording time ranged from 8 hours to 8 days. Patients with known epilepsy admitted for ictal single-photon emission computed tomography or intracranial EEG monitoring were excluded from analysis. Results: Three patients were diagnosed with clinically significant asystole or bradyarrythmias. One patient (age 5 months) died in the hospital during an event in which she could not be resuscitated. The other two (ages 49 and 76) patients had episodes for 39 and 8 years, respectively and carried the diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy. Both of these patients had an implantable cardiac defibrillator placed and are event-free. Conclusions: The incidence of patients admitted for video-EEG monitoring who are ultimately diagnosed with asystole and bradyarrythmias not associated with epilepsy is rare. However, the lack of timely diagnosis can be fatal, and epileptologists should recognize the possibility of significant cardiac arrythmias being misinterpreted as seizures.

Castro, and 1 Rosa Kashiara ( 1 Division of Psychology, Hospital das Clinicas FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, Faculdade de Medicina USP, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Traditional neuropsychological testing may fail to detect abnormalities in declarative memory tests in epileptic patients. One possible explanation is that such tests do not adequately measure memory in real life activities. Prospective memory (PM), i.e. cognitive abilities related to remembering a planned intention in the correct setting, may be a more ecological measurement of memory function in daily activities. We studied the performance of patients with left and right mesial temporal sclerosis and normal controls in a prospective memory battery and compared results with performance in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and with a self assessment questionaire for memory impairment (QMI). Methods: The battery consisted of six time and event related tasks to be recalled in the adequate situation, such as remembering to tell the examiner that they needed a new prescrition after fifteen minutes and remembering to ask for an personal object taken by the examiner at the end of a 105 minute session.Patients were submitted a neuropsychological test battery during the session, including the RAVLT and were asked to fill the QMI (24 items). Spontaneous and cued recall of the 15 RAVLT words was tested after 7 days. Performance in the PM tests was compared to RAVLT scores and to QMI score. A patient was considered impaired in either MP or RAVLT if performance fell below 2SD of controls. Significant memory compaints were considered if QMI score was 1SD above controls. Sensitivities and specificities for impairment measured by PM and RAVLT were calculated in relation to QMI assessed impairment (gold standard). Results: We studied 28 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (17 left) and 18 normal controls, matched by age (38±10 vs 40±12 yrs) and education (11±2 vs 11±2)(age 40 ±2). Left MTS patients performed significantly worse than controls in PM and spontaneous recall and in QMI score (p < 0.05). Both left and right MTS performed significantly worse than controls in 7-day cued recall (p < 0.05). Sensitivities in relation to QMI were 56.2% for PM, 50% for RAVLT, 37.5% RAVLT and PM and 68,8% for RAVLT or PM. Specificities were 100% for PM, 83.3% for RAVLT, 100% for RAVLT and PM and 91.6% for PM or RAVLT measured impairment. Conclusions: This prospective memory test was able to differentiate memory performance between left MTS patients and controls. It is has a better specificity than RAVLT in relation to a self assessment memory questionaire. Its sensitivity is increased when used in combination with RAVLT. Further studies should better delineate its use in combination with other tests in the assessment of memory dysfunction in epileptic patients and in patients with memory impairment of other etiologies. 1 Judith Butman, 2 Maria E. Fontela, 2,3 Veronica De Simone, 3 Marina Drake, 1 Cecilia Serrano, 2 Maria B. Viaggio, 2,3 Alfredo Thomson, and 1,3 Ricardo F. Allegri ( 1 Memory Center, Department of Neurolgy, Hospital Zubizarreta, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; 2 Epilepsy Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; and 3 Neuropsychology Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Britanico, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: It has been proposed that behavioral impairment in patients with amygdala dysfunction might be related to an inability to reverse their behavior despite receiving negative feedback. Epileptic patients who undergo anterior temporal lobectomy represent an ?in vivo? model to study the role of amygdala in cognitive flexibility. The aim of this study is to evaluate cognitive flexibility in epileptic patients with amygdala resection when facing negative feedback. Methods: Ten epileptic patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (6 left temporal lobectomy and 4 right temporal lobectomy) were matched for age and education with 10 healthy controls. Subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation. To asses cognitive flexibility we used a reversal ?learning task. Results: Patients' mean and standard deviation score were: Beck depression Inventory 8 ± 1.5; PANSS (positive) 10 ± 1.3; PANSS (negative) 14 ± 2.2; PANSS total 28.3 ± 2; verbal IQ 104.2 ± 7, nonverbal IQ 97.2 ± 6, full scale IQ 101.4 ± 6.3. Categories achieved on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 5.7 ± 0.16. Patients had less number of reversions (mean:9.3) compared to controls (mean: 4.23; p < 0.001), and needed more trials before the first reversion (patients: 23.42 vs controls: 5; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with epilepsy who undergo anterior temporal lobectomy appear to have post operative difficulties to perform a learning-reversal task. Their lack of cognitive flexibility cannot be explained by psychiatric comorbidity, low IQs or a dysexecutive syndrome. 1 Gus A. Baker ( 1 Division of Neurosciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom ) Rationale: There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that people with epilepsy, when compared to normal controls, are much more likely to experience a range of neuropsychological impairments. There are a number of factor that have been linked to the causation of these effects including the underlying lesion, the effects of continuous seizures, the sedative effects of AED treatment and the impact of mood. Determining the relative contributions of these various factors has been difficult but previous studies have confirmed cognitive side effects of several antiepileptic drugs such as central slowing, motor slowing and impairment of attention and concentration. The SANAD trial, a randomised controlled clinical trial of standard versus novel antiepileptic drug treatment, represents a unique opportunity to study the natural history of cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who havge yet to be exposed to AED treatment and who have expereinced few seizures. Methods: A standardised battery of neuropsychological tests including measures of psychomotor speed, attention, memory, mental flexibility, tracking tasks, higher executive functioning, mood and patient perceived cognitive effects were administered prior to AED treatment, 3 months and 12 months. Results: There were differences between the epilepsy group and published control data for a number of key domains including: immediate, delayed and recognition memory; new learning; tests of higher executive functioning; sustained attention; and motor speed. These differences were significant at p = 0.001 level. In addition patients also had significantly worse profiles on the profile of mood scale. Conclusions: These results highlight that newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy are already significantly compromised in terms of their neuropsychological and psychological functioning prior to starting AED treatment and exposure to a significant number of seizures. This study will provide and opportunity to study the development of these cognitive effects allowing for treatment and seizure history. It will also allow for the identification of individuals most at risk of developing signficant cognitive difficulties.

Barr, 2 Essie Larson, 1 Kenneth Alper, and 1 Orrin Devinsky ( 1 NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Fordham University, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ? 2 (MMPI-2) is an objective, self-report instrument that is used frequently to examine personality and psychopathology in patients with epilepsy. One advantage of this test is that it provides validity indicators useful for identifying biases in responding that could potentially invalidate its results. The goal of this study is to examine the rates of invalid MMPI-2 profiles in a sample of patients undergoing VEEG monitoring for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Methods: MMPI-2 profiles were obtained from 126 patients undergoing continuous inpatient VEEG monitoring. The mean age of the sample was 37.1 years (range, 17 to 74 years). The sex distribution was 74.6% female. Non-epileptic seizures (NES group) were identified in 75 patients. Fifty-one patients had VEEG findings indicating partial (n = 30) or generalized (n = 21) epilepsy (ES group). The groups were matched in terms of age, education, and IQ. The NES group had a higher proportion of females (87% vs. 57%, p < .01). All subjects completed the 567-item version of the MMPI-2. Analyses were conducted on standard validity indices, including the L, F, and K-scales, as well as the consistency indices, VRIN and TRIN. We also examined two other validity measures, the Fp-scale and the FBS-scale. The former was developed for assessment of rarely endorsed symptoms in populations with high rates of psychopathology. The latter (FBS, Fake-Bad-Scale) is used for measuring reporting bias in injury claimants attempting to exaggerate symptoms while maintaining a socially desirable appearance. Rates of invalid responding, as defined by scores exceeding published cutoffs, were assessed through standard tests of proportions. Results: Invalid MMPI-2 profiles were identified in 43.6% of the total sample. A significantly higher rate of invalid responding was observed in the NES group than in the ES group (53.3% vs. 29.4%, p < .001). Invalid profiles were obtained in only 18.6% of the NES group and 17.6% of the ES group when limited to analysis of conventional validity indices (e.g., L, F, K, VRIN,  Chi-Square, NS). None of the 126 subjects participating in this study exhibited an elevation of the Fp-Scale. Elevations of the FBS-Scale were observed in 44.0% of the NES group and in 21.6% of the ES group (p < .001). Conclusions: Over 40% of our sample produced invalid MMPI-2 profiles, which raises concern about the prevalent use of the instrument in this population. Rates of invalid responding in the NES and ES groups were the same when identified through standard validity indices. Higher rates of invalid responding observed with the FBS-Scale indicate that patients with NES are twice as likely to produce exaggerated test profiles than patients diagnosed with partial or generalized epilepsy. 1 Brian D. Bell, and 1 Bruce P. Hermann ( 1 Neurology/Neuropsychology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Conventional memory assessment might fail to identify memory dysfunction that is characterized by intact recall for a relatively brief period, but rapid forgetting thereafter. A recent study of auditory and visual selective reminding test performance revealed that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients demonstrated poorer memory ability than controls, but there were no group differences in rate of information loss at the 30-minute and 24-hour delay trials (Bell et al., 2005). In addition, at the individual level of analysis accelerated forgetting over 24 hours was not more common in TLE patients compared to controls. Methods: In this study, we assessed Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd ed. (WMS-III) Logical Memory subtest (LM) performance, including immediate memory and recall after 30-minute and 14-day delays, in a control group (n = 25) and a group of individuals with TLE (n = 25). The mean age of epilepsy onset was 11 years (SD = 8). Individuals with a history of right, left, bilateral or indeterminate TLE laterality were included and five of the TLE patients had undergone a left anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) at the time of this study. The results described below were unchanged when the ATL patients were excluded. Results: Group analysis: A 2 X 3 (Group X Trial) univariate ANOVA for LM free recall raw scores revealed main effects of group and trial, but no significant group X trial interaction effect. T tests revealed that the control group performed significantly better than the TLE group on the immediate, 30-minute delay, and 14-day delay trials. Individual analysis: Memory impairment was defined as a score ≥ 1 standard deviation below the control group mean. Examination of raw scores revealed that the TLE group had a significantly higher percentage of individuals with impairment at the immediate and 30-minute delay trials, but not at the 14-day delay. Moreover, none of the TLE patients versus three controls (12%) showed memory impairment solely at the 14-day trial. When examining percent retention scores, only 4% of the individuals with TLE versus 20% of the controls were unimpaired after 30 minutes but impaired after 14 days. Conclusions: Accelerated forgetting over a 14-day delay was not present on a widely used story memory test (WMS-III LM) in a group of individuals with TLE. This evidence suggests that the conventional 30-minute delay utilized in clinical neuropsychological evaluations typically is sufficient for measuring memory functioning in TLE patients. Future study of word list retention after a delay of weeks in subsets of TLE patients with clearly lateralized seizures would further test this hypothesis.

Burton, 1 Pradeep Modur, 1 Rebecca Woods, 1 Edgar Pererra, and 1 Mike Gruenthal ( 1 Neurology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY ) Rationale: WADA testing is a standard part of the work-up for epilepsy surgery, and assesses the likelihood of new post-surgical language/memory deficits. We present the WADA results of two patients who had undergone anterior temporal lobectomy, but who had not been evaluated using the WADA. To our knowledge the results of WADA testing in patients who have already undergone anterior temporal-hippocampal resection has not been previously reported. These cases allow for a comparison of the following conditions in regards to memory function: dominant hippocampus, nondominant hippocampus, and no hippocampus. Methods: Our WADA procedure includes a mental status exam, memory acquisition, sequential language testing, and memory recognition. The demographic and surgical data of our cases is detailed in Table 1. Patient 1 had previously undergone a right anterior temporal lobectomy and patient 2 had a left anterior temporal lobectomy. Neither surgery resulted in seizure control, necessitating a new surgical work-up. Results: Results reveal that both patients are left hemisphere dominant for language. The right hemisphere resection patient did not sustain a disruption in memory function as the result of right hemisphere injection, while injection of the dominant hemisphere disrupted memory. In contrast, the left hemisphere resection case displayed more functional memory deficit after nondominant hemisphere injection, while injection of both hemispheres suppressed memory compared to baseline. Figure 1 reveals that the no hippocampus condition resulted in total suppression of memory function for both cases. When the dominant hippocampus was functioning in isolation no disruption of memory function was noted compared to baseline. When the nondominant hippocampus was functioning in isolation memory function was significantly diminished, but not completely suppressed. Conclusions: Current results support the hypotheses that there can be a dominance for memory function that is not solely based on material specificity. Second, resection of the dominant hippocampus results in greater memory impairment compared to resection of the nondominant hippocampus. Third, current results suggest that the nondominant hippocampus can support memory function to an extent, although not at the level of the dominant hippocampus. Finally, our results highlight the need for a comprehensive presurgical work-up. 1 [Memory Assesment: collapsed across cases (% of targets recongnized correctly).] 1 Robyn M. Busch, 1 Heather D. Stott, 1 Thomas W. Frazier, 1 Richard I. Naugle, 2 Imad Najm, and 3 William Bingaman ( 1 Psychiatry  2 Neurology, Epilepsy  and 3 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have higher rates of depression and anxiety than patients with other focal epilepsies or generalized seizures. Memory problems are common among patients with mood and anxiety disorders as well as among patients with TLE. Given the high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and memory problems in patients with TLE, the present study sought to determine if presurgical mood and anxiety scores are useful in predicting memory change following anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) and to ascertain if these scores have incremental validity over presurgical memory and intelligence scores. Methods: This retrospective study examined data from 174 patients with medically intractable TLE (Left = 79; Right = 95) seen for neuropsychological evaluations that included: Depression, Anxiety, Anxiety Related Disorders (ARD), and Mania subscales of the Personality Assessment Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory-II; General Memory Index (GENMEM) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd Edition; and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition. All patients later underwent ATL for treatment of their epilepsy and completed postsurgical neuropsychological testing. Participants' mean age and education were 34.25 (SD = 11.51) and 12.84 (SD = 2.11), respectively. The mean age of seizure onset was 14.92 (SD = 12.25) and mean duration of seizures was 19.49 years (SD = 12.59). There were no significant differences between the left and right groups in terms of age, race, sex, education, age of seizure onset, or seizure duration. Results: Simple regression analyses were conducted with mood and anxiety as independent variables (IVs) and memory change score as the dependent variable (DV). A hierarchical regression analysis was then computed with presurgical GENMEM and FSIQ scores entered as IVs in step one, the five mood variables in step two, and GENMEM change as the DV. Regression analyses were conducted separately for left and right TLE patients. Results of the simple regression revealed that presurgical mood and anxiety scores were significant predictors of postsurgical change in GENMEM for left TLE but not right TLE patients. Of the mood variables, the ARD subscale made the largest contribution to the prediction. Similarly, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that mood and anxiety scores added significantly to the prediction of GENMEM change above and beyond the prediction made by presurgical GENMEM and FSIQ scores among left but not right TLE patients. Again, ARD made the largest contribution to this prediction. Conclusions: This study supports the clinical utility of presurgical mood and anxiety scores in predicting memory change following ATL in patients with left, but not right, TLE. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that mood and anxiety scores add significantly to the prediction of postsurgical memory change beyond the prediction made by presurgical memory scores. 1 Juliana P. DaPaz, 1 Carla C. Adda, 1 Leila M. DaRoz, 1 Leandro L. Valiengo, 1 Carmen L. Jorge, 1 Rosa Maria F. Valerio, 1 Rosa Kashiara, and 1 Luiz Henrique M. Castro ( 1 Neurology, Faculdade de Medicina USP, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Material specific memory deficits are often seen in temporal lobe epilepsy. Patients show verbal learning and confrontation naming deficits. These data were obtained lateralizing patients exclusively by MRI or interictal EEG (iEEG) data. Unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (uMTS) is often a bilateral disease, with contralateral EEG abnormalities, which may impact on cognitive functioning. We compared neuropsychological scores (NP) in pure unilateral and bilateral uMTS patients. Methods: MRI-diagnosed uMTS, ages (17?55), education >8 yrs, without other MRI lesions or significant psychiatric/neurologic disease. Patients underwent video-EEG monitoring (VEEG), iEEG, WADA test and a NP battery [digit span, vocabulary and object assembly subtests (WAIS III), Stroop I,II,III, Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Verbal Fluency (FAS), Rey Figure (Immediate and Late Recall)]. Patients were divided in four groups: right and left, unilateral or bilateral (RU, LU, RB and LB) by a laterality index obtained from a summated score of iEEG, VEEG and WADA, compared to MRI findings. Normal controls were matched by age and education. Scores on individual neuriopsychological tests were compared among all groups and controls. Results: 54 patients (30 or 56% men), 29 (or 54%) left MTS, education (10.6 ± 2.1yrs.) and 18 controls (4 or 22% men) education (11.1 ± 1.1yrs). 13 were RU, 20 LU, 12 RB and 9 LB.When comparing neuropsychological scores using MRI or iEEG isolatedly, classified as left or right, left MTS patients performed significantly worse in RAVLT (VI, VII and total score) and in FAS than controls and worse than controls and right MTS in BNT (p < 0.05, all tests) for both MRI or iEEG. When the 4 groups were compared, RU and LU differences disappeared. BL patients performed significantly worse than controls in RAVLT (VI, VII, total score), worse than controls, LU and RB in Stroop II and than RU in BNT. (p < 0.05, all tests). When iEEG was analyzed among the four groups, BL patients performed significantly worse than controls in RAVLT (VI, VII and total score) and worse than BR in BNT. Conclusions: Although it is widely accepted that left MTS patients show deficits in verbal learning and recall as well as confrontation naming, our data suggests that only patients with left MTS on MRI, but with bilateral involvement by other eletrophysiologic criteria (VEEG and iEEG) and cognitive functioning measures (WADA) perform significantly worse in episodic verbal memory and confrontation naming tasks. In this sample, pure left MTS patients do not show cognitive impairment in relation to right MTS patients (unilateral and bilateral) or controls. Bilateral temporal involvement with anatomic and/or functional involvement may be crucial for memory dysfunction in left temporal lobe epilepsy.

Allegri ( 1 Neuropsychology Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Britanico, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; and 2 Epilepsy Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) show impairment in confrontation naming tasks. Furthermore naming difficulties have been related to left temporal dysfunction. The objective of this study is to characterize naming difficulties in a group of temporal epileptic patients and further compare naming abilities between patients with right and left temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Thirty three epileptic patients were matched for age and education with 31 healthy volunteers. Fourteen patients had left TLE epilepsy and nineteen right TLE. All patients were right handed with IQs within the normal range. All subjects were administered an extensive neuropsychological battery. Confrontation naming was explored using the Boston Naming Test adapted version for Argentina. Total number of correct responses and type of errors committed were analyzed. Errors were classified into 5 categories: semantic errors, phonemic errors, visual errors, circumlocutory errors or nonresponse. For analysis purposes only the first 40 naming errors were considered as previous local studies showed that naming deficits in the last 20 pictures is strongly influenced by education and cultural background. Results: The epilepsy group performed significantly worse than controls on a naming test (TLE = 46 ± 6 vs controls = 53 ± 2, p < 0.001). Type of errors were: 42% semantic, 32% nonresponses, 13% circumlocutory, 9% visual and only 1% phonemic errors. No naming differences were found between right and left TLE patients (p = 0.7). Conclusions: Temporal lobe epilepsy patients showed poor performance on a naming task compared to control subjects further supporting the language deficit observed in this population. The most common type of errors (anomia and semantic) reflect dysfunction of the semantic system. Surprisingly, no differences were found when right and left temporal epilepsy patients were compared. This finding might reflect functional reorganization of language-related neuronal networks in temporal lobe epilepsy. 1 Jelena Djordjevic, 1 Viviane Sziklas, 1 Dominique Piper, 1 Sidonie Penicaud, and 1 Marilyn Jones-Gotman ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University ) Rationale: Auditory naming tasks may be more appropriate than visual ones as a measure of potential word-finding difficulties in patients who are candidates for resection from the dominant anterior temporal lobe (1). We wished to optimize clinical usefulness of the existing auditory naming task (ANT) by creating a French version that would yield results similar to those obtained in English, and by increasing the number of items so that auditory naming results could be compared more directly with those from visual naming. Methods: To facilitate a more direct comparison of auditory naming with the visual naming task used most commonly (Boston Naming Test; BNT), we increased the number of items on the existing auditory naming task from 50 to 69 by adding 19 new items, then testing 119 healthy volunteers (53 francophone, 66 anglophone) on this longer version, and finally keeping the 60 items that gave the clearest results (i.e., elicited greatest agreement, fewest synonyms). To maximize equivalence between English and French versions, we compared results from anglophone and francophone subjects for each item, rejecting those on which language-group differences were greater than 25%. These normative data were then used to rearrange items in order of increasing difficulty separately in each language. We are now comparing performance on the revised ANT to BNT in patients (n = 20) with epileptic focus in a temporal lobe. Results: Comparison of mean correct responses on the 60-item ANT with those from the BNT showed a small, in absolute terms, but significant (p < .01) difference between tasks for healthy subjects, with BNT yielding the higher scores. There was a main effect of language, showing higher English than French scores on both tasks (p < .01). Patients with a left temporal-lobe focus earned lower scores on both naming tasks compared to those with a right temporal-lobe focus (p = .03); again ANT scores were lower overall than BNT scores. Conclusions: As reported also for the 50-item ANT (1), auditory naming remains more difficult than visual naming for healthy subjects. Thus, despite equating the ANT and BNT for number of items, scores cannot be compared directly, as the difference in difficulty should be taken into account. Our French version of the ANT yields scores that are highly similar to the English, although the French are slightly lower. The French ANT is already proving useful in language evaluation of francophone patients in Quebec. 1. Hamberger M, Seidel W. JINS (2003); 9:479?89. (Supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.) 1 Robert C. Doss, and 1,2 John R. Gates ( 1 Epilepsy, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, P.A., St. Paul, MN ; and 2 Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: The assessment and diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (NES) in inpatient epilepsy programs is very common (20?50% of admissions). The underlying etiology of NES can reflect a variety of conditions as denoted by the DSM-IV. The aim of this study was to determine the most common psychiatric diagnoses of NES in a comprehensively evaluated sample of patients. Methods: The sample consisted of 58 consecutive admissions to the adult inpatient epilepsy unit who were eventually diagnosed with NES via video-EEG monitoring. The determination of a psychogenic etiology was made after ruling out physiological causes, history review, neuropsychological and personality assessment (i.e., PAI), as well as psychiatric and/or psychological consultation. DSM-IV diagnoses were made by either a consulting psychiatrist or psychologist. Results: There were 58 NES patients (67% female) with an average age, education, and WAIS-III Full Scale IQ of 36.5, 13.2, and 94.0, respectively. Personality testing using the PAI showed a clinical elevation on the Somatic Complaints scale (Mean T-score = 70.0) with Conversion being the most elevated subscale in the profile (Mean T-score = 71.0). The most common preexisting psychiatric diagnoses included Depression (50%), PTSD (13.8%), other Anxiety (17.2%), Somatoform (13.8%), and Substance Abuse/Dependence (12.1%). Sixty-five percent (65%) of the sample reported a history of physical and/or sexual abuse. The final DSM-IV diagnosis for the NES was overwhelmingly Conversion Disorder (74.1%) and Somatoform Disorder NOS (8.6%). The remaining diagnoses for the NES included various anxiety, dissociative, and factitious disorders (17.3%). Conclusions: In an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit, the vast majority of NES cases confirmed by video-EEG are diagnosed as Conversion Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. That is, the NES are thought to reflect psychological factors (unconscious or not) that are manifested by pseudoneurological symptoms or deficits. Other less common diagnoses include panic attacks and dissociation associated with PTSD and/or a primary dissociative disorder. An accurate psychiatric diagnosis of NES is important in that treatment will necessarily be dictated by the underlying psychological disorder. Furthermore, diagnostic accuracy relies on a multidisciplinary approach that considers both the patient's medical and psychosocial history and current functioning. 1,5 Mario F. Dulay, 1,2,5 Harvey S. Levin, 1,2,5 Michele K. York, 2,5 Daniel Yoshor, 3 Robert G. Grossman, 4,5 Amit Verma, 4,5 Ian L. Goldsmith, and 4,5,6 Eli M. Mizrahi ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, BCM ; 3 Department of Neurosurgery, Methodist Hospital ; 4 Peter Kellaway Section of Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, BCM ; 5 Baylor Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, BCM ; and 6 Section of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, BCM ) Rationale: Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric disorders found in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) before and after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Severity of depression is associated with neuropsychological impairment in TLE patients. No previous study has characterized the relationship between the presence of depression/anxiety and changes in memory function after ATL. Methods: We studied 56 patients (ages 17?56 years) who underwent ATL for refractory epilepsy. Patient data were divided into four groups: left-ATL with (n = 10) and without (n = 13) psychiatric disturbance and right-ATL with (n = 17) and without (n = 16) psychiatric disturbance. There were no significant differences between groups in age, education, age at seizure onset, duration of illness, pre-ATL seizure frequency and post-ATL seizure outcome. Retrospective chart review was used to determine the presence of psychiatric disturbance (mood and anxiety disorders), which was based on recommendations for psychiatric treatment after ATL made by the attending neuropsychologist. Patients were included if they had an IQ >84 to ensure that memory deficit was not attributable to generalized cognitive impairment. Memory abilities were assessed an average of 5 months before surgery and an average of 11 months after surgery using the Verbal and Nonverbal Selective Reminding Tests. Results: Twenty-seven patients (48% of the sample) received recommendations for psychiatric treatment after surgery: 13 for mood disorders, 2 for anxiety disorders, and 12 for comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that left-ATL patients with psychiatric disturbance had the largest verbal memory reductions from before to after surgery compared to all other groups (Tukey post-hoc p values <.01). There was also a drop in the number of words recalled by left-ATL patients without psychiatric disturbance, but the reduction was significantly greater for left-ATL patients with psychiatric disturbance. On the other hand, there was slight improvement in verbal recall ability for right-ATL patients after surgery regardless of psychiatric status. There were no significant interactions or main effects for nonverbal memory. Conclusions: Our results suggest that besides side of excision, the presence of depression and anxiety should be taken into account when evaluating verbal memory deficits after ATL. Questions remain regarding whether or not verbal memory deficits will improve after ATL if psychiatric symptoms are remediated with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmaceutic interventions. 1 Darren Fuerst, 1 Adele Haber, 1 Michelle Kieski, 1 Jay Shah, 1 Aashit Shah, and 1 Craig Watson ( 1 Neurology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: List learning has generally been less useful for the localization of temporal lobe seizures than has story recall. It has been hypothesized that executive functions may play a role in the learning, recall, and recognition of word lists. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which list learning and executive functioning measures are correlated. Methods: A total of 161 subjects took part in the study. Of these, 74 subjects were left temporal lobe epileptics, 55 were right temporal lobe epileptics, and 32 subjects had bi-temporal onset or could not be lateralized by EEG. The word list learning measure used in this study was the CVLT. The variables used from the CVLT were the z-scores of the number of words recalled on Trials 1, 5, and 1?5 total, short delay free and cued recall, long delayed free and cued recall, number of hits and false positives on recognition testing, number of perseverations, semantic clustering, and serial clustering. Executive functioning measures consisted of the Trail Making Testing B, lexical fluency (CFL), and measures from the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, including total responses, total correct, total errors, perseverative responses, perseverative errors, and the number of categories completed. Results: Overall, in the entire sample only Trails B reached statistical and practical significance its relationship with Trials 1, 5, and total 1?5, short delay free recall, short delay cued recall, and long delay free recall. None of the other measures correlated significantly and substantially. When subjects were divided into long delay free recall greater or less than -2, the only correlation of significance was between Trails B and total 1?5, for each group. When left temporal onset patients were examined, only Trails B correlated with trials 1, 5, and 1?5 total, and long delay free recall. For right temporal patients, Trails B correlated with Trials 1?5, short delay free and cued, and long delay free and cued recall. Also, for these subjects a number of WCST measures correlated with these variables. Conclusions: In general, word list learning is not related to executive functioning in temporal lobe epilepsy. This conclusion may be tempered somewhat in right temporal lobe patients, in which the relationship deserves further study. 1 Anna R. Giovagnoli, 2 Rute F. Meneses, and 1 Antonio Martins Da Silva ( 1 Neuropathology and Neurology, ?Carlo Besta? National Neurological Institute, Milano, Italy ; 2 FCHS-Fernando Pessoa University and IBCM-University of Porto, Porto, Portugal ; and 3 ICBAS/IBCM-University of Porto and Hospital Geral Santo Antonio, Porto, Portugal ) Rationale: Although the quality of life (QOL) of patients with chronic brain damage may reflect common stressing conditions, different facets and determinants may characterize the QOL of patients with different diagnosis. This study evaluated patients with partial epilepsy aiming to compare personal dimensions of their QOL with respect to patients with other chronic brain diseases. Methods: Sixty-four adult patients with partial epilepsy (n = 36) and other chronic neurological diseases associated with brain lesion (vascular, tumour, or inflammatory) (n = 28) were evaluated after informed consent. They reported self-evaluation of QOL, mood and cognitive efficiency using the WHO QOL-100 and Spiritual, Religious and Personal Beliefs scales, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire. Neuropsychological tests assessed reasoning, attention, language, visual perception, memory and executive abilities. Results: T statistics comparing the two patient groups did not show any difference in the total WHO QOL-100 score. On the contrary, significant differences emerged in spirituality dimensions, with minor feelings of peace (p = 0.01) and life meaning (p = 0.02) in the epilepsy patients, and in neuropsychological performances (p = 0.01), with higher scores at attention and praxis tests in the epilepsy patients. Although not significantly so, the epilepsy patients were more anxious and depressed but perceived better cognitive abilities than the other patients. In the epilepsy group, the WHO QOL-100 total score significantly correlated with the feelings of peace (r = 0.56, p = 0.006), state-anxiety (r =?0.52, p = 0.01), trait-anxiety (r =?0.58, p = 0.005), and depression (r =?0.62, p = 0.002), as revealed by separate Pearson's tests. In the other patient group, the WHO QOL-100 total score significantly correlated with feelings of life meaning (r = 0.47, p = 0.01), hope (r = 0.536, p = 0.003), openness (r = 0.61, p = 0.001), forgiveness (r = 0.49, p = 0.008), self-esteem (r = 0.62, p < 0.001), state-anxiety (r =?0.78, p < 0.001), trait-anxiety (r =?0.93, p < 0.001), depression (r =?0.79, p < 0.001), and the subjective perception of cognitive efficiency (r =?0.65, p = 0.006). Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that QOL, as expressed by a single index, may appear similar in epilepsy patients and patients with other chronic brain diseases. However, they differ in spiritual facets, mood, and cognitive abilities. Even if in both groups mood has a central place in the perception of QOL, the subjective appraisal of health may reflect the interaction of different inner factors. Future studies are needed to determine the spectrum of psychological and spiritual facets relating to epilepsy, promoting specific health interventions. 1 David S. Glosser, 1 Dayna A. Leis, 1 Joseph I. Tracy, and 1 Michael R. Sperling ( 1 Neurology, Jefferson Epilepsy Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Mood disorders are frequent co-morbidities in epilepsy and may be accompanied by polysomatic complaints. Studies of temporal lobectomy patients have reported post-surgical mood changes with right vs left laterality differences. Among non-epilepsy patients, right hemisphere lesions have been associated with diminished awareness of physical impairments. A sample of right (R) vs left (L) temporal lobectomy S's with pre and 1-yr. post surgical measures was compared to evaluate the effect of surgery and laterality on Anxiety (anx.), Depression (dep.), and Somatization (somat.). Methods: We prospectively studied 20 (L) and 12 (R) side sequentially admitted temporal lobectomy patients, 16 male, and compared Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) Anxiety, Depression, Somatization subtest scores pre and 1-yr. post surgery. Pre-surgical duration of epilepsy, age at surgery, gender, and IQ were assessed. The PAI is a reliable  R = 98. L vs R sample equivalency was challenged by a significantly lower number of R side cases returning for 1 yr. post testing. Females and males, L  while L S's improved only on somat. scores and had no improvement in anxiety or depression. This is consistent with reports that L hemisphere lesions more likely produce mood deterioration; while R damage is associated with decreased appreciation of physical impairment and, occasionally, denial of illness/injury. Alternatively, the combination of L focus and post-surg sz reduction may deprive patients of anti-depressant effects of seizures. Hence, while L side patients' depression and anxiety did not improve, the reduction in seizures produced reduced somat. scores. Though higher post-surgical somatic complaints might have been expected in dominant hemisphere surgery, due to increased threat to language, this did not occur. The greater pre-surgical sz duration of the L patients may reflect reluctance to operate on the dominant hemisphere. Although higher depression, anxiety, and somatization has often been reported among females, this was not seen. 1 Arthur C. Grant, 1 Sayeh Beheshti, 1 Pany Tehrani, 2 Roxan F. Saidi, 1 Olivia Aguilar, 1 Veronica Martin, and 1 Stephanie Moore ( 1 Neurology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA ; and 2 Medicine, St. Joseph's Hospital, Orange, CA ) Rationale: Limited English language skills complicate neuropsychometric assessment and Wada testing in patients with refractory TLE undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. The patient population at our institution is culturally and ethnically diverse. For many patients English is a second or third language, and is understood and spoken with varying expertise. Although administering the neuropsychological component of the Wada test in a patient's native language is desirable, direct translation of English-language Wada protocols into other languages does not account for cultural or language-specific content. Methods: Our Wada test is a modification of one used at several epilepsy centers. It includes repetition and recall of spoken words and phrases, with additional foil words and phrases used when testing memory performance. Several of the phrases have cultural (e.g. ?My country ?tis of Thee?) and/or language-specific (e.g. ?Mary had a little lamb?) significance that would be lost with direct translation to other languages. We used a combination of culturally congruent substitutions and direct translations to adapt our Wada protocol for use with both Mexican-born Spanish and Iranian-born Farsi speaking patients. In addition, we attempted to preserve phrase length and general semantic content as much as possible. For instance, instead of ?Mary had a little lamb,? the Farsi version uses a strikingly similar line from a well-known Persian nursery rhyme, ?gaveh Hassan chejooreh?? (How is Hassan's cow?), and the Spanish version uses a line from a familiar lullaby, ?Los pollitos dicen pio pio? (The chicks say pio pio). Instead of ?My country ?tis of Thee? we substituted ?Mexico lindo? in the Spanish version and ?zardee-ye man az tow? (My yellowness is from you) in the Farsi version. The latter phrase is part of a traditional exclamation made during a ritual associated with the Persian new year celebration. Medically-trained native speakers administered the protocol to one Farsi speaking and two Spanish speaking patients, under the direct supervision of a neuropsychologist. Results: The procedure was administered without difficulty to all three patients, and was scored using criteria developed for the original English version. In all three patients, Wada memory and language results were consistent with other clinical data, and were incorporated into the surgical decision-making process. Conclusions: Although the number of patients is small, these data suggest that culturally-sensitive adaptations of English-language Wada protocols provide reliable results, and can be used without independent validation in a large number of patients.

Martin, and 2 Edward Faught ( 1 Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ; and 2 Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: It has become important to understand the potential cognitive problems that older adults with epilepsy might encounter. We previously demonstrated cognitive impairments in epilepsy seniors. To further investigate potential cognitive declines in epilepsy seniors, we conducted a prospective study of cognitive performance across a three-year time span. Methods: Fifteen epilepsy seniors averaging 68 years of age (range 62?77) at follow-up were studied. Participants had partial-onset seizures for 34 years on average. All participants completed measures of overall cognition, attention, language, memory, construction, abstraction, executive function, and mood at baseline and at an average follow-up interval of 3.1 years. Results: Epilepsy seniors showed worsening executive control over the follow-up period as measured by the Executive Interview Test (EXIT), t(13) =?3.06, p = .009. A trend towards significance was observed for poorer performance on WMS-III Logical Memory I (p = .06). There were no other changes observed in neuropsychological test performance or mood across the follow-up interval (all p values >.10). Conclusions: Across three years, epilepsy seniors had diminished executive control with some evidence of decreased verbal recall. Otherwise, stability in cognitive functioning was observed. Older adults with epilepsy appear prone to selective worsening of executive control. Numerous factors could contribute to executive dyscontrol, including brain atrophy related to continued seizures and/or cognitive effects of medications due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics. Further study is necessary to determine what factors contribute to worsening executive dyscontrol in epilepsy seniors. (Supported by Epilepsy Foundation of America and Centers for Disease Control.)

The objective of this work is to analyze the underlying psychiatric pathology of patients with pseudoseizures in a general outpatient clinic. Methods: A retrospective study of patients that underwent EEG due to a suspicion of pseudo seizures was realized. The clinical history, psychiatry diagnosis and EEG NONITORING were reviewed in sixteen patients (M/F: 10/6), middle age 40,6 years. All of them were studied by EEG monitoring, pseudoseizures seizures were recorded in 10 of these 16 patients, the other six had a high clinical suspicion. In 8 patients coexisted the pseudoseizures with epilepsy, 1 had migraine, 1 was diagnosed o syncopes, the rest of them did not have a clear epilepsy diagnosis. Results: Four patients did not have a clear psychiatric pathology. Five patients were malingering with clear secondary gain. One of the subjects admitted self-induced illness and spontaneously improved after video EEG monitoring. The others ameliorated after retirement from their work. One patient had Alcohol Dependence. Four patients had an Anxiety Disorder NOS, 1 was a Depressive Disorder, 1 patient had an Impulse-Control Disorder NOS, 7 patients were diagnosed of different Personality Disorder, all of those patients were women. The women improved when the socio familial circumstances changed. Men experienced some change when social aspects were modified. Conclusions: The women with pseudoseizures had been diagnosed basically of Personality Disorders. Men had secondary gain, or no clear psychiatric diagnosis. In this study we verify the importance of a psychiatric management to obtain adequate pseudoseizures control. 1 Hajo M. Hamer, 1 Anja Haag, 1 Johannes Dorst, 1 Felix Rosenow, and 1 Susanne Knake ( 1 Neurology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany ) Rationale: Identification of eloquent cortex is a crucial issue in the preoperative assessment of patients with medically intractable epilepsy to reduce the risk of postoperative cognitive decline. Functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) is already a well established tool for language lateralisation. In this study we evaluated a fTCD-paradigm that reliably lateralises to the non-dominant hemisphere. Methods: 30 right handed healthy controls (17 male; 13 female age = 27,1 ± 7,5) participated in the study. While measuring cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) simultaneously and continuously in both middle cerebral arteries (MCA), all patients performed a mental rotation paradigm (cube filled with three ropes had to be rotated mentally to imagine views from different sides). The paradigm consisted of 20 activation and resting periods. In addition, the already established lexical fluency paradigm for language lateralisation was performed. Data were analysed offline with the software Average?, which performs a heart-cycle integration and a baseline-correction and calculated a laterality index (LI) with its standard error of the mean increase in blood flow separately for both MCA during activation. Results: One out of the 30 participants showed atypical right hemispheric language dominance and was excluded from further analysis. 21 participants (72%) of the 29 with left hemispheric language dominance showed right hemispheric dominance in the mental rotation paradigm. 7 (24%) patients generated greater left than right hemispheric activation and one participant did not show any lateralisation. There was no significant correlation between the LI in the mental rotation paradigm and test performance and no significant negative correlation between the LI of the mental rotation and the language paradigm. Conclusions: In more than two thirds of the participants the mental rotation paradigm showed a right hemispheric lateralisation. So far, mental rotation appears to be one of the best paradigm to activate predominantly the non-dominant hemisphere in fTCD. Participants will be interviewed to elucidate whether different especially verbal strategies could be responsible for left hemispheric lateralisation in some participants. Evaluation of this paradigm in epileptic patients is warranted. 1 Cynthia L. Harden, 2 Janice M. Buelow, 3 Joyce Cramer, 4 Carl B. Dodrill, 1 Blagovest Nikolov, and 1 Kenneth Perrine ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ; 2 Nursing, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ; 3 Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, West Haven, CT ; and 4 Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Mood disorders are prevalent in persons with epilepsy. As part of the Epilepsy Foundation of America's initiative on mood disorders, a professional education subcommittee developed a survey to assess knowledge of and attitudes and practices towards mood disorders in epilepsy. Methods: The survey entitled ?Mood in Epilepsy Neurology Practice Questionnaire? consisted of 14 questions including three demographic items. A 5-degree Likert scale was developed for most answer choices. The survey was piloted by some attendees of the American Epilepsy Society (AES) meeting in December 2004. Unselected attendees who passed by the EFA booth were asked to complete the anonymous, 1-page survey. Results: Ninety-nine responses were obtained and the total number of answers to selected questions are listed below. 1 How often do you ask epilepsy patients about their mood? Never 2/Rarely 4/Sometimes 21/Often 47/Always 25 2 How much do you think that symptoms of a mood disorder are important factors in determining an epilepsy patient's quality of life?

Further, concern about exacerbating seizures is not a reason for withholding antidepressant medication among these practitioners. These findings suggest that educational efforts regarding mood disorders and epilepy have favorably impacted the practices of AES members, but whether this holds true in a larger group of general neurology practictioners assessed in a less biased manner remains to be determined. 1 Chin-Wei Huang, 1 Yi-Jung Hsieh, 1 Ming-Chyi Pai, and 1 Jing-Jane Tsai ( 1 Epileptology and Neurology, National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Pediatrics, Chi-Mei Foundation Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Behavioral Neurology and Neurology, National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; and Epileptology and Neurology, National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan ) Rationale: Cognitive impairment in epilepsy has gained much attention in clinical practice. most of them are focused on the seizure type, age at seizure onset, seizure duration, antiepileptic drugs and epilepsy surgery. Few studies specifically focused on cryptogenic epilepsy. In addition, how the cognitive performance in cryptogenic epilepsy responds to treatment remains elusive. Methods: We investigated the cognitive performance in cryptogenic epilepsy patients with the aid of cognitive ability screening instrument (CASI), based on cross-sectional and longitudinal aspects. One hundred patients met the diagnostic criteria of cryptogenic epilepsy were recruited from a national university hospital. The patients with normal total CASI scores were compared with those with abnormal ones. We also compared the follow-up CASI score after 3 years with the previous one in all cryptogenic epilepsy patients.

Black bar, initial score, gray bar, the following score, A: The group with initial normal total CASI score, B: The group with initial abnormal total CASI score group. Figure 1A. Results: 36% of cryptogenic epilepsy patients showed cognitive impairment. The variables correlated with higher risks of cognitive impairment were lower educational status, number of seizure types, duration of seizure and polytherapy, especially the lower educational status. The correlation between CASI and the MMSE was excellent. As to the follow-up study, the abnormal group showed significant improvement in total CASI score. The normal group showed no significant change. Conclusions: We suggest that in cryptogenic epilepsy, lower educational status remains the most important factor in determining cognitive performance. Adequate treatment with anti-epileptic drugs can improve cognitive performance in previously cognitively impaired patients. (Supported by National Cheng Kung University Hospital.) 1 David Isaradisaikul, 2 Kelly A. McNally, 1 Jason M. Meckler, 1 Michael D. Privitera, 2 Bruce K. Schefft, and 1 Jerzy P. Szaflarski ( 1 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) often manifest differently in different patients. Selwa et al. (Epilepsia 2000; 41(10): 1330?1334) developed a system of PNES classification to describe different types of spells. Previous research has demonstrated that patients with PNES are commonly associated with elevations on the hypochondriasis and hysteria scales of the MMPI. In the present study, we sought to investigate the relationship between PNES spell type and MMPI profiles. Methods: We reviewed video-EEG reports and MMPIs in 86 patients diagnosed with definite PNES after inpatient video-EEG monitoring at the University of Cincinnati between January 2000 and March 2003. Definite PNES was defined as habitual spells recorded on video-EEG without an ictal EEG discharge and normal background alpha rhythm during the event. The diagnosis of PNES was based on the results of the prolonged video-EEG monitoring (PVEM), clinical characteristics of the events recorded, and other supporting evidence (e.g., neuropsychological testing/MMPI). Patients with mixed PNES and epileptic seizures were excluded. Based on review of spells, each patient was classified as predominantly or exclusively belonging to the catatonic, thrashing, automatisms, tremor, intermittent, or subjective categories of nonepileptic seizure type based on Selwa's classification. MMPI data were collected on each patient as part of the standard neuropsychological battery obtained prior to discussion of the diagnosis with the patient. Results: We found that the largest groups consisted of patients with intermittent (n = 22), subjective (n = 21), and thrashing (n = 19) types of PNES. Analysis of variance results indicated that there was a significant effect of PNES spell type on MMPI standardized T-scores on a combination of the hypochondriasis scale (1) and the hysteria scale (3) (F = 3.87, p = 0.003). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons revealed that patients with catatonic-type PNES had significantly lower scores on scales 1 and 3 than all other PNES types. No other MMPI scales were found to be significantly related to PNES spell type. Conclusions: We found that patients classified with catatonic-type PNES had significantly lower scores on the hypochondriasis and hysteria scales of the MMPI, as compared to all other types of PNES. According to previous research, patients in the catatonic subgroup tended to have a better outcome than other PNES types. This improved outcome in the catatonic group may be related to their decreased pathology on MMPI scales 1 and 3. 1 Donya L. James, 1 Mike R. Schoenberg, 1 Kyra A. Dawson, 1 Pamela Lang, and 1 Mary Ann Werz ( 1 Neurology, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: There is conflicting data in the literature regarding material-specific memory deficits in patients with epilepsy (Kim et al., 2003). Some research suggests that patients with left hemisphere seizure lateralization have decreased capacity for verbal memory while patients with right hemisphere seizure lateralization have decreased capacity for visual memory. Subsequent research has not been able to fully confirm these findings. Methods: The participants were 23 patients diagnoses with epilepsy whose seizure lateralization evaluation including the Wechsler Memory Scale- 3rd Edition. Results: Primary Index scores [e.g. Auditory Immediate Memory (IM), Visual Immediate Memory (VI), General Memory Immediate (IM), Verbal Memory Delayed (AD), Visual Memory Delayed (VD), Auditory Recognition Memory Delayed (ARD), and General Delayed Memory (GM)] were compared using ANOVA. Significant differences were found between AI index scores and ARD index scores. Patients with right hemisphere seizure lateralization scored significantly better on both indexes. There were no significant differences between the groups on other WMS-III indexes. Conclusions: The study provides further support for differences in patients performance on material-specific memory tests. However, the degree of lateralization is less pronounced in patients with epilepsy having left hemisphere epileptic focus. This research provides further evidence of material specific memory deficits on the WMS-III, although not for delayed memory. Patients with right lateralization of seizure activity perform better on tasks of immediate recall of auditory information as well as tasks involving the recognition of verbal information after a delay. 1 S. Kennepohl, 1 V. Sziklas, and 1 M. Jones-Gotman ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: We have previously raised a question whether the well-known hemispheric difference in memory function might be process-specific as well as material-specific1,2; i.e., related to both novelty vs. familiarity and verbal vs. nonverbal material. To test this question using neuroimaging, recognition memory must be used; our prior results with patients used recall. We have developed a single recognition memory protocol to be used in both clinical and neuroimaging research. Methods: We use 4 types of stimulus dichotomized along verbal/nonverbal and novel/familiarity dimensions (abstract words, nonsense words, drawings of objects and abstract designs). For each stimulus type, the task consists of two learning/recognition trials and a delayed recognition trial. The fMRI task differs from that used in clinical research primarily in that it uses a block design for item presentation (alternating blocks of stimuli and baseline items), includes a simple perceptual decision task (is item primarily ?straight? or ?curvy?) to ensure fixation during encoding, and does not use an interference task between learning and delayed recognition. Comparability of the two versions was assessed with groups of matched neurologically healthy participants (fMRI vs. clinical version; n = 35 and n = 18, respectively). A small sample of individuals with either primarily left- or right-sided temporal lobe (TL) epilepsy was tested using the clinical version. Results: Our results show that healthy individuals demonstrate significant learning over the two first trials, with little-to-no forgetting following a delay. ANOVAs revealed: 1) no effect of version; 2) main effect of novelty (familiar > novel); 3) main effect of material (?nonverbal? > verbal); 4) main effect of trial. Significant interactions showed poor initial learning of novel material (with bigger improvements on Trial 2), and better overall recognition of drawings of objects. Preliminary results with a small sample of patients suggests that those with a left TL focus improve much more on learning novel than familiar material, whereas those with a right TL focus show little change over trials. Conclusions: We have developed a simple yes-no recognition memory protocol allowing study of material- and process-specific learning/retention using an almost identical paradigm in fMRI or clinical testing. The clinical and fMRI versions of the task appear directly comparable with respect to memory performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first learning/memory protocol using an identical paradigm, potentially yielding complementary information about brain regions active during memory compared with the result of focal lesions. The novelty/familiarity dimension yielded a large effect, confirming the importance of this factor in learning, and may be particularly salient in elucidating laterality effects in temporal-lobe epilepsy.

Kubu ( 1 Psychiatry  Right = 122) to examine potential factors that may moderate the relationship between BNT performance and seizure lateralization and to determine the incremental validity of this measure in predicting seizure lateralization. Results: The results support the clinical utility of the BNT in determining ultimate side of surgery and indicate that age of seizure onset strongly moderates this relationship. BNT performance was helpful in identifying ultimate side of surgery in patients with later age of seizure onset (i.e., >6 years). This relationship was not apparent in patients with younger age of seizure onset. In addition, site of seizure focus (i.e., temporal vs. nontemporal) approached significance as a moderating variable with more robust relationships apparent in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. FSIQ and duration of epilepsy were not significant moderating variables. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses supported the role of the BNT in predicting ultimate side of surgery and further demonstrated that this instrument has incremental validity over and beyond memory and IQ laterality scores. Conclusions: This study supports the clinical utility of the BNT in the pre-operative evaluation of candidates for epilepsy surgery, particularly for patients with later seizure onset.

Privitera ( 1 Psychology, Unniversity of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; 2 Psychology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; and 3 Neurology, University Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Approximately 2% of the population is diagnosed with epilepsy and about one third of those diagnosed will develop intractable epilepsy (Snyder, 1998). Thus, surgical intervention, particularly anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL), has become a widely used form of treatment for those with medically uncontrolled seizures (Engel, 1996) and has a success rate of about 80% (Janszky et al., 2005; Olivier, 1988). Previous studies have found unilateral hippocampal atrophy, side of surgery, and duration of seizures to be significantly predictive of seizure control after ATL (Jeong et al., 1999; Olivier, 1988). Additionally, studies have shown that patients with higher preoperative IQ and language scores and lower preoperative verbal memory scores have good seizure control post ATL (Chelune et al., 1991; Chelune et al., 1998; Hennessey et al., 2001). The primary goal of this study was to determine changes in cognitive functioning after ATL and to identify predictors of favorable seizure and cognitive outcome post-surgically. For seizure outcome, the predictors included hippocampal integrity, seizure laterality and duration, and pre-surgical cognitive functioning. For cognitive outcome, the predictors examined were hippocampal integrity, seizure laterality and duration, and seizure outcome. Methods: Data from a convenience sample of 36 patients who underwent ATL for relief from medically intractable seizures were included in this study. Surgery was performed at University Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. All participants underwent prolonged video/EEG monitoring and pre- and post-surgical neuropsychological evaluations. Seizure outcome was determined according to Engel's classification system. Results: Approximately 60% of patients' overall IQ and verbal memory scores improved or remained the same following ATL. The majority of these patients were seizure free post surgery, and those who improved on verbal memory tasks had undergone right ATL. Additionally, patients who were seizure free following ATL significantly improved on an executive functioning task. Interestingly, more than half of the patients declined on nonverbal memory and confrontation naming post right ATL. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that only pre-surgical cognitive scores were significantly predictive of seizure outcome F(8,15) = 2.713, p < .05), accounting for 59% of the variance. Futher, regression analyses yielded statistically significant main effects for nonverbal memory and confrontation naming (t(29) = -2.43, p < .05 and t(29) = 2.27, p < .05, respectively). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that patients improved on most measures of cognitive functioning. Further, cognitive improvement appeared to be greatest in patients who were seizure free following ATL. Higher pre-surgical cognitive scores were predictive of seizure relief post surgery. 1 Carrie R. McDonald, 1 Dean C. Delis, 1 Marc A. Norman, 2 Evelyn S. Tecoma, and 2 Vicente J. Iragui ( 1 Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA ; and 2 Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA ) Rationale: Executive dysfunction is common in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and is thought to be secondary to underlying frontal lobe dysfunction. However, executive dysfunction has also been reported in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Thus, the specificity of executive dysfunction to FLE versus TLE is unclear. In addition, the degree of executive dysfunction in these populations may be related to disease-specific variables, including the side of the seizure focus, presence of a structural lesion, and/or the age of seizure onset. The goal of this investigation was to determine (1) the nature and extent of executive dysfunction in patients with FLE and TLE and (2) the relationships between disease-specific variables and executive dysfunction. Methods: Participants in this investigation were 23 patients with FLE (10 left, 11 right, one bilateral), 20 patients with TLE (11 left, 8 right, one bilateral), and 23 age- and education-matched controls. Fifteen patients with FLE had MRI-confirmed frontal lobe lesions. All patients with TLE had mesial temporal sclerosis. All participants completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functions System. Test performances were adjusted for age, gender, and education and transformed to a common metric (z scores). Composite z-scores were created for each of the following domains: switching, inhibition, fluency, abstraction, and planning. Results: Results revealed that patients with FLE were impaired relative to controls in switching, inhibition, fluency, and abstraction, but not planning. Conversely, patients with TLE were found to be significantly impaired only in fluency relative to controls, although their performances across domains were decreased and did not differ from those with FLE. In the FLE group, correlation analyses did not reveal a relationship between age of seizure onset and any domain of executive functioning. Instead, a left-sided seizure focus and structural lesions were associated with poorer performances. In patients with TLE, an early age of seizure onset was related to greater impairment in one domain (i.e., abstraction) regardless of the side of the seizure focus. Conclusions: Executive dysfunction in patients with FLE is pervasive and appears to depend on the side of the seizure focus and presence of structural pathology. In patients with TLE, executive dysfunction is relatively subtle but may be more pronounced in those with an early seizure onset. These findings are consistent with past research indicating that executive dysfunction is present in patients with FLE and TLE. However, our research extends the literature by demonstrating that the nature, extent, and disease-specific correlates of executive dysfunction differ between the patient groups.

Privitera ( 1 Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Neuropsychological test results are often used in the differential diagnosis of epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). However, since deficits have been reported in both groups, simply investigating overall performance may not be sufficient. It may be important for neuropsychologists to shift their attention to the qualitative differences in test responses between patients with PNES and ES. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) can be used to investigate differential response patterns on recognition memory tasks. SDT posits that performance is dependent on two independent factors: 1) ability to discriminate between targets and distractors (sensitivity, or actual memory ability) and 2) propensity to respond in a particular manner (response bias). Methods: One hundred patients diagnosed with PNES and 108 patients with temporal lobe ES, 62 left temporal (LTLE) and 46 right temporal (RTLE), were studied. Each participant was administered the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III). Scores on the recognition subtest of the List Learning task were analyzed with the traditional method of scoring and also subjected to SDT analytic decomposition into indices of sensitivity (d') and bias (c). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the diagnostic utility of raw scores and SDT measures. Results: Raw scores on the recognition memory task were found to significantly discriminate between ES and PNES (?2= 6.01 p = .014, Area under ROC curve, or AUC = .57) however, analysis of SDT measures slightly improved the diagnostic utility (?2= 16.95, p < .001, AUC = .62). Both sensitivity (Wald ?2= 8.43, p = .004) and bias (Wald ?2= 7.92, p = .005) significantly contributed to the discrimination of ES and PNES. Increased sensitivity and a more negative response bias increased the odds of PNES (odds ratio, OR, sensitivity = 1.84, bias = 0.09). Decomposition into SDT measures did not significantly improve the discrimination between LTLE and RTLE (raw scores ?2= 6.63, p = .01., AUC = .66; SDT measures ?2= 14.42, p < .001, AUC = .68). Sensitivity (Wald ?2= 8.17, p = .004) but not response bias (Wald ?2= 2.9, p = .09) was found to be a significant predictor of left versus right TLE, with decreased sensitivity increasing the odds of LTLE (OR = 0.45). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SDT measures of sensitivity and response bias may be useful tools to aid in the differential diagnosis of ES and PNES. Patients with PNES were found to have a negative response bias as compared to patients with ES. The negative response bias in the PNES group may be related to depression, inadequate effort or low motivation on the diagnostic testing. These results suggest that, not only is overall performance on neuropsychological testing important, but differences in response patterns should also be considered. 1 Cristiane S. Messas, 2 Luiz Henrique M. Castro, 2 Carmen L. Jorge, and 1 Leticia L. Mansur ( 1 Physical, Speech and Occupational Therapy, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy show cognitive imparment in episodic memory. Semantic memory aspects have received less attention in temporal lobe epielpsy. We evaluated aspects of semantic memory in epileptic patients with temporal lobe epilepsy secondary a mesial temporal sclerosis. Methods: We studied patients with medically refractory mesial TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery with MRI documented unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Patients were classified as right or left mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), according to MRI findings. Inclusion criteria included right handed patients with ages between 18?55, education above 8 yrs and absence of other MRI lesions or other significant neurological or psychiatric disease. Patients underwent a detailed battery evaluating episodic memory (word list learning, with spontaneous, cued and recognition recall and imediate and late history recall) and semantic memory tests: picture-word matching, definition of objects, common nouns, verbs and adjectives, word list generation [FAS, and category: animals and means of transportation), auditory responsive and visual confrontation naming (common and proper nouns, verbs and adjectives). Performance of left and right MTS patients was compared with a control group of normal individuals, matched by age, gender and education. Results: We evaluated 18 MTS patients (10 left, 8 right) and 22 controls. Groups did not differ in age, gender and education. All patients were high dose mono or polytherapy of antiepileptic drugs. Left MTS patients performed significantly worse than controls in immediate and late history recall (p < 0.05). Left MTS patients also performed worse than right MTS and controls in word list learning, but the difference did not reach statistical significance(p < 0.05). In semantic memory testing, both left and right MTS patients performed significantly worse than controls in confrontation naming for common and proper nouns, as well as in word list generation (FAS, animals and means of transportation). In word-picture matching, right MTS patients performed significantly worse than controls (p < 0.05). Left MTS patients performed worse than controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (due to sample size). Left and right MTS patients performed worse than controls in responsive naming and in visual confrontation for verbs and adjectives, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Groups did not differ in the definition task for objects, nouns, adjectives and verbs. Conclusions: In this group of patients, while episodic verbal memory impairment was noted in left MTS patients, imparment in some aspects of semantic memory was seen in both left and right MTS patients. 1 Yafa Minazad, and 1 Laura Kalayjian ( 1 Neurology, University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Epilepsy is a chronic illness that negatively impacts quality of life. Cultural factors may have an influence. At Los Angeles County Medical Center, the majority of patients are Spanish-speaking, uninsured, and with low income and level of education. It is important to identify the factors associated with quality of life in this population to provide better care. Methods: Two hundred adult Hispanic patients, seen at our epilepsy clinic underwent a structured interview followed by a self-administered questionnaire (English or Spanish). Demographic and other information regarding their epilepsy was collected. The questionnaire consisted of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE- 10) plus 11 additional questions designed to identify more cultural/social concerns. A statistical regression model was used to correlate these factors with mean QOLIE 10 scores. Results: Of the 200 patients interviewed, 61% were female. Mean age was 36 and mean duration of epilepsy was 20 years. 82% spoke Spanish as their primary language. 51% arrived by public transportation. Average number of antiepileptic medication prescribed was 2, and 74% of patients reported compliance. Mean seizure frequency was 1 per month. Mean percent optimal life scores (QOL) derived from the QOLIE 10 was 69.4%. Seizure frequency was significantly related with QOL, (p < 0.001). QOL decreased by 10% with every increase in category of seizure frequency; one every other month or less, more than every other month up to 2 per month, and 2 or more per month. Epilepsy duration was significantly and inversely associated with QOL (p < 0.04). Patients' gender, age of onset, seizure type, and etiology, did not correlate with QOL. Language was significantly associated with QOL (p < 0.01). English speaking Hispanics had lower QOL scores compared to Spanish speaking ones. Average length of education was 8 years. Of the 34% of patients who had stopped education due to epilepsy, 46% were below age 30. Patients with higher level of education (high school and above) had significantly lower QOL (p < 0.03). There was a significant association between sense of embarrassment (stigma) and QOL (p < 0.001). Twenty six percent reported being diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Of those diagnosed, 56% were receiving treatment. The question left unanswered the most by patients was regarding driving. Of the 14% of our patients who drove, only 51% owned a driver's license. Conclusions: Cultural factors and epilepsy burden play a role in quality of life in Hispanic epilepsy patients at a major US urban medical center. Stigma, language, and education had significant relationships with QOL. QOL was also significantly associated with increased seizure frequency and duration of disease. These results are similar to other studies showing refractory epilepsy patients have poor QOL. This information will enlighten health care providers to the needs of this cultural group. 1 Hilary Mounfield, 2 Gus Baker, 3 Michael Feichtinger, and 4 Philippe Ryvlin ( 1 Chief Executive, Epilepsy Scotland, Glasgow, United Kingdom ; 2 Clinical Neuropsychology, Walton Center for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, United Kingdom ; 3 Department of Neurology, Karl-Franzens University, Graz, Austria ; and 4 Department of Functional Neurology and Epileptology, Neurology Hospital, Lyon, France ) Rationale: To provide a patients' perspective on the cognitive side effects of anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment and the consequences for quality of life. Methods: A nine-item questionnaire comprising a combination of forced-choice and open-ended questions was distributed to 4,500 members of nine chapters of the International Bureau for Epilepsy (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Israel, Norway and Scotland). Results: Data analysis was performed on 837 completed questionnaires. The average age of respondents was 40 years, 54% were female and 95% were taking medication for their seizures (60% polytherapy vs 39% monotherapy). Average length of time on treatment was 18.07 years (± 18.07). Indicators of cognitive impairment considered to be affected ?very much? or ?moderately? included sleepiness/tiredness (57%), slowness of thought (42%) and difficulties learning something new (41%). Two thirds stated that cognitive impairment was related to their condition or AED therapy, with 41% attributing impairment to their AED therapy alone. More than half (59%) stated that cognitive impairment had prevented them from achieving a goal and approximately 50% reported that their quality of life had been affected including: work (48%), education (46%), relationships (48%) and leisure pursuits (44%). When asked what side effects they would most like to avoid, respondents reported indicators of cognitive impairment most frequently, including sleepiness/tiredness (35%), memory problems (19%), lethargy/sluggishness (9%) and difficulty paying attention (8%). Conclusions: Insights gained from this survey highlight the debilitating effect of cognitive impairment on individuals with epilepsy and the importance ascribed to minimising cognitive side effects of AEDs.

Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Italy ) Rationale: The main aim of this investigation is to assess the possible cognitive changes in patients with epilepsy compared to controls over 5 years, and to investigate the clinical variables mainly implied in the mental alteration. Methods: 50 patients with focal epilepsy and 50 healthy controls were administered the same battery of comprehensive neuropsychological tests at baseline and 5 years later. Raw scores of all psychometric measures were converted to adjusted (age, gender, years of education) z scores. Results: Patients with focal epilepsy exhibited a significant impairment in substained attention compared to controls within 5 years, while the other cognitive domains did not show any important change. The worsening of attention was mainly related to the duration of epilepsy, the age of onset, a history of tonic-clonic seizures, and the level of education. There was no relation to the AEDs regimen. Conclusions: Our results could have important implications considering the influence attention can have on other cognitive functioning, on the quality of life and on the work status, in order to prevent further cognitive deterioration, especially in those patients more at risk to develop that decline. 1 Sandra Pouliot, and 1 Marilyn Jones-Gotman ( 1 Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: We have found that healthy young adults remember odors leading to large emotional reactions (measured with self ratings and galvanic skin response (GSR)) better than odors provoking smaller emotional reactions. Because the amygdala seems to be critically implicated in memory for emotional information and because it is part of the primary olfactory area, we hypothesized that patients with a unilateral amygdala resection (included in a selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) or a corticoamygdalohippocampectomy (CAH)) would not show the normal better memory for emotional than for nonemotional odors, but that instead their memory would be the same without respect to the emotion-arousing properties of the odors to be remembered. Methods: We tested 20 patients who had undergone a SAH or CAH (10 left (6 men), 10 right (3 men)) for treatment of intractable epilepsy, and 32 healthy control subjects matched to the patients for age, education and gender. First, participants smelled passively 21 odors (time interval between odors: 45 seconds) while their breathing, heart rate and GSR were measured. Second, they smelled the same 21 odors again and rated each odor's intensity, pleasantness, familiarity and emotion-arousing properties. Third, a few days later (mean = 5.3, standard deviation = 3.4), we gave participants an unexpected recognition odor memory test. Results: Patients did not show better memory for emotional odors than for nonemotional ones, whereas the healthy control subjects did. There was no difference between patients with a left or right resection in odor memory accuracy or response bias. However, patients with a right resection tended to rate all odors as less emotionally arousing than did patients with a left resection and healthy control subjects. Control subjects showed greater GSR changes to arousing than to nonarousing odors, but the breathing and heart rate measures did not differ as a function of these properties of the odors. Conclusions: Patients who undergo a SAH or CAH, whether in the left or right hemisphere, lose the memory advantage that odors causing strong emotional reactions normally have. This absence of an effect of arousal is not related to differences in perceiving the odors, because only individuals with right resections rated odors differently whereas both left- and right-resection groups failed to remember the emotional odors better than nonemotional ones. This finding is likely owing to resection of the amygdala, which was included in both types of surgery. (Supported by Savoy Foundation and Canadian Institutes of Health Research.) 1 Gail L. Risse, 1 Robert Doss, 1 Wenbo Zhang, and 1,2 John R. Gates ( 1 Epilepsy, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, P.A. of United and Children's Hospitals and Clinics - St. Paul, St. Paul, MN ; and 2 Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Recent studies have reported a high rate of concordance between magnetoencephalography/magnetic source imaging (MSI) and the Intracarotid Amobarbital Procedure (IAP) in identifying patients with left hemisphere language dominance, despite the frequent co-occurrence of some right hemisphere activation on MSI. This study examines the anatomical activation patterns in the right hemisphere in response to an auditory word recognition task in patients who were classified with bilateral language based on the IAP. Methods: Data from four patients diagnosed with chronic epilepsy and/or brain tumor who had been classified with bilateral language representation on IAP and who also underwent language mapping with MSI were retrospectively reviewed. MSI data were obtained with a 148-channel Magnes 2500 WH system (4-D Neuroimaging, SanDiego, CA) and analyzed using the single equivalent dipole model. For each patient, the number and anatomic location of right hemisphere dipoles were examined in relation to modality-specific IAP language responses scored for the right hemisphere. Results: Evidence of correct responses on automatic speech tasks and/or at least one correct naming response was present in all four patients during maximum drug effect following the left injection on IAP. Two of 4 patients demonstrated some auditory comprehension in the right hemisphere as well. Right hemisphere MSI language activation sites included the superior temporal gyrus and/or angular gyrus in 3 of 4 patients. The fourth patient showed activation in the right inferior frontal region and a portion of the insula. This patient had the highest right hemisphere language score on IAP of the 4 cases reviewed. For all patients, activation of classical temporal lobe language areas in the left hemisphere significantly exceeded that seen on the right. Conclusions: These data appear to confirm independent activation of specific right hemisphere language areas in patients with unambiguous language function in both hemispheres. Results will be considered in relation to MSI activation in exclusively left language dominant cases and other neuropsychological variables. 1,5 Heike Schmolck, 1,2,3 Amit Verma, 1,2,3 Ian Goldsmith, 4 Daniel Yoshor, 4 Harvey Levin, 4 Michele K. York, 1,2,5 Perry J. Foreman, 1,2,3,6 Eli M. Mizrahi, and 1,5 Paul E. Schulz ( 1 Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ; 2 Peter Kellaway Section of Neurophysiology, BCM, Houston, TX ; 3 Baylor Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, BCM, Houston, TX ; 4 Neurosurgery, BCM, Houston, TX ; 5 Neurology, Michael DeBakey VAMC, Houston, TX ; and 6 Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, BCM, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Semantic Memory (SM) is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., AD, FTD) or structural lesions affecting the lateral temporal cortex bilaterally (e.g., Herpes Encephalitis). The effect of unilateral lesions is less understood. Prior studies reported deficits in pre- as well as postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. These deficits have been suggested to be highly specific to the clinical difficulties experienced by TLE patients. Our goal is to study SM in patients before and after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) to determine the effect of seizure laterality and the impact of surgery. Our specific aims are to investigate whether deficits in SM after ATL are related to the surgery or the TLE, to assess the magnitude of possible effects, and to determine whether dominant ATL represents a higher risk. Methods: We use 4 tests of semantic knowledge for 48 items. They test the ability to name an item when provided with either a picture or a description (confrontation naming, auditory naming), to provide a definition of the item, and to generate exemplars from a category (category fluency). We have cross-sectionally examined 14 pre-ATL and 18 post-ATL patients, and 8 controls. A prospective study arm is comparing performance before and after ATL in individual patients. Results: Both dominant and non-dominant TLE patients were impaired compared to controls, but the deficit in dominant TLE patients was more severe (ANCOVA IQ covariate, p < 0.05). Interestingly, surgical patients did significantly or marginally worse than presurgical patients on both naming tasks, but they performed better on the definitions task (p < 0.05). Surgical patients supplied more information about the items defined, whereas error rates were similar. Category fluency was also better in the ATL group. Overall performance remains impaired for TLE patients regardless of surgical status in reference to controls. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study found that SM was impaired before and after ATL, suggesting that ATL does not substantially alter SM. However, our prospective study will provide firmer conclusions regarding the impact of ATL on SM. SM was more impaired in dominant TLE. Postsurgical patients performed worse on confrontation naming but better on the definitions task; the latter is likely to be due to a nonspecific effect of improved fluency (less AEDs and less seizures) since error rates did not differ. (Supported by the Epilepsy Foundation through the generous support of the Roger F. and Edna F. Evans Fund.) 1,2 Carol J. Schramke, 1 April A. Valeri, 1,2 James P. Valeriano, and 1,2 Kevin M. Kelly ( 1 Neurology, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA ; and 2 Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: This study compares patients with verified epileptic seizures (ES) and non epileptic seizure like events (NESLE), based on information obtained in clinical interviews, to determine which historical variables most reliably distinguish between these groups. Methods: All patients who were admitted for video EEG monitoring at Allegheny General Hospital between December 1998 and December 2004 and had a report, from at least 24 hours of video EEG monitoring, that suggested either an epileptic seizure or a non epileptic event were included. All patients admitted for monitoring were seen for a clinical interview by the first author. Data were coded based on that clinical interview including whether or not patients reported (1) pending litigation, (2) pending application for disability, (3) marital discord, (4) an unstable work history, (5) history of working in healthcare, (6) significant abuse or psychosocial stress during childhood, (7) history of sexual abuse, (8) current family conflict, (9) history of antisocial behavior, (10) history of delinquincy in childhood, (11) family history of seizures, (12) family history of mental health problems, CFS, or fibromyalgia, (13) family history of alcohol abuse, (14) incontinence during events, (15) history of self injury during an event, (16) events during sleep, (17) psychotropic medication at time of evaluation, (18) that events are related to stress, (19) history of psychiatric hospitalization, (20) history of panic disorder, (21) history of other anxiety disorder, (22) history of depression, and (23) history of other psychiatric diagnosis. Data were subjected to chi square analysis to determine whether there were significant between group differences. Results: Of the 153 reports of monitoring available for review, 65 recorded seizures and 56 recorded NESLE. In the other cases patients did not have events or events were not clearly classified. There were significant between group differences in patient report of (1) marital discord, (2) significant abuse or psychosocial stress during childhood, (3) history of sexual abuse, (4) family history of mental health problems, CFS, or fibromyalgia, (5) family history of alcohol abuse, (6) psychotropic medication at time of evaluation, (7) history of psychiatric hospitalization, (8) history of panic disorder, (9) history of other anxiety disorder, (10) history of depression, and (11) history of other psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusions: Many variables previously suggested to distinguish between patients with ES and NEE were not found to be significantly different in our two patient groups. The variables that did differ in the two groups suggest patients with NESLE are more likely to report histories of significant stress and abuse during childhood, current isues with relationships, and psychiatric diagnoses and treatment. 1 Alon Sinai, 1 Piotr J. Franaszczuk, and 1 Nathan E. Crone ( 1 Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Lexical semantic judgments are expected to depend on modality-specific, as well as amodal, lexical semantic processing. To verify the existence of these different components of lexical semantic processing, we used electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings during a semantic relatedness task to measure event-related cortical activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods: Having undergone surgical implantation of subdural electrode grids for the treatment of intractable epilepsy, six native English speakers (15?43 years old, mean 30 y.o.; 3 female, all left hemisphere dominant for language) judged whether sequentially presented pairs of words were semantically related or not, responding with a forced choice button press. Time-frequency analyses utilized matching pursuits to measure event-related ECoG spectral responses with respect to a 1-sec baseline preceding stimulus presentation. Word pairs were presented in either visual or auditory modalities during separate blocks. Event-related changes in frequency-specific signal energy were compared within subjects between conditions (visual/auditory; semantically related/non-related). Results: Event-related increases and decreases in ECoG signal energy were observed in a variety of frequency ranges, including increases in high gamma (>70 Hz) activity. Modality-specific event-related energy changes were observed in at least one recording site in all subjects. Modality-independent energy changes were observed in 5 of the 6 subjects. In 4 subjects event-related energy changes at some sites were significantly different for semantically related vs. unrelated word pairs. These findings were most prominent in left superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and basal temporal cortex, as well as some of their right hemisphere counterparts. Conclusions: Lexical semantic processing occurs in both modality-specific, as well as amodal, cortical networks, distributed across cortical language regions in the dominant hemisphere, as well as in homologous regions of the nondominant hemisphere.

St. Louis, 1 Sean Mc Evoy, 1 Qian Chi Shi, and 1 Matthew Rizzo ( 1 Iowa Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA; Division of Neuroergonomics, Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA; Division of Neuroergonomics, Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA; and Division of Neuroergonomics, Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy are at risk for automobile crashes. Cognitive effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may impair driving performance. Useful Field of View (UFOV) is a sensitive and specific predictor of automobile collisions. We analyzed UFOV in subjects with partial epilepsy. Methods: 20 partial epilepsy subjects (aged 21?61 years, mean = 41.5) and 50 neurologically normal controls (aged 24?56 years, mean = 39.3) participated. Epilepsy syndromes were temporal (n = 18; 12 had prior anterior temporal lobectomy) and extratemporal (n = 2). UFOV was assessed using the Visual Attention Analyzer, Model 3000 (Visual Resources, Inc.). UFOV Task 1 measures processing speed at central fixation. Task 2 analyzes divided attention between central and peripheral targets. Task 3 involves selective attention between a peripheral target and distracters. Task 4 is a more difficult discrimination task. The dependent measure is a threshold score (ms) for 75% correct target identification. Higher scores indicate poorer performance. UFOV Task scores were added to calculate a UFOV Total score for each subject. Results: UFOV scores were significantly higher on all UFOV tasks in subjects with partial epilepsy (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; see Table), indicative of impairments of processing speed, divided attention, and selective attention. Conclusions: UFOV scores are increased in subjects with partial epilepsy compared to neurologically normal individuals, suggesting a greater crash risk in individuals with partial epilepsy. Causes of impaired UFOV scores include reduced processing speed, divided and selective attention impairments, and mild superior quadrantic visual field deficits due to surgical lesions. Our future studies in drivers with epilepsy aim to further differentiate effects of seizures, AEDs, and lesions upon cognitive abilities critical to safe automobile driving.

Thomson ( 1 Neurology Department, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Epileptic patients have an increased risk of psychiatric comorbidity causing considerable burden and impact on quality of life. Prevalence of psychotic disorders in epilepsy is between 2?9%. Psychosis is more often classified according to the chronologic relation between the psychotic episode and the preceding seizure, i.e., ictal, postictal or interictal psychosis. The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical features and to evaluate the prevalence of psychotic disorders in our epileptic population. Methods: Clinical records of 370 epileptic patients evaluated in our section between 2002 and 2004 were review. Patients who presented psychotic disorders were included for analysis. Patients MRI, EEG recordings, demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Patients with: psychosis antedating epilepsy, history of substance abuse, other neurological disorder or symptoms related to AEDs, were excluded. Results: Twenty-six patients (7%) experienced psychosis. The mean age was 36 years old (SD:11.02) - Ictal Psychosis: Three patients (11.53%). All had localization related epilepsy with complex partial seizures (CPS). Psychosis and EEG discharges stopped with AEDs.The mean time of epilepsy diagnosis was 2.3 years (SD: 00.57) - Postictal psychosis: Seven patients (26.92%), 6 patients post status epilepticus and one post cluster of seizures. The mean interval between epilepsy and psychosis onset was 22.28 years (SD: 11.98). Five patients suffered CPS secondary to remote symptomatic epilepsy. Two patients had generalized seizures and idiophatic epilepsy. In all cases symptoms ceased within 7 days. - Interictal psychosis: Twenty patients (76.92%). The mean interval between onset of epilepsy and psychosis was 21 years (SD: 11.02). Most patients had remote symptomatic CPS. Seventeen patients showed focal interictally epileptiform discharges on EEG. Conclusions: Prevalence of psychotic disorders in our study are in accordance with previous studies. Our data also support that psychosis might be associated with CPS and remote symptomatic epilepsy. Interictal and postictal psychosis appears to be related to longstanding epilepsy. Adequate treatment of psychotic disorders is as important as seizure control for epilepsy management. Detecting and treating psychiatric comorbidities is required to help patients to achieve their maximal functional state and improve their quality of life. REFERENCES Kanner AM. Stagno S. Kotagel P.

Faught ( 1 Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL; Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL; and Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: A significant proportion of adults with epilepsy are over the age of 60 (Hauser, 1992). Due to health issues related to advancing age, epilepsy and side effects of AEDs, aspects of quality of life are a concern for this population. A comparison of quality of life issues between a sample of elderly with and without epilepsy is described. Methods: Thirty elderly adults 60 years of age and older without epilepsy (EA) (12 males, 17 females) were compared to a sample of 27 elderly adults with epilepsy (EAE) (14 males, 11 females). All subjects were living independently in the community. EA were older (M = 71.97 SD = 5.48) than EAE (M = 64.41 SD = 3.81). Inclusion criteria for EAE were a seizure occurrence within the last 12 months and seizure disorder not resulting from stroke or TBI. Quality of life was assessed using the Older Americans Resource Survey (Fillenbaum, 1988), a self-report instrument containing 5 subscales (social resources, economic resources, mental health, physical health, ADL) and a cumulative score. Results: Three subscales of the OARS showed significantly lower scores for EAE; mental health, physical health, and ADL scores (see Table 1). Additionally, EAE were significantly more likely to be dependent on others for transportation (U = .001) and EA were more likely to have hearing impairments (U = .02). Conclusions: Assessment outcomes reveal poorer quality of life in EAE in the areas of mental and physical health and activities of daily living, in spite of the fact that the EAE sample was considerably younger than the EA comparison group. These findings underscore the need for further study regarding quality of life issues in EAE, particularly aspects of physical and mental health and their impact on a person's ability to manage personal care (ADL). Such findings may also reflect a need to provide careful follow-up and education in aspects of care such as medication compliance with EAE. (Supported by Center for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Fisher ( 1 Neurology, Stanford University Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, CA ; 2 Psychiatry, Stanford University Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, CA ; and 3 PGSP-Stanford Psy.D Consortium, Stanford University Hospital and Clinics, Stanford, CA ) Rationale: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are commonly encountered during evaluations for refractory epilepsy. Treatment for this debilitating condition centers on various forms of psychotherapy. Group therapy may be an effective therapeutic strategy, particularly in combination with individual therapy. Outcome in therapeutic trials have focused mainly on measures of event frequency or quality of life, which can be influenced by comorbid physical, psychological, and social factors. Changes in the subjective quality of PNES in response to therapy have received relatively little attention. Methods: The authors devised a preliminary, retrospective study to assess the impact of group therapy in combination with individual therapy on subjective measures of PNES including frequency, intensity, duration, and semiology. Questionnaires focusing on subjective measures were completed by 7 of 10 participants in Psychodynamic Group Therapy (PDT) and 4 of 6 in Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (CBT). Participants had long-standing history of refractory PNES. Results: Mean duration of participation was 16.7 months in PDT group and 6.4 months in CBT group. Two of 7 PGT respondents stopped having PNES. Of the 9 respondents who continued having PNES, 7 felt their events were less disabling, 6 reported improvement in frequency, 6 reported less intense events, 5 reported shorter events, 5 characterized events as less severe, 2 reported change in semiology, and 2 noted less cognitive impairment during events. Eight of 9 with persistent PNES had multiple event types. Five of these 8 reported a change in relative proportion of event types with decrease of more disabling events. Conclusions: This preliminary study reveals improvement in the subjective experience of PNES within the context of group therapy. Participants who continued to have PNES experienced fewer, less intense, and subjectively less disabling events. This preliminary retrospective study raises the possibility that measures of the subjective experience of PNES may be useful for assessing progress in psychotherapeutic interventions. Further similar analyses using validated tools and prospective designs may be of value. 1 Michael Westerveld, 1 Kimberly R. Stoddard, 2 John T. Langfitt, 3 William Barr, 1 Dennis D. Spencer, and 4 Susan S. Spencer ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; 2 Neurology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY ; 3 Neurology, New York University (NYU), New York, NY ; and 4 Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Although there have been numerous previous studies reporting memory outcome following temporal lobectomy, these studies typically do not follow patients for periods greater than one-two years after surgery. Consequently, little is known about long-term (i.e., more than 2 years post-surgery) cognitive outcome following temporal lobectomy. Variables that relate to outcome, particularly long-term seizure control, have also not been studied. The current study reports on the verbal memory outcome for patients enrolled in a multi-center, prospective epilepsy surgery outcome study. Methods: A total of 80 patients who had reached the 5 year post-surgical date and for whom follow-up memory data were available are included in this report. Patients were enrolled in the multicenter study of epilepsy surgery (MSES), and underwent neuropsychological testing as part of their pre-surgical evaluation, follow-up testing at two years post-surgery, and again at 5 years following surgery. Neuropsychological evaluation included general cognitive ability (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), and verbal memory testing (California Verbal Learning Test). Results: Neuropsychological testing at baseline revealed no significant pre-operative differences in Verbal, Performance or Full Scale IQ scores between the right and left TL surgery groups. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the baseline verbal memory testing between the right and left TL groups. Repeated measures ANOVA reveals a trend toward better verbal memory outcome among patients with at least one 3 year remission period (p = .07), regardless of side of surgery. There is no significant main effect for side of surgery, but there was a significant interaction between time, side of surgery, and seizure outcome. While patients who underwent successful right temporal lobectomy (defined as at least 3 year seizure free period during follow-up) had the best verbal memory outcome, patients undergoing right temporal lobectomy that did not have a 3 year remission had the worst memory outcome, and were comparable to the left TL group without a 3 year remission. Post-hoc analysis also revealed that 3 of the 4 groups declined between the 2 year and 5 year outcome points. Conclusions: These results reveal that patients undergoing temporal lobectomy continue to evidence evolving changes in cognitive function 5 years after surgery. Although seizure outcome is a key factor, other variables also play a role, including side of surgery and baseline level of function. These findings indicate that patients may remain vulnerable to verbal memory declines as long as 5 years following temporal lobectomy. (Supported by NIH Grant Number 2 R01 NS32375-06.) 1,3 David J. Williamson, 2 Daniel L. Drane, 2 Elizabeth S. Stroup, 1,2 Alan Wilensky, 2 Mark D. Holmes, and 2 John W. Miller ( 1 Scientific Affairs, Janssen Medical Affairs, LLC, Titusville, NJ ; 2 School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA ; and 3 Neurology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL ) Rationale: Recent investigations have demonstrated that the majority of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) perform in the invalid range on tests designed to detect valid effort on neurocognitive testing (Williamson et al., 2003, 2004). However, a small percentage of patients with video-telemetry confirmed epilepsy also fail symptom validity testing (SVT), including some without evidence of somatoform disorder or apparent motivation to perform in a suboptimal manner. There are inconsistent findings about the extent to which recent epileptiform activity influences neurocognitive performance (Aldenkamp & Arends, 2004). Clinically, we noted that patients with epilepsy who experienced seizures within the past 24 hours seemed more likely to fail symptom validity testing. We investigated this matter in a more systematic fashion to determine the extent to which recent seizure activity may compromise the validity of neurocognitive findings. Methods: Sixty-three patients referred for continuous video-EEG monitoring for evaluation of uncontrolled seizures at the University of Washington were administered the Word Memory Test as part of a comprehensive epilepsy neuropsychological evaluation. Only patients classified on the basis of their ictal EEG recordings and behavioral presentation as experiencing epileptic seizures were included in the study. In order to screen out patients with known cognitive deficits severe enough to decrease the likelihood of normal performance on SVT, patients unable to live independently were excluded. Results: Of the patients who failed SVT, 75% had suffered a seizure within the preceding 24-hour period. ROC analysis suggests that simply knowing that a patient had suffered a seizure within the preceding 24 hours significantly improves one's ability to predict whether they will fail SVT (p = .03). These findings appear to be particularly true for patients diagnosed with complex partial seizures: 3/8 patients with complex-partial seizures with a right-sided focus who had suffered a recent seizure failed (vs. 0/8 who had not seized), whereas 5/8 patients with a recent left-sided focal seizure failed (vs. 0/8 who had not seized). Conclusions: Based upon these preliminary data, it appears that suffering a seizure within 24 hours of neurocognitive testing may place a sizeable proportion of patients with epilepsy at risk for failing SVT, particularly if a patient suffers from complex partial seizures. Given the demonstrated relationship between failed SVT and improbably poor scores on neurocognitive testing in epilepsy and other populations, this may have important implications for clinical decision-making based upon such test results. 1 Pezhman M. Zadeh, 1 Adriana E. Palade, and 1 John F. Brick ( 1 Neurology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: Posterior Communicating Artery Wada for memory evaluation is rarely done. The presurgical internal carotid artery Wada for memory evaluation provides sufficient information in many patients with medically intractable epilepsy. We report five cases in which performance of posterior communicating artery Wada helped us evaluate the hippocampus involvement in memory function, after the Internal Carotid Artery WADA injection demonstrated that patients may be at risk for memory loss if mesiotemporal structures would be removed. Methods: In the five patients bilateral internal carotid artery injection of amobarbital was performed with concurrent EEG recording. Subsequently patients had language and memory evaluation done by Neuropsycology team. The evaluation of memory function suggested bihemispheric memory representation, with the concern that the patients may experience memory decline after ipsilateral resection of mesiotemporal structures.Additional testing with amobarbital injected in the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery supplying the hippocampus was done, with additional small amounts of amobarbital being needed until patient developed a visual field cut. Results: Clinically, patients were evaluated for development of homonymous hemianopsia which suggests adequate posterior communicating artery injection. In all of the cases the concurrent EEG recording showed minimal background slowing of the hemisphere being injected. Additional memory testing was performed and demonstrated good memory support in the remaining hemisphere not supplied by PCA and in the contralateral hemisphere therefore allowing safe resection of the tested hippocampus. Post-surgical follow up with Neuropsychological testing did not demonstrate any memory impairment. Conclusions: Inconclusive bilateral carotid Wada testing does not disqualify the patients with intractable epilepsy from being a good candidate for surgical resection of mesiotemporal structures. Posterior communicating artery Wada is very useful in assessing involvement of hippocampus in memory function.

AB  - Summary As compared with European practice, the American approach to resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhage de-emphasises pre-hospital interventions in favour of rapid transport to definitive care; limits initial surgical interventions under the damage control model; uses crystalloid as the initial fluid of choice; and follows an empiric 1:1:1 approach to transfusion with red cells, plasma and platelets in hemodynamically unstable and actively bleeding patients. The use of bedside visco-elastic testing to guide coagulation support is not as widespread as in Europe, while the early administration of tranexamic acid is more selective.

Michael ( 1 Mental Retardation Research Center, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 2 Division of Neurosurgery ; and 3 Department of Neuropathology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Based on histopathology, cortical dysplasias (CD) are classified into mild CD if the cortex shows architectural abnormalities only and severe CD if the cortex also presents cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells in addition to architectural changes. Both types induce intractable seizures in children. We showed that GABAergic cell numbers and GABA terminals were altered in severe CD but not in mild CD. GABA peak currents, densities and desensitization time constants were also differentially altered in mild and severe CD, suggesting that mechanisms of seizure induction might be different in those two types of pediatric CD (Andre et al., Epilepsia 46 Suppl. 8: 5, 2005). The present study characterized further postsynaptic GABAA receptor function in non-CD, mild and severe CD human brain. Methods: Cortical samples resected for the treatment of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy were collected from non-CD (n = 10), mild (n = 6) and severe CD (n = 10) patients. Brain tissue slices were acutely dissociated and electrophysiological recordings were performed on isolated pyramidal neurons. Patch electrodes were filled with N-methyl-D-glucamine for whole-cell voltage clamp recordings. Different concentrations of GABA and GABAA receptor modulators were applied to the cells. Results: EC50 values were similar in non-CD and severe CD but higher in mild CD cells suggesting less sensitive GABAA receptors. Zinc reversibly decreased GABA peak currents in all cells. However, severe CD cells had a smaller sensitivity to zinc compared to non-CD cells. Zolpidem, a benzodiazepine (BZ) of type I that binds specifically to α1 subunits, reversibly enhanced GABA peak currents in all cells. Zolpidem sensitivity was significantly smaller in severe CD cells compared to mild and non-CD cells. Conclusions: GABA sensitivity determined by EC50 values was similar in non-CD and severe CD cells. However, GABAA receptors responded differently to modulators in severe CD vs non-CD. Sensitivity to zinc was smaller in severe CD, suggesting higher expression of ?2 subunits. Zolpidem effect was also decreased in severe CD vs non-CD indicating a decreased expression of α1. As α1 and ?2 subunits are part of the BZ binding site, alteration in their expression is likely to change the efficacy of BZ used to treat seizures in severe CD. In mild CD, effects of modulators binding to α1- and ?2-containing receptors were not different from non-CD indicating those subunits are not altered. However, GABA sensitivity was lower in mild CD, which could implicate a loss of inhibition and lead to seizures. Together, these results indicate that GABAA receptor subunit composition is differentially altered in mild and severe CD and suggest that different drugs targeting GABA function might be needed to treat the two types of CD.

Van Rijen, 1 Dirk Troost, and 1 Eleonora Aronica ( 1 Department of (Neuro) Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery/Rudolf Magnus Institute for Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Developmental glioneuronal lesions, such as gangliogliomas (GG) are increasingly recognized causes of chronic pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. The cellular mechanism(s) underlying the epileptogenicity of GG remain largely unknown. It has been postulated that chronic epilepsy in patients with malformations of cortical development is associated with dysfunction of the inhibitory GABAergic system. We aimed to identify the subtypes of interneurons present within GG specimens and the expression and cellular distribution patterns of GABA receptors (GABAR) and GABA transporter 1 (GAT1). The expression of the various components of the GABAergic system were also analysed in the perilesional cortex. Methods: We investigated immunocytochemically the expression of parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), GABAAR (a1 subunit), GABAB (R1 and R2) and GAT-1 in 30 specimens of GG obtained during epilepsy surgery, including 10 cases with sufficient amount of both perilesional and adjacent normal control cortex. Results: Immunocytochemistry for parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y demonstrate the presence of inhibitory neurons of different subtypes within the GG specimens. Most interneurons were NPY positive, whereas fewer reacted to calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin. Both GABAAR and GABABR (R1 and R2) subtypes were detected within the neuronal component of GG specimens. In addition, GABABR2 immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in glial cells. GG specimens displayed also expression of GAT-1 IR. Compared to normal cortex, reduced perilesional IR for parvalbumin was observed in 70%, for calbindin in 60% and for GABAR and GAT-1 in 30% of the specimens. Increased staining was detected for NPY in 80% of the cases. Conclusions: The cellular distribution of components of the GABAergic system in GG, together with the perilesional changes suggest that alterations of the GABAergic system may contribute to the complex abnormal functional network of these highly epileptogenic developmental lesions.

Parisi ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; 2 Child and Adolescent Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester ; 3 Division of Neuro-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN ; and 4 Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery outcomes may differ among the focal malformations of cortical development (MCDs). Specifically, most pathologic studies have suggested that balloon cells portend a better prognosis compared to other ?focal cortical dysplasias.? This could impact surgical decision making, since there are several MRI features highly suggestive of balloon cells. For example, focal cortical thickening with T2 signal abnormality extending towards the ventricle has been reported to be 94% specific for balloon cell pathology. We have previously proposed a categorization scheme for focal malformations of cortical development, discarding the term ?focal cortical dysplasia? since these lesions are not precancerous. This study correlates the histopathologic type of focal malformation with epilepsy surgery outcomes. Outcome of each focal MCD category Pathologic subtype Engel class I outcome (free of disabling seizures) Architectural disorganization 1 of 6 (17%) Cytoarchitectural dysmorphism without balloon cells ?9 of 12 (75%) Cytoarchitectural dysmorphism with balloon cells 12 of 20 (60%) Polymicrogyria 4 of 8 (50%) Indeterminate 0 of 1 (0%)? p = 0.12 Methods: Pathologic specimens were retrospectively reviewed from 49 consecutive focal MCDs resections at Mayo Clinic Rochester. These cases were all removed for intractable epilepsy. Specimens were systematically classified using microscopy and standardized immunohistochemical techniques, according to our recently reported classification scheme. Clinical outcomes were compared between different histopathologic subtypes. Results: Of the 49 cases, three were excluded since there was no post-operative follow-up. Of the remaining 46, 26 patients (57%) remain free of disabling seizures (Engel class I). Average follow-up was 34 months. Patients with cytoarchitectural dysmorphism (with or without balloon cells) trended towards better outcomes compared to architectural disorganization and polymicrogyria. However, balloon cells did not portend the best prognosis. Only 60% of patients with balloon cells (?cytoarchitectural dysmorphism with balloon cells?) were free of disabling seizures compared to 75% of those with cytologically abnormal neurons and architectural disorganization without balloon cells (?cytoarchitectural dysmorphism without balloon cells?). Conclusions: Epilepsy surgical outcomes remain suboptimal in focal MCDs. Other focal lesions causing epilepsy, such as cavernomas or mesial temporal sclerosis, are associated with excellent outcomes in up to 90% of patients. In contrast, we found that only 57% of patients with focal MCDs remained seizure-free. In our cohort, balloon cells did not portend a better prognosis than other focal MCDs. 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio, 1 Timothy A. Simeone, 2 Frank Schottler, 1 Do Young Kim, 1 Harold Rekate, 1 Jack Kerrigan, and 1 Jong M. Rho ( 1 Barrow Neurological Institute, St Joseph's Hospital  and 2 Alpha Med Sciences Co., LTD, Osaka, Japan ) Rationale: The hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) represents a rare but important model of subcortical epileptogenesis. Clinical studies, based primarily on intracranial electrode recordings have established that the HH itself is epileptogenic, but the mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we examined the network properties of surgically-resected human HH tissue using a planar multielectrode array recording system. Methods: HH tissue was obtained with patient consent and upon resection was immediately submerged in ACSF bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Tissue slices (400 ?m) were placed in a microelectrode dish (Alpha Med Systems, Osaka, Japan) and perfused with warmed (35°C) oxygenated ACSF. The electrodes were arranged in an 8 ? 8 grid with 150 ?m separation. Slices were arbitrarily placed over the entire electrode grid. Results: Paired-pulse stimulation (50 ms interval) to random points within the tissue elicited small negative field potentials and stimulation-evoked single unit firing within specific regions of the tissue. A 5?20% paired-pulse depression of the field potential was evident in most areas, and was converted to a similar magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation by picrotoxin (100 ?M) suggesting the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components. Furthermore, the stimulation-evoked single unit firing increased (?4-fold) with the second pulse consistent with paired-pulse facilitation of an excitatory component. Picrotoxin substantially increased evoked unit firing suggesting that endogenous GABAergic neuron activity is present normally, and inhibition or shunting of an excitatory component is prominent. In addition, we recorded spontaneous single unit firing of individual cells from multiple electrodes with frequencies ranging from 1?14 Hz and spontaneous negative slow wave activity with amplitudes ranging from 5?300 mV. Interestingly, the frequency of spontaneous slow wave activity decreased with application of picrotoxin and increased with muscimol (30 ?M). Conclusions: Our observations indicate that HH tissue is composed of neurons that are strongly modulated by GABAA receptor-mediated mechanisms. This is consistent with earlier observations demonstrating positive immunoreactivity of HH tissue to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67). A novel finding in this study is that populations of neurons also give rise to spontaneous slow wave discharges. It is of interest to determine if the spontaneous activity will become synchronous across the tissue and develop into epileptiform activity in response to provocation. Future studies will characterize the spontaneous activity and the functional architecture of HH tissue. (Supported by NIH and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Jan A. Gorter, 2 Karin Boer, 1 Erwin Van Vliet, 2 Sandra Redeker, 3 Fernando H. Lopes da Silva, 3 Wytse J. Wadman, and 2 Eleonora Aronica ( 1 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences/Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; and 3 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ) Rationale: The complement cascade has been suggested to be involved in the inflammatory responses observed in a variety of disorders of the central nervous system. Recent evidence suggests that complement activation may contribute to seizure activity and promote neurodegeneration. We investigated the possible involvement of the complement cascade during epileptogenesis in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the chronic phase of spontaneous seizures in both experimental as well as human TLE. Methods: RNA was obtained from three different brain regions (CA3, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum) at three different time points (1 day = acute phase; and 1 week = latent phase; 3?4 months = chronic epileptic phase) after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE) in rat. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Gene Chip System (230A). The immunohistochemical pattern of C1q, C3c and C3d was assessed in human hippocampal specimens from controls and medically intractable TLE with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Results: Genes involved in the complement pathway (e.g. C1qa, C1qc, C3, C4a, Cfh) were upregulated after induction of SE in rat and remained elevated in the chronic phase. C1qa and C1qc were already induced in the acute phase. C3, C4a and C8b were induced in the latent phase and showed the highest expression at the end of the latent period. In human TLE with HS, glial expression of C1q, C3c and C3d was observed particularly within regions where neuronal cell loss occurs (e.g. CA1 and hilus). Conclusions: Our data indicate that within the immune response the complement activation represents a prominent process during epileptogenesis. The persistence of complement activation is supported by the data on human HS specimen showing increased expression of complement factors in activated glial cells. Although the complement system may be useful in eliminating aggregated and harmful proteins associated with epilepsy, abnormal activation of the complement system can also have damaging effects through activation of inflammatory processes.

Hantus, 1 Dileep Nair, 1 Richard Burgess, and 1 Imad Najm ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: One third of epilepsy patients are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a well-recognized cause of refractory epilepsy that can often be cured by surgical resection. The presence of periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is associated with the development of epilepsy, although the role of these lesions in the generation of epileptogenicity and their cellular/molecular characteristics remain unclear. Methods: In this report, we present the histological and immunocytochemical (ICC) characteristics of a periventricular nodule that was resected from a 17 years old female with a history of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, a lateral temporal MCD and multiple PVH. Invasive video electrographic encephalography (VEEG) with subdural electrodes and a depth electrode targeted at the PVH did not confirm the PVH as the seizure onset zone. The patient underwent a temporal lobectomy that included the removal of a subcortical nodule. She remained seizure free on no antiepileptics for four years, then presented with a single generalized seizure. Results: Histological and ICC examinations of the resected nodule showed dysmorphic neurons lacking any laminar or columnar organizations. These neurons were intermixed with GFAP positive glial cells, immature neurons (TUJ1 positive) and immature astrocytes (vimentin positive). Some subcortical neurons expressed doublecortin, a marker of migrating cells. The expression of GABA (Calbindin, parvalbumin) and NMDA (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) receptors were also examined. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PVH is constituted of a mixture of neuronal and glial cells at various levels of differentiation that failed to mature and migrate to their final position in the neocortex. It is unclear if these nodules are epileptogenic. Further studies of the role of PVH in epilepsy are needed in order to further characterize the electrophysiology and molecular biology of the constituent cells of these lesions and their overlying neocortical areas. 1 David C.

Simon, and 2 Robert Meller ( 1 Physiology  2 RS Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ; and 3 Oregon Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Neurological Sciences Center, Portland, OR ) Rationale: The role of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is incompletely understood. Experimental modeling suggests seizures activate TNFR1 and downstream pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades, although little is known about whether these pathways function in human TLE brain. Methods: We examined TNFR1 signaling in hippocampus surgically obtained from refractory TLE patients (n = 10), and compared results to matched autopsy controls (n = 6). TNFR1 signaling was also examined in hippocampus obtained from mice following focally-evoked limbic seizures. Samples were processed for detection of protein in whole cell lysates or subcellular fractions, immunoprecipitation studies and immunohistochemistry. Results: Western blotting established total protein levels of the TNFR1 proximal signaling adaptor TNFR-associated protein with death domain (TRADD) and cleaved caspase-8 were higher in TLE samples than matched autopsy controls. Intracellular distribution analyses determined cytoplasmic levels of TNFR1, TRADD and the caspase-8 recruitment adaptor Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and microsomal levels of TRADD, FADD and cleaved caspase-8, were raised in TLE samples. Immunoprecipitation studies, supported by fluorescence microscopy revealed increased TNFR1-TRADD and TRADD-FADD association in TLE samples. Expression and localization of these proteins was similar in mouse hippocampus. Seizures evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid increased microsomal levels of TNFR1 signaling components and triggered TNFR1-TRADD and TRADD-FADD complex formation and caspase-8 processing. Conclusions: These data show seizures in mice activate hippocampal TNFR1 signaling and reveal this pathway to be engaged in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Accordingly, the TNFR1 pathway may be a potential target for adjunctive neuroprotective therapy following status epilepticus or in the setting of recurrent epileptic seizures.

Most of the resected hippocampi of patients with TLE resistant to pharmacological treatment are characterized by neuronal loss and abnormal mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the fascia dentata. The main goal of this work was to study neuron density and mossy fiber distribution in the hippocampi of TLE patients with different MRI volumetric hippocampal profiles. Methods: Using MRI hippocampal volumetry, patients were classified as: 1) normal volume (NV; n = 8; hippocampal volume with at least 2.5 cm3); 2) mild atrophy (MA; n = 9; hippocampal volume between 2 and 2.5 cm3); and 3) severe atrophy (SA; n = 10; hippocampal volume with less than 2 cm3). Corresponding hippocampal histological sections were stained with cresylecht violet or hematoxylin/eosin for hippocampal cell counts and neo-Timm histochemistry for mossy fiber detection. Histological controls were autopsy patients (n = 13; without antemortem clinical seizures or evidence of brain pathology on postmortem examination). Results: 1) Compared to autopsies, all three TLE groups showed loss of granular cells (NV: 44%; MA: 43%; SA: 48%) and CA1 (NV: 83%; MA: 69%; SA: 72%), CA2 (NV: 39%; MA: 39%; SA: 47%); CA3a (NV: 64%; MA: 70%; SA: 62%) and CA4 (NV: 55%; MA: 63%; SA: 64%) pyramidal cells, p < 0.001; 2) all TLE groups presented higher neo-Timm staining in the inner molecular layer of the fascia dentata than their autopsy controls (gray level: Control: 7,6 ± 4; NV: 72,6 ± 8; MA: 90,8 ± 10,8; SA: 95,5 ± 8; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Atrophy profile observed on MRI does not necessarily reflect either cell loss intensity or axonal reorganization in patients with TLE. (Supported by BAP-FAMERP; FAPESP ?

The present study was designed to demonstrate: i) a pathological vascularization associated with TLE, ii) angiogenic processes active in chronic focus, iii) an impact of vascular remodeling on epileptogenicity. Methods: Hippocampi were collected from 40 patients after surgery for intractable TLE with various etiologies and from 5 non epileptic (NE) patients (autopsies or hippocampectomy for parahippocampal tumor). By immunohistochemistry or immunoblot, we evaluated: microvessel density, expression of markers of immature endothelial cells, of angiogenic factors and their receptors. We also checked impairments of blood brain barrier (BBB). In parallel, we studied the kinetics of these processes in the rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced limbic epilepsy. Results: We observed division markers in vascular cells in neurogenic areas of epileptic hippocampi. The microvessel density was significantly higher in TLE patients than in NE patients. More, there was no quantitative differences between TLE with hippocampal sclerosis and TLE with other etiologies. Most of these microvessels were positive for markers of immature endothelial cells. The angiogenic factor VEGF was expressed mainly by neurons and often by astrocytes, and its receptor Flk-1 was localized on thin vascular sprouts. In all cases of TLE, we observed impairments of BBB, allowing IgG leakage and blood cell extravasation. In rats, the degree of vascularization increased progressively from 1 week after status epilepticus. VEGF was rapidly and strongly overexpressed after seizures, whereas the other markers appeared during the silent period. The BBB was early damaged. In the chronic stage, these phenomena were still obvious, as for human TLE. Conclusions: For the first time, we demonstrate a neo-vascularization of the TLE focus, independently of etiology. We suggest that the pathological angiogenic processes are related to the persistent inflammation and are maintained by recurrent seizures. The consequences of this vascular remodeling may concern hemodynamics, inflammation, neurotoxicity, BBB permeability and drug refractoriness.

Becker ( 1 Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn ) Rationale: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are characterized by a localized malformation of the neocortex and the underlying white matter. Balloon cells, similar to those observed in tuberous sclerosis (TSC) are present in a significant number of cases (FCDIIb). Histopathological similarities indicate that FCDIIb may be pathogenetically related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, that normally constitute a tumor suppressor mechanism. Accumulation of coding allelic variants affecting exons 5 and 17 of TSC1 as well as loss of heterozygosity of the second TSC1 allele have been observed in many FCDIIb patients (Becker et al., Ann Neurol 2002). Here, we have studied the potential functional relevance of coding allelic variants of TSC1 found in FCDIIb with respect to the interaction of the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Methods: Sequence variants of the TSC1 allele found in FCDIIb patients were introduced in the full-length TSC1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. M. Nellist, Amsterdam) by site-directed mutagenesis. We have further generated TSC1 cDNA variants with mutations found in TSC patients, i.e. by introducing premature stop codons. Protein interaction assays were performed to analyze a potentially compromised interaction between the TSC1/2 proteins hamartin and tuberin. Results: TSC1 sequence variants were successfully introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Compromised interaction of the hamartin-tuberin complex was most pronounced in TSC1 mutants bearing the premature stop codon at position R692X (p < 0.01). Sequence alterations of TSC1 present in FCDIIb (H732Y) also resulted in significantly compromised TSC1/2-interaction compared to wild-type TSC1 (p < 0.05). The latter was comparable to findings obtained by the expression of the TSC-determining allele variant R786X. Conclusions: Our data suggest, that allelic variants with amino acid exchange of the TSC1 gene in FCDIIb may be associated with compromised TSC1/TSC2 interaction. The functional relevance is currently studied in cell culture and animal systems.

The aim of our study is to systematically review the pathology around the cyst in patients with epilepsy treated with AC and cortical resection. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient data from epilepsy surgeries at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1978 and 2006. Only those patients treated with resection of cyst and adjacent cortex were included in the study. Patients' records were reviewed for demographic data, follow-up duration, EEG, MRI or CT imaging, and histopathology reports. Results: Of 1880 patients, only 10 patients had AC and six were treated with cyst resection. There were five males and one female patient. The locations of the AC were in the left temporal fossa in four, left peri-rolandic region and right sylvian fissure in one each. Ictal onset zone was localized to the AC region in all patients. The mean duration of epilepsy was 12.2 + 8.8 years and the mean cyst size was 5.7 ? 4.2 ? 4 cms. Review of pathology showed mild subpial gliosis around the AC in all patients. Four of these showed normal adjacent cortex. However, one patient showed mild cortical dysplasia and another showed hippocampal sclerosis. At follow-up ranging from 9 ± 0.24 months, all 6 patients were seizure free (one patient had 3 seizures at 2 months and none thereafter). Patients with abnormal cortical pathology were found to have earlier onset, longer duration, and lower frequency of seizures. Conclusions: A cortical abnormality either independently or in association with subpial gliosis appears to be the cause of seizures in patients with AC. Identifying the cortical pathology preoperatively with the help of high-resolution MRI and a dedicated epilepsy imaging protocol could influence the type and extent of resection required. It is important to have proper orientation of the cyst and adjacent cortex in order to verify the pathological substrate for the seizures. 1 Mary T. Silvia, 3 Alexander R. Judkins, 2 Phillip B. Storm, 1 Robert G. Kalb, and 1 Brenda E. Porter ( 1 Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery ; and 3 Department of Neuropathology ) Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is the cause of intractable pediatric epilepsy in up to 60% of surgical case series.1 Previously identified histologic features of CD include large dysmorphic neurons and prominent disorganized neurites. We hypothesize that there are differences in dendrite morphology (total dendrite length and branching patterns) between CD tissue and controls. To better understand the cellular morphology of CD, we quantitatively characterized the dendritic tree of dysmorphic neurons from Palmini grade II A and II B dysplasia from children with refractory epilepsy.2 Methods: Tissue from pediatric CD patients was collected at the time of epilepsy surgery and stained using the Golgi-cox method. We have analyzed dendrite length and branching order from 3 refractory patients. Dendrites attached to the cell body are first order dendrites and those arising from the first order are called second order dendrites, and so on. Branching order is a measure of the neuron's dendrite tree complexity. Dendrite length refers to the summed total of the basilar dendritic tree. Slides were analyzed for total dendrite length, and dendrite order for at least 10 neurons per patient and compared against literature autopsy controls.2,3 Results: Patients 1, 2, and 3 were 11% (461?m ± 74.7 SEM), 30.3% (1271 ?m ± 182.3 SEM) and 17.0% (714.8 ?m ± 121.5 SEM) of the total dendrite tree length compared to literature controls (4193.4 ?m ± 250 SEM). The most complex of our patients neurons branched to the 5th order, compared to the 8th order in controls. The largest difference in branching order occurred in 3rd and 4th branches, with Patients 1, 2, and 3 at 8%, 22%, and 2.7% of the control values, respectively, for number of dendrites per cell that branched to a 4th order. Conclusions: Pediatric CD tissue varied significantly from literature autopsy controls', with shorter total dendrite length per cell and decreased branching, indicating that CD dendrite trees are smaller and simpler in structure. Our findings suggest that the large and disorganized appearance of neurites in type II CD is associated with lack of dendrite organization rather than dysmorphic neurons with enlarged dendrite trees. Our data also suggest the dysmorphic neurons are similar to immature neurons with less complex dendrite trees. We are analyzing autopsy specimens from multiple ages to address this issue.

Several reports have described the neurogenesis from surgical specimens of temporal lobe epilepsy, not only in an animal epilepsy model. However, the function of neurogenesis remains to elucidate. We herein examined the neurogenesis in the human hippocampus from temporal lobe epilepsy patients by immunohistochemical staining, and compared the neurogenesis between the specimens from hippocampal sclerosis and non-hippocampal sclerosis. Methods: Six surgical specimens were examined by immunohistochemical staining using NeuroD, PSA-NCAM, GFAP, Ki-67. Three cases thus demonstrated hippocampal sclerosis in both magnet resonance imaging and pathological evaluations, and another 3 showed non-hippocampal sclerosis. The cell counting of positive cells of each type of staining was applied in the ammon horn and the dentate gyrus. We also observed the nature of the cell and axon with positive staining. Results: PSA-NCAM positive cells were mostly detected in the hilus, and also in the granule cell and CA1 pyramidal cell layers in both the hippocampal sclerosis and non-hippocampal sclerosis groups. The PSA-NCAM positive immature neurons were co-stained with NeuN, but not with either NeuroD or Ki-67. The PSA-NCAM positive immature neurons were frequently detected in the non-hippocampal sclerosis group. Conclusions: The PSA-NCAM and NeuN co-stained immature neurons were located in the hilus of human temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the ability of neurogenesis was found to be higher in the non-hippocampal sclerosis group than in the hippocampal sclerosis group.

Loeb ( 1 Department of Nuerology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI ; 2 Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics ; 3 Department of Pediatrics ; and 4 Department of Pathology ) Rationale: Cortical malformations are one of the most common causes of medically intractable epilepsy. One of the more common malformations is polymicrogyria (PMG), where up to 80% of patients have epilepsy. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this high incidence of epilepsy are not known, nor is it known if epileptic regions of neocortex differ between patients with PMG and patients with non-lesional neocortical epilepsy. Recently, we used a functional genomic strategy to identify a small group of activity-depdnent genes are induced in neocortical epileptic foci, regardless of the underlying cause. Here, we hypothesize that both common and as well as unique patterns of gene expression can be identified in children with PMG compared to patients with non-lesional neocortical epilepsy. Localization of these induced genes can identify neuronal populations involved human epilepsy associated with malformations. Methods: Electrically mapped neocortical tissue was obtained from 8 children with intractable epilepsy (4 with PMG, and 4 with gliosis) who underwent a two-stage surgical resection. The seizure onset region and a nearby area without spontaneous epileptiform activity as a ?control? were compared by histology, real-time qPCR, and Agilent genome wide microarrays. Genes identified as differentially expressed were characterized further by in situ hybridization to identify populations of activated neurons. Results: Despite a marked difference in tissue histology between PMG patients and those with gliosis, there was a remarkably similar pattern of gene induction at regions of seizure onset and maximal interictal spiking. Patients without malformations expressed these activity-dependent genes predominantly in normal-appearing layers II-IV pyramidal neurons. In patients with PMG, these same genes were also restricted to layer II-IV neurons, in highly epileptic regions directly adjacent to thickened layer I regions in the polymicrogyri. In addition to common gene expression changes, we also identified genes uniquely altered in PMG neocortex that could underlie some of the morphollgical features of this malformation. Conclusions: Results genomic studies of PMG suggest that similar molecular pathways are activated in PMG as in other non-lesional forms of neocortical epilepsy, however, the expression of some of these activity-dependent genes in PMG localize to neurons directly adjacent to malformations. In addition, there are unique patterns of gene expression in PMG that are likely to relate directly to the malformation. (Supported by: 1. NIH NINDS R01 NS45207.; 2.

Talos, 2 Joseph R. Madsen, 2 Peter M. Black, and 1 Frances E. Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: The most common neurological symptom of human neocortical dysplasias is early-life epilepsy, including infantile spasms. Frequently, these patients develop pharmaco-resistant seizure disorders, which require surgical excision. The exact mechanisms of epileptogenesis and high incidence of pharmaco-resistance to conventional antiepileptic drugs (AED) in cortical dysplasias are poorly understood. GABA receptors (GABARs), which are normally hyperpolarizing, can become depolarizing under certain circumstances and actually increase neuronal excitation. This depends on the intracellular chloride concentration, regulated by the chloride-importer NKCC1 and the chloride-exporter KCC2. Increased NKCC1 and decreased KCC2 expression in hippocampal subiculum from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients renders GABARs depolarizing (PNAS 103:8465;2006). We hypothesized that similar to TLE, neurons from neocortical dysplastic tissue would demonstrate higher NKCC1 expression and lower KCC2 levels relative to control neurons, a profile consistent with the presence of depolarizing GABARs. Methods: Cortical tissue from 6 patients ages 1?6 years were obtained during brain surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy. In all cases, malformations of cortical development were confirmed by histopathological examination (tuberous sclerosis, n = 3; focal cortical dysplasia, n = 2; hemimegalencephaly, n = 1). Age-matched autopsy cortical samples from cases with normal neurologic history were used as controls (n = 4). Tissue was collected and handled in accordance with the Clinical Research Committee at Children's Hospital, Boston. 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue blocks were cut at 50 microns and immunohistochemically double labeled with cell markers (NeuN, non-phosphorylated neurofilament, vimentin, GFAP) in combination with transporter antibodies NKCC1 (1:100, Chemicon) and KCC2 (1:500, Upstate). Results: Staining of dysplastic tissue with neuronal and glial markers demonstrated loss of cortical lamination, the presence of disoriented, misshaped neurons, an increase in number of white matter neurons and a variable degree of gliosis. In addition, in cortical tubers and hemimegalencephaly tissue, cytomegalic dysplastic neurons could be easily identified. In all cases, increased NKCC1 expression associated with a moderate decrease in KCC2 levels was observed in most normal-size and cytomegalic dysplastic neurons, compared to controls. Notably, strong NKCC1 immunoreactivity was observed in glial cell population as well. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an imbalance in neuronal NKCC1 and KCC2 expression (increased NKCC1: KCC2 ratio) in human neocortical dysplasias that may render GABARs depolarizing. This mechanism may play a critical role in increased seizure susceptibility and relative refractoriness to GABAR agonists in these patients.

Najm ( 1 Department of Neurology, Section of Adult Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method often used for the assessment of patients with epilepsy. More than a quarter of patients who present with drug-resistant epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia (CD) show no MRI abnormalities. The role of differential expression of glutamate receptors as a substrate for hyperexcitability in epilepsy has been shown. We intended to develop a non-invasive and sensitive imaging technique to be used with specific biomarkers for epileptic tissue. Methods: Anti-NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) antibody (Chemicon AB1516) was labeled with Gd-DOTA (NR1/Gd-DOTA) using an activated carboxyl to create an amide coupling. In a first study, ex vivo human brain slice tissue was maintained alive immediately following surgical resection, and optimized T1-weighted MRI was acquired using a 9.4T MRI scanner. Following baseline MRI, each tissue was treated with NR1/Gd-DOTA or NR1 without Gd-DOTA for two hours and washed for one hour to remove non-specific binding. In a second study, MRI (7.0T) was acquired before and after ex vivo live rat brain slices were treated with NR1/Gd-DOTA or control treatments (vehicle only, Gd-DOTA only or anti-NR1 only). Additional 3-hour washing followed by MRI was conducted in order to verify signal variation over time. Results: The first study (Figure) demonstrated that optimized high-field MRI and antibody-based MRI probes can be used to non-invasively detect cell receptors within freshly resected brain tissue. The second study validated that MRI contrast was due to specific binding of the labeled antibody to cell receptors. Fading in the signal detected after additional washing revealed a temporal dependence on the amount of antibody probe bound to tissue slices. Conclusions: Our preliminary data show that NR1 protein can be detected in freshly harvested human and rat brain tissue samples using high field MRI techniques. The development and application of new antibody-based MRI probes that can be selectively detected and quantified will provide a new platform technology for visualizing molecular substrates of epileptogenic brain areas and other pathologies.

De Graan ( 1 Pharmacology and Anatomy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ; and 2 Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate have been linked to the initiation and maintenance of seizures in patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Impairment of the glutamate-glutamine cycle, responsible for the inactivation and recycling of extracellular glutamate, has been implicated.One of the key neuronal components of this cycle is the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT), which mediates the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Three types of VGLUTs have been identified so far. VGLUT1 is the major type in the hippocampus. Little is known about VGLUT expression in the human hippocampus. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in VGLUT expression in the hippocampus of patients with TLE. Methods: We examined the hippocampal distribution of the VGLUT subtypes by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation in 7 ?m paraffin sections. Protein levels were assessed by semi-quantitative western blotting. Measurements were performed in hippocampal biopsies obtained during surgical resection as treatment for TLE. Comparisons were made between hippocampi of TLE patients with (HS group) and without hippocampal sclerosis (nonHS group) and autopsy controls without neurological symptoms. Results: VGLUT1 immunoreactivity (IR) showed a diffuse neuropil staining of the subiculum, the pyramidal cell layer of all CA fields, the hilus, and the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Large punctate structures around neuronal cell bodies and axons were observed in CA4 and CA3. No IR was detected in cell bodies. VGLUT1 mRNA was abundant in granule cells and pyramidal neurons. In nonHS and HS hippocampi VGLUT1 mRNA levels were decreased compared to controls, especially in areas with neuron loss. However, VGLUT1 protein levels were significantly increased in the nonHS hippocampus compared to both the HS and control hippocampus. This upregulation indicates translational regulation within hippocampal neurons. In addition, VGLUT1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in the DG of the HS hippocampus, consistant with the increased number of mossy fiber synapses onto granule cells due to mossy fiber sprouting. VGLUT2 IR was very weak in controls, but it was upregulated in the molecular layer of the DG in TLE patients. In the nonHS group VGLUT2 IR was only found in the outer molecular layer, whereas in the HS group VGLUT2 was also present in the inner molecular layer. These data indicate an upregulation of VGLUT2 associated with mossy fiber sprouting. Conclusions: Hippocampal mRNA expression of VGLUT1 is decreased and correlates with loss of glutamatergic synapses due to neuron loss. The increase in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 protein found in TLE patients is most likely due to new glutamatergic synapse formation. This increase in glutamatergic signalling may contribute to the progression and pathology of TLE. 1 Jie Wu, 1 Jamie DeChon, 2 Nasim Bahadorani, 3 Harold Rekate, 1 John F. Kerrigan, and 2 Yongchang Chang ( 1 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Neurobiology, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: Human hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are associated with precocious puberty, gelastic seizures and severe refractory epilepsy. Emerging evidence suggests that the HH itself plays a pivotal role in this syndrome. ?-aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in modulation of fast inhibition through GABAA receptors. Abnormal GABAA receptor function is an important mechanism of epileptogenesis in various types of human epilepsy and animal epileptic models. However, it is unknown whether functional GABAA receptors are natively expressed in HH neurons ? and if so, what are the functional, pharmacological and molecular properties of these receptors. Methods: Acutely enzymatic/mechanical dissociation of HH neurons was performed. Fresh resected HH tissues were immediately placed in ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM): 136.7 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.1 NaH2PO4, 9.84 HEPES, 16.6 glucose and 21.9 sucrose. After incubation at 22 ± 1 °C for at least 1 h, tissue sections were treated with papain (4?6 mg/ml at 31 °C for 50?60 min), and then one tissue fragment was mechanically dissociated. Isolated single HH cells usually maintained function for 2?6 h. Perforated patch-clamp whole-cell recording combined with U-tube drug application was applied to characterize function and pharmacology of GABAA receptors. Results: Under perforated patch-clamp recording in voltage-clamp mode, GABA induced an inward current (IGABA) at a holding potential of ?50 mV. The IGABA was mimicked by a GABAA receptor agonist (muscimol) and blocked by GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline), suggesting that the IGABA was mainly mediated through the activation of the GABAA receptor. The concentration-response relationship curve of IGABA showed that the EC50 and Hill coefficient were 1.3 mM and 0.9, respectively. The current-voltage relationship current was linear at a reversal potential close to zero with a symmetric external and internal chloride concentration. HH neurons exhibited heterogeneity for allosteric modulations. Although most HH neurons presented an enhancement of IGABA by pentobarbital and pregnenalone, only ?60% of neurons showed potentiation of IGABA by diazepam. RT-PCR showed normal GABAA receptor subunit expression in HH tissues. Conclusions: We are the first to describe the functional, pharmacological and molecular properties of the GABAA receptor expressed in human HH. An understanding of functional GABAA receptors in HH neurons provides new insights into the epileptogenesis of gelastic seizures.

Levine, and 1 Carlos Cepeda ( 1 Mental Retardation Research Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA ; 2 Department of Neuropathology ; and 3 Division of Neurosurgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in TSC genes that encode hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2). These proteins affect cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation in multiple organs, including the brain. In particular, it has been suggested that these proteins may represent growth suppressors. Epilepsy is one of the major complications of TSC and affects about 85% of patients. TSC shares histopathologic similarities with severe forms of focal cortical dysplasia (CD), specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. Methods: In this study we examined the morphological and electrophysiological properties of cells in cortical tissue samples from pediatric cases with TSC (n = 11, ages 1.8?10.1 yr) or severe CD (n = 15, ages 0.2?14 yr), that underwent surgery for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Normal- and abnormal-appearing cells in slices were identified morphologically by infrared videomicroscopy and biocytin labeling (n = 72 in TSC and n = 151 in severe CD). Electrophysiological membrane properties were assessed with whole-cell patch clamp recordings in current and voltage clamp modes. Results: In both TSC and severe CD cases, abnormal-appearing cells were observed in the cortical mantle and classified into four principal groups. The first consisted of very large, pyramidal-shaped cells corresponding to cytomegalic neurons. The second group included large, non-pyramidal cells with atypical somatodendritic morphology that correspond to balloon cells. The third group included misoriented and dysmorphic pyramidal neurons, and the fourth consisted of immature-looking pyramidal cells. Morphologically, abnormal cells from TSC and severe CD cases were very similar. Electrophysiologically, the most abnormal properties were found in cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. Cytomegalic neurons were hyperexcitable, whereas balloon cells had no active inward currents and lacked synaptic inputs. Balloon cells were found more frequently in TSC cases, whereas cytomegalic pyramidal neurons occurred more frequently in severe CD cases. Conclusions: Besides the frequency of occurrence, there were no clear morphological or electrophysiological differences in cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells from TSC and CD patients, suggesting a link between the lesions produced by TSC gene mutations and the cellular alterations observed in severe forms of CD.

Najm ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) was recently identified as the specific binding site for levetiracetam in the brain and as a promising target for drug development. We have previously reported the differential expression of SV2A in the neocortex of patients with cortical dysplasia (CD)-associated pharmacoresistant epilepsy (Alexopoulos et al., Epilepsia 46 Suppl. 8:273, 2005). The objective of this study is to investigate the expression of the same protein in a well-characterized animal model of CD. Methods: Sprague-Dawley time-pregnant rats received 145cGy whole body irradiation at embryonic day 17, resulting in pups with multifocal hippocampal (HIP) and cortical abnormalities. These animals exhibit recurrent, spontaneous seizures following ?a second hit? in the form of a single dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ 30 mg/kg i.p.; postnatal day 60). Occurrence of seizures was confirmed by video-EEG and behavioral monitoring. Age-matched, nonirradiated controls received the same subconvulsive dose of PTZ. Video-EEG recordings were obtained for 1 month before and after PTZ injection in all animals. Brains were examined using Cresyl Violet and immunostaining for SV2A and neuron-specific nuclear protein. Results: Irradiated rats (n = 8), but not control rats (n = 3) developed spontaneous behavioral and electrographic seizures following PTZ (?second hit?), characterized by extended periods of arrest, facial or forelimb clonus and occasionally rearing and falling. Immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis in the cortex and HIP of non-irradiated controls showed SV2A to be localized in regions surrounding cell bodies. Punctate staining was observed in HIP areas occupied by mossy fiber terminals. Histological examination of stained slices of irradiated animals confirmed the presence of multifocal CD and neuronal dispersion in HIP. ICC analysis of irradiated epileptic animals displayed a redistribution of the SV2A protein from the cell bodies to the neuropil (figure 1). SV2A in HIP of irradiated rats occupied the area of the hilus and apical dendrites in the dentate gyrus and cornus ammonis. Conclusions: The differential changes in SV2A immunoreactivity following recurrent seizures in dysplastic but not control animals are reminiscent of those observed in human epileptic and dysplastic tissue. Further studies will examine the influence of seizures in the SV2A redistribution, and its potential role in the expression of epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance.

Edward Dudek ( 1 Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Animal models of chronic epilepsy with spontaneous seizures may be useful for antiepileptic (AED) drug development. Convenient and effective methods for testing potential AEDs over days and weeks should facilitate many experiments. This study investigated the effect of carbamazepine (CBZ) administered in food pellets on rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Methods: Adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley; 150?250 g) were given repeated low-dose kainate treatment (5 mg/kg ip hourly until convulsive status epilepticus persisted >3 h). Food pellets with CBZ were provided (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day) in three 2-week trials (n = 7?9 rats) involving 5 days of CBZ or control treatment, separated by 2 recovery days. The total amount of food provided corresponded to normal caloric diet of 60 gm/kg/day. Results: All animals consumed the entire daily drug-in-food dose intermittently but continuously throughout the 24-h day. CBZ significantly reduced mean seizure frequency in a dose-dependent manner. At 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, CBZ treatment consistently failed to block all motor seizures, but no motor seizures were observed in any of the rats at 300 mg/kg/day. Conclusions: This AED-in-food protocol appears to be an effective means of chronic drug administration. When administered over 5-day periods, CBZ reduced the frequency of spontaneous motor seizures in a dose-dependent manner, but very high doses were required to block all motor seizures. The effects on electrographic seizures remain to be determined. (Supported by NS 049620 (FED).) 1 Michael R. Kasten, 1 Sanghoon Lee, and 1 Matthew P. Anderson ( 1 Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Recent studies have found epilepsy-associated mutations in non-ion channel genes. LGI1, a secreted protein of unknown function, was found to be mutated in patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). To investigate the functional effects of this protein on native neural circuits, we developed methods to study wild-type and mutant LGI1 protein in living brain tissue. Methods: Transgenic mice were created using a full-length LGI1 gene engineered to contain the epilepsy-associated LGI1 gene mutations. We also created transgenic mice using the wild-type, full-length LGI1 gene. In order to measure the effect of this mutant protein on neuron excitability and synaptic communication, we prepared acute brain slices from adult LGI1 transgenic and control mice and compared the electrophysiological properties of individual neurons. Because ADLTE is characterized by auditory hallucinations during seizures, we studied neurons in a second order thalamic nucleus that relays auditory sensation to the cortex, the dorsal medial geniculate nucleus (DMGn). Results: Mutant LGI1 transgene increased the intrinsic excitability of DMGn thalamic neurons. Mutant LGI1 transgene also increased phosphorylation of a number of protein kinases. Conclusions: These findings support our current hypothesis that mutant LGI1 causes epilepsy through a unique mechanism involving altered signal transduction.

Scammell, 1 Donald L. Schomer, and 1 Matthew P. Anderson ( 1 Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) with auditory features were recently found to harbor mutations in the non-ion channel protein LGI1. To determine if mutations of this protein are sufficient to produce epilepsy, we created a transgenic mouse from the full-length LGI1 gene engineered to contain an epilepsy-associated gene mutation. As a control, other transgenic mice were also created that carry extra copies of the wild-type, full-length LGI1 gene. We predicted that ADLTE mutant LGI1 will produce epilepsy in mice. Methods: Mice of each genotype were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes for polysomnogram recording. After > 9 days of recovery from surgery, they were transferred to recording cages in a sound-attenuated chamber with a 12 hr light/dark (LD) cycle (30 lux; lights on at 7:00 A.M. and off at 7:00 P.M.) and a constant temperature (22?24°C) for 5 days of continuous recording. Video recordings were also performed during the last day in a subset of mice. The signals were digitally filtered (EEG, 0.3?30 Hz; EMG, 2?100 Hz) and semi-automatically scored in 10 sec epochs as wake, NREM sleep, REM sleep, or seizures. Sleep analyses were focused on the last recording day. The preliminary scoring was visually inspected and corrected when appropriate. Results: Mutant LGI1 transgenic (n = 5), full-length LGI1 transgenic (n = 4), and wild-type littermate (n = 5) mice showed no significant differences in the hourly amounts of NREM, REM, or wakefulness. Seizures induced by pentylene-tetrazol (60 mg/kg, i.p.) were also examined. Conclusions: ADLTE mutant LGI1 transgene does not significantly influence the pattern of sleep. We are currently testing the hypothesis that mutant LGI1 is sufficient to cause epilepsy.

Aujla, 2 Michael Fetell, and 1 Frances Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 2 IVAX Pharmaceuticals, Key Biscayne, FL ) Rationale: Hypoxic encephalopathy is a major cause of neonatal seizures, and can lead to long term neurologic deficit and epilepsy. Neonatal seizures can be refractory to conventional AED medication. AMPARs are overexpressed on cortical neurons in the neonatal rat and term human, when the susceptibility to hypoxic seizures is highest (J. Comp. Neur. 2006; 497:42). We have shown that the AMPA subtype of neuronal glutamate receptors in cortex and hippocampus play a critical epileptogenic role in a rodent model of neonatal seizures (J. Neurosci. 2005; 25:3442), and AMPAR antagonists such as NBQX and topiramate effectively suppress the acute and long term epileptogenic effects of hypoxia in the perinatal rodent (Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50:366; Epilepsia 2004; 45:569). Here we evaluated the efficacy of talampanel (GYKI-53773), a novel orally-available non-competitive AMPAR antagonist in our rodent model. Methods: P10 rat pups were exposed to global hypoxia per our previous protocols (J. Neurosci. 2001; 21:8154). Rats were pretreated i.p. with talampanel or vehicle 30 minutes prior to hypoxia and seizure time and severity were recorded by videotape and scored blinded. A second outcome measure was evaluated by assessing susceptibility of rats to KA-induced seizures 20 days (P30) after they were exposed to hypoxia. KA was administered i.p. (10 mg/kg) and seizure activity was recorded over a 3-hour period. Rats given KA on P30 were killed on P33 by transcardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Each brain was removed, postfixed, cyroprotected in 20% sucrose overnight, and mounted onto a freezing microtome. To quantify DNA fragmentation, counts of positively stained cells per 12,500?m2 in CA1, CA3 and amygdala were made as previously described (Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50:366). Results: Acute hypoxia-induced seizures at P10 were suppressed by talampanel in a dose-related manner. Anticonvulsant activity was maximal at 7.5 and 10 mg/kg, where seizures were blocked 74.6% at 10 mg/kg (25.4 ± 7.3, n = 17; p < 0.001) and 86.7% at 7.5 mg/kg (13.3 ± 3.2, n = 17; p < 0.001). Rats pretreated with vehicle prior to hypoxia showed significantly more neuronal injury in amygdala following KA-induced seizure at P30 than did nonhypoxic controls or rats pretreated with talampanel (7.5 and 10 mg/kg) prior to hypoxia at P10 (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). Conclusions: Talampanel exhibited a dose-dependent effect on hypoxia-induced hypoxic seizures in the immature rat. Futhermore, acute talampanel treatment during hypoxia protected the rats from later life increases in seizure susceptibility that are observed in vehicle treated hypoxic controls. These data suggest talampanel may have clinical potential in the treatment of neonatal seizures.

PPARα activation by fenofibrate can protect cerebral injury by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we tested PPARα activation on the cerebral excitability before study its potent neuroprotective effects in status epilepticus. Methods: Wistar rats (280g-320g) were separated in two groups (n = 8). Sham group (Sh) received a complete powder diet ad libidum, while experimental group (F) received powder diet containing 0.2% fenofibrate. After 14 days of treatment, pentylenetetrazole threshold (PTZth) was used to assess anti-convulsive effect. PTZ was dissolved in a saline solution (10 mg/ml) and was infused i.v. at 5 ml/h. Two threshold doses (mg/kg) were studied: the first bilateral forelimb myoclonus and the start of generalized seizure. Liver weights were recorded in each animal to assess that fenofibrate was pharmacologically active. All values are given as mean ± sem. Results: Rats receiving diet with 0.2% Fenofibrate had an increase of liver weight (liver weight/body weight): 0.063 ± 0.004 versus 0.036 ± 0.002 (p = 0.001). Myoclonic and seizure PTZ thresholds were increased in F group in comparison to Sh group: myoclonic PTZth were 40.85 ± 3.06 mg/kg in F group vs. 34.28 ± 1.26 mg/kg (Sh) (p = 0.028); seizure PTZth were 46.85 ± 3.58 mg/kg in F group vs. 37.29 ± 1.8 mg/kg (Sh) (p = 0.021). Conclusions: A treatment with 0.2% fenofibrate significantly increases myoclonic and seizure PTZ thresholds suggesting anticonvulsive proprieties. The role of PPAR activation in brain excitability should be investigated.

Miller ( 1 Pediatrics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: We used the rat in utero radiation model of cortical dysplasia (CD), which is characterized postnatally (P) by neuronal dyslaminations, polarity disorientations, and daily increases in cortical thickness. At P30 these rats may exhibit cortical seizures from the region of the permanent CD. Because the CD is present at birth and increases daily in size with the growth of neurons and dendrites, we hypothesized that a permanent increase in NMDA receptor densities may develop early in the first week to enhance CD neurons' excitability. Methods: Dams were radiated with 145 Rads (cGy) at embryonic day 17 (E17), their offspring were studied at 24 hour intervals, postnatal ages P0?10 and P21?36. The development of CDs measured neuron sizes and neuron densities in cortical layers II-V. Densities were compared to age matched controls using stereology. In siblings, expressions of NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B were measured by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Statistics between control and radiated age matched pups were made between treatments and across ages. Results: Daily increases in neuron sizes were found from P0 through P10 in both groups, and after that there were no greater cytoplasmic increases in either group. At P0 and P1 nearly all neurons were spherical or oval in shape, lacking dendritic processes. At P2 neurons developed larger cytoplasms and larger proximal dendrites, which gave the neurons a pyramidal shape in all cortical layers. Growth of dendritic and axonal processes began at P2 and continued after P10. The expression levels for NR1 and NR2B at P0 and P1 were low, but increased significantly by P2; however, this increase plateaued after P2 and through P10. It is important to note that these developmental patterns were the same for both radiated and nonradiated pups. Conclusions: We used the rat in utero radiation model to identify postnatal malformations of cortical neurons and their NMDA receptor subunit expressions. During the earliest postnatal period, P0-P10 the cortex is expanding with increasing neuron sizes and neuritic outgrowths. Only P0 and P1 had significantly immature neurogenesis, with small, round neurons lacking dendrites and having the lowest NMDA receptor expressions. At P2-P10 neuron sizes and dendritic lengths increased. Also, at P2 NMDA expressions were maximal, and neither NR1 nor NR2B expressions increased on subsequent days. These developmental patterns in neurons and receptors were the same for control and radiated rats that always had permanent CD starting at birth. Hence, the later (P30) process of epilepsy likely occurs when all the axo-dendritic synapses, including aberrant excitatory connections within the CD, are fully mature.

Michalopoulos, 4Cristian Achim, and 1,2,3 Elizabeth M. Powell ( 1 Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: Inhibitory neurotransmission functions in neural circuits by repressing of excitatory output. Local GABAergic interneurons are the main source of inhibition in the cerebral cortex. Loss of these neurons leads to epilepsy along with other neurological disorders. Interneuron development is tightly regulated by molecular cues including hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). HGF/SF signals via its receptor MET to promote cellular survival, differentiation, mitogenesis and migration dependent upon cellular context. HGF/SF, which is secreted as a single chain precursor form, must be cleaved for biological function by serine proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). uPAR, the receptor of uPA, efficiently increases the protease cleavage by uPA. Adult uPAR?/? mice have decreased numbers of neocortical GABAergic interneurons and severe behavioral dysfunction such as spontaneously generated seizure and increased susceptibility to PTZ(pentylenetretrazol)-induced seizures. These defects of GABAergic interneurons have been attributed to a reduction of HGF/SF. Methods: The uPAR?/? mouse was bred with transgenic mouse overexpressing HGF/SF under the astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (GFAP). Immunohistochemistry and seizure behaviors to PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) were used to evaluate anatomical and functional recovery of GABAergic interneuron in wildtype, GFAP-Hgf, uPAR?/?, and uPAR?/?:GFAP-Hgf mice. Results: The loss of interneurons in the uPAR?/? mouse is restored in uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse, in which the uPAR?/? mouse was bred with an HGF-overexpressing mouse line (GFAP-HGF). Reduction of PV(parvalbumin), a marker of GABAergic neuron, in the uPAR?/? mouse is rescued in uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse (Figure 1). The seizure susceptibility to PTZ of uPAR?/? mice is decreased in the uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse, to frequencies and severity observed in wildtype animals. The latency to seizure activity after PTZ treatment is also increased in the uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse as compared to uPAR?/? mouse. Conclusions: These data suggest that restoring HGF/SF levels can recover the anatomical interneuron defects and neocortical circuitry, leading to prevention of the seizure activity of uPAR?/? mice. This study will help uncover molecular mechanisms critical for seizure onset and their possible therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

Beachy ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT and 2 Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 1- 2/1000 live births. Approximately 40% of the infants with HIE and neonatal seizures develop epilepsy by 4 years of age. The Levine rat pup model of hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) insult is a well characterized model of HIE. Recently, it has been reported that 40% of rat pups exposed to H/I insult at 7 days of age exhibit spontaneous seizures by 6 months of age (Epilepsia 2004; 45(10):1210?1218). We hypothesize that a H/I insult will alter seizure threshold and, thus, predispose the rat to the development of spontaneous seizure activity. Methods: Seven day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were anesthetized with isoflurane and subjected to right carotid artery ligation. After recovery, the pups were returned to their dams for 2 hours. Pups were then exposed to 8% oxygen/92% nitrogen for 2 hours. Temperature was maintained at 34.5?36°C. Convulsive current curves for clonic (forebrain) and tonic (hindbrain) seizures were generated at 1 and 2 months after H/I insult and compared to those obtained from age- and sex-matched naive control rats (> 25 rats per treatment group). Data were compared using Probit analysis (Minitab statistical software program). Results: Data for each seizure type is presented as CC50, the current at which 50% of the rats exhibited seizures ± standard error. A decrease in CC50 suggests increased seizure susceptibility. In naive male rats, CC50 significantly increased over time. Female naive rats had significantly deceased CC50 at 2 months of age (clonic 18.2 ± 0.4 mA, tonic 29.2 ± 0.9 mA) when compared to male naive rats (clonic 27.3 ± 0.9 mA, tonic 52.6 ± 1.4 mA). When compared to naive female rats, the CC50 for clonic seizures in female rats was significantly decreased (p = 0.005) at 1 month post H/I insult but increased at 2 months (p = 0.001). CC50 for tonic seizures in female naive and H/I rats did not differ. Male rats exhibited increased CC50 for tonic seizures (p = 0.007) at 1 month (35.5 ± 1.2 mA) and 2 months (61.6 ± 1.7 mA) when compared to naive male rats (28.3 ± 1.7 mA and 52.6 ± 1.4 mA, respectively). Conclusions: Alteration in seizure susceptibility is dependent on sex and time after H/I insult. Female rat pups exhibited enhanced clonic (forebrain) seizure susceptibility at 1 month after H/I insult but deceased susceptibility 2 months after insult. Interestingly, H/I insult in male rats decreased tonic seizure susceptibilty at 1 and 2 months after insult. Thus, H/I insult does not appear to consistently increase seizure susceptibility as evaluted by the MES method. Based on these results, it would appear that electrical population seizure threshold testing is not predictive of long-term outcome (e.g. spontaneous seizure activity).

Cole, and 1 Fei Zhu ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA ; and 2 Epilepsy Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: We sought to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TcES) via concentric ring electrodes on ictal electrographic and behavioral activity and mortality in rats with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (290?330 g) were briefly anesthetized and 3 concentric ring electrodes were afixed to their scalps one day before the experiment. Scopolamine methylnitrate (2 mg/kg i.p.) was given 30 minutes prior to pilocarpine. Pilocarpine HCl (310 mg/kg i.p) was given to cause long lasting SE. Laplacian EEG was recorded from tri-polar concentric electrodes on the scalp. TcES was applied 5 minutes after the onset of SE. Time-frequency analysis was performed on the Laplacian EEG signals to compare the electrographic activity before and after the application of TcES. Behavior was monitored by inspection. Survival was assayed at 24 h after administration of pilocarpine. Results: Control rats (n = 8) followed the classic electrographic stages of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus described by Treimen (1987) and expired on average 15 hours after the pilocarpine injection. TcES-treated rats (n = 8) lived significantly longer (p = 0.013, Two-Sample t-Test), which were euthanized on average at 48 hours. Twenty-four hours after the pilocarpine injection, six (75%) TcES-treated rats versus one (12.5%) control rat were alive (p = 0.041, Mann-Whitney U test). Both electrographic and behavioral manifestations of seizure activity were reduced or abolished after the application of TcES. All surviving TcES-treated rats recovered to baseline activity, including eating and drinking. By contrast, none of the control rats ate or drank after they entered SE. The time-frequency analysis showed evident differences before and after TcES. Conclusions: The application of TcES increased survival of rats with pilocarpine-induced SE. Positive TcES effects on electrographic and behavioral manifestations of seizure activity were significant and persistent. TcES may represent a novel and effective early treatment for SE.

Cavazos ( 1 Neurology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX ) Rationale: Early life status epilepticus is detrimental to the behavioral and cognitive development in childhood and increases the risk to develop epilepsy in later life. Recurrent seizures during the first two weeks of life in rats induce limited neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Holmes et. al., 1999; Cilio et. al., 2003). These neurobiological alterations enhance the degree of neuronal injury and the duration of status epilepticus experienced after a second excitotoxic injury later in life (Koh et al., 1999; Schmid et al., 1999). The present study examines the frequency of late spontaneous seizures one year after early life kainic acid induced status epilepticus. Methods: Kainic acid was administered in age specific doses for the following experiments. On postnatal day (P) 15, kainic acid was administered to induce convulsive status epilepticus and control rats received equal volumes of saline. On P45, half of rats from each group received kainic acid induced status epilepticus. Status Epilepticus was monitored for 6 hours and behavioral seizures were scored using a previously described scale. These four groups were allowed to mature for 1 year and then underwent surgical implantation of bipolar hippocampal electrodes to monitor the occurrence of late onset spontaneous seizures. Rats were then monitored for 8 hours to determine the frequency of late onset spontaneous seizures. After rats were monitored they were perfused with sodium sulphide and paraformaldehyde/gluteraldehyde for histological examination with Timm's reagent and Cresyl Violet. Results: After one year of maturation, rats that received kainic acid or saline on P15, did not demonstrate late onset spontaneous seizures over several 8 hour monitoring sessions, however mossy fiber sprouting was detected in the oriens of the CA3b region. Rats that receive saline on P15 and kainic acid on P45 developed late onset spontaneous seizures with an hourly seizure frequency of 0.22 ± 0.13 (mean ± SEM). This excitotoxic insult induced neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway into the dentate gyrus and CA3b regions. Rats that received a ?double hit? kainic acid on P15 and P45 developed severe late onset spontaneous seizures, with an hourly seizure frequency of 0.62 ± 0.31. These rats also developed widespread neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway into the dentate gyrus and the CA3b regions. Conclusions: Early life status epilepticus induced by kainic acid induces limited neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization in the CA3b region, which is not sufficient to initiate the process of epileptogenesis. However, alterations after early life seizures shift the neurobiology in a pro-epileptic direction that enhances the susceptibility to seizures and accelerates epileptogenesis after subsequent insults during adulthood. 1 Marion Czapp, 1 Jens P. Bankstahl, 2 Mark Helm, 3 Ulrich Massing, 3 Vittorio Ziroli, 4 Uta Huelsermann, 4 Gert Fricker, and 1 Heidrun Potschka ( 1 Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany ; 2 Department of Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany ; 3 Clinical Research, Clinic for Tumorbiology, Freiburg, Germany ; and 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany ) Rationale: Despite the launch of several new antiepileptic drugs (AED) during the last two decades pharmacoresistance of epilepsy remains an unsolved problem. It is hypothesized that local overexpression of multidrug transporters (MDT) in the epileptic tissue of pharmacoresistant individuals results in limited access of AED to the epileptic focus region. Downregulation of MDT by RNA interference (RNAi) would be a possible approach to overcome pharmacoresistance. Aim of the present study was to test if specific delivery of siRNA targeting the mRNA sequence of the major MDT P-glycoprotein (Pgp) to brain-capillary endothelial cells is possible. Methods: Liposomes were coupled with ApoE4 peptides which are discussed to mediate an uptake of liposomes into brain-capillary endothelial cells via LDL receptors. ApoE4-liposomes loaded with fluorescence-labelled siRNA targeting the rat Pgp mRNA sequence were administered i.v. to female Wistar rats. Distribution of siRNA was investigated at different time points (4, 10, 24 h) post administration by confocal microscopy in rat brain sections. Based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect the integrity of siRNA was controlled (siRNA was labelled with two fluorescent dyes). The influence of siRNA molecules on Pgp expression was evaluated 24 h post administration by immunhistochemistry and compared with control groups. Results: Fluorescence microscopy of rat brain sections after siRNA administration demonstrated a successful targeting to brain-capillary endothelial cells. An accumulation of labelled siRNA in the cells was obvious at all time points. The intensity of fluorescence increased from 4 to 24 h post administration. FRET analysis indicated that the siRNA was still intact 24 h following administration. Preliminary results of the immunhistochemical investigations gave evidence for a reduced Pgp expression in rats treated with siRNA in comparison with control groups. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that specific delivery of siRNA encapsulated in immunoliposomes to brain-capillary endothelial cells can be achieved. Thus, the study substantiates the suitability of this novel approach for siRNA delivery. Reduction of Pgp expression in brain-capillary endothelial cells will be investigated in further experiments to ensure that an RNAi-based downregulation of Pgp takes place and enhances AED efficacy in the amygdala kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

This study investigated whether VNS affects the threshold for provoking focal motor seizures using cortical electrical stimulation. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were implanted with a custommade cuff-electrode around the left vagus nerve. Stainless steel electrodes were bilaterally implanted on the rat motor cortex for stimulation and recording of EEG. Motor cortex stimulation (50 Hz, biphasic current pulses) with increasing amplitude (0 to max 2000 ?A) was performed. At the time of the first clinical seizure symptoms, the stimulation train was acutely aborted and the threshold intensity was determined by means of continuous video-EEG monitoring. The vagus nerve was stimulated for one hour with an intensity of 0,75 mA and a maximum duty cycle. For each rat, seizure thresholds (ST) were assessed before and immediately after VNS during 2 or 3 sessions on different days. Results: In 7/8 rats, ST increased after one hour of VNS. In 1/8 rat ST remained unchanged. In total, 21 sessions of VNS were performed in the 8 rats; for each session, ST were assessed at least 3 times before and 3 times after VNS. There was a significant increase (99% CI) of the ST after one hour of VNS (mean: 1424 ?A; SD: 315; range: 869?1999 ?A) compared to the baseline value (mean: 1077 ?A; SD: 244; range: 673?1754 ?A). Conclusions: In this study VNS significantly increased ST in a cortical stimulation model used for evaluating efficacy of antiepileptic treatment for motor seizures. These data indicate that VNS is capable of modulating cortical excitability. (Supported by V. De Herdt is supported by a grant (?aspirant?) from the FWO-Flanders.) 1 Stefanie M.

Human positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown altered GABAA receptor expression using flumazenil (FMZ), a ligand with a high affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR). Small animal PET, using serial scans in the same epileptic animal, is potentially a powerful technique to investigate the evolution and pathophysiolgical basis of these changes during epileptogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 2?-[18F]fluoroflumazenil ([18F]FFMZ) to study the GABAA/cBZR complex in rats utilizing small animal PET. Methods: In five male non-epileptic control rats (350?375 g), two serial dynamic PET scans were acquired under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia after bolus injection of [18F]FFMZ (66.6 ± 3.7 MBq). Six scans were acquired after injecting a tracer dose. In addition, a pre-saturation scan, consisting of a cold FMZ injection followed 10 min later by [18F]FFMZ, and two displacement studies (cold FMZ injection during the dynamic scan) were performed. PET/MRI co-registration was performed to delineate different regions of interest (whole brain, hippocampus, pons). Results: In the hippocampus, a structure with high GABAA/cBZR density, the signal intensity was higher (10%) than in the whole brain (p < 0.05) with no difference between left and right hippocampus. In the pons, which has low GABAA/cBZR density, the signal intensity was approximately 20% lower than in the whole brain (p < 0.01). Pre-saturation and displacement studies showed a high non-specific component in the measured signal, which may be due to recirculation of [18F]-fluoroethanol, a metabolite of [18F]FFMZ. [figure 1] Conclusions: This study has demonstrated differential uptake of [18F]FFMZ into key structures in the brain, with the highest activity in the hippocampus. However, significant non-specific activity in the brain will limit the ability to detect changes in GABAA/cBZR density during epileptogenesis and therefore alternative ligands need to be investigated.

Both morphological and electroclinical features of MTLE can be mimicked in the adult mice by a unilateral injection of kainic acid (KA) in the dorsal hippocampus. Neuronal loss in CA1, CA3 and hilus as well as gliosis and mossy fiber sprouting are observed in the injected side, as well as dispersion of the dentate gyrus, as observed in MTLE patients. In addition, recurrent focal hippocampal discharges occur two weeks after KA which share many similarities with human focal discharges. Whether these discharges are suppressed by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was addressed in this study where the effects of different classical AEDS were compared to a new AED: pregabalin. Methods: C57BL/6 adult mice were stereotaxically injected with KA (1 nmol in 50 nl) in the dorsal hippocampus and equipped with cortical and hippocampal electrodes. After 3 weeks, mice were injected with different doses of AEDs or vehicle in a random order and EEG recordings were performed for 20 min pre-injection and up to 120 min post-injection. Diazepam (0.5, 1, 2, 3 mg/kg) (n = 6), valproate (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) (n = 6), lamotrigine (30, 60, 90 mg/kg) (n = 7), carbamazepine (25, 50 mg/kg) (n = 12) and pregabalin (n = 8) (10, 50, 100 mg/kg) were injected i.p. Only animals with cell loss and dentate gyrus dispersion were used in the analysis. Cumulated durations of hippocampal discharges during 20 min periods were compared between the different drug conditions and versus vehicle using ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: Hippocampal discharges were suppressed in a dose-dependent way following diazepam (1, 2 and 3 mg/kg). Suppression of seizures was also observed with high doses of valproate (400 mg/kg) and lamotrigine (90 mg/kg) without dose-dependency and with occasional behavioral side-effects. No suppression was obtained following carbamazepine (25 and 50 mg/kg) and aggravation was observed after a low dose of lamotrigine (30 mg/kg). Pregabalin significantly suppressed hippocampal discharges in a dose-dependent way (50 and 100 mg/kg). Conclusions: Our study shows that besides benzodiazepines, only pregabalin suppresses focal discharges in a dose-dependent way in the kainate-mouse model of MTLE. On the contrary, classical AEDs were effective only at high doses (valproate, lamotrigine) or were without effects (carbamazepine). In addition to the histological, electrophysiological and behavioral features of this model, the resistance to classical AEDs suggest a form of drug-refractoriness often observed in human MTLE. Therefore this model fulfils most criteria for an efficient preclinical development of antiepileptic therapeutical strategies for MTLE. The suppressive effects of pregabalin suggest that this compound could be effective on human MTLE.

Willmore ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, Miyazaki Medical College, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan ; and 2 School of Medicine, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Kindling is a form of epileptogenesis that can be induced with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We undertook this study to evaluate the contribution of glutamate and GABA transporters in the process of PTZ kindling. Methods: Rats were kindled with PTZ (40 mg/kg) injected i.p. three times per week until two consecutive stage five seizures were observed. Experiment 1 Animals underwent pentobarbital anesthesia and decapitation at 24 hours (Group A) or at 30 days (Group B) after their last PTZ induced seizure. Rats in Group A and B were compared with each control rats (Group C and D). Experiment 2 We collected early-established animals (Group E) and kindling resistant animals (Group F). Early-established rats had consecutive stage five seizures with less than 5 injections of PTZ. Kindling resistant animals did not have fully kindled seizures by 12 injections of PTZ. Under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital brain tissue was collected at 30 days after the last PTZ injection. We used western blotting to measure the changes in hippocampal glutamate and GABA transporters in all animals. Results: GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAC-1 of Group A were elevated significantly compared with Group C. No change was found in any transporters of Group B compared with Group D. However, at 30 days (Group B) after their last PTZ induced seizure, animals had stage 5 seizure with PTZ. In early-established rats (Group E), levels of EAAC1 and GAT1 were decreased by 30% when compared to kindling resistant animals (Group F). In these animals, the level of GLT-1, GLAST and GAT3 equaled control. Conclusions: Activation of NMDA receptors is critical to the kindling process. Since all glutamate transporters were increased at 24 hours after establishing kindling with PTZ we considered this effect a response to seizure induced glutamate turnover. While animals remain kindled at the chronic phase, the lack of sustained changes in glutamate transporters suggest these proteins are not involved in the maintenance of epileptogenesis. We wonder if the glutamate and GABA transporters might be operant in the convulsion threshold set factor or as a pace factor for kindling.

The nucleus reuniens (RE) is the largest of the midline nuclei and major source of projections to the hippocampus. Afferent projections originate mainly from limbic structures. Immunocytochemical studies have revealed calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) immunoreactive neurons in the RE and 70% of CR-immunoreactive cells also showed CB-immunoreactivity. The present study was focused on distribution and dynamics of neuronal degeneration in the RE and on changes in CR-immunoreactivity within this nucleus in immature rats surviving up to one week after lithium-pilocarpine SE. Methods: Experiments were performed in Wistar rats 12, 15, 18, 21 and 25 days old. Lithium-pilocarpine model of SE was used. Only animals exhibiting convulsive SE were included in this study. Rats of all age groups were sacrificed 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours and 1 week after SE. Animals were deeply anesthetized with urethane (2.5 g/kg i.p) and perfused with 0.01 PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were postfixed and cryoprotected. Blocks of the brain were sectioned in a coronal plane (50 ?m), mounted on gelatin-coated slides and processed for FluoroJade B (FJB) histochemistry. Another group of 25-day-old animals surviving 1 week after SE was processed for localization of CR. To determine the CR-expressing cells the standard immunocytochemical techniques were used. Sections were observed under an epifluorescence microscope Olympus Provis AX 70 using FITC filter set. Results: Since P15 massive neuronal degeneration was evident in the RE. Damage was found in all age groups (P15, 18, 21, 25) and number of degenerated (FJB positive) neurons?increased with age of SE elicitation and with survival interval. Neuronal degeneration was evident in all parts of nucleus, but the majority of FJB-positive cells was in the rostral half of the RE. A significant decrease in number of CR-positive neurons was apparent in animals surviving 1 week. CR-reactive neurons were absent in the lateral portions of the RE, while the medial part of the nucleus exhibited a few of CR-positive cells. Conclusions: The reuniens nucleus belong among thalamic nuclei where massive neuronal degeneration was evident since P15. The number of degenerated neurons increased with age and survival time after SE. Significant decrease in number of CR-immunoreactive neurons indicate that calretinin has no neuroprotective effect within the reuniens nucleus.

Henshall ( 1 Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Prolonged seizures in adults can damage the hippocampus and cause epilepsy. However, the effects of prolonged seizures on the immature brain remain poorly understood. A small number of studies have suggested seizures in rats < P14 cause damage, however the date at which vulnerability emerges is contraversial. If these seizures were able to cause hippocampal sclerosis, a characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), this could have significant implications for seizure treatment and approaches to anti-epileptogenesis. Methods: We have developed a novel animal model in P10 Sprague-Dawley rat pups that provides the unique ability to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis following seizures in the developing brain. The model features early-life prolonged seizures, induced by intraamygdalar injection of kainic acid (KA), that trigger acute neuronal death in the hippocampus, leading to hippocampal sclerosis at adulthood. EEG was recorded both acutely and over a period of weeks at adulthood to confirm the presence of seizures. Results: Seizures were induced and hippocampal injury was then examined at various time points thereafter. Seizures induced largely unilateral hippocampal damage, affecting CA1 and CA3 regions. Western blot revealed that cell death was associated with activation of apoptotic pathways. By adulthood animals exhibited profound unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. Long-term EEG confirmed the presence of spontaneous seizures in these animals. Administration of a neuroprotectant FK506 during the initial seizures provided protection from hippocampal sclerosis at adulthood. Conclusions: We have successfully developed a novel model of unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and TLE in P10 rat pups. Using this model valuable insights may be gained into epileptogenesis in the developing brain and provide targets for anti-epileptogenic treatments.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ) Rationale: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide and its characteristics are a predisposition to recurrent unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal hypersynchronous discharges of neurons. Through experimental modelling and clinical neuroimaging it has been shown that seizures are capable of causing neuronal death and this may contribute to epileptogenesis, impairments in cognitive function or the epilepsy phenotype. Neuronal death in this setting is, at least in part, due to the induction of the molecular machinery of apoptosis. Studies using clinical material from patients who suffer recurrent seizures and animal epilepsy models have confirmed changes in expression and activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the caspase and Bcl-2 protein family. Another consistently up-regulated pro-apoptotic protein in seizure models is the tumour suppressor protein p53. Recently a new p53 up-regulated target gene has been identified named PUMA. PUMA, a BH3-only protein, is one of the most potent pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family which is also expressed in the central nervous system. In this study we examine the role of PUMA in seizure-induced neuronal death using PUMA knock-out mice. Methods: Seizures were focally evoked in adult C57Bl/6 mice by unilateral stereotaxic microinjection of kainic acid into the basolateral amygdala nucleus. The EEG was continuously monitored until lorazepam was administered to terminate seizures after 40 minutes. For Western blotting, samples were homogenized in lysis buffer and loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel. For immunohistochemical analysis, coronal brain sections were stained with NeuN and analysis of cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation was performed using fluorescein-linked TUNEL. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's paired least significant difference test as appropriate. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Results: In C57Bl/6 wild-type mice, p53 and PUMA were up-regulated in the hippocampus shortly after seizure induction. Assessment of the phenotype of PUMA knock-out mice revealed normal numbers of hippocampal and amygdala neurons, and normal expression of the kainate receptor in the amygdala and hippocampal site of seizure elicitation. Seizures elicited by intra-amygdala kainate were of similar frequency and severity in the PUMA knock out mice. However, neuropathological analysis revealed neuron survival was significantly greater in PUMA knock-out mice than in wild-type mice and TUNEL counts were significantly lower in PUMA knock-out mice than in wild-type mice. Conclusions: The present data suggest that PUMA contributes to the neurodegeneration taking place during seizure-induced neuronal death and may therefore represent a therapeutic target for adjunctive therapy to prevent hippocampal damage following status epilepticus.

Englot, 1 Ulrich Schridde, and 1,2 Hal Blumenfeld ( 1 Department Neurol., Yale University School Med, New Haven, CT ; and 2 Department Neurobiol., Yale University School Med, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Partial seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are often classified as either complex, characterized by deficits in consciousness, or simple, involving no loss of consciousness. Prior intracranial EEG studies of complex-partial seizures in TLE patients have shown large amplitude slow waves in the frontal and parietal cortices ictally, most prominent in the orbitofrontal cortex. This neocortical slowing is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow in these areas measured using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has been hypothesized that ictal neocortical slowing may reflect abnormal cortical and subcortical network interactions during temporal lobe seizures, responsible for the deficits in consciousness seen in TLE patients. However, an animal model is needed to further study the mechanisms and pathophysiology of neocortical slowing. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a bipolar stimulating/recording electrode in the dorsal hippocampus, and a frontal recording electrode in the association (n = 5), cingulate (n = 6), or lateral orbital (n = 5) cortex. After one week of recovery, animals were kindled with a daily 1s train of 1ms, 60 Hz biphasic pulses at the threshold current necessary to produce an afterdischarges of >3s duration. EEG recordings from the hippocampal and frontal electrodes were compared. Behavior was rated using the standard Racine scale. Results: Hippocampal EEG showed seizure activity, consisting of polyspike discharges, during all events. While frontal recordings in the association and cingulate cortices showed rapidly propagating fast (polyspike or sharp) activity within 1?2s of hippocampal stimulation, large amplitude slow waves of approximately 3?4 Hz were seen ictally in the lateral orbital cortex. Behaviorally, these seizures did not involve motor convulsive activity. As daily stimulations proceeded, the slow rhythm in the lateral orbital cortex progressively converted to fast spike activity, suggesting seizure propagation. Conclusions: Our results show neocortical slowing in the lateral orbital cortex during hippocampal seizures in rats. These data suggest that hippocampal kindling may provide a good animal model of complex-partial seizures in patients with TLE, demonstrating neocortical slow activity outside the region of seizure initiation. Further studies into the fundamental mechanisms of neocortical slowing in this model may provide insight into pathophysiology of altered consciousness in complex-partial seizures, and may lead to improved treatments of TLE.

Yamada, 1 Michael Wong, and 1 Liu Lin Thio ( 1 Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Leptin is a neurohormone that helps regulate body weight and also has complex effects on neuronal excitability. Because its predominant effect on neuronal excitability in vivo is unclear, we examined the susceptibility of leptin deficient ob/ob mice to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced seizures. Methods: We studied PTZ induced seizures in 31 wild type (C57BL/6J) and 30 ob/ob (B6.V-Lepob/J) male mice at 44?58 days of age using continuous video EEG recordings. After 15 minutes of baseline recording, a 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/kg dose of PTZ was injected intraperitoneally. The recording continued for 30 minutes after the injection or until death, whichever came first. PTZ induced generalized absence, myoclonic, clonic and clonic-tonic seizures. Maximal clinical seizure severity, latency to clinical seizure onset, latency to the first epileptiform abnormality and the normalized cumulative epileptiform duration were determined. Clinical seizure severity was rated as: 0 = no seizures, 1 = absence seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 2 = myoclonic seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 3 = generalized clonic or clonic-tonic seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 4 = repetitive absence or myoclonic seizures without normal interictal behavior or EEG throughout the 30 minute recording, 5 = death. The normalized cumulative epileptiform duration was the sum of the duration of all epileptiform abnormalities divided by the total time of the recording after PTZ injection. Comparisons were made using a t-test with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: The background EEG for both wild type and ob/ob mice showed 6?7 Hz theta activity without any epileptiform abnormalities. In both groups, PTZ induced the same types of clinical and electrographic seizures in a dose-dependent manner. The latency to the first clinical seizure and to the first epileptiform abnormality was the same in wild type and ob/ob mice at all PTZ doses. The maximal clinical severity at 25 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg PTZ were the same in wild type and ob/ob mice. However, at 75 mg/kg PTZ the clinical severity was 5.0 ± 0.0 for the ob/ob mice because all mice died whereas it was 3.5 ± 0.8 (p < 0.05) for wild type mice. At 75 mg/kg PTZ, the normalized cumulative epileptiform duration was 9 ± 3% for ob/ob mice and 5 ± 1% for wild type mice (p < 0.05). ob/ob mice also showed a higher maximal clinical severity and normalized cumulative epileptiform duration at 50 mg/kg PTZ. A greater number of generalized clonic and clonic-tonic seizures accounts for the greater severity of seizures in the ob/ob mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that PTZ induces more severe seizures in ob/ob mice. These results are consistent with leptin acting as an endogenous anticonvulsant and support a role for leptin in the treatment of epilepsy.

The syndrome is characterized primarily by intellectual impairment, ranging from mild learning disability to profound mental retardation. We are interested in studying the cellular electrophysiological factors underlying the pathophysiology of seizure activity in the brain tissue of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) gene knockout mice (KO). Methods: We have characterized the induction of seizure-like events (SLE) in young adult mouse hippocampal slices exposed to low Mg-ACSF and tetanic stimulation bouts, as with our previous KO mice. All recording were performed on transverse hippocampal slices (400 ?m) from mice aged 6?9 weeks, in oxygenated ACSF, at 33°C. SLEs and extracellular field responses were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampal slices, in response (were appropriate) to Schaffer collateral stimulation. Results: The KO mice hippocampal slices were more easily induced into SLEs with either low Mg-ACSF, or by repetitive tetanizations. KO slices showed a shorter lag time to SLE of 15.4 min. vs 26.5 min. in wt slices, required fewer tetanic stimuli to produce SLEs. A brief application of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (at 1 or 10 ?M delayed the onset of low Mg-induced, but not tetanic stimulation-induced SLEs in KO hippocampal slices by more than 3-fold. However, we found that longer application of this same drug leads to diminished (with low Mg-ACSF exposure) or increased susceptibility (with tetanic stimuli) to SLEs in the KO hippocampus. Also, we have found that inhibitory network that regulates paired-pulse inhibition in CA1 of the hippocampus, is dramatically reduced in the KO hippocampus, leading to a complete lack of PPI that can be elicited in the wt slices. Conversely, we have found that paired-pulse facilitation is significantly enhanced in the KO hippocampus as compared to the wt, and that this may point to alterations in presynaptic calcium handling in these FMRP knockout mice. Conclusions: We have found that hippocampi from FMRP knockout mice are more easily induced into seizure-like events in vitro. We are continuing work to further elucidate the nature of mGluR regulation of SLEs in this model, as well as the influence of inhibitory inputs in the KO hippocampus on seizure susceptibility in these mice.

Kalynchuk ( 1 Psychology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada ; 2 Cell Biology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago, Spain ; 3 Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 4 Psychology, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that has important roles in the developing nervous system as well as in the adult nervous system. It is believed that extracellular reelin may act as either a stop or as a chemoattracting signal for radially migrating neurons. Deficits in reelin signaling have been found in a variety of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disorders, including epilepsy. However, in the adult nervous system, the specific role of reelin is not fully understood. Reelin is synthesized and released by GABAergic interneurons and recent studies have suggested that reelin might modulate and even enhance long-term potentiation in the adult brain. Importantly, enhancement in synaptic transmission is thought to play a crucial role in the intensification of afterdischarges and progressive development of convulsions in the amygdala kindling model of epilepsy. Methods: To determine if amygdala kindling was associated with changes in reelin expression, rats were surgically implanted with an electrode into the basolateral amygdala and subjected to 99 kindled or sham stimulations. An additional group of non-kindled genetically prone FAST kindled rats was also processed in order to determine if basal reelin expression was altered in rats that were genetically more susceptible to enhanced amygdaloid excitability and the effects of kindling. Brains were processed for immunohistochemical determination of reelin, NeuN, and doublecortin. Results: The total number of reelin positive cells in the hilus was not substantially different between all groups; however, there was a slight decrease in the number of these cells within the subgranular zone for the kindled and non-kindled FAST rats. A decrease in reelin expression within the stratum lacunosum-moleculare was also found for kindled and non-kindled FAST rats. Doublecortin immunohistochemistry revealed that some newly born neurons migrated ectopically into the hilus for kindled rats but not for sham-stimulated controls or for non-kindled FAST rats. Interestingly, we often observed several abnormally located reelin positive cells scattered throughout the dentate granule cell layer for non-kindled FAST rats suggesting a possible pre-existing GABAergic circuit malformation in this group of rats. Conclusions: These findings suggest that changes in reelin expression within the hippocampus during development might influence network formation that may influence susceptibility to epilepsy. (Supported by NSERC.) 1 Patrick D. Fox, 1 Hyokwon Chung, and 1 Sookyong Koh ( 1 Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Northwestern Medical School, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Chronic epilepsy often starts with an isolated early life seizure, a period of remission, and then the re-emergence of seizures later in life. To mimic this event in rats, we developed a ?two-hit?-kainic acid (KA) model and demonstrated that an early life seizure increases susceptibility to seizures and to seizure-induced neuronal injury in adulthood. We have found that activation of resident microglia and subsequent increases in mRNA of inflammatory cytokines and complements appear to be the key initiating events for seizure-induced inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that the inflammatory reaction provoked by early-life seizures primes the developing brain and microglia, leading to rapid reactivation by a second seizure in adulthood. Blocking of this microglia activation through pharmaceuticals such as minocycline may prevent some neuronal injury typically seen following these later life seizures. Methods: Postnatal day 21?25 LE rats were injected with KA (10 mg/kg, I.p.) or saline. The first dose of minocycline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered immediately after KA injection, and 6 more doses were given 24 hours apart over the next 7 days. Two weeks after KA/PBS injections, all remaining rats were given KA. Rats were perfused two days later and all brain sections were processed for immunocytochemistry (ICC) using IbA1/Aif antibody to visualize activated microglia. CA1 subregions of the hippocampal sections were analyzed using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.). An average percent of area above the set threshold (threshold area containing immunoreactive cells captured at 20x) and the number of stained cells were calculated per animal. Results: Cellular hypertrophy of microglia suggestive of activated state was observed within 24 h after KA-induced seizures. The group that experienced early-life seizures (K/K) had a marked increase in the number of activated microglia compared to control littermates who received single KA in adulthood (S/K). These microglia were larger and formed a complex, web-like network localized within the hippocampus especially over the CA1 region. Over two fold increase in immunoreactive areas was noted in K/K compared to S/K (KA: 9.0 ± 1.3 vs. Saline: 4.0 ± .1.0, p < 0.04, n = 8). The microglia count was also significantly greater (KA: 233.1 ± 12.1 vs. Saline 153.5 ± 9.2, p < .039, n = 8). This hypertrophic, hyperplastic, reactivating effect of an early-life seizure on microglia was abolished in minocycline treated rats. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the experience of early life seizures primes the microglia and elicits a much more robust activation in response to later life seizures. Whether microglial reactivation is causally related to the epileptogenic effect of early-life seizures to increase seizure susceptibility and cell death will be determined.

Studies with transgenic mice indicate that KA receptors containing GluR6 subunits play a role in KA-induced seizures (1). Here we used kainate receptor knockout (KO) mice to determine the clinical seizure and EEG correlates of GluR5 kainate receptor activation, and the roles of kainate receptor subunits in other seizure models. Methods: Video-EEG monitoring was carried out during slow tail vein infusion of the selective GluR5 agonist ATPA in wild type (WT), GluR5-/-, and GluR6-/- mice. We also assessed seizure thresholds using the i.v. PTZ and 6 Hz models. Results: Slight myoclonic jerks/twitches associated with single sharp waves occurred at lower doses of ATPA in WT than in GluR5-/-, but generalized seizures occurred at similar doses. Myoclonic jerks occurred at comparable doses in WT and GluR6-/- mice; paradoxically, EEG seizure patterns began with lower doses in GluR6-/- mice. There were no significant differences between any of the genotypes in their thresholds for clonic seizures induced by i.v. PTZ or in the 6 Hz seizure model. Conclusions: GluR5 kainate receptors contribute to ATPA-induced myoclonic jerks, but not to generalized seizures. The increased sensitivity of GluR6 KO mice to ATPA was unexpected. In the KO animals, the existence of GluR5 homomers instead of GluR5/GluR6 heteromers may account for the phenomenon since GluR5 homomers are about 2.4-fold more sensitive to ATPA than are GluR5/GluR6 heteromers (2). GluR5 and GluR6 kainate receptors do not appear to play a role in seizure activity in the PTZ and 6 Hz models. 1 Mulle C, Sailer A, Perez-Otano I, et al. Nature 1998;392:601?605. 2 A. Alt, B. Weiss, A.M. Ogden, et al. Neuropharmacology 2004; 46:793?806. 1 Michael A. Galic, 2 James G. Heida, 3 Campbell G. Teskey, and 2 Quentin J. Pittman ( 1 Neuroscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; 2 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: There is increasing evidence that immune and inflammatory processes in early life are capable of producing lasting effects on physiology and CNS function and raise the possibility that a single inflammatory episode during development could evoke changes in seizure susceptibility later in adulthood. Methods: To explore this hypothesis, postnatal day 14 male rats received either the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (25?250 ?g/kg), or the viral mimetic Polyinosinic:Polycitydylic acid (POLY I:C) (1 mg/kg) to induce a mild inflammatory process. Two months later, rats received lithium and pilocarpine (LI-PILO), kainic acid (KA) or were subjected to amygdala kindling to discern any changes to seizure susceptibility. Following KA seizures, subsets of animals were killed and brains evaluated for neurodegeneration using Fluoro jade histochemistry. Results: Neonatally LPS-treated, but not POLY I:C-treated rats, showed significantly faster seizure onset times (SOTs), by about 25% compared to controls. Adult rats given LPS and then LI-PILO two months later, did not show the same reduction in SOT as found with the neonatal treatment. Separate experiments determined a comparable susceptibility of neonatally LPS-treated rats to adult convulsions evoked with KA, but not to amygdala kindling. Behavioural sensitivities to KA were also reflected in the amount of neuronal degeneration in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampus 24 h after SOT. Conclusions: Taken together, we have observed that long-lasting changes in seizure susceptibility can be evoked following a mild inflammatory episode during development, possibly through a mechanism involving, or specific to, the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (LPS-activated), but not TLR-3 (POLY I:C-activated) pathways.

Good, 3 Shivkumar Sabesan, 2 Trevor D. Boone, 2 Leon D. Iasemidis, and 1,2 David M. Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University ; and 3 Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: In the last decade, substantial progress has been made in the study of the human epileptic brain by utilizing concepts and measures from nonlinear dynamics. The hallmark of this research is the ability to predict seizures prior to their clinical or electrographic onset (IEEE TBME 2003; 50:616?627). As the ability to predict leads to the possibility of control, research in controlling seizures with closed-loop systems is expected to flourish in the near future and will most likely include studies performed in animal models of epilepsy. We have thus applied the concepts from nonlinear dynamics, namely the Largest Short-Term Lyapunov exponent (STLmax), to evaluate the effectiveness for real-time seizure prediction in the lithium pilocarpine rat model of chronic epilepsy as a precursor for a closed-loop seizure control system that utilizes deep brain stimulation. Methods: Three male Sprague-Dawley rats (300?350g) were stereotaxcially implanted with a customized array of Tungsten depth wire electrodes which included four cortical, two hippocampal, and two thalamic contacts. Chronic epilepsy was established several weeks after an episode of prolonged status epilepticus using the lithium pilocarpine model (3 mmol/kg LiCl followed by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine 24 hrs later). Continuous EEG/video recordings were made during the entire experiment and all data analyzed in real-time. STLmax values were calculated for each electrode and entrainment of STLmax was evaluated utilizing a pair t-statistic (T-index). True and false predictions were noted with a seizure prediction horizon set at 180 minutes. Results: Continuous EEG data from Rat1 (55 seizures in 166 hours), Rat2 (25 seizures in 384 hours), Rat3 (16 seizures in 739 hours) resulted in a total of 96 seizures in 1289 hours of recording. The seizure prediction results from each rat were: Rat1, prediction rate 35/55 = 63.4%, 11 false positives (0.0663/hr), mean prediction time = 111 minutes; Rat2, prediction rate 22/25 = 88.0%, 50 false positives (0.1302/hr), mean prediction time = 149 minutes; Rat3, prediction rate 10/16 = 62.5%, 114 false positives (0.1543/hr), mean prediction time = 114 minutes. Overall prediction rate- 67/96 = 69.8%, 175 false positives (0.1358/hr), mean prediction time = 125 minutes. Conclusions: While the overall prediction rate of ?70% is less than the one reported in human data (?80%), similar false positive rates (?1 every 8 hours of recording), and an extended prediction time were noted. Given these results, prediction of seizures in the lithium pilocarpine rat model of chronic epilepsy appears feasible as a model of chronic epilepsy for testing real-time feedback control systems utilizing thalamic deep brain stimulation.

Dudek ( 1 Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO ; 2 School of Pharmacy, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY ; and 3 Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Animal models of chronic epilepsy, such as the kainate-treated rat, may be useful in the discovery of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The present study evaluated the effectiveness of carbamazepine on the frequency of spontaneous motor seizures in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Another aim of the study was to of develop a paradigm for continuous, long-term oral administration of potential AEDs. Methods: Single intraperitoneal (IP) injections of carbamazepine (10?100 mg/kg) were compared to vehicle [i.e., 20% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-?-cyclodextrin] injections via six AED-versus-vehicle tests using a repeated-measures cross-over protocol. To establish an effective dose and the time-course of the anticonvulsant effect, two trials (8?9 rats per trial) evaluated single per os[i.e., oral- by mouth (PO)] doses of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine. Each PO trial included 3 AED-versus-vehicle tests comprised of carbamazepine-containing or control pellet feedings on alternate days with a recovery day between each treatment day. Based on the single-feeding studies, carbamazepine at 100 mg/kg was administered three times per day (TID) for 5 days. Results: Carbamazepine significantly reduced seizure frequency at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg after single IP injections, and caused complete seizure cessation during the 6-h post-drug epoch in 25% and 70% of animals at 30 and 100 mg/kg. Single IP injections and single oral feedings of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced seizure frequency relative to control treatments during 6-h and 22-h epochs following drug administration. A single feeding of carbamazepine (100 mg/kg PO) was significantly effective for 20 h and full recovery was complete within 23 h. Continuously administered carbamazepine (100 mg/kg PO, TID) significantly reduced seizure frequency by >50% for 24 h and completely suppressed motor seizures in 50% of the animals tested. Conclusions: High doses of carbamazepine (30 and 100 mg/kg) were highly effective at suppressing spontaneous seizures, and were associated with a high percentage of motor seizure freedom. Administration of higher doses of carbamazepine did not further suppress spontaneous motor seizures. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine was as effective as IP injections. Significant anticonvulsant effects of 100- mg/kg PO carbamazepine were sustained for the duration of the 5-day trial.

Certain forms of synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on modifications of the presynaptic release machinery. However, our knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms and the role of the presynaptic release machinery in functional changes that underlie epileptic activity at the level of the synapse is very limited. Therefore, we have analyzed whether the expression patterns of components of the presynaptic release machinery are altered in different stages of an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We have furthermore characterized knock-out mice deficient for three proteins that are integral components of the release machinery, RIM1α, RIM2α or Synaptotagmin 10 (Syt 10), in an experimental model of TLE. Methods: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced by systemic application of pilocarpine to rats as well as to three mutant mouse lines. Changes in mRNA levels were analyzed by Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH). Seizure susceptibility was determined after induction of SE. The frequency and severity of chronic recurrent seizures was analyzed with a telemetric EEG system (DSI) and parallel video analysis. To study hippocampal damage, the amount of segmental hippocampal loss of neurons and gliosis were analyzed in wild-type and knock-out mice after SE. Results: To investigate changes in the mRNA expression level of various components of the presynaptic release machinery hippocampal subregions (dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1) were isolated from rats 4, 6 and 8 hours and 5 and 28 days after SE induced by pilocarpine. Analysis of these samples by Real-time PCR, ISH and Affymetrix-Micro-Arrays showed distinct changes in the expression patterns of several constituents of the release machinery; e.g. Syt 10 could not be detected in the CA1 region of control rats/mice, neither by single cell PCR nor by ISH, however, its mRNA was strongly expressed in CA1 cells 6 h after SE. To study if ablation of individual components of the presynaptic release machinery affects epileptogenesis we are analyzing three mutant mouse lines in the pilocarpine model of TLE: knock-out mice for the active zone proteins RIM1α and RIM2α, which exhibit defects in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, and Syt 10, whose mRNA expression is induced by seizures. So far the results obtained by Video- and EEG-Monitoring of these animals suggest that RIM1α knock-out mice have a higher susceptibility to seizures than wild-type littermates (n = 5). Furthermore, the latency to the first seizue and to SE seem to be reduced. Conclusions: Our results suggest that components of the presynaptic release machinery are modified during epileptogenesis, may play a pathogenetic role and constitute targets for new therapeutic approaches in TLE.

Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered for 7 days with physiological solution (SF) or mercaptopropionic (MP) acid. The day of the experiment, a shunt micrordialysis probe or a concentric probe was inserted into the carotid artery or the hippocampus respectively, in order to monitor extracellular phenytoin (PHT) levels. In SF and MP treated rats, PHT (30 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 30 after an intraperitoneal administration of SF or nimodipine (NIMO, 2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data was made using TOPFIT program. Results: No differences were found in PHT plasmatic levels comparing all experimental groups. In rats pretreated with SF, hipocampal PHT concentrations were signicantly lower in MP treated rats (maximal concentration (Cmax): 2.7 ± 0.3 ?g/ml, p < 0.05 vs SF rats) compared to SF animals (Cmax: 5.3 ± 0.9 ?g/ml). Whilst pretreatment with NIMO did not modify central pharmacokinetics of PHT in SF treated rats (4.5 ± 0.8 ?g/ml), PHT levels were significantly higher in MP rats pretreated with NIMO (Cmax: 6.8 ± 1.0 ?g/ml, p < 0.05 vs MP rats pretreated with SF) compared to MP animals with previous administration of SF. Conclusions: Thus, our results suggest that central pharmacokinetics of PHT was altered in epileptic rats by MP administration. The effect of NIMO on hipocampal concentrations of PHT suggested that P-gp is implicated in the reduced central bioavailability of PHT in MP epileptic rats. (Supported by University of Buenos Aires.) 1 Susan L. Campbell, and 1 John J. Hablitz ( 1 Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: Elevated glutamate levels have been reported in several epilepsy models. The electrophysiological changes that occur when transporter function is disrupted in experimental models of epilepsy have not been examined. The freeze-induced model of cortical dysplasia results in abnormal lamination of cortical structures associated with hyperexcitability in the region adjacent to the microsulcus. Here we used this model to test the role of glutamate transporters in synaptic transmission in the hyperexcitable region. Methods: Focal freeze lesions were induced in postnatal day (PN) 0 Sprague-Dawley rats using methods described previously. In freeze-lesioned cortex, recordings of layer II/III pyramidal cells were obtained 0.3?1.5 mm lateral to the microsulcus. Synaptic responses were evoked with a bipolar stimulating electrode (twisted pair of 25 mm Formvar insulated nichrome wires) positioned 150?200 ?m below the recording pipette. Stimuli were current pulses 10?100 ?A in amplitude and 50?100 ms in duration. A stimulation frequency of 0.05 Hz was used. The glutamate uptake antagonists DL-threo-?-benzylozyaspartic acid (TBOA) and dihydokainate (DHK) were bath applied. Results: TBOA prolonged postsynaptic currents (PSCs) and decreased the threshold for evoking spontaneous epileptiform activity in lesioned cortex. Uptake inhibition also induced an increase in holding current in the dysplastic cortex. In contrast, responses in sham operated and control animals were not affected. The effect of blocking uptake was mediated primarily by the glia glutamate transporter (GLT-1) since the selective GLT-1 blocker DHK mimicked the effects of TBOA. The increases in the holding current suggested that glutamate was accumulating extracellularly and activating ionotropic glutamate receptors. The increase in excitability following uptake inhibition appeared to be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors since prior application of D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) prevented TBOA-induced effects and TBOA-induced changes were reversed by APV. In the freeze-lesioned cortex spontaneous epileptiform activity does not occur at a high rate. Under control conditions, the probability for the occurrence of spontaneous discharge was 0.09 ± 0.06 (n = 22) which increased significantly to 0.59 ± 0.1 (n = 22) when TBOA was applied. Conclusions: These results indicate that glutamate transporter function is altered in rat focal cortical dysplasia and these changes contribute to the observed hyperexcitability. Alteration in transporter function could result in increasing extracellular glutamate concentrations and over activation of NMDA receptors during neuronal activity. (Supported by NS22373.) 1 Kiyotaka Hashizume, 1 Seiji Takebayashi, and 1 Tatsuya Tanaka ( 1 Neurosurgery, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan ) Rationale: The aim of this study was a comparison of the antiepileptic effect between deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN), using the same epilepsy model. Methods: A guide cannula was stereotactically implanted into the left sensorimotor cortex of male Wistar rats. Focal cortical seizures were induced by a microinjection of kainic acid (KA) into the left sensorimotor cortex. Using this focal seizure model, High-frequency electrical stimulation of STN or ATN was performed intermittently when the animal developed into the seizure status. The seizure frequency of DBS-on and DBS-off was measured from a video-EEG system. The data was analyzed statistically. Results: An intracortical injection of KA was induced focal and secondarily generalized seizures in all animals. The ipsilateral (the side of KA injection) STN-DBS suppressed the seizure frequency to 50?60% of the DBS-off phase. The effect of bilateral STN-DBS showed no significance than the ipsilateral DBS. When the electrode was implanted into bilateral ATN, no seizure was induced by KA injection. The implantation of the ipsilateral ATN lead to seizure suppression, and the ipsilateral ATN-DBS suppressed seizures more strongly. Conclusions: Both DBS of STN and ATN suppressed KA-induced focal seizures. The antiepileptic effect of ATN-DBS was stronger than STN-DBS in this animal model. The seizure suppression of the electrode implantation alone may be caused by a focal destruction of ATN. 1 Henry J. Hasson, and 1,2 Solomon L. Moshe ( 1 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 2 Neuroscience and Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency and a common problem in neonates. To date, effective treatments to stop ongoing status epilepticus in this age group have not been identified. To assess efficacy and morbidity from the treatment of prolonged seizures in the immature brain, it is necessary to develop screening assays. Methods: SE was induced in postnatal day 15(P15) and 21(P21) rats by systemic administration of kainic acid (KA) 3.5 mg/kg (P15) and 10 mg/kg (P21) or lithium-pilocarpine (PI) 60 mg/kg (P15) and 30 mg/kg (P30). Rats were monitored by EEG with an electrode in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In both models behavioral seizures continue for several hours and electrographic seizures continue for more than 24 hours if left untreated. After one hour of electroclinical SE, rats were treated with pentobarbital (PB), diazepam (DZ), or saline. Rats were then intermittently monitored for cessation of behavioral and electrographic seizures, and for mortality for 3 days following treatment to confirm that the seizures stopped and did not recur. Results: Both drugs can stop the ongoing seizures both behaviorally and electrographically. PB (50 mg/kg) was XX% effective in stopping KA and PI induced SE in both P15 and P21 rats. DZ (20 mg/kg) was effective in stopping SE in 50?64% of rats in 3 of the 4 groups. In the KA P21 group, it was not effective. Higher doses of diazepam did not improve the outcome in P15 pups in KA-SE. When effective, DZ stopped SE much quicker than PB (p < .0001). In most groups, mortality from SE did not change irrespective of whether SE was stopped or not. In the P15 PI group, treatment with either drug had increased mortality compared to untreated SE. Conclusions: This study shows that it is possible to abort seizures in the developing rat even after 1 hour of SE using drugs at appropriate doses. The drugs, when effective, stop both the behavioral and the EEG seizures. The action of DZ is rapid, suggesting that subsequent treatments can be quickly initiated if SE does not stop within 1?2 minutes. On the other hand, PB takes significantly longer to work, and more time is needed to determine if the therapy will stop the seizures. Age and cause of SE may contribute to drug-induced morbidity. Our protocol can be used to assess the efficacy and morbidity of new agents.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology, Royal College of Surgeon In Ireland, Dublin, Dublin, Ireland ) Rationale: Sublethal brain insults can confer protection against cell death induced by subsequent (prolonged) damaging insults. While best described for ischemia, there is some evidence brief seizures may precondition the brain against damage following prolonged seizures (e.g. status epilepticus). To study this so-called ?epileptic tolerance?, we examined neuronal damage following status epilepticus in mice that received various doses of sublethal preconditioning seizures and at various intervals between the conditioning and injurious stimuli. Methods: Seizure preconditioning activity was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of kainic acid (KA) at various doses (5.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg; n = 5, plus vehicle controls, n = 9) and subsequent status epilepticus was induced by intra-amygdala (i.a.) injection of KA (1.0 ug) at two time-points (24 or 72 hours) after the first insult. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and NeuN immunostaining was used to detect neuronal damage within the hippocampus. Results: Preconditioning seizures did not induce significant hippocampal damage at any dose tested. Mice that received preconditioning seizures induced by KA i.p. at 15.0 mg/kg given 24 hours before i.a. KA showed significant reductions in TUNEL counts and significantly more surviving neurons as assessed by NeuN in the ipsilateral hippocampus, particularly the CA3 subfield (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the duration of high amplitude polyspike seizures evoked by i.a. KA in mice that received preconditioning. Surprisingly, increasing the time interval between preconditioning and prolonged seizures to 3 days resulted in raised mortality rates (e.g. 3/5) when mice underwent the second prolonged (i.a. KA) seizures: evidence of preconditioning-induced sensitization to seizures. Conclusions: This study provides a new model with which to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying endogenous neuroprotection programmes in brain. (Supported by Science Foundation Ireland grant B466.) 1 James G. Heida, 1 Jana Veliskova, 1 Libor Velisek, 1 Ondrej Cudomel, 1 Solomon L. Moshe, and 1 Aristea S. Galanopoulou ( 1 Neurology and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: It is widely accepted that status epilepticus (SE) in early life does not result in major neuronal death as observed in adults. There is increasing evidence however that more subtle aspects of brain physiology are permanently affected. Of particular interest is the potential effect of repetitive early life seizures on the physiology of endogenous seizure controlling circuits, such as those involving the substantia nigra reticulata (SNR). The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of 3 episodes of SE, during early postnatal development, on the seizure controlling function of the SNR in rats. Methods: Three episodes of SE were induced in Sprague Dawely rat pups of both sexes on postnatal days 4 (P4), P5, and P6 by systemic injection of kainic acid ([KA] 1.25, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg i.p. respectively). Animals were left until P28 when they were implanted with bilateral cannulae aimed at the anterior SNR. At P30, rats received bilateral infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (100ng/0.25 ?l per side), which has been shown previously to have an anticonvulsant effect when infused into the anterior SNR at P30 (Veliskova  2 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Yale University, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Reductions in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) have proven useful for the lateralization and localization of seizure foci in patients with intractable epilepsy. Since most patients to date have been studied only after years of intractable seizures, it is unclear, if the deficits in NAA precede the onset of overt seizures or, alternatively, are solely a consequence of chronic, intractable seizures. To determine when the reductions in NAA occur, we used a pilocarpine rat model and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Methods: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in male rats with pilocarpine and terminated after 1 hour with diazepam. Control rats received sham-injections of saline (n = 10 control rats). The severity of the SE was graded according to Racine, and rats with severe generalized seizures (stages 3, 4 and 5) were included for analysis (n = 11). Two and seven days post-SE, MRSI data were acquired with 2ul resolution. Three voxels within each hippocampus (6 voxels per rat) were selected for analysis. Following the day 7 MRSI study, the rats were maintained under anesthesia and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Neuronal loss in the regions spanned by the spectroscopic images was assessed using stereologic methods as described by West. Results: Displayed in Fig. 1 are hippocampal spectra from a sham injected animal (control) and 2 and 7 days post-SE in a pilocarpine treated rat. NAA is significantly reduced at 2 days post-SE (27.5 ± 6.9% decrease, p < 0.001) and 7 days post-SE (17.3 ± 6.9% decrease, p < 0.001) in comparison to sham-injected controls (Fig. 1). Despite the substantial reductions in NAA 7 days post SE, neuronal counts averaged over the entire hippocampus showed a non-significant reduction of 2% in comparison to sham treated animals. Conclusions: Hippocampal NAA content in this rat model of epilepsy is significantly reduced during the latent period prior to the development of overt spontaneous seizures. The reduction in NAA, 17%, is not due to neuronal loss, since neuronal numbers are not significantly decreased over the volume sampled. The presence of decreased NAA during the latent period suggests that spectroscopic studies of NAA provide an early marker of the processes underlying the development of epilepsy, prior to the manifestation of overt seizures. If validated in patients, this would provide a non-invasive method for evaluating and identifying those patients at risk to develop epilepsy following a first provoked seizure.

Mareci ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 5 Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Using MRI at 17.6 Tesla, we have studied structural changes that occur during the latent period of epileptogenesis in an animal model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and correlated these changes with histological analysis. Methods: Five 50-day-old adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were anesthesized and implanted with stimulating electrodes to induce self-sustained status epilepticus in 4 out of 5 rats. Subsequently, rats were video monitored to capture spontaneous seizures. After eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed, transcardially perfused, and the intact fixed brains imaged in vitro at 17.6 Tesla. After imaging, brains were processed for histology and stained with Fluoro-Jade C, Timm, GFAP, Black Gold and Perl iron stains to correlate structural changes with those observed with MRI. Results: Three of 5 rats presented with observable spontaneous seizures during the epileptogenic period. These rats showed significantly decreased T2 in the pyramidal cell layer CA1 of the hippocampus and the dorsal thalamic nuclei bilaterally [Fig. 1]. One presented with a cavity and increased T2 in the parahippocampal gyrus on the contralateral side of stimulation. No T2 changes were observed in the frontal cortices of these seizing rats. The two rats with no observable seizures either hadn't been stimulated or had stimulating electrode placement in the dorsal thalamus instead of the hippocampus. These rats showed no significant T2 abnormalities in any brain region. Histological analysis has been completed for one of the seizing rats and revealed mossy fiber sprouting around the dentate gyrus bilaterally, iron deposition in the dorsal thalamus and demyelination and astrocytic proliferation in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions. Conclusions: These results suggest that there may be a correlation between T2 changes in the parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus (related to mossy fiber sprouting and gliosis on histology) and the seizure activity of animal models of MTLE. Future work will correlate these changes with in vivo MRI at different time points after electrical stimulation and structural changes using specific histological methods. [figure 1] (Supported by NIH grant R01 EB004752, the Wilder Epilepsy Research Center and University of Florida Alumni Foundation.) 1 Riikka J. Immonen, 1 Asla Pitkänen, and 1 Olli H.J. Gröhn ( 1 Department of Neurobiology, A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mn2+-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) can reveal functional, structural, and connectional alterations in the brain with a high spatial resolution in vivo. We showed that Mn2+ injected in the entorhinal cortex is transported via perforant pathway to the dentate granule cells resulting in labeling that correlates with the density of mossy fiber sprouting [Nairismägi et al. Neuroimage 2006]. Now we hypothesized that systemic Mn injection and MEMRI can be used for detection of mossy fiber sprouting. Methods: MnCl2 (45 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to 10 adult Wistar rats. After 12 hours, status epilepticus (SE) was induced with kainic acid (KA) in 6 rats (MnSE group). T1 weighted (gradient echo, TE = 2.7ms, TR = 120ms) and quantitative T1 mapping (IR- fast spin echo, TI = 10, 400, 1000, 1600 ms) MRI was performed under 1% halothane anaesthesia at 4.7T, 3 and 25 hours after KA injection. Two months later, follow-up MRI was performed before and 24 hours after injection of Mn. In the end, rats were perfused for histology, and brains were stained to detect neurodegeneration, gliosis, and mossy fiber sprouting. Results: At 15 h after KA injection, T1 relaxation times did not differ between the groups. This indicates that Mn accumulation during generalized seizures is not activity dependent. Two months after KA administration, Mn-enhanced MRI indicated thickening of the dentate gyrus (DG) and proximal CA3 in T1-weighted images in the MnSE group (260 ± 40% increase compared to controls, p < 0.05). The CA1/adjacent corpus callosum signal intensity was 1.37 ± 0.03 in the MnSE and 1.22 ± 0.03 in the control group (Fig. 1, p < 0.05), confirming the increased accumulation of Mn in the CA1 region of the KA-injected animals. The initial histological analysis shows both mossy fiber sprouting (DG) and neuronal loss related gliosis (CA1) in the signal enhancement areas. [figure 1]Fig.1 Manganase enhanced T1-wt images 25h (A,C) and 2 months after KA injection from two representative animals. Conclusions: MEMRI contrast after systemic Mn injection is not associated with brain activation during and after SE. Alterations in the thickness and shape of the DG and CA3 or CA1 regions of hippocampus proper can be attributed either to mossy fiber sprouting or gliosis, respectively. According to our data it is evident that MEMRI after systemic administration is able to reveal cellular level changes in the hippocampus. It remains to be studied if the accumulation of Mn into mossy fibers and/or glia can be differentiated. (Supported by Finnish Cultural Foundation of Northern Savo.) 1 John R. Ives, 2 Krista L. Gilby, and 2 Dan C. McIntyre ( 1 Department of Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Carlton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: We tested the effects of TMS using a model MagPro X100 (Medtronic Canada Inc., Toronto, ON) on well-established kindled seizures in rats as there seems to be no studies in this area. First we determined whether 60 Hz TMS could evoked seizures in kindled rats. Second, we determined whether low frequency (1 Hz) TMS (LFTMS) had any effect on the threshold or performance of kindled seizures. Methods: Since kindling was originally established in 21 rats using 2 sec of low intensity 60 Hz sinusoidal electrical stimulation, we set the TMS parameters to 2 sec of 60 Hz, biphasic, magnetic stimulation at 100%. The 21 rats, 7 amygdala and 14 ventral hippocampal kindled, previously received more than 10 generalized seizures and their thresholds were stabile. These 21 rats were also from 3 selectively bred groups, 6 ?Fast kindler?, 5 ?Slow kinders ? and 10 ?F1 hybrids?. Two types of TMS coils were used to stimulate the rats, the round and the figure 8. The round coil had a central-hole that was positioned over the rats' implanted headplug connector, when the kindling leads to the rat were not attached. The figure 8 coil was used when the leads were attached. In 12 ventral hippocampal kindled rats, we tested the efficacy of LFTMS against the kindled seizures in two experiments, A) 1 Hz, 70%, for 30sec, wait 1min and determine the seizure threshold and behavioral profile, and B) 1 Hz, 70%, for 5min, wait 24hrs before testing. Results: No TMS protocol alone triggered a convulsive seizure or focal after-discharge in any rat. Further the focal after-discharge threshold to the kindling stimulus was not affected by LFTMS. However, the latency to forelimb clonus of the kindled seizure was significantly lengthened by both LFTMS protocols, indicating a delay in the recruitment of the convulsive kindled seizure. Surprisingly, TMS did not block or even marginally obscure the online EEG from the implanted bipolar Nichrome electrodes. Conclusions: TMS alone does not trigger seizures in seizure-prone or -resistant rats with a well-established kindled focus in either the amygdala or hippocampus. 1 Hz TMS does not effect the AD threshold, but significantly affects the recruitment of the convulsive seizure, which is an anti-epileptic effect.

Elisevich ( 1 Neurosurgery, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ; 2 Anesthesiology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ; and 3 Neurology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Epileptogenesis precipitated by status epilepticus (SE) is believed to evolve during a latent period which intervenes between SE and the emergence of spontaneous seizures. Vascular pathologies have been observed in several limbic structures in chronically epileptic animals following SE, including upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among reactive astrocytes, angiogenesis, and increases in neovascular permeability. Here we have investigated the temporal evolution of these vascular pathologies following SE in the rat. Methods: SE was induced in male wistar rats (250 g ? 350 g) by systemic kainic acid injection (10 mg/kg, i.v.), and was terminated four hours after onset by injection of pentobarbital (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The control group received vehicle injections and did not develop SE. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (50 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered daily for seven consecutive days to separate cohorts beginning 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, or 49 days post-SE. Animals in each cohort were sacrificed 14 days after completing the BrdU injection series, and angiogenesis was subsequently assayed by double-label immunohistochemistry for BrdU and von Willebrand factor. Prior to sacrifice, vascular permeability was assayed serially at 7, 14, 21, 24 and 56 days post-SE, using gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gd-DTPA was administered using a stepped down infusion protocol that maintained a relatively constant blood Gd-DTPA level during 20 min of imaging. Pre-contrast T1-weighted images (T1WI) were subtracted from post-contrast T1WI to identify enhancing areas. Results: Endothelial proliferation was significantly increased (p < 0.05) during the first two weeks (day 1 and day 7 cohorts) post-SE, spanning the duration of the average latent period. At sacrifice, coincidently labeled cells were commonly found in abnormal neovessels within regions damaged by SE. MRI image subtraction indicated that vascular permeability increased toward the end of the latent period, coinciding with the formation of abnormal neovascular complexes within regions of epileptogenesis. Conclusions: The evolution of vascular pathologies following kainic acid-induced SE occurred primarily during the latent period which preceded the onset of spontaneous seizures. These were observed exclusively in regions of the brain damaged by SE and consist of abnormally permeable neovascular complexes formed via angiogenesis. The timing of events in relation to SE suggests that the resultant increase in vascular permeability may bias the adjoining neuropil toward hyperexcitability and promote the emergence of spontaneous seizures.

This has widely been thought to be a consequence of the epileptic process, but recent evidence suggests there could be a common causal link. This study investigates whether the GAERS (Generalised Absence Epileptic Rats from Strasbourg) strain of rats, a phenotypic animal model of generalised absence epilepsy, also display behavioral abnormalities, and attempts to determine whether these behaviors are present prior to the development of absence seizures. Methods: Mixed gender GAERS rats were compared with Non-Epileptic Controls in neurobehavioral tests for anxiety (elevated plus maze) and depression (sucrose-preference test). Comparisons were made at 7 or 13 weeks, the equivalent neurodevelopmental age of adolescence in a rat, and also before and after the development of seizures. Results: GAERS rats showed increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze at both 7 and 13 weeks of age compared with NEC rats, as evidenced by a significantly lower number of open arm entries (at 7 weeks: 3.14 ± 0.53 entries (n = 14) vs 7.90 ± 1.01 (n = 20); at 13 weeks: 4.67 ± 1.03 entries (n = 15) vs 6.09 ± 0.73 (n = 11) ? two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0019). This strain of rats also displayed a significantly reduced preference for sucrose drinking water (at 7 weeks: 3.18 ± 0.66ml (n = 11) vs 6.67 ± 0.88ml (n = 3); at 13 weeks: 3.00 ± 0.84ml (n = 5) vs 4.83 ± 0.63ml (n = 12) ? two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0054), indicating an anhedonic state and suggestive of a depressive phenotype. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that GAERS rats, when compared with non-epileptic controls, display anxious and depressive behaviors which are present prior to the onset of absence seizures. This suggests that affective disorders may not be a consequence of seizures, and also raises the possibility that there may be a common neurodevelopmental causality which predisposes humans to both affective disturbance and epilepsy.

Kelly ( 1 Department of Neurology, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA ; 2 Department of Neurology, Stroke Program, The Medical Center at the University of Texas at Houston, Houston, TX ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Several rat strains have been studied extensively and are well-known as genetic models of absence epilepsy. Less well-known is the fact that many common laboratory rat strains frequently express spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a similar fashion. These SWDs are usually 6?9 Hz, and are associated with motor arrest of the animal. Generally, SWDs tend to be more frequent and longer in duration as the animals grow older. To our knowledge, however, no study in Long Evans rats has included a detailed observation of SWDs and how SWD expression changes throughout their lifetime. Previously, we reported that cortical infarction by middle cerebral artery/common carotid artery occlusion results in a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of SWDs compared to sham-operated control animals (Kelly et al, 2006). In this study, we sought to extend these observations to gain a better understanding of the timecourse of SWDs and the effect of lesion-associated changes on their expression in these animals. Methods: Five Long Evans rats lesioned by MCA/CCAO and four Long Evans sham-operated controls were intermittently monitored by video-EEG over a six-month period as previously reported (Kelly et al, 2006). Fifty-hour samples were then chosen from each animal's EEG record and visually reviewed for the presence of SWDs. The time and date of each SWD observed was documented, as well as the duration of the event. Preliminary results were obtained by plotting SWD data on a timeline for analysis by linear regression. Results: Preliminary results in control rats indicate that in 4 of 4 animals (100%) SWDs tend to increase in frequency of occurrence as the animal grows older. The average duration of SWDs tended to increase with age in 2 of 4 animals (50%), while decreasing in the other 2 animals (50%). Preliminary results in lesioned animals show a trend toward both greater frequency of occurrence and longer duration of SWDs in 2 of 5 (40%) of animals, and a decrease in both frequency of occurrence and duration in 2 of 5 animals (40%). One animal (20%) showed an increase in the frequency of occurrence, but a decrease in the average duration of SWDs. Conclusions: Since 7 of the 9 animals included in this study showed a trend toward an increase in the frequency of occurrence of SWDs over the six-month monitoring period, these studies appear to be consistent with reports of an aging-related increase in SWD expression in other rat strains. Changes in average duration of SWDs over time appear to be variable animal to animal. No reported changes in SWD expression are clearly related to the lesion.

The functional meaning of NO and NOS in epilepsy remains controversial despite previous studies from animal models. In present study, we investigated NOS expression in the hippocampus of rat with pilocarpine-induced seizures. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (200?250g) were pretreated with atropine methylbromide (1 mg/kg s.c.) and 30 min later with pilocarpine hydrochloride (330 mg/kg i.p.). After 40 min, the Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated by injection of diazepam (4 mg/kg i.p.). Animals were sacrificed 1 day, 3days, 2 wk (silent phase) or 1 month (chronic phase) after status. Neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and epithelial NOS (eNOS) expressions and the density of mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the hippocampus were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and neo-Timm's histological procedures. Results: iNOS and eNOS expressions were more strongly upregulated than nNOS expression at both phases. nNOS expression gradually increased until 3 days and decreased after 2 wk. iNOS expression had no alteration at both phases. eNOS expression tended to decrease after 2 wk. The density of MFS gradually increased and was strongest at 1 month. Conclusions: Our data indicate that nNOS and eNOS with the strongest upregulation in the silent phase may have a correlation with epileptogenesis while iNOS with the durability of upregulation in both phases may have something of influence on the hippocampus also after the epileptogenesis was acquired. 1 Rafal M. Kaminski, 1 Hamid Sheikhi, and 1 Michael A. Rogawski ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS/NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: 11-Beta hydroxylase is involved in final steps of steroid hormone synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to accumulation of hormone precursors, which may eventually enter an alternative metabolic pathway and become neurosteroids. Neurosteroids are potent anticonvulsants acting via positive modulation of GABAA receptors. We have previously shown that they are particularly effective against 6 Hz seizures in mice. In the present study we investigated whether inhibition of 11-beta hydroxylase protects against 6 Hz seizures and whether this effect is associated with increased neurosteroid synthesis. Methods: Male NIH Swiss mice were the experimental subjects. The animals were pretreated with either metyrapone or etomidate, which both are potent inhibitors of 11-beta hydroxylase, and challenged at various time points with corneal 6 Hz electrical stimulation (32 mA, 3 sec.) to induce seizures. Separate groups of animals were additionally treated with finasteride to test whether seizure protection following administration of metyrapone or etomidate is attenuated by inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis. Results: Metyrapone afforded dose-dependent protection against 6 Hz seizures 30 min. after injection (ED50 = 190.6 mg/kg). However, the potency of metyrapone was much higher (6-fold increase) when the animals were tested 6 hrs. following injection (ED50 = 30 mg/kg). Etomidate displayed very similar pattern of protection against 6 Hz seizures with respective ED50 values of 4.5 and 1.7 mg/kg. Finasteride partially attenuated the anticonvulsant effects of both 11-beta hydroxylase inhibitors. Conclusions: Inhibition of 11-beta hydroxylase produces prolonged anticonvulsant actions in mice. This effect may be associated with an increased neurosteroid production, which could be responsible for protection from seizures. 1 Irina Kharatishvili, 1 Riikka Immonen, 1 Olli Grohn, and 1 Asla Pitkanen ( 1 A.I. Virtanen Institute, Kuopio University, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: The risk of posttraumatic epilepsy positively correlates with the severity of brain injury. Up to 50% of patients with penetrating head injury can develop epilepsy later in life, whereas for moderate injury the incidence of epilepsy is only 4.2%. Our previous study with lateral fluid percussion brain injury model (FPBI) demonstrated that severe impact strength resulting in 31?33% mortality, causes development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in 43?50% of experimental animals (Kharatishvili et al., Neuroscience 2006;140:685?97). In this study, we aimed to examine if in FPBI model, similarly to humans, probability of developing epilepsy is associated with injury severity. Methods: Head trauma was induced by lateral FPBI in adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 15, 5 shams). The pressure of the applied impact, as recorded by a transducer, varied from 2.3 to 3.3 atm. The low mortality rate (23%) indicated moderate severity of the injury. Quantitative MRI was used to monitor the progression of the lesion starting at 3 hrs post-injury and repeated at 3 d, 9 d, 2 month-, 3 month- and 6 month post-injury time-points. Morris water maze test (MWM) was used to assess the long-term behavioral outcome (spatial learning and memory) 7 months after FPBI. After that, 24h/day continuous video-EEG monitoring was performed to assess the development of seizure activity; animals were implanted with depth electrode in the ventral hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury site and contralateral cortical electrode, and followed by continuous video-EEG for 2 + 2 weeks with 3 week interval for up to 12 months. Results: The mean volume of the cortical damage at 6 months post-injury was 40.8 ± 38.1mm3 (range 2.7?130.0 mm3). MWM test demonstrated no difference in spatial learning in injured rats compared to shams (p>0.05). EEG monitoring revealed 2?20 sec runs of 6?8 Hz monomorphic rhythmic activity with a spike-like negative phase in 70% rats both in the FPBI and control groups. This rhythm was registered in drowsiness over the injury side and was responsive to movement. No epileptiform discharges/seizures were recorded during the entire monitoring period. Conclusions: Rats with moderate FPBI had substantial cortical lesion. However, the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory deficit was not as pronounced as previously found in animals which developed epilepsy after severe FPBI (p < 0.05). Also, none of the rats had electrographic seizures. In lateral FPBI, the moderate force of the impact results in progressive brain damage but does not increase the likelihood of posttraumatic epileptogenesis.

Growing evidence suggests that pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules are synthesized during seizures in the brain at the sites of seizure initiation and propagation, and that rapid induction of these inflammatory mediators may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. We hypothesize that activation of microglia and subsequent increases in cytokines, chemokines, and complements are the key initiating events for seizure-induced inflammatory responses. Methods: In a total of 40 heterozygous Cx3cr1GFP/+ adult mice, Cx3cr1 encoding fractalkine chemokine receptor has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene by targeted deletion via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Seizures were induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA, 20 mg/kg); control with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The mice were sacrificed 30 min, 1day, 2 days, 7days, or 14 days after the injections. Three 50-?m-thick horizontal sections (6 hippocampal sections per brain) were selected for quantification of microglia. An average percent of area above the set threshold (containing green fluorescent cells/hippocampal hilar region capture at 20X magnification) and number of fluorescent element were calculated per animal, and comparison was made between KA and Control animals. Results: Enhanced fluorescent signaling indicative of microglial activation was already apparent in the hippocampus 30 minutes after KA-induced seizures. Within 2 days, microglia in the hippocampus appeared enlarged and more numerous. A nearly 2 fold increase in the area of fluorescent cells was noted in KA treated mice compared to control littermates (PBS:1.67 ± 0.15 vs KA:3.08 ± 0.28, p < 0.005). Also, significant microglial proliferation occurred 2 days after KA-induced seizures (113 ± 5 vs 189 ± 9, p = 0.0002). These increases in the area and number of fluorescent cells persisted to 7 days after KA (area%: 1.64 ± 0.10 vs 2.35 ± 0.21, p < 0.01; spot counts: 102 ± 3 vs 141 ± 5, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Taking advantage of transgenic mice in which all microglia are fluorescently labeled, we have unequivocally demonstrated an acute and persistent microgliosis after KA-induced seizures. Neuroinflammation provoked by seizures thus appears to be mediated via activation of resident CNS immune cells, microglia. Our data implicates microglia in seizure-induced neuronal excitability and degeneration, and suggests an inhibition of microglia activation as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Schauwecker ( 1 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Cell and Neurobiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Susceptibility to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death varies among inbred mouse strains due to variation in genetic background. Our QTL mapping studies have shown that distal chromosome 18 (Sicd1) contains a gene(s) conferring different susceptibility to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) inbred mouse strains. We have verified that the causal gene(s) reside in the Sicd1 QTL utilizing congenic strains. We found the congenic strains having the Sicd1 QTL-resistant locus from a cell-death resistant strain (B6) and the remainder of their genome from a cell-death susceptible strain (FVB) are less susceptible to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death as compared to the cell-death susceptible strain (FVB). We hypothesized that a strain-specific variation in one or more genes is responsible for the Sicd1 QTL effect. Methods: We have focused on two potential candidate genes, Galr1 and Mbp, based on their putative role in modulating seizure susceptibility and excitatory amino acid-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis we sought to identify sequence variants in the Galr1 and Mbp genes between B6 and FVB strains using DNA sequencing. As a complimentary method to identify the Sicd1 QTL gene(s), we have examined changes in gene expression at the mRNA level of Galr1 and Mbp in hippocampal homogenates from both the parental inbred and the reciprocal congenic strains. Studies are underway to detect aberrant splicing based on cDNA sequencing and differential expression of Galr1 and Mbp at the protein level between our parental strains, B6 and FVB, as well as our reciprocal congenic strains. Results: Based on preliminary results, no coding sequence variants have been detected in the Galr1 and Mbp genes. We have found genotype-dependent differences in Galr1 mRNA expression between B6 and FVB parental strains using qRT-PCR (p = 0.023). Differential expression of hippocampal mRNA for Galr1 was also found by qRT-PCR between the FVB.B6-Chr18 congenic strain and the parental FVB strain. In contrast, no statistically significant differences in Mbp mRNA expression were observed either between the parental strains or recombinant congenic strains (p = 0.816). Conclusions: Based on the expression variation and its putative role in modulating seizure susceptibility and excitatory amino acid-induced cell death we consider Galr1 as a strong candidate gene responsible for the Sicd1 QTL effect. Follow-up studies whether there is functional expression differences in Galr1 gene between B6 and FVB would support Galr1 as a Sicd1 QTL gene. Results from the proposed studies will add to our understanding of the molecular determinants critical for the pathogenesis of seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death.

This study examined the contributions to this effect of the subtypes of glucocorticoid receptors: mineralocorticoid (MR, high-affinity for CS) and glucocorticoid (GR, low-affinity for CS). Methods: Female Non-Epileptic Control rats 10?13 weeks of age were ovariectomized and implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala. Five experimental groups were studied: 1. Water-control (n = 6), 2. CS treated (n = 6), 3. CS + Mifepristone (Mif ? GR-antagonist, 25 mg/kg sc, n = 7), 4. CS + Spironolactone (Spir ? MR antagonist, 50 mg/kg, n = 5), and 5. CS + Mif (25 mg/kg) + Spir (50 mg/kg) (n = 6). Corticosterone was dissolved in drinking water (6 mg/100 ml) and administered ad libitum (groups 2?5) throughout the kindling period. Rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (Groups 1 and 2) or the relevant antagonist in vehicle (Groups 3?5) twice daily for the entire kindling period. Rapid Amygdala Kindling (RAK), which began two days after initial treatment, consisted of 10 sec bursts of 400?A every 15?20 mins, with up to 24 stimulations per day. Results: Groups differed significantly in the number of stimulations required to reach the ?fully kindled state? defined as five Class V seizures on the Racine scale (p = 0.04, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). The CS-treated group kindled faster than either the water-treated control group (p < 0.05) or either of the three CS+antagonist groups (p < 0.10). No significant differences were found between the any of the CS+antagonist groups and the water-treated controls. Conclusions: The data implicate both high affinity (MR) and low affinity (GR) glucocorticoid receptors in the mechanism by which low-dose CS accelerates kindling epileptogenesis. This may have implications for understanding the potential effects of chronic stress and depression in initiating and/or exacerbating TLE.

Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Division of Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 3 McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging imaging modality that has the potential to image the dynamic function of the brain due to its unique ability of imaging biological tissues with high optical contrast and ultrasound resolution. Here we report the first application of our finite element based PAT method for imaging of seizure-onset zone in an animal model of focal seizures. Methods: Male Harlen Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 50?60g, were used in this study. The rats were anesthetized with urethane 1 mg/g in all the experiments. Focal seizures were induced by microinjection of a GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the left parietal neocortex. A mechanical scanning photoacoustic system with single acoustic transducer was employed for collecting the light-induced acoustic signals. A reconstruction algorithm was used to generate PAT images. Results: Following microinjection of BMI into the left parietal cortex, focal seizures were induced and confirmed with electroencephalogram recordings which showed high amplitude spike and wave discharges. These seizures were accurately localized tomographically by PAT. The dynamic changes in PAT imagings were comparable to EEG changes during seizures. Conclusions: Our result showed that PAT is an emerging non-invasive imaging modelity to localize the seizure-onset zone. Compared to other neuroimaging modalities, PAT has not only the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution, but also the ease of use. It has the potential to bring brain imaging to the bedside, clinic and daily life, and coincide a scan with a seizure such that an epileptic focus and seizure occurrence can be visualized in real-time.

Wood, and 1 Paula E. Schauwecker ( 1 Cell and Neurobiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Studies have shown a correlation between estrous cycle and seizure susceptibility in humans and most mammals. This effect is also seen during menopause, or reproductive senescence. It has been hypothesized that the hormonal fluctuations throughout the various stages of estrous exert some type of influence on seizure occurrence, prevalence, and severity. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of ovarian hormone cyclicity at different stages of estrous, the loss of ovarian hormones and the relationship to kainate-induced seizure susceptibility and seizure induced cell death. Methods: Control female mice of the FVB/NJ (FVB) strain were administered kainic acid (KA) at different stages of the estrous cycle. Estrous cycle was determined by vaginal cytology and only regularly cycling animals were chosen for the experiments. KA or saline was administered systemically to female FVB mice at various stages of the estrous cycle, to ovariectomized (OVX) females, OVX females treated with estradiol (OVX + E), and VCD-treated female mice. Mice were monitored for 4 hours for seizure onset, severity, and activity and scored for latency to onset of first severe seizure and duration of severe seizures. After 7 days of recovery, neuronal damage was evaluated throughout the hippocampus proper. Results: Among ovary-intact female FVB mice, estrous cyclicity was without effect on seizure susceptibility. In particular, no significant differences in latency to onset or duration of severe seizures were noted. In contrast, in the OVX + E female mice, seizure duration was significantly increased, and latency to onset of seizures was reduced, as compared to OVX and ovary-intact female mice. The extent of hippocampal cell death among ovary-intact mice was not affected based on estrous cycle staging. In particular, no significant differences in the extent of cell death were observed between ovary-intact female FVB mice injected with KA during estrus, when gonadal hormone levels peak, or during diestrus, the nadir of gonadal hormone levels. Conclusions: Our results suggest that estradiol may lower the threshold for seizure activity. While we found no modulatory effects of estradiol on seizure susceptibility or cell death based on estrous cyclicity, it is important to note that two different models for the modulation of ovarian steroid levels were used. In one model, ovariectomy (OVX) causes a complete disruption of gonadal hormones. In contrast, ovarian steroid levels vary across the estrous cycle in ovary-intact female mice. In addition, OVX + E mice have none of the protective effects of progesterone present. Studies are ongoing to compare two models of reproductive senescence: the OVX model and the chemically-induced VCD model. Insight into the mechanisms of brain related-changes as a result of the loss of ovarian steroids will help identify risk factors for seizure susceptibility and cell death in aging women. 1 Jesus Machado-Salas, 3 Patricia Guevara, 1 Dongsheng Bai, 1 Reyna Duron, 2 K.

Methods: Our Laforin-deficient knockout mice were produced by deleting the Laforin domain coding region of the EPM2A gene (Hum Mol Genet 11:1252?1262.2002). Similar groups of control and homozygous null mutant mice were sacrificed at fixed intervals and their encephalons were fixed with glutaraldehyhde and processed with PAS and immunocytochemical techniques. Monoclonal antibodies were used against neurofilaments M and L (NFM/L) . Results: Our experimental animals showed neuronal death at 2 months of age, in the absence of apoptotic changes or accumulation of Lafora bodies (LfB). At 9 months of age the number of LfB was very prominent in large nerve cells. They were positive to PAS, Ubiquitin and AGEP. Large neurons from the brainstem, hippocampus and cerebellum showed abnormal immunoreaction for NFM/L, which, in some cases, very much resembled neurofibrillary degeneration. Clusters of fragmented and distorted neurites were seen, very much like ?senile? (neurite) plaques. Analysis of LfB has revealed some unexpected structural components that appear to establish an anatomofunctional link between them and the neurocytoskeleton . Conclusions: Our observations apppear to indicate that our model of Lafora disease presents morphological evidence of a neurodegenerative process in absence of apoptotic cell death. Lafora bodies do not primarily participate in neuronal death. With age, they increase in size and number, accumulating poliglucosans and, probably, also misfolded proteins. The presence of a complex structure in the ring of Lafora bodies, allows us to postulate an active role for these still enigmatic inclusions.

To utilize potential of these drugs attention is now focused on specific NMDA antagonists. We decided to study effects of representants of the two above mentioned classes low-affinity noncompetitive antagonist memantine and NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil in immature rats. Methods: Two models of epileptic seizures were used ? pentetrazol(PTZ)-induced motor seizures and cortical epileptic afterdischarges (ADs) induced by stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex. Male rats of the Wistar strain 12, 18, and 25 days old were tested. The same age groups were studied behaviorally to find possible side effects. Spontaneous behavior in the open field was registered and motor performance was checked by means of age-specific tests. Memantine was administered intraperitoneally in doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, ifenprodil in doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg. Each age and dose group in each experiment was formed by 8 to 10 animals. Results: Memantine suppressed generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in a dose-dependent manner in all age groups. In contrast, it potentiated minimal clonic seizures. Ifenprodil suppressed only the incidence of the tonic phase of GTCS in 12- and 18-day-old rats. Memantine increased threshold intensities for elicitation of spike-and-wave type of AD in 12- and 18-day-old rats as well as threshold for the other (mixed) type of ADs (due to a transition of epileptic activity into the limbic system) in 25-day-old rats. Duration of ADs was shortened in all age groups. Ifenprodil pretreatment decreased threshold intensities for elicitation of mixed type of ADs in 18- and 25-day-old rats and increased duration of these ADs in 25-day-old rats. If administered when the animals allready passed repeated ADs, it significantly shortened ADs in 12- and 18- but not 25-day-old animals.All doses of memantine increased locomotor activity in 12- and 18-day-old rats, the change in the oldest group was not significant. The 20- and 40- mg/kg doses impaired motor performance in all age groups. Ifenprodil increased locomotor activity only in 12-day-old rats and motor performance was changed only with the highest dose in 12- and 25-day-old rats. Duration of the impairment of motor performance by either drug was shorter than duration of an anticonvulsant effect. Conclusions: Memantine exhibits anticonvulsant action as well as side effects described for common NMDA atagonists. Ifenprodil has an action mostly in the youngest group what is in agreement with developmenal decrease of NR2B subunits in the NMDA receptors.

Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a dynamic state. There are progressive changes in clinical behavior, response to treatment, extent of neuronal damage, and EEG pattern during prolonged clinical and experimental status epilepticus. SE also causes deficits in learning and memory, but progressive impairment with increasing severity of SE has been little studied. We tested the hypothesis that the EEG stage during SE predicts the extent of subsequent cognitive impairment. Methods: Forty-three 250?280 gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 4 stainless steel epidural electrodes for EEG recording. Status epilepticus was induced by 3 mmol/kg IP LiCl followed 24 hrs later by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. EEG was continuously recorded before and after injection, and SE was stopped at EEG stage I (discrete seizures), III (continuous ictal activity), IV (continuous ictal activity punctuated by flat periods), or V (periodic epileptiform discharges) (Treiman et al., Epilepsy Res5:49?60, 1990) with IP diazepam (10 mg/kg) plus phenobarbital (25 mg/kg). Control rats were given PB and DZM prior to SE induction and thus did not develop SE. Spatial learning and memory were assessed one week prior to SE induction and one week after SE using a modification of the Morris Water Maze (Morris, J Neurosci Methods11:47?60, 1984). Learning impairment was tested in six trials on each of four sequential days. Effect of the SE stage on the mean escape times to a submerged platform were determined by a multiple analysis of variance. Pair-wise multiple comparisons of groups were done by Fisher's least significant difference. The mean escape time for the trials on test day 1 post-SE was compared with the mean of the trials on test day 4 pre-SE to assess the effect of SE on spatial memory. Results: Mean time to stop SE from pilocarpine injection was: Stage I 25 min, Stage III 65 min, Stage IV 100 min, and Stage V 210 min. There were no significant differences between these groups in pre-SE water maze performance. However, post-SE day 1 mean escape times were significantly worse compared with pre-SE day 4 (test of memory) as well as the mean escape times for all test days (test of learning) in Stage IV and Stage V rats when compared to controls, Stage I, and Stage III rats (p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between control, Stage I and Stage III rats, nor between Stage IV and Stage V rats. Conclusions: SE results in a marked impairment of both visual-spatial memory and learning in the late stages of SE. Stage IV, and V rats demonstrated a greater impairment than controls, or Stage I-III. Thus progressive cognitive impairment, in addition to other dynamic changes cited above, is also an effect of prolonged SE. These data provide further evidence that the EEG stage during prolonged SE is a marker of its severity. (Supported by the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Stella M. Valiensi, 1 Oscar A.

Propofol is an anaesthetic with anticonvulsant effect, but its use is limited by complications such as Rhabdomyolisis? There are no experimental studies that can demonstrate neuroprotective activity of Propofol in S.E, neither R. attributed to this drug . Objectives: 1 ? To evaluate if Propofol in an animal model of Pilocarpine ? induced S.E can prevent neuronal damage in hippocampal structures. 2 ? To evaluate if Propofol in S.E. in this experimental model can cause R. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats, (200 to 300 g) were used. Biosecurity rules defined by the Institute of Basic Sciences and Experimental Medicine of our Hospital were followed. 1.CONTROL GROUP : n = 9 rats: 4 cm3 saline solution intraperitoneal (i.p) 2.PILOCARPINE GROUP : n = 10: 1 mg/kg N-Hyoscine butylbromide+ 350 mg/kg of i.p Pilocarpine. 3.PROPOFOL GROUP : n =10: 1 mg/kg N-Hyoscine butylbromide+ 350 mg/kg of i.p Pilocarpine. After 30 minutes of S.E., 20 mg/kg Propofol. Behaviour and Scalp EEG monitoring were evaluated. Brains were removed after 2 hours,and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H.E). The hippocampus was assessed. 4 histologic groups with signs of neuronal damage(dark and shrunken) were identified . 1) No damage 2) Mild damage: (+) 2?3 neurons per field (400 X) 3) Moderate damage (++) 3?5 neurons per field 4) Severe damage (+++) 5?7 neurons per field The muscle quadriceps femoralis was removed and stained with H.E. The presence of macrophage in and around the fibres was evaluated . The pathologist performed analyses blinded to the treatment received by the rats. Results: Brain damage in every area was analyzed with a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon sum rank).A p < 0.05 was considered a significant difference. Between Group1 and Group 2, greater difference was found in temporal neocortex and subiculum in Group 2. Significant damage decrease was observed in Group 3, with less damage in the CA3?4 regions (p = 0.0019). BEHAVIOUR All the rats had S.E. EEG: Group1: normal EEG. Group 2: continuous epileptiform activity . Group 3: continuous epileptiform activity during S.E. Propofol produced suppression of the epileptiform activity. R.: 2 rats in each group(Group 2 and Group 3) had signs of R.There were no statiscally significant differences between treatment groups. Conclusions: Neuronal damage was less severe in the rats treated with Propofol, with decrease neuronal damage regarding the CA region, specifically in the CA3?4 regions, which suggests its neuroprotective effect. R. was not considered a statiscally significant finding. 1 Brona M. Murphy, 2 Clara K. Schindler, 2 Sachiko Shinoda, 1 Carmen Bellver-Estelles, 1 Mark Dunleavy, 2 Robert Meller, 1 Jochen H.M. Prehn, 2 Roger P. Simon, and 1 David C. Henshall ( 1 Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 Robert S. Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Seizures whether brief or prolonged are capable of causing neuronal death. Apoptosis signaling pathways play a role is such neuronal loss. Previous studies have demonstrated that experimental seizures can activate the apoptotic intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway and that components of this pathway are altered in involved brain structures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We have developed a mouse model of seizure-induced neuronal death with features of programmed cell death. Presently, we examined the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in this model and contrasted this to events within human epilepsy brain. Methods: The experimental methods used in this study included, a mouse seizure model: intraamygdala kainic acid injection in adult mice, terminated after 40 min by diazepam, human temporal lobe specimens: hippocampal resections obtained following surgery for intractable epilepsy compared to matched autopsy controls, Western blotting and Immunofuorescence. Results: Seizures evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid in C57BL/6 mice caused ipsilateral death of CA1 and CA3 neurons within the hippocampus. Western blotting revealed seizures induced overexpression of Bax, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and ?7. Analysis of hippocampi from patients with intractable epilepsy revealed cleaved caspases 9 and 7 were present. In searching for relevant anti-apoptotic proteins we found no changes to expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl but a rapid decline in Bcl-w levels at both 0.5 (p < 0.01) and 4 h following seizures. Reasoning that loss of Bcl-w may promote cell death after seizures we investigated hippocampal injury following seizures in mice lacking Bcl-w. Bcl-w knockout mice exhibited no obvious neuroanatomical differences to their wildtype littermates and expressed similar hippocampal levels of a range of apoptosis-associated proteins including Bcl-2 and similar amygdala levels of the kainic acid (KA) receptor GluR5?7. Seizures evoked by intraamygdala KA induced significantly more hippocampal neuronal loss and DNA fragmentation (terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling) in Bcl-w knockout mice compared to wildtype mice. Extending these data, we found higher cytoplasmic levels of Bcl-w in hippocampus from patients with TLE compared to autopsy controls. Conclusions: These data identify Bcl-w as an endogenous neuroprotective gene that may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of seizure-induced brain injury and temporal lobe epilepsy.

This study was designed to investigate immediate (24 hours) and long-term changes (2, 4 and 6 weeks) in GABAA/cBZR expression, neuronal loss and MFS in the hippocampus in the kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE. Methods: Age-matched non-epileptic control male rats were randomized into control and KA groups (at least n = 6/group). MFS and GABAA/cBZR expression, neuronal loss and MFS were measured in hippocampal subregions, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 in both the control and epilepsy groups. GABAA/cBZR expression (Bmax value) was measured by saturation-binding analysis using [3H]-Flumazenil, a cBZR antagonist. Stereological counting was performed for cell counting and volume analysis of the CA3 SPc subregion of the hippocampus. MFS into the dentate molecular layer was quantified from Timm-stained brain slices. Results: At 24 hours post-SE, Bmax was significantly increased compared to controls in the whole hippocampus (+29.4%± 5.7; p < 0.001) and parietal cortex (Par Ctx) (+30.6%± 12.8; p < 0.05) as well as in all subregions of the DG, CA1, and CA3 with the exception of CA3 SPc (Repeated measure ANOVA, p < 0.02). Calculated from absolute values, no changes in receptor expression were seen over 2?6 weeks. There was no difference in MFS 24 hours post-SE compared with controls but MFS increased in the dentate molecular layer at 2 weeks post SE (20% above control; p < 0.05) and showed a progressive increase over time reaching 70% above controls (p < 0.001) at 6 weeks. At 24 hours, statistically significant neuronal loss occurred (?24 ± 9.3%) in the CA3 SPc region (control = 6, KA group = 6, p < 0.05) associated with a significant increase in GABAA/cBZR expression per surviving neuron. No recovery of neurons was apparent through to the end of 6 weeks post-SE. Conclusions: Changes in GABAA/cBZR expression, cell loss and synaptic reorganization occur during epileptogenesis and may influence the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Elevated receptor expression observed early after status epilepticus (within 24 hours) may be a protective response by the brain to dampen excitability and increase resistance to future seizures. MFS, a form of neuronal reorganization, is a prominent feature in the KA model of TLE progressively increasing during the latent epileptogenic period up to onset of SRS. GABAA/cBZR expression and MFS were not correlated until 6 weeks implying that MFS may affect seizure activity in late stages of epilepsy onset. 1 Sandeep P. Nair, 4 Wendy M. Norman, 1 Linda K. Dance, 1,3 Panos M. Pardalos, 1,2 Jose C. Principe, and 1,4 Paul R. Carney ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida ; 2 Electrical and Computer Engineering ; 3 Industrial and Systems Engineering ; and 4 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Gradual, progressive preictal dynamical convergence among brain regions has been reported in human epilepsy (IEEE TBME 2003; 50; 616?27) and in an animal model of chronic limbic epilepsy (CLE) (Epilepsia 45 (S7): 211?212). We have used a spontaneously seizing animal model of limbic epilepsy to investigate the occurrence of spatiotemporal transitions involving such dynamical convergence among different regions in an epileptogenic brain. We hypothesize that the frequency of these transitions increases progressively from the time of initial insult to the subsequent manifestation of epilepsy. Methods: Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4) were used in the study. The model was developed using chronic hippocampal stimulation (CHS). The animals animals, after allowing sufficient time for recovery from the stimulation procedure,were connected to an automated system that monitored the T-index calculated from short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents estimated from multiple brain regions. A (dynamical convergence (transition) was defined as a drop in T-index value from a preset upper threshold (UT= 10) to a lower threshold (LT= 2.662). The time leading to the first seizure was divided into blocks of 12 hours and the frequency of transitions in each block was calculated. The null hypothesis is rejected if the regression slope is found to be significantly positive (p < 0.05). Results: Two out of the four animals developed spontaneous seizures after CHS. The first showed a progressive increase in frequency of spatiotemporal transitions leading up to the first seizure (recording time before seizure?232.9 hrs, slope = 0.09, p = 0.0005), the second animal showed an abrupt increase in incidence immediately preceding the seizure (recording time before seizure?142.5 hrs, slope = 0.07, p = 0.0228). No dynamical transitions were observed in the two animals that did not develop spontaneous seizures. Conclusions: These results suggest that spatiotemporal transitions involving convergence of dynamical values among brain regions may be a marker for epileptogenesis.

We investigated whether carbamazepine (CBZ), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA) as monotherapy are antiepileptogenic or disease modifying. To mimic clinical study design, treatment was started 24 h after the beginning of electrically induced SE. Methods: SE was induced by stimulating the lateral nucleus of the amygdala of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 98) electrically for 20?40 min. One group of vehicle treated non-stimulated animals served as controls for histology and behavioral analysis (SHAM, n = 37). SE was stopped with diazepam (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) at 4 h after SE induction (additional injection of DZP 10 mg/kg was given at 3h after the first injection). Administration of compounds (CBZ 120 mg/kg/d, n = 17; LEV 300 mg/kg/d, n = 18; VPA 600 mg/kg/d, n = 16; vehicle VEH, n = 47) was started 24 h after the beginning of SE. On the first day, AEDs were administered intraperitoneally, and thereafter i.g. All compounds were administered at 8 h intervals for 7 d. SE and the development of spontaneous seizures were monitored with video-EEG. The occurrence of epilepsy and seizure frequency were assessed at 10 weeks after SE induction with a continuous video-EEG monitoring (24h/day) for 2 weeks. To confirm antiepileptogenesis or disease modification, the second 2-weeks continuous video-EEG was started 14 weeks after SE. Thereafter, animals underwent behavioural testing (Morris water-maze and fear conditioning) and were perfused for histology. Results: Altogether, 62% of VEH, 89% of LEV, 53% of CBZ, and 88% of VPA treated animals developed epilepsy. The mean seizure frequency in the VEH group was 6.3 ± 12.8 sz/d (range 0.04?50, median 0.39), in the LEV group 4.8 ± 7.6 sz/d (range 0.04?24.2, median 0.88), and in the VPA group 7.6 ± 18.5 sz/d (range 0.07?70). In CBZ group the mean seizure frequency was 0.6 ± 0.6 sz/day (range 0.04?1.63, median 0.46). However it did not differ from that in the VEH group. Mean behavioural seizure severity did not differ between groups. The mean seizure duration was longer in the CBZ group compared to that in the VEH group (77 ± 16 sec vs. 68 ± 19 sec, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The three AEDs with different mechanisms of action, LEV, CBZ, and VPA were not antiepileptogenic when started at 24 h after SE induction and continued for 7 days.

Fisher ( 1 Neurology, Stanford, Stanford, CA ) Rationale: Since CSF drug delivery is clinically useful for antibiotics and antineoplastics, direct delivery of anti-epileptic medication to the CSF may also be useful and improve the tolerability and efficacy of these drugs. We performed a proof-in-principle study of intraventricular gabapentin (GPN) in the rat. Methods: Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with two Alzet model 2001 osmotic pumps, each delivering 1.0 ?L/hour for one week. Pumps were connected to left and right intraventricular catheters, with tips in relation to Bregma at: 1.4 mm lateral and 0.8 mm posterior on the right, 2 mm lateral and 1.3 mm posterior on the left, and 2.5 mm below the top of cortex. GPN 80 ?g/?L was installed into each pump and delivered at 3.8 mg per day. Half of the animals had pumps filled with isotonic normal saline (control group), and half with GBP. Seizure theshold was tested after five days, by dripping the convulsant liquid anesthetic flurothyl onto tissue paper at 10 ?L/minute in a sealed 3.2 L container. A single observer, blinded as to treatment group, recorded the time to first myoclonic twitch, first partial seizure and first tonic-clonic seizure. Seizures were judged behaviorally; no EEG was used as part of this protocol. Results: Of 60 rats used, 6 were lost due to mortality or pump/catheter malfunction. For the surviving 54, time to first tonic-clonic seizure was 295.8 ± 58.8 s (n = 28) for control group, versus 338.0 ± 89.9 s (n = 26) for the rats with GBP in the pump (p = 0.049 by two-tailed t-test). The mean time to onset of first myoclonic jerk was 158.7 ± 20.8 vs. 164.6 ± 33.5 s (p = n.s.). Effects of flurothyl can be influenced by animal weight; however, regression of time to tonic-clonic seizure versus weight yielded no significant relationship. Serum gabapentin levels obtained immediately after testing the seizure threshold were undetectable (<1 ?g/ml) in every animal. We did not perform quantitative studies of GPN distribution through brain, but methylene blue dye in the pumps distributed into periventricular white matter and also over cortex, especially ipsilaterally. Conclusions: Intraventricular delivery of gabapentin elevates the threshold for generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the rat flurothyl model, but not time to the first myoclonic jerk or first partial seizure. Interpretation is limited, as the degree of penetration and distribution of the GPN into brain cannot be detailed. Unmeasurable serum levels suggest the effect is not systemic. Intraventricular delivery of antiepileptic drugs would be useful for drugs with poor oral absorption or which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Intraventricular administration of drugs that do penetrate into brain after oral ingestion (e.g. GPN) may or may not be useful, depending upon achievable improvements in the therapeutic/toxic ratio and in steady brain levels of drug.

Mareci ( 1 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: In this study, we used MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine the temporal hippocampal and parahippocampal structural changes in vivo at 11.1 Tesla (T) during the latent period of epileptogenesis and to examine these same regions in the excised intact brain at 17.6 T. The mesial temporal lobe model was also used to determine if chronic stimulating/recording microelectrodes distort MR images collected at 11.1 T. Methods: Fifty micron gold plated tungsten wires (2) were implanted in the ventral hippocampus in Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6). Spontaneously seizing rats were obtained following experimentally inducted status epilepticus (SE). Rats were video recorded to capture spontaneous seizures. Injured rat brains were examined in vivo at 11.1 T pre/post wire implantation and after SE at 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60 days. The intact excised brain of 2 rats were imaged at 17.6 T. Diffusion weighted images were acquired using gradient directions specified by the tessellations of an icosahedron on the hemisphere. The diffusion weighted images were fit to a rank-2 tensor model of diffusion. Results: Five of the 6 rats developed seizures. The DT images of the rat, without seizures, looked identical to controls. In the other 5 rats, diffusivity increased in the hippocampus and fimbria in vivo. In 2 of these rats, diffusivity also increased in the entorhinal cortex. Increased diffusivity was seen as early as day 7 post-stimulation. We examined the excised brains of a seizing rat and one that did not. In the seizing rat, the diffusivity increased bilaterally in the hippocampal region, identified with mossy fiber sprouting. The hippocampus showed atrophy ipsilateral to the simulation. Decreased fractional anisotropy indicated a loss of structure in the dentate gyrus and CA2/3 region of the pyramidal cells (Fig.1). Conclusions: The induced SE produces bilateral structural changes, visible in detail with DTI, in the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. Stereotaxic images allowed repeated measures of the structural changes during epileptogenesis and the implanted wires produced minimal distortions. Future work will relate the physiological and structural changes, during epileptogenesis, using electrophysiology and DTI.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 RS Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Hippocampal sclerosis is the commonest lesion identified in temporal lobe epilepsy and has been proposed as both cause and effect of seizures. Additionally, an emerging concept in epilepsy research is that the propagation of paroxysmal activity is necessary and sufficient to transform a naïve structure into one that is capable of generating spontaneous (epileptic) seizures. This transformation underlies the formation of an epileptogenic focus that can entrain the generation of seizures in interconnected structures. However, whether seizure-injury occurs within such communicating fibre tracts is largely unknown but recent reports document the presence of lesions within white matter tracts in epilepsy patients. According, we evaluated white matter tract injury within the corpus callosum in a novel seizure model in mice. Methods: Adult male C57Bl/6 mice underwent focally-evoked seizures induced by intraamygdala kainic acid microinjection with continuous electroencephalography. Seizures were terminated by intravenous lorazepam 40 (n = 10) or 50 minutes (n = 7) following kainate/vehicle (n = 3) injection and brains obtained 24 hours later. Coronal sections were processed for detection of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL technique. To identify the cell populations of the corpus callosum, the slides were labelled for oligodendrocytes with antibodies against 2,3-cyclic-nucleotide 3- phosphodiesterase (CNP) or myelin basic protein (MBP) and for astrocytes with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Results: Seizures in mice terminated after 40 min resulted predominantly in unilateral TUNEL staining within ipsilateral CA3 and CA1. In contrast, when seizure activity was extended to 50 min contralateral CA1 and CA3 hippocampal damage was more frequently observed. Examination of the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum revealed the presence of cell death. Our data also revealed significant correlations between numbers of degenerating cells in contralateral (r = 0.460, p < 0.05) corpus callosum and the severity of neuronal cell death in CA3 hippocampus ipsilateral. Seizures induced oligodendrocyte death in the corpus callosum as revealed by the immunofluorescence colocalization of TUNEL/MBP or CNP. In contrast, the presence of a gliogenesis is shown around the corpus callosum. Conclusions: The present data establish that prolonged focal limbic seizures in mice induce damage to non-neuronal elements within the corpus callosum and show the degree of this injury is a function of hippocampal damage. Our data indicate seizures injure white matter tracts and offer a potential mechanism for seizure generation and spread to contralateral and extrahippocampal structures.

Schwartz ( 1 Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Cortical stimulation is playing an increasing role in clinical neuroscience in the treatment of epilepsy, stroke and pain. The neuromodulatory effects of cortical stimulation include both excitation and inhibition, the balance of which varies with the stimulation parameters. As a result, cortical stimulation also influences cerebral hemodynamics, including perfusion and oxygenation, which may also vary depending on the stimulation parameters, although little data exists on this subject. In this study, we investigate the effects of stimulation frequency on the hemodynamic response using optical recording of intrinsic signals (ORIS). Methods: Using bipolar tungsten electrodes, the rat sensory neocortex was stimulated at variable frequencies in a pseudo-random fashion at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 250 Hz at a constant charge (CC). The amplitude remained constant at 1 mA. CC was maintained by delivering stimulation at 100 spikes at each frequency and varying the duration of stimulation. Simultaneous field potential (f.p.) recording and ORIS was performed at 570 nm and 610 nm to quantitatively measure total hemoglobin (Hbt), deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbr) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) using a pathlength correction. Optical data was averaged over 10 trials at each frequency and each trial lasted 100 sec so the optical signal could return to baseline. Trials with afterdischarges were eliminated. Results: A large increase in Hbr was recorded at all stimulation frequencies but the maximum occurred at 10 Hz (2.12 ± 0.20%, n = 3). The relationship between the increase in Hbr and stimulation frequency (in log scale) could be characterized by the equation y =?1.1164 ? 2 + 3.1836x ? 0.2979 (R2 = 0.74). There was a significant correlation between the duration of stimulation and the duration of the increase in Hbr (r = .86, p < 0.05). The largest increase in Hbt occurred at 50 Hz (4.04 ± 1.08%, n = 3) and the relationship between the increase in Hbt and stimulation frequency (in log scale) could be characterized by the equation y =?1.3816 ? 2 + 5.3414x ? 1.2291 (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.05). The duration of the increase in Hbt was generally longer than the duration of stimulation by 80 seconds, regardless of frequency. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the duration of stimulation is more important than the frequency in determining the duration of the dip and that the relationship between frequency and both Hbt and Hbr is not linear, with a plateau occurring between 10?50 Hz.

The process is especially prominent in the hippocampus, which is involved in mood and memory functions and epilepsy. A new hypothesis for the development of depression in humans has been formed over the last few years, which includes neurogenesis as a factor of importance in the depressive disease: Reduction of neurogenesis in the hippocampus is a causality factor in the generation of depression and stimulated neurogenesis is part of the recovery process from the depressive state. The same applies for epilepsy. VNS therapy, which has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of epilepsy, was early on in its development noted to have mood elevation effects in VNS treated patients, with effects on depressive symptoms. This anti-depressive effect from VNS has been proven in clinical studies, and VNS is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe depression in humans as well as epilepsy. The mechanisms behind the antiepileptic and anti-depressive effects from VNS are, however, not fully understood. We hypothesize that a VNS-induced stimulation of the neurogenesis is part of the mechanism behind the observed clinical effects from VNS. Methods: The degree of stem cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was studied. The number of new cells were measured by BrdU (bromodeoxy-uridine) incorporation. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against BrdU were used for the detection of the newly divided cells. Eight rats implanted with VNS-leads and generators were stimulated for two days with the following parameters: 0.75 mA output current, 250 microseconds pulse width, 20 Hz frequency, 30 seconds on and 5 minutes off. These rats were compared with eight control rats that had VNS surgery for implantation of the VNS equipment, but with devices constantly in the off position. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups with a 50% increase of stem cell proliferation at the 0.03 significance level in the VNS-stimulated rats as compared to sham operated animals. Conclusions: These results indicate that VNS treatment in the rat affects the stem cell proliferation in the hippocampus. In the light of the prevailing theory of a link between hippocampal neurogenesis, epilepsy and depression, this finding might represent an interesting path in the search for mechanisms behind the actions of VNS.

Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 2 Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: rTMS is a noninvasive method for cortical stimulation that is emerging as a new therapeutic tool in epilepsy. The technique is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction where small intracranial electrical currents are induced by a strong rapidly-changing extracranial magnetic field. Limited human trials and animal experiments in our laboratory show acute suppression and reduction in frequency of partial seizures with EEG-guided single pulse and 0.5 Hz rTMS. However, the capacity of rTMS to suppress generalized (absence) seizures has not been thoroughly examined. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether whether 0.5 Hz rTMS can suppress frequent PTZ-induced generalized seizures in a rat absence epilepsy model. Methods: Generalized (absence) seizures were triggered in adult male Long Evans rats (n = 10) with PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.). Immediately after PTZ injection, and thereafter at 30-minute intervals, one group (n = 4) was treated with 0.5 Hz repetitive TMS for 10 minutes (300 stimuli). A second group (n = 6) remained as untreated controls. Continuous EEG was recorded with subdermal wires electrodes for 120 minutes after PTZ injection, and then analyzed for seizure frequency during periods between TMS sessions. Results: (1) Frequent brief absence seizures accompanied by generalized spike-wave discharges on surface EEG were triggered by PTZ injection in all rats. (2) 3/6 untreated rats died within the monitoring period ? 0/4 rats died in the 0.5 Hz rTMS group. (3) Average cumulative seizure frequency was lower in the treated group after 60 min (t = 2.65; p < 0.033), 90 min (t = 2.98; p < 0.021) and 120 min (t = 2.85; p < 0.030) of monitoring. Conclusions: 0.5 Hz rTMS is effective in suppression of generalized seizures in the PTZ absence epilepsy rat model. Or finding may be a step toward eventual treatment of generalized epilepsy with low frequency rTMS.

In the developing rat brain, untreated LiPC-SE results in age dependent hippocampal injury as well as widespread extrahippocampal neuronal damage. We examined whether brief durations of SE are sufficient to induce injury in the immature brain. Methods: EEG data was collected using acquisition software obtained from wireless transponders implanted s.c. in two week old wistar pups. Rats were pretreated with LiCl (3 mEq) on the day of surgery and then subjected to SE 16?20 hr later with pilocarpine (60 mg/kg) at P14. Diazepam (5 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (25 mg/kg) were given after varying durations of SE using EEG recordings to determine both the delay of onset after PC injection, as well as the total duration of SE. 24 hr after the onset, rats were given pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) followed by perfusion/fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were embedded in paraffin and cut at 8 ? intervals. Sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade B (F-J B) as a marker of neuronal injury, and analyzed using a semiquantative scale (0 = no injury, 1 = trace, 2 = < 10%, 3 = 10?25%, 4 = 26?50%, 5 = > 50% F-J B labeled neurons) bilaterally in three sections containing the dorsal hippocampus. Results: SE was established in over 90% of the P14 rats. Behavioral manifestations of seizures appeared almost immediately after PC injection, but synchronized video monitoring revealed a delay of 9.8 ± 1.6 min before the appearance of continuous, rhythmic, high frequency electrographic activity used to mark the onset of SE. Prolonged recordings showed that the combination of diazepam/phenobarbital was sufficient to prevent the return of seizures over the following 24 hr period. While 30 min of SE was not sufficient to induce hippocampal injury with the exception of trace dentate granule cells, injury was seen in the amygdala (2.3 ± 0.1) and cortex (1.8 ± 0.1). No brightly labeled neurons were seen in the thalamus, but some lightly stained, irregularly shaped neurons were detected. Conclusions: Previous studies have shown that P14 rats subjected to LiPC experience several hours of SE resulting in extensive neuronal injury, particularly in the CA1 hippocampal subfield. While early pharmacological intervention was sufficient to protect those neurons from injury, extrahippocampal structures remain vulnerable after only 30 min of SE. Studies in adult rats suggest protection of the Ammon's horn alone is not sufficient to prevent epilepsy. 25% of untreated P14 rats undergoing LiPC-SE go on to demonstrate spontaneous seizures. Whether the neuronal injury that results after only 30 min is sufficient to induce epilepsy is under investigation.

Both loss and gain of FLN-A function have been proposed to disrupt the migration initiation of cortical neurons. Here we show that MEKK4 (a MAP3K member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway) is involved in Fln-A regulation and PVNH formation. Methods: We performed histological analyses on the brains of MEKK4-deficient mice. Additionally, we designed short interference RNA (siRNA) constructs targeting MEKK4, incorporated these constructs into the developing cerebral cortex by in utero electroporation and analyzed the fates of transfected cells. Immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, GST-pulldown and western blot analyses were also performed Results: MEKK4?/? mice develop bilateral PVNH in the cerebral cortex that arise from breaches in ventricular surface lining. Using neuronal markers, we show that cells within PVNH have differentiated and failed to migrate into the cortical plate. In utero electoporation of MEKK4 siRNA at E14.5 and analysis at P0 revealed dramatic disruption of migration-initiation of cortical neurons compared to control. Analysis of Fln-A expression in MEKK4?/? forebrain revealed elevated and ectopic Fln-A, while MEKK4 RNAi increased Fln-A phosphorylation in vitro. Finally, recombinant-MKK4/SEK1 protein precipitated a complex containing MEKK4 and Fln-A suggesting that MKK4/SEK1 bridges these molecules during development. Conclusions: Disrupted migration initiation in MEKK4-deficient cells may be related to both defects of the ventricular surface lining and dysregulated Fln-A. Our data demonstrate an essential role for MEKK4 in the migration of developing cortical neurons and provide insight into the pathogenesis of human PVNH.

HupA reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase and reduces glutamate-induced neuronal death as an NMDA receptor antagonist. We previously reported that huperzine potently protects mice against clonic seizures induced by s.c. pentylenetetrazol at 1 mg/kg (White, 2005) with a TD50 of 0.83 mg/kg. We now report results from the 6-Hz model of psychomotor seizures. Methods: Anesthetic/electrolyte solution (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride in 0.9% saline) was applied to the eyes of male, 18?25 g CF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) prior to placement of corneal electrodes. Seizures induced by 6-Hz corneal stimulation (Barton, 2001) using three levels of stimulation ? 22, 32 and 44 mA ? (3 sec duration) were assessed at various times after i.p. administration of 0.09 ? 1.1 mg/kg HupA. Median effective doses (ED50) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each the three current stimulations evaluated. Results: ED50 values for i.p. HupA were 0.28, 0.34 and 0.78 mg/kg for 22, 32, and 44 mA, respectively. The following results were observed at the highest doses tested at each stimulation level: at 22 mA, 7/8 animals were protected with a dosage of 0.7 mg/kg; at 32 mA, 8/8 animals were protected with 0.83 mg/kg; and at 44 mA, 6/8 animals were protected with 1.1 mg/kg. Conclusions: HupA produced a potent anticonvulsant effect in the 6-Hz model of psychomotor seizures at all stimulation levels tested and with ED50 values less than the TD50, suggesting a possible advantage over phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and topiramate, each of which display limited efficacy in this model at doses devoid of behavioral toxicity. Further, the less than 2-fold ratio of dosages effective across the range of stimulations suggests a possible advantage over other drugs active in this model such as levetiracetam. These findings and the known action of huperzine as an NMDA receptor antagonist warrant further pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. References Barton ME et al. Epilepsy Res 2001;47:217?27.

Recordings in A/J mice confirmed that the onset of behavioral status reflected the onset of electrographic status (n = 4). All DBA mice demonstrated neuronal loss in CA3 (n = 6/6), but all A/J mice did not (n = 3/6). Neuronal loss was detected in area CA1 in DBA (n = 3/6) but not A/J mice (n = 0/6). Both strains demonstrated NPY expression in mossy fibers (A/J: n = 5/6; DBA: n = 4/5). There were more EGCs in DBA mice (A/J: 3029.9 ± 1053.4 cells/hippocampus, n = 4; DBA: 9590.2 ± 1979.2, n = 6; p < 0.05). Conclusions: A/J and DBA/2J mice show differences in acute behavioral and long-term anatomical changes with the pilocarpine model. Differences suggest that use of one variable to define susceptibility can be misleading. The results suggest guidelines for future studies of strain-dependent seizure susceptibility, and characterize an infrequently-studied strain for QTL mapping of seizure susceptibility.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the ability of viral vector-mediated hippocampal overexpression of GDNF to supress seizures and alter seizure-induced cell death and neurogenesis. Methods: A recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) encoding for GDNF or GFP (control) was injected in multiple sites of the hippocampal formation of rats. A recording/stimulating electrode was placed in the ventral hippocampus, and animals were stimulated either for 1 s once daily, inducing kindling epileptogenesis, or for 1 h continously to induce self-sustained status epilepticus (SE). Kindled animals were re-stimulated (i.e. re-kindled) four weeks following termination of kindling to assess the sustainability of hyperexcitability. Behavioural seizure activity (graded according to the scale of Racine) and EEG were recorded throughout the experiments. All experiments were conducted according to international ethical guidelines for animal care and were approved by the local ethical comittee. Results: Using the kindling model, we found that transfection with rAAV-GDNF decreased the number of generalized seizures, prevented an increase of the duration of behavioural convulsions seen in re-kindled control animals, and increased the threshold for induction of re-kindled seizures. In the SE-model of epilepsy, animals overexpressing GDNF developed fewer generalized stage 5 seizures and exhibited a significantly better survival rate following SE. We further found that in GDNF-overexpressing animals, a higher proportion of new-born (BrdU+) cells acquired a neuronal fate, as determined by staining for DCX and Neun, compared to control animals. The SE-induced damage in hippocampal CA1/CA3 and dentate gyrus, as assessed by fluorojade staining, was unchanged by rAAV-GDNF transfection. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that rAAV-mediated gene transfer is a feasible method for long-term delivery of GDNF to the seizure focus, and that such GDNF overexpression is able to suppress seizures in different animal models of epilepsy.

Mareci ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: We used an 11.1 Tesla (T) magnet to determine in vivo temporal hippocampal and parahippocampal structural changes in the latent period of epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We also determined if chronic microelectrodes distort MR images to assess the feasibility of MRI with electrophysiological arrays. Methods: Fifty micron gold plated tungsten wires (2) were implanted in the ventral hippocampus in Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4). Spontaneously seizing rats were obtained following experimentally inducted status epilepticus (SE). Rats were video recorded to capture spontaneous seizures. An MRI compatible stereotaxic frame was developed, to allow repeatable positioning under isoflurane in the 11.1T/40 cm bore magnet, along with a 3 cm, 150 degree arc, linear surface MR coil. Rats were imaged pre/post wire implantation and after SE at 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60 days. T2-weighted images were collected and quantified. Results: Brain images and wire locations were obtained with the stereotaxic frame, which provided a repeatable platform. Significantly increased T2 values were observed in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, particularly on the contralateral side to stimulation, in three out of four rats. T2-weighted images of the first rat showed a contralaterally growing volume of hyper-intense tissue in the hippocampus and amygdala (Fig. 1). The brain of the second rat did not change; the wires were medial to the hippocampus near the alveus. The third rat showed hyper-intensity in the contralateral amygdala, with wires in the ventral hippocampus. The fourth rat was hyper-intense in both sides of the hippocampus and amygdala by day 3, but slightly decreased in time, with wires in the hippocampus near the alveus. Conclusions: Unilateral electrically induced SE produces bilateral structural changes in the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. Stereotaxic images allowed repeated measures of the structural changes during epileptogenesis. The implanted wires produced minimal distortions. Their positioning in the ventral hippocampus may play a role in which structures show changes. Future work will relate the physiological and structural changes during epileptogenesis using electrophysiology and high resolution MRI.

Farber ( 1 Sleep Disturbance Research, VA GLAHS, North Hills, CA ) Rationale: To describe some similarities and dissimilarities between feline epilepsy models, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) and Electrical Status Epilepticus in Slow-sleep (ESES) with respect to sleep state modulation, neurobehavioral consequences and early intervention. Methods: The sleep-wake state distribution of seizures and neurobehavioral consequences were quantified in relation to monoamine concentrations (microdialysis) as well as before and after lesions, systemic and localized drug administration and/or photic stimulation in feline epilepsy models (n = 86), mostly in the amygdala kindling epilepsy model. 1 Similarities and Dissimilarities of age-related amygdala kindling in kittens to Electrical status epilepticus (ESES) and/or Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) SIMILARITIES DISSIMILARITIES AGE DEPENDENCY Critical period for onset GTCs can last to adulthood in kittens SPONTANEOUS SEIZURE-RELATED SYMPTOMATOLOGY: Seizure types (GTCs, partial motor, atypical absence, complex-partial); IID types ?

GTCs = generalized tonic-clonic convulsions; ?= increased ?= decreased; CSWS = Continuous slow spike wave during sleep (Supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.) Results: 1) Table 1 compares the kindling model to LKS and ESES with respect to sleep state modulation, spontaneous neurobehavioral consequences and early intervention. 2) Neural generators of synchronous EEG oscillations (tonic background slow waves and sleep EEG transients), can combine to promote electrographic seizure propagation during NREM; antigravity muscle tone permits seizure-related movement. 3) Neural generators of asynchronous neuronal discharge patterns can reduce electrographic seizures during REM sleep; skeletal motor paralysis blocks seizure-related movement during REM. 4) Neurobehavioral consequences depend on the site of the focus, regardless of overt histopathological change in the young. 5) The prognosis is best with early intervention. Conclusions: The kindling process is thought to have trans-synaptic effects on cells distal to the kindled focus. Age-related changes could underlie the progression of epileptic and non-epileptic symptoms in kindled kittens, LKS and ESES. 1 Ajay K. Srivastava, and 1 H. Steve White ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Recently we have characterized the pharmacology of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the lamotrigine (LTG)-resistant pentylenetetrazlole kindled (Epilepsia 2003; 44,42) and LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat (Epilepsia 2004; 45(7):12). In this model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, CBZ, PHT, and TPM were all inactive at non-toxic doses. In contrast, VPA and retigabine (Epilepsia 2005;46(8):217) were both effective. The broad-spectrum AED felbamate (FBM) displays a favorable preclinical profile in various models of epilepsy including the phenytoin-resistant amygdala kindled rat (Neuropharmacology 2000;39(10):1893?903). The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of FBM in the LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat model of refractory epilepsy. Methods: Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were kindled via basolateral amygdala stimulation according to the method described by Srivastava et al., (Epilepsia 2004; 45(7):12). One hour before each kindling stimulation, rats in the control group received 0.5% methylcellulose and rats in the experimental group received LTG (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Seizure severity and afterdischarge duration was recorded after each kindling stimulation. Treatment was continued until all rats displayed 4 consecutive Stage 5 seizures (Clin Neurophysiol 1972; 32:281?294). Two days later, both groups were challenged with 15 mg/kg, i.p LTG to confirm LTG-sensitivity (control) and LTG-resistance (experimental). The efficacy of FBM (100, 150 and 200, mg/kg administered 90 min prior to kindling stimulation) was then evaluated. The ED50 and 95% confidence intervals were calulated using Probit analysis. Results: Felbamate dose-dependently reduced the seizure severity and decreased the ADD in the fully kindled LTG-resistant rat. At the highest dose tested (200 mg/kg), FBM decreased the seizure score from 5 ± 0 to 2.25 ± 0.6 and the ADD from 57 ± 5 sec. to 22 ± 30 sec. The calculated ED50 and (95% confidence intervals) for FBM against Stage 4 and 5 seizures was 169 and (131 ? 206) mg/kg, respectively. Conclusions: In an animal model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, the broad-spectrum AED FBM was found to effectively block the fully kindled secondarily generalized kindled seizure. In this particular model, FBM is as effective as VPA and the investigational AED retigabine (albeit less potent than retigabine). These findings demonstrated that the LTG-resistant kindled rat can be utilized to differentiate the AED profile of novel AEDs and confirm that FBM possesses a unique profile relative to CBZ, PHT, LTG, and TPM. Ongoing studies continue to evaluate the mechanism underlying the development of pharmaco-resistance in this model.

Steve White ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ; and 2 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of childhood death and disability. Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and cognitive disabilities are common sequelae that may manifest years after TBI. PTE afflicts 10% of children after severe TBI but remains poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that TBI during brain development increases seizure susceptibility later in life, we used standard electrical stimulation techniques to assess seizure thresholds in a rat TBI model. Methods: Immature, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20/grp) underwent TBI by controlled cortical impact (6-mm rounded tip, 4 m/sec velocity, 2-mm deformation, 100 msec duration) to left parietal cortex using isoflurane anesthesia (1%) on post-natal day (PND) 16?18. Results were compared to those obtained from age-matched sham (craniotomy only using isoflurane) and naive rats (n = 20/grp). Seizure thresholds were assessed during adolescence and adulthood for tonic (PND 34 and 60), clonic (PND 37 and 63) and limbic (PND 40) seizures. Full convulsive current (CC) curves were generated by staircase procedure and the median CC (CC50) was calculated using Probit analysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Tonic and clonic seizure thresholds increased with age in naive rats (p < 0.05). As shown in Table 1, seizure responses during adolescence (PND 34?40) were similar among groups for tonic and clonic seizures; however, limbic seizure responses showed a trend toward lower thresholds after TBI. In adults (PND 60?63), tonic seizure thresholds were decreased in both sham and TBI (vs. naive) groups. Conversely, clonic seizure thresholds were similar among sham and naive rats but decreased after TBI (vs. either naive or sham). Conclusions: TBI to left parietal cortex during brain development attenuates normal maturational increases in clonic seizure thresholds and may increase susceptibility to limbic seizures. Given the involvement of frontal cortex and limbic system in learning and decision-making functions, this finding may have implications not only for PTE, but also for post-injury learning and behavioral deficits. Delineation of the incidence of PTE and cognitive deficits, as well as further characterization of longitudinal maturational changes in seizure thresholds post-TBI are ongoing. 1 Seizure Thresholds Tonic Clonic Limbic adolescent ?naive 27.7 (25.1, 30.5) 12.3 (10.4, 13.9) 89.0 (87.6, 90.5) ?sham 30.4 (29.0, 33.0) 13.7 (12.0, 15.5) 87.8 (86.4, 89.2) ?TBI 26.9 (23.7, 29.6) 11.6 (9.7, 13.5) 87.2 (85.4, 88.9)# adult ?naive 36.5 (35.1, 37.8) 15.0 (13.7, 16.3) ?sham 34.5 (33.8, 35.8)* 14.8 (13.5, 16.1) ?TBI 33.7 (32.1, 35.3)* 12.0 (10.3, 13.7)*?

Stewart, 2 Robert S. Fujinami, 1 Karen S. Wilcox, and 1 H. Steve White ( 1 Pharmacology  and 2 Neurology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Viral infections of the CNS are associated with a significantly increased risk for seizures and epileptogenesis. Up to 50% of adult-onset epilepsy cases in developing countries are associated with CNS infection. To our knowledge, no available animal model accurately reproduces the pathology of human encephalitis-induced epilepsy. We have established an animal model where infection of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leads to the development of seizures during the acute encephalomyelitis phase of infection. Stage 4/5 seizures (Racine, Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophys. 32: 281?94, 1972) occur in approximately 50% the mice between 3?10 days post infection and appear to remit as the infection clears. The present study tested the hypothesis that seized mice have altered seizure thresholds post inoculation, which increases their risk for the development of spontaneous seizures. Methods: B6 mice were infected intracerebrally with the Daniel's strain of TMEV (TMEV-DA). Animals were monitored for the development of seizures and separated into two groups: seized versus non-seized. Two months after infection with 3 ? 105 PFU TMEV-DA, minimal clonic and maximal tonic hindlimb extension (THE) seizure thresholds of seized and non-seized mice were assessed by electroconvulsive seizure testing (EST). Additionally, the rate of corneal kindling acquisition (number of stimulations required to reach fully kindled state, i.e., 3 consecutive Stage 5 seizures) was assessed to determine whether TMEV inoculation leads to an increased rate of kindling. Results: At two months post infection, seized mice had a significantly lower minimal clonic seizure threshold compared to the non-seized mice (seized CC50= 6.7 mA, non-seized CC50= 7.8 mA, p < 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference in maximal THE seizure thresholds between the seized and non-seized mice (seized and non-seized CC50= 13.5 mA, p < 0.99). In a preliminary study to assess acquisition rate of corneal kindling, 8/8 seized mice displayed fully generalized Stage 5 seizures, versus 5/8 non-seized mice. Furthermore, seized mice had much shorter latencies to generalized seizures than non-seized mice. Conclusions: The results obtained in the present study demonstrate altered seizure susceptibility following recovery from seizures associated with TMEV- induced encephalitis. Furthermore, they suggest that these animals may be more susceptible to epileptogenesis following subsequent challenges. Although preliminary, these results further support this as a model of encephalitis- induced hyperexcitability.

An international team has been assembled to identify Asian herbal medicines used for epilepsy, isolate their constituent compounds, and test these compounds in established animal models of epilepsy and in vitro assays to determine their potential mechanisms of action. We report the preliminary findings from the first herbal medicine to be evaluated. Methods: Five pure compounds were isolated from an Asian herbal extract commonly used for epilepsy and were designated ADD 377008, 377009, 377010, 377011, and 377012 by the NIH/NINDS Anticonvulsant Screening Project. Compounds were assessed in the mouse maximal electroshock and s.c. Metrazol (pentylenetetrazol; s.c. Met) models of generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, respectively, following p.o. administration to Swiss-Webster mice. Minimal motor impairment was evaluated in the rotarod test. Four of the compounds were tested for effects against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures derived from rat cortex (Sun et al., NeuroSignals 2003;12:31?8). Results: ADD 377010 protected 5/5 animals after a dose of 300 mg/kg (i.p.) in the scMET model and had no effect in the MES model. No other compound was active up to 300 mg/kg in either model, and none caused motor impairment. All four compounds tested prevented NMDA receptor-mediated cytotoxicity when co-applied with NMDA. Conclusions: Compounds isolated from an Asian herbal medicine demonstrate promising activity in the NMDA assay, and one also effectively blocked seizures in the scMET model, suggesting it may be responsible for the anticonvulsant properties of its parent extract. Further evaluations of compounds isolated from herbal medicines used for epilepsy are warranted. (Supported by an American Epilepsy Society Research Infrastructure Award.

Wasterlain ( 1 Epilepsy Research, VA GLAHS, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: The role of febrile seizures (FS) in epileptogenesis and the contribution of fever to the long-term consequences of prolonged FS and febrile status epilepticus (SE) are poorly understood. Controversy remains regarding any causal relationship between prolonged FS and temporal lobe epilepsy. This study investigated the contribution of hyperthermia per se to SE-induced epileptogenesis, using the lithium-pilocarpine model of SE in immature rats, and carefully controlling for brain temperature and seizure severity. Methods: SE was induced in rats at postnatal day 10 (P10) by administration of lithium (3mEq/kg, i.p.), and 24 hours later by pilocarpine (60 mg/kg, s.c.). Body temperature was maintained during 30 min of SE at 39 ± 1°C (hyperthermic animals) or at 35 ± 1°C (normothermic animals). SE was terminated by diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Control animals received lithium and diazepam in presence of hyperthermia or normothermia. The course of SE was recorded by video/EEG for 24 hours. The severity of SE was assessed by measuring the following parameters: duration of SE (time of last seizure), and total seizure time (time spent in seizures subtracting interictal time) using Harmonie Software. Separate groups of animals, subjected to SE at P10 without surgery, were monitored four months later for the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) by telemetry/videotape continuously for one month. Results: We were able to control brain and body temperature during and after SE in both study groups: hyperthermic (39 ± 1°C) and normothermic (35 ± 1°C). Terminating SE by diazepam was effective in both groups (10.2 ± 1.5 min in hyperthermic animals and 12.3 ± 2.2 min in normothermic animals). Total seizure time (54.5 ± 15.2 min after SE in hyperthermic animals and 56.7 ± 12.1 min after SE in normothermic animals) and duration of SE (87.2 ± 23.2 min after SE in hyperthermic animals vs. 95.2 ± 28.2 min after SE in normothermic animals) were similar between groups. Only hyperthermic animals developed convulsive seizures (50%). Both groups of animals that experienced SE at P10 developed electrographic seizures 4 months later (83 vs 55%). However, the frequency and seizure severity were significantly higher in hyperthermic animals (12.5 ± 3.5 vs 4.2 ± 2.0 SRS/day). Conclusions: Since the precise role of hyperthermia during SE in long-term consequences such as epileptogenesis and neuronal injury has never been adequately defined, this study tightly controlled seizure duration and seizure severity in order to isolate hyperthermia as the main variable and to study its consequences. In this model, hyperthermia greatly increased the epileptogenicity of SE, leading to subsequent behavioral seizures not seen in the normothermic group, and increased the severity and incidence of spontaneous electrographic seizures.

Sudbury, and 1,2 Massimo Avoli ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ; and 2 Human Physiology and Pharmacology, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy ) Rationale: The participation of the insular cortex (IC) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has long been suggested from studies of human epileptic patients; however, its network interactions with the perirhinal cortex (PC) and hippocampus remain uninvestigated. Here, we used a hippocampus-parahippocampus-IC rat brain slice to provide the first characterization of network epileptiform interactions among these structures during application of the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Methods: Brain slices (450 ?m) were prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Field potential recordings were acquired using ACSF-filled glass electrodes positioned within area CA3 of the hippocampus, the PC and the IC. 4-AP (50 ?M) was bath applied to induce epileptiform synchronous network activity. Results: 4-AP induced three types of epileptiform activity: (i) fast interictal events (duration = 0.1?0.2 s; interval of occurrence = 0.7?1.2 s) that were mainly observed in CA3 as well as (ii) slow interictal (duration = 0.5?2.0 s; interval of occurrence = 4.0?21.7 s) and (iii) prolonged ictal-like (duration = 11.3?48.7 s; interval of occurrence = 17.9?332 s) that occurred synchronously among the PC and the IC and occasionally entered the hippocampus. Only slow interictal discharges were present in PC and IC in 15/30 slices. Moreover, slow interictal and ictal events were generated by the IC following surgical isolation. Ictal discharges were abolished by NMDA receptor antagonism while interictal activity persisted. Further antagonism of non-NMDA glutamatergic receptors abolished interictal discharges and disclosed slow field potentials that recurred at intervals of 11.4?28.0 s in all structures. Bath application of the ?-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4-,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAGO, 10?M) significantly reduced the occurrence of these slow potentials in all structures (n = 5); this effect was reversible with naloxone methiodide (20?M). Application of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (50?M) abolished these field potentials. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that epileptiform activity occurs synchronously among PC and IC networks, while analogous activity can be generated independently within the isolated IC. These observations suggest that the network characteristics necessary and sufficient to initiate epileptiform network events are present within the IC.

Roopra ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: During investigation of mechanisms of the ketogenic diet, the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG had unexpected anticonvulsant and antiepileptic effects in hippocampal slices and against seizures evoked by kindling of the perforant path. Anticonvulsant and antiepileptic properties of 2DG were further characterized by kindling of olfactory bulb and in screening models in cooperation with the NINDS Antiepileptic Screening Program (ASP). Cognitive and systemic toxicity was examined in rats receiving 2DG for as long as 6 months. Methods: Rats received olfactory bulb or perforant path kindling stimulation twice daily with 1-sec trains of 60-Hz 1-ms pulses at the lowest intensity evoking ADs by a standardized protocol. Interictal and ictal burst frequencies were examined in rat hippocampal slices in 7.5 mM [K+]o. 2DG was evaluated in NINDS ASP screening models in rats and mice including maximal electroshock, subcutaneous metrazol, 6-Hz stimulation, and Frings audiogenic mice. Cognitive effects were evaluated in rats in the Morris water maze. Results: Application of 2DG (10mM) to hippocampal slices in 7.5 mM [K+]o reduced CA3 interictal bursts by ?40% and ictal bursts by 60%. 2DG (250 mg/kg) 30 min before kindling of perforant path in rats induced a 2-fold increase in AD threshold (an anticonvulsant effect) and a 2-fold increase in the number of ADs required to evoke Class V seizures (an antiepileptic effect). In contrast, 2DG prior to olfactory bulb kindling also resulted in 2-fold slowing of kindling progression, but had no effect on AD threshold. Initial evidence of anticonvulsant activity was observed in preliminary screening against seizures evoked by subcutaneous metrazol in rats, by 6-Hz stimulation in mice, and in Fring's audiogenic mice, but not against seizures evoked by maximal electroshock. Additional testing is underway to further characterize the activity found in these models. 2DG at 2 gm/kg daily for 2 weeks in rats had no effect on Morris water maze performance, and body weights of rats receiving 0.5 gm/kg daily for 6 months did not differ from controls. Conclusions: 2DG has novel anticonvulsant and antiepileptic activity against experimental seizures compared to currently available anticonvulsants and a favorable preclinical toxicity profile. Acute anticonvulsant action was observed in vitro against both interictal and ictal discharges. Robust chronic antiepileptic action against kindling progression was independent of the seizure initiation site, but anticonvulsant action against AD threshold was stimulation site specific. The in vivo chronic effects on kindled seizures have been associated with a novel mechanism of antiglycolytic metabolic suppression of seizure-induced BDNF and trkB expression by the NADH sensor CtBP and the transcription factor NRSF, which regulates neuronal gene expression.

Moreover, neurogliaform cells are the only known cortical cell type that can reliably activate postsynaptic GABAA and GABAB receptors after discharging a single action potential. Using three-dimensional light microscopic reconstructions and correlated electron microscopic investigations, we found that neurogliaform cells formed synapses (62 ± 28 ?m) closer to the soma of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells than Martinotti cells (102 ± 48 ?m) that evoked faster inhibitory responses. Thus, the slow kinetic properties of GABAA responses evoked by neurogliaform cells can not be explained exclusively by the dendritic localization of the synapses. However, there is a twofold difference in unitary axon densities between neurogliaform cells and other interneurons (0.954 ± 0.299 and 0.453 ± 0.015 ?m axon in 1000 ?m3).We propose that neurogliaform cells release GABA all over their dense axonal field to activate GABA receptors on dendrites present in the axonal cloud. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we studied the physiological properties of responses between neurogliaform cells, other identified interneurons and layer 2/3 pyramidal cells using whole cell patch clamp recording in neocortical slices with the AMPA, NMDA and GABAB receptors blocked. Results: Neurogliaform cells evoked slower GABAA currents (10?90% rise time: 4.5 ± 1.6 ms, weigthed decay time constant: 42 ± 9.7 ms, amplitude: 97 ± 69 pA) than basket cells (10?90% rise time: 0.7 ± 0.2 ms, weigthed decay time constant: 8.1 ± 1.9 ms, amplitude: 130 ± 109 pA). The variability in amplitudes of neurogliaform cell-evoked IPSCs (0.14 ± 0.04, S.D./mean) was much less than in the basket cell-evoked responses (0.29 ± 0.1). Furthermore, gradual changing of extracellular calcium resulted in continuous increases in the amplitude of the responses. Blocking of GABA transporter 1 by NO-711 dramatically increased the decay time constant of neurogliaform cell-evoked IPSCs (by 203 ± 110%) and did not affect basket cell-evoked IPSCs. The low affinity, competitive antagonist of GABAA receptors, TPMPA had a larger effect (58 ± 17%) on the amplitude the neurogliaform cells effect compared to basket cells (35 ± 17%). Alfa1 subunit specific GABAA agonists (zolpidem, Cl218,872) had significant effets on the neurogliaform cell-evoked responses. However, the properties of this modulatory action was different than on basket cell-evoked IPSCs. Conclusions: These results indicate that a spill-over-like mechanism of GABA release takes place following single action potentials in neurogliaform cells, in contrast to the more conventional basket cell synapses. These data suggest that neurogliaform play highly specialized role in regulating neuronal activity in the cortical networks.

This study compared changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during intermittent light stimulation (ILS) between photosensitive and asymptomatic baboons. Methods: Six photosensitive and four asymptomatic baboons, matched for age, gender and weight, were selected based upon previous scalp EEG evaluation. Continuous intravenous ketamine (5?13 mg/kg) was used for sedation. Subjects underwent five sequential blood flow PET studies within 60 minutes using 20 mCi 15O-labelled water. Images were acquired in 3D mode (CTI/Siemens HR+ scanner, 63 contiguous slices, 2.4mm thickness). Three resting scans were alternated with two activation scans. ILS was performed at 25 Hz for 60 seconds before to 60 seconds after the start of an activation scan. PET images were coregistered with MRI (3T Siemens Trio, T1-weighted 3D sequence, TE = 6, TR = 14, TI = 800msec, flip angle 19°, NEX = 6). PET scans were reviewed and corrected for motion artifact. Resting scans were contrasted with activation scans and averaged independently for both groups. Results: The controls showed greatest ILS-induced activation in the left middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri, left brainstem structures and right postcentral gyrus, and bilaterally in the occipital lobes, posterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. In contrast, the photosensitive animals showed strongest ILS activation in the right anterior cingulate and medial orbital gyri, amygdala, globus pallidum, left inferior and superior temporal gyri, and the pineal gland. A striking finding was the absence of occipital activation during ILS in the photosensitive animals. Deactivations were noted in the right orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in the controls, and in the posterior cingulate gyrus, brainstem and cerebellum of the photosensitive animals. Conclusions: The patterns of ILS-induced CBF changes differed between control and photosensitive groups. These differences of activations and inhibitions suggest involvement of specific cortical-subcortical networks in photosensitivity.

White, 2 Krista Gilby, and 2 Dan C. McIntyre ( 1 MIRECC, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Kindling is a progressive increase in seizure activity following the daily application of focal, low-intensity electrical stimulation of different forebrain regions. Two strains of rats were developed to exhibit different rates of amygdala kindling, and were called Fast and Slow kindlers. These animals also show different response profiles to α2-adrenoreceptor (AR) agonists. Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine α2-AR binding sites and subtype mRNA expression in the CNS of naive Fast and Slow rats. Methods:α2-AR binding sites were measured in naive Fast (n = 8) and Slow (n = 8) kindlers with the α2-AR antagonist [3H]RX821002. α2-AR binding sites were measured in the locus coeruleus (LC), neocortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, septum, amygdala, habenula and hippocampus. α2-AR is composed of three different subtypes. α2A- and α2C-AR mRNA were determined in the CNS of Fast and Slow kindlers by in situ hybridization with oligonucleotides. α2A-AR mRNA was measured in the LC, cortex, septum, hypothalamus and amygdala, and α2C-AR mRNA was measured in the LC, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, caudate and nucleus accumbens. Results:α2-AR binding sites, as determined by [3H]RX821002, were not statistically different between Fast and Slow kindlers in all regions of the CNS. α2A-AR mRNA expression, the subtype responsible for [3H]RX821002 binding, therefore, was not different. However, α2C-AR mRNA expression was different between Fast and Slow kindlers in many regions of the CNS, including nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus granule cell layer, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum and neocortex layer II: in these cases, α2C-AR mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the Slow compared to Fast kindlers. Conclusions: These data indicate a signifcant increase in several brain structures in the α2C-AR mRNA expression in Slow versus the Fast kindlers. These differences in α2C-AR mRNA may explain the different α2 adrenergic pharmacological profiles between the two strains, and speak additionally to adrenergic involvement in epileptogenesis.

Epileptogenesis in EL mice is thought to be caused by collapse of redox state induced by either decreased antioxidant protection or excessive free radical formation. However, measurement of reductants in brain tissue extracts is problematic because synergistic actions of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol or glutathione are effective in scavenging free radicals. Using in vivo methods we developed, we evaluated hippocampal antioxidant ability in EL mice with X-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and microdialysis. Methods: Using sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, each mouse underwent stereotactic implantation of guide cannula into the ventral hippocampus. EL mice were injected i.p. with the nitroxide radical 3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl (PCAM) at 677 micromol/kg (3.3 ml saline/kg). Following PCAM injection sequential measurements with EPR were used to monitor levels of nitroxide radicals in the extracellular fluid of the hippocampus. In vivo antioxidant efficacy was estimated based on the principle that PCAM loses paramagnetism and that the decay rate of the EPR signal expressed as half life will reflect tissue antioxidant efficacy. Animals used included experimental groups of 6 five week old and 6 eight week old EL mice; all animals were interictal. Mice from the originating strain of EL mice, DDY mice of similar age, were used as controls. Results: EPR half-life in the five week old mice was equal to control. However, by eight weeks there was significant prolongation in EPR half-life in EL mice when compared to both control groups of DDY mice. None of the EL mice used in this experiment were subjected to seizure-inducing stimulation and they remained in the interictal state. Conclusions: Since five week EL mice do not seize in response to tossing stimulus while by eight weeks EL mice are subject to seizures, we concluded that the decreased in vivo antioxidant ability is a fundamental change related to development of seizures.

However, the effect of focal cooling on seizures arising from the temporal lobe has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We devised an apparatus for the cooling of the hippocampus in order to examine the effect of focal cooling on experimental hippocampal seizures. Methods: We developed a cooling needle (measuring 1 mm diameter and 6mm length) made of copper which was attached to a thermoelectric (Peltier) chip. Next, experiments were performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats under halothane anesthesia. The cooling needle, a thermocouple and a needle electrode for the EEG recording were then inserted into the right hippocampus after performing a craniotomy. Kainic acid (KA) (1 mg/ml, 1 ?l) was injected into the left hippocampus to provoke epileptiform discharges (EDs). Thereafter, focal cooling was started and it was continued for 5 minutes after confirming the appearance of EDs in the right hippocampus which had been provoked by the KA in the contralateral hippocampus. Results: The temperatures of the cooled site in the hippocampus were 9°C in the center, while they were under 25°C within 2.4 mm in radius from the cooling center in phantom experiments using the cooling device.The EDs began to significantly decrease in amplitude from 90 seconds after the start of cooling (p < 0.01). The mean amplitudes of the EDs were suppressed to 68.1 ± 4.8% at the end of the cooling and then stayed low values during the subsequent period. The temperatures of the cooling site were maintained at 33.1 ± 0.7°C before cooling and then they decreased to 14.5 ± 1.3°C finally. Conclusions: We confirmed that hippocampal cooling suppressed the EDs provoked by KA injection in the contralateral hippocampus. Our results therefore seem to suggest that hippocampal cooling may thus be a potentially useful minimally invasive therapy, which might thus be able to replace the need to perform a temporal lobectomy. 1 Kristina Surdova, 1 Erik Taub?ll, 2 Anette Krogenæs, 2 Ellen Dahl, 2 Jan L. Lyche, 2 Irma C. Oskam, and 2 Erik Ropstad ( 1 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; and 2 Department of Production Animal Sciences, Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: It is well known that valproate (VPA) affects endocrine function. There are, however, contradictory reports in the literature as to whether or not VPA affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Such effects, if present, are important since this hormonal axis is crucial in the homeostasis of fundamental bodily functions and in regulation of stress responses. In the present study the effects of VPA exposure on basal and stress-induced cortisol was investigated in male adolescent goats. Methods: Twenty-three bucks aged 2 months at the start of experiment were given VPA mixture (n = 16) or control solution (n = 7) perorally twice daily for 8 months. VPA mixture was given in single doses up to 62.5 mg/kg to sustain therapeutic plasma concentrations (300?600 ?mol/l). In Experiment 1, blood samples were analyzed for cortisol weekly from weeks 35 to 50 of the year. In experiment 2, bucks aged 9 months were exposed to a period of mild stress associated with blood sampling from indwelling jugular vein catheters every 15 minutes for 7 hours. The effects of VPA on plasma cortisol concentration were studied in repeated measured mixed model analyses. Results: VPA treated bucks in experiment 1 had significantly lower basal cortisol concentrations than control animals during the study period (F1,14= 6.22, p = 0.026). A significant time effect (F7,98 = 5.92, p < 0.0001) was found with a decrease in basal cortisol plasma concentrations towards the end of the study period. A significant time/treatment interaction (F7,98= 2.63, p = 0.016) was found with a more pronounced decrease in plasma cortisol in the control group than in the treated group. In experiment 2 the cortisol response to mild stress was different in the VPA group compared to control. Overall, there was a lower cortisol response in the VPA group compared with controls. Mean basal plasma cortisol concentration was 2 ng/ml in both groups. During the first period of mild stress plasma cortisol concentration in the control group was 4?8 ng/ml compared to 3?6 ng/ml in the VPA group. In both groups cortisol decreased after 1.5 hours of blood sampling. The group difference was significant when only main effects were included in the model (F1,14= 47.2, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: VPA exposure was associated with a significant reduction in both basal and stress-induced plasma cortisol concentration in male adolescent goats. The observed effects can be a potential problem with long-term VPA treatment. On the other hand, it may be speculated that the reduction in cortisol levels and reduced response to mild stress could be related to the mood stabilizing effect of VPA. 1 Michael R. Taylor, 1 Matthew T. Dinday, 2 Sally Chege, and 1,2 Scott C. Baraban ( 1 Neurological Surgery, UCSF, San Francisco, CA ; and 2 Graduate Program In Neuroscience, UCSF, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Studies from humans, rodents, and fruit flies have identified dozens of single gene mutations that result in heritable forms of epilepsy or increased seizure susceptibility. Although this genetic basis for epilepsy and seizure susceptibility is well established, there have been no efforts to identify gene mutations conferring seizure resistance. Large-scale mutagenesis screening in simple vertebrates offers a powerful approach to further studies of the genetic basis of epilepsy. Here we describe the initial results of the first forward-genetic screen to identify seizure resistant zebrafish mutants. Methods: Approximately 5,000 F1 adult fish were generated from matings between ENU-treated males and wild-type females. From these founders 1,896 F2 families were generated and ?500,000 F3 larvae were used for screening. Using a behavioral assay, we isolated several seizure-resistant (SR) familes based on their ability to survive prolonged exposure to the convulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). All SR mutants were further characterized by examining resistance to another convulsant (pilocarpine), tracking behavioral responses, and recording electrical activity. In addition, mutants were genetically mapped by bulked-segregant analysis, and recombination analysis with microsatellite markers was used for fine-mapping. Results: Six seizure-resistant mutant families were identified in a forward-genetic screen over a four-year period. One mutant, s198, was also shown to be resistant in a pilocarpine survival assay, suggesting multi-convulsant resistance. Three of the mutants exhibited reduced behavioral activity upon acute PTZ exposure (s139, s333  and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Treiman et al. (Epilepsy Res 5:49?60, 1990) described five stages of progressive electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during clinical and experimental status epilepticus (SE), which reflect the underlying severity of the episode of SE. Longer duration of SE and later EEG stages translate to increased problematic cessation of seizures, perhaps due to progressive attenuation of GABA-mediated inhibition. We hypothesized that marked electrophysiologic changes in GABAA receptor function correlate with a specific EEG stage during experimental SE in rats. Methods: Ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were injected (i.p.) with 3 mM LiCl followed by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine 24 h later to induce SE. Animals were sacrificed before initiation of SE (control), or during EEG Stages I, III, or V, and brains were rapidly removed, placed in cold (4°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for 1 min, sliced using a vibratome, and then oxygenated for 1 h in ACSF at room temperature. Paired-pulse responses with interpulse intervals (IPI) of 30, 50, 100 and 150 msec were induced by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and recorded from the cell-body layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. ? oscillations (30?80 Hz) were then elicited by tetanic stimulation at a voltage twice that of threshold and were also recorded from CA1. Some Stage V hippocampal slices were perfused with 100 ?M GABA or 1 ?M diazepam following initial electrophysiological recordings. Results: Paired-pulse stimulation resulted in increased inhibition in Stage I hippocampal slices compared to control slices (p < 0.05, IPI = 50 msec) but decreased inhibition in Stage V slices compared to Stage I slices (p < 0.05, IPI = 50 msec). ? oscillations were progressively attenuated in slices from later EEG stages. Amplitude (p < 0.01), duration (p < 0.05) and spike count (p < 0.05) were all reduced in Stage V slices compared to control slices. Perfusion with GABA, and to a lesser extent with diazepam, resulted in recovery of ? oscillations in Stage V slices. Conclusions: These results are consistent with other reports of attenuation of GABA-mediated inhibition during prolonged SE, which may explain the increased refractoriness of later stages of SE to treatment. In addition, our results indicate a possible impairment of presynaptic release of GABA occurred in this model. This observation suggests GABA reuptake inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. We also report the new finding that paired-pulse inhibition is greater during Stage I compared to control slices and speculate that this may represent an initial compensatory response to excessive excitation before GABA-mediated inhibition begins to deteriorate as SE progresses.

Garvey ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: There is a need for more effective drugs for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) but testing potential SE drugs in human patients is difficult. The cobalt-homocysteine model of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) (Epilepsy Res 2:79?86, 1988) can be used to predict the median effective dose (ED50) and median effective concentration (EC50) of drugs against SE. We used this experimental model to study the potential efficacy of levetiracetam in the treatment of GCSE. Methods: 135 male 200?300 gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 4 stainless steel epidural electrodes for EEG recording. 2.5 mg powered cobalt was placed under the left frontal electrode. When the rat exhibited interictal polyspikes and/or right UE twitching, SE was induced by injecting 8 mM homocysteine thiolactone IP. Immediately after the 2nd GTC seizure, levetiracetam (LTA) was administered IP and was considered effective if no further seizures occurred 10?30 minutes after injection. Animals were euthanized at 30 minutes after onset of SE and blood and brains collected for LTA determination by HPLC. Because LTA was not effective alone, its ED50 was determined after administration of 0.1 mg/kg diazepam (ED50 of DZM alone =? 5 mg/kg), using doses from 0 to 1000 mg/kg. The neuroprotective potential of LTA was determined by comparing visual-spatial performance in a Morris Water maze at various EEG stages of SE with and without LTA (500 mg/kg). Results: LTA alone at doses of 10 to 6000 mg/kg was not effective at stopping GCSE in the cobalt-homocysteine model. The ED50 of LTA, when given in combination with 0.1 mg/kg DZM, was 550 mg/kg (CI 385?800 mg/kg), based on doses from 0?800 mg/kg. Paradoxically, at 1000 mg/kg only 14% of the rats stopped GCSE. 500 mg/kg LTA had no neuroprotective effect on water maze performance in rats in which SE was stopped at EEG stage V, whether given during SE (Stage III), or when SE was stopped at Stage V. Serum and brain LTA concentrations 30 minutes after administration will be shown. Conclusions: LTA is not effective alone in the cobalt-homocysteine model of GCSE. Its efficacy is enhanced by prior- or co-administration of a subtherapeutic dose of diazepam, but the ED50 is still ? 550 mg/kg. Whether or not LTA should be considered for use in human SE will at least partially depend on the serum concentration that corresponds to the ED50 of 550 mg/kg in this model. If the serum concentration is in a range safe for human administration, it can serve as a target concentration in further study of the potential of LTA in the treatment of human SE. It may be that LTA will be an effective second treatment that should be used to provide long-term protection against relapse in human GCSE after initial use of a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam. (Supported by UCB and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Andrew K. Tryba, and 2 Charles J. Marcuccilli ( 1 Physiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ; and 2 Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: The neurotrophin, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), plays a critical role in neural development, migration, plasticity, recovery from injury and learning. In epileptogenic brain areas, such as the temporal lobe, BDNF is up-regulated during repeated seizures, whereby it is proposed to enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission and decrease GABAergic inhibition, enhancing the overall excitability of the network (Neuroscientist. 2005 11(4):282?7). BDNF additionally enhances intrinsic neuronal membrane excitability (Nature 1999;401 (6756):918?21). Thus, BDNF has been proposed to promote epileptiform activity (Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24(1):47?53). Although, BDNF over-expression and exogenous application lead to reduced seizure threshold in experimental models where inhibition is reduced, no one has before shown that BDNF alone induces cortical epileptiform activity. Here, we test the hypothesis that BDNF application can trigger epileptiform activity. Methods: We used brain slice preparations containing temporal lobe cortex of CD-1 mice (age P10-P15), where we simultaneously recorded network population activity and from individual cortical neurons using whole cell current clamp techniques. Results: BDNF application (50ng/mL) triggered paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) bursting (n = 9/10); PDS bursts were NMDA-dependent and blocked by the NMDA antagonist, CPP. BDNF enhanced bursting properties in intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons (n = 3), but not in non-rhythmogenic neurons (n = 7). Application of BDNF also induced seizure-like population activity in some (n = 8) preparations. Conclusions: Our data support our working hypothesis that BDNF can preferentially enhance bursting properties of rhythmogenic neurons that may trigger SLA. Additionally, BDNF can trigger PDS bursting, one of the hallmarks of epilepsy. Thus, our results suggest that BDNF signaling may be involved in the genesis of epilepsy.

Ozen ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; 2 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 3 Neuroconnections Program, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has a long history of therapeutic use in the treatment of a number of neurological disorders, perhaps most effectively for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Neural stimulation may also provide a promising innovative technique for the treatment of pharmacoresistant seizure disorders. While there is experimental and clinical evidence that direct electrical stimulation of deep brain structures can prevent or decrease seizure activity, fundamental questions remain to be resolved including the identification of the most effective brain sites and stimulation parameters, long-term consequences and potential side effects. The mechanism underlying deep brain stimulation is as yet unknown, although it is thought that the application of high-frequency stimulation results in a net inhibitory effect that serves to desynchronize activity, effectively abolishing pathologically synchronized epileptiform activity. This may explain why stimulation of a number of structures have been shown to have anticonvulsant properties. Methods: In this study we examined the effect of high frequency stimulation (applied to a number of subcortical sites) on seizure thresholds of electrically kindled temporal lobe seizures. The DBS consisted of unipolar, biphasic square wave pulses, with pulse durations of 300 ?s, delivered at a frequency of 100 Hz and an intensity of 200 ?A. The DBS was applied 1 second prior to the application of the kindling stimulation to ensure effective activation prior to the seizure inducing stimulus. The seizure activity was scored with respect to the afterdischarge (AD) duration and seizure severity. Results: Preliminary data revealed DBS applied to the entopeduncular nucleus resulted in a strong anticonvulsant effect on the seizure threshold and AD characteristics. We observed the increase in seizure threshold to occur over time which was observed to commence at about the 12th kindling session. The nominal progression in AD characteristics typically observed during kindling were largely absent, with the AD duration becoming shorter, the spike frequency lower and the spike complexity more simplistic. Conclusions: We conclude there may be strong anticonvulsant effects of DBS on temporal cortex seizures that are dependent on the site of stimulation.

Gorter ( 1 Center for Neuroscience, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Epilepsy Institute of the Netherlands, Heemstede, Netherlands ; and 3 Department of (Neuro) Pathology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands ) Rationale: Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been found to be associated with various neurological disorders, including the acquired epilepsies such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, it is not known to what extent the BBB integrity changes during epileptogenesis and whether alterations in BBB permeability may contribute to the development of epilepsy. To get more insight into this, we determined BBB permeability in epileptic rat and human and studied the possible consequences of BBB opening for the subsequent progression of TLE. Methods: BBB permeability was investigated in the rat at different time points after electrically induced SE using various tracers that bind to albumin. The cellular localization of albumin was further investigated using immunocytochemistry in rat and human epileptic brain specimens. In addition, we investigated whether BBB opening was related to seizure progression. Results: In a rat model for TLE, in which epilepsy develops after an electrically induced status epilepticus (SE), the BBB was most affected 1 day after SE in limbic brain regions. Although a partial recovery took place during the latent period, the BBB was still permeable in the chronic epileptic phase. Tracer deposits (albumin) were found in microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Similarly, albumin extravasation in human was most prominent directly after a fatal SE in astrocytes and neurons, and to lesser extent in hippocampi of temporal lobe epilepsy patients. BBB permeability in chronic epileptic rats was positively correlated to seizure frequency. Artificial opening of the BBB by mannitol in the chronic epileptic phase induced a persistent increase in the number of seizures in the majority of rats. Conclusions: These findings indicate that BBB leakage occurs during the latent and chronic epileptic phase and suggest that this permanent disruption can contribute to the progression of epilepsy.

Voskuyl ( 1 Division of Pharmacology, LACDR, Leiden, Netherlands ; 2 LAP 3 Department of Nuclear Medicine  and 4 Epilepsy Institute of the Netherlands (SEIN), Heemstede, Netherlands ) Rationale: The GABAA-receptor plays an important role in epileptogenesis. A key question is whether downregulation or changes in receptor properties are involved in reduced efficacy of antiepileptic drugs, in particular in pharmacoresistance. Recently, a full saturation approach was developed, in which the whole range of receptor occupancies, obtained from a single PET-experiment per animal, was used to calculate both GABAA-receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (KD). This method was used to examine the influence of kindling on Bmax and KD. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were amygdala kindled up to 5 consecutive stage V seizures (n = 12). Implanted but unstimulated rats served as controls (n = 22). The PET experiment was performed 10?14 days after the last seizure. After injection of an excess amount of flumazenil (FMZ) to fully saturate the receptors, the concentration-time curves of FMZ were measured in blood with HPLC-UV and in brain with PET. Next, Bmax and KD were estimated using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling. The model consists of a blood, a tissue and 2 brain (?free? and ?bound?) compartments. The total FMZ concentration in brain, as measured by PET, reflects the sum of ?free? and ?bound? concentrations. In the model, exchange between blood, tissue and ?brain free? compartments is described by first order rate constants, and specific binding depends on both the concentration of free ligand and the concentration of receptors available for binding. Population PK modelling allows for simultaneous analysis of data from all animals, taking interindividual parameter variability into account. Results: In control rats, all model parameters, including specific binding of FMZ in the brain, as characterized by Bmax (14.5 ± 3.7 ng/ml) and KD (4.68 ± 1.5 ng/ml), could be estimated adequately. Kindling did not affect KD, but Bmax decreased to 64 ± 16% of control. This finding corresponds with a reduction in maximal effect of the allosteric modulator midazolam to 72% of control, as reported by Cleton et al. In addition, the volume of distribution of the brain was increased to 180 ± 27% of control, indicating that transport from the brain was decreased. Conclusions: This study shows that the full saturation technique, using a single injection of FMZ, allows detection of moderate reductions in GABAA-receptor density and changes in brain PK. The decreased Bmax may underlie the reduced efficacy of midazolam in kindled rats. In addition, the study shows the feasibility to conduct (longitudinal) studies on epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance development in chronic epilepsy models.

De Lanerolle, and 1 Tore Eid ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; 2 Department of Anatomy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Glutamine synthetase (GS), which converts glutamate to glutamine, is deficient in specific areas of the sclerotic hippocampus in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). A key question is whether hippocampal GS deficiency is causally related to the generation of seizures in MTLE. Methods: The GS inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (MSO) was infused chronically into the hippocampus of rats at the following doses: 1.0 mg/ml (n = 4), 2.5 mg/ml (n = 18), 5.0 mg/ml (n = 11), and 10 mg/ml (n = 39). Saline infused animals (n = 30) were used as controls. The animals underwent long-term intracranial EEG and video monitoring for up to 83 days; the activity of GS was assessed biochemically; and the brain pathology was explored by Nissl- and silver-staining of histological sections. Results: Infusion of MSO, but not saline, caused significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of brain glutamine synthetase. A dose of ≥ 2.5 mg/ml MSO consistently produced spontaneously recurrent seizures (stages I ? IV) after a clinically silent interval of 5?9 days, whereas no seizures were observed in saline treated animals. Hippocampal gliosis and neurodegeneration were present in all MSO-treated animals in a dose-dependant manner (i.e. increasing severity in pathology change with higher dose of MSO). Conclusions: These studies suggest that the deficiency of hippocampal GS is a causative factor in the generation of spontaneously recurring seizures in MTLE, and that GS may represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease. 1 Andrew M. White, 1 Philip A. Williams, 1 Jennifer L. Hellier, 2 F. Edward Dudek, and 1 Kevin J. Staley ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver, CO ; and 2 Department of Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Following severe head trauma, 10 ? 50% of survivors will develop epilepsy. Identifying the subset of individuals that will go on to have chronic seizures would greatly improve their clinical care. We used the repeated low-dose kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy to investigate the spectral content of the EEG before and after treatment (pre-ictal) to determine if there are EEG predictors of future epilepsy. Methods: We used implantable radiotelemetry units to continuously monitor the EEG in freely behaving rats. Three sets of rats were observed: (1) rats treated until motor status (MSE) (n = 5), (2) rats treated until electrical status (ESE) (n = 5), and (3) saline treated rats (n = 3). An average Fast Fourier Transform was calculated using the Welch method and a rectangular window. Each window contained 65,536 points (262 sec). The results were averaged over an entire day (329 windows). Three power sectra were compared: (1) prior to kainate, (2) 3 days after kainate, and (3) 8 days after kainate. Results: All MSE rats developed chronic epilepsy. Their power spectrum did change after kainate administration. In 4/5 of the rats considered, the total power increased. The increases corresponded mostly to the lower frequencies, below 5 Hz. These increases persisted in 3/5 of the rats 8 days after treatment. By comparing the spectral density when frequent spikes are present (this was present only with MSE rats) with that when they were absent, we note that there is an increase in both high frequency (due to the sharpness of the spike) and low frequency (due to the periodicity of the spiking) power. We note that the results were invariant to the type of window used (Hamming, Hann, rectangular). None of the ESE rats developed chronic seizures. In these rats, we note that the total power decreased after kainate treatment in 4/5 of the rats. The fact that the power does not increase is not surprising because visually there was no change in the signal (no spikes). We also do not see the low frequency increase in the power spectrum noted in the MSE rats. For control rats the average EEG total power changed by only 10% from before to after kainate treatment. Conclusions: Kainate-injured rats that develop epilepsy exhibit spectral changes (increases in low-frequency power) in the EEG that appear prior to the onset of frequent motor seizures. Some of these spectral changes are due to the appearance of spikes (either individually or in clusters). If similar changes are found to be present in humans, it could be possible to predict whether an individual is likely to go on to develop chronic epilepsy following a brain injury. This will have a large positive influence on the care of patients with brain injury and could focus treatment trials on those at highest risk.

Wilson, 1 Isabel Chung, and 1 Sookyong Koh ( 1 Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Prolonged seizures during childhood can lead to neuropsychiatric consequences including memory impairment, learning disability, and behavioral problems. No effective post-seizure treatment exists to prevent this neurological insult. Using kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we have demonstrated a reversal of seizure-induced decrease in exploratory behavior in open field testing of young rats by exposure to an enriched environment for 7?10 days after KA. These behavioral changes were accompanied by transcriptional alterations of genes involved in proliferation, long-term potentiation, and memory consolidation including Arc, Homer1a, and Egr1. The expression of these genes were decreased after KA-induced seizure but significantly increased after post-seizure exposure to an enriched environment. To demonstrate a causal role for these genes in alleviating seizure-induced behavioral deficits, we have delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV2) containing Arc into the hippocampus of young rats after KA-induced seizure and assessed the subsequent behavioral effects. Methods: Arc, Homer1a, and Egr1 were cloned into AAV2 shuttle vectors and high-titer rAAV2 vectors were produced by the CMRC Viral Vector Core. Long-Evans male rats were injected either with PBS or KA at postnatal day 21 (P21) and divided into 5 groups (KA-ARC, PBS-ARC, KA-GFP, PBS-GFP, PBS-No Surgery). One day later, rAAV2-Arc or rAAV2-GFP was stereotactically injected into the hippocampus of anesthetized rats in the surgical groups. Rats underwent the open field test at P28, 35, and 42. Animals were sacrificed at P44 and brains were immediately flash-frozen. 40 ?m cryostat sections were cut and processed for quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), in situ hybridization (ISH), immunocytochemistry (ICC), and western blot. Results: In the open field test, KA-ARC animals explored significantly more than KA surgical controls (two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0196, n = 8). By the third week of open field testing, a 1.6-fold increase in exploratory behavior of KA-ARC rats compared to KA controls was paralleled by a >2.5-fold increase in Arc mRNA (qRT-PCR, p = 0.0013, n = 8) and a 2-fold increase of Arc protein in western blot with Arc antibody. Shown by ISH and ICC, Arc mRNA and protein were primarily localized to the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus. Exploratory behavior significantly correlated with Arc mRNA expression seen in qRT-PCR (r = 0.701, p = 0.0012, n = 18). Conclusions: Expression of Arc mRNA and protein was increased by injection of rAAV2-Arc into rat brain, which led to an improvement in exploratory behavior after KA-induced seizure. These results demonstrate that Arc expression can reverse seizure-induced behavioral impairments. Future in vivo studies injecting viral vectors containing Egr1 and Homer1a into rat brain will elucidate whether these genes will also afford protection against behavioral deficits after seizure.

Chromosome substitution strains (CSS) are strains in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing. A panel of CSS in which each chromosome is represented may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to a phenotype. Pilocarpine hydrochloride is a muscarinic cholinergic agonist that causes limbic seizures in mice, modeling human temporal lobe epilepsy. QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures have not been reported. C57BL/6J (B6) mice have been shown to be resistant to seizures; the A/J strain has been less studied, but appears more susceptible to seizures. Here, we report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) X A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Methods: 340 adult male mice?at least 10 of each CSS, 50 B6, and 39 A/J?were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures between 10 and 12 weeks of age. Mice were pretreated with atropine (5 mg/kg), followed in 30 minutes by pilocarpine (250 mg/kg), then continuously observed for 3 hours. Using a seizure staging system adapted from established (Racine) rodent seizure scales, highest stage reached, latency to each stage, and latency between stages were recorded for all mice. Significance of results in the CSS panel screen was determined by nonparametric comparison of mean highest stage reached (Mann-Whitney), and cox proportional hazard regression was used to generate hazard ratios and p-values for latency variables. Results: B6 mice were more resistant to seizures and were slower to reach each stage compared to A/J mice (p < .01). The CSS for chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe seizure stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 seizure-resistant phenotype (p < .01). Latency to all seizure stages and between stages was also significantly shorter for CH10 and CH18 mice, with hazard rates as high as 25 times that of B6 mice. Conclusions: Results of CSS mapping suggest the presence of seizure susceptibility loci on mouse chromosomes 10 and 18. This approach can provide a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.

Frankel ( 1 Neurogenetics, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME ) Rationale: BRUNOL4 (Bruno like 4) is a brain specific RNA binding protein, the loss of which leads to both convulsive and absence seizures in mice. The expression of Brunol4 is concentrated in neurons of the brain regions controlling synchronization and oscillation such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, suggesting that BRUNOL4 may play important roles in the maintenance of normal neuronal rhythmic activities. We hypothesize that BRUNOL4 is involved in the processing of mRNAs encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation. Thus, BRUNOL4 deficiency would lead to altered expression of several molecules which in turn would result in seizures. This study aims to identify differentially expressed genes in the Brunol4 mutant brains and to determine how BRUNOL4 regulates gene expression. Methods: RNAs were extracted from mutant and control brains before the onset of overt seizures. The transcriptomes between mutants and controls were compared by microarrays, followed by northern and western analysis to confirm the expression difference. A potential BRUNOL4 recognition site in the target RNA transcripts was identified by multi-species sequence comparison. Direct binding between BRUNOL4 and its RNA targets was demonstrated by RNA-immunoprecipitation in neurons. The consequences of the BRUNOL4-RNA interactions were investigated through reporter assays and RNA decay studies in cultured neurons. Results: Multiple potential BRUNOL4 target RNAs with altered expression were identified in mutants. Subsequent work confirmed the reduced expression of four RNAs encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation in the mutant brain. The RNAs encode N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, serotonin receptor 2c, synapsin II and α-synuclein, some of which have been implicated in seizures while others may represent novel pathways in epilepsy. Sequence analysis revealed a highly conserved U/G rich motif in the 3? untranslated region (UTR) of all four genes. RNA- immunoprecipitation showed that BRUNOL4 interacts with the 3? UTRs of the four RNA transcripts through binding to the conserved U/G rich region. In luciferase reporter assays, the expression of chimeric reporters containing 3? UTRs of the target RNAs was down-regulated in the Brunol4 mutant neurons compared with wildtype neurons, a defect that can be rescued by adding back BRUNOL4 through transfection. Preliminary studies suggest that the mRNA decay rates of the four RNA transcripts are shorter in mutant neurons. Conclusions: BRUNOL4 appears to modulate neuronal excitability at the RNA level through fine-tuning the stability of RNA transcripts encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation. Brunol4 mutant mice represent the first animal model where compromised mRNA processing leads to epilepsy, thus providing a novel disease mechanism for seizure disorders.

Kelly ( 1 Neurology, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA ; and 2 Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Macroscopic properties of the EEG are frequently correlated with abnormal behaviors. We observed an apparent correlation of increased generalized spike wave discharge (SWD, absence seizure) amplitude to abnormal behaviors in aged F344 rats during long-term video-EEG recordings. We sought to validate quantitatively whether SWD amplitude could be used as a reliable marker to predict myoclonic arousals and limbic seizures in these animals. Methods: SWD amplitude recorded from six EEG channels during the initial 5 hours of a 24 hour recording was observed, and 7 schema were established to predict two major types of abnormal behaviors (myoclonic arousal and limbic seizures) in the following 19 hours of recording. The 7 schema consisted of: 1) event occurrence frequency; 2) myoclonic arousal; 3) head nodding (class II); 4) forelimb or hindlimb clonus (class III); 5) running and rearing (class IV); 6) falling and jumping (class V); and 7) fatality. Five episodes of SWDs were chosen randomly in the first 5 hours of recording and an average amplitude was generated from 6 EEG derivations: F3-C3, C3-P3, F3-P3, C4-P4, F3-F4, and C3-C4. Quantitative prediction for different abnormal behaviors were determined based on the amplitude variation of the 6 channels. For example, it would be predicted that there would be no myoclonic arousal when the amplitude of F3-C3 was greater than that of F3-P3 by more than 5%, whereas there would be 1 to 2 events of myoclonic arousal in the subsequent 19 hours when the F3-P3 amplitude was over 10% greater than F3-C3 while the amplitude of C3-P3 was less than or equal to C4-P4. For purposes of simplicity, a standard scheme of quantitative comparison was designed: 1 class III event = 2 class II events, 1 class IV event = 4 class II events. Accuracy was judged by comparing the number of observed events to the predicted results. For example, based on SWD amplitude, the range of actual class II events is predicted between 5 and 8 times. Prediction failure occurs when the actual class II event number is 3 or 10. Results: Twenty two EEG files of 20 month old F344 rats (n = 9) were analyzed and 3 prediction categories included: 1) frequency of occurrence of myoclonic arousal; 2) event frequency; and 3) limbic event class and fatality. Analysis indicated prediction accuracy of 80% for myoclonic arousals, 70% for event frequency, and 75% for limbic events ± fatalities. Taken together, prediction accuracy was ?70%. Conclusions: These findings suggest that macroscopic properties of electrocerebral activity in aged F344 rats may be used as predictors of abnormal ictal behaviors in these animals. These findings also suggest the possibility that specific differences in EEG spectral power may be quantifiable and equally predictive of these behaviors.

Holmes ( 1 Neuroloscience Center at Dartmouth, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy suffer from varying degrees of postictal impairment including confusion and amnesia. This impairment adds substantially to the disease burden of epilepsy. However, the mechanism responsible for postictal cognitive impairment is unclear. In this study we monitored place cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus before and after spontaneous seizures in epileptic rats. Place cells fire action potentials when the animal is in a specific location in space, the so-called place field. Place cell function correlates well with performance in tasks of visual-spatial memory and are an excellent measure of spatial memory. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at P70 were given lithium chloride (127 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally (IP) 18 hours before an IP injection of pilocarpine (34 mg/kg) to induce SE. One month later the rats were implanted with eight tetrodes and place cells and interneurons recorded. We compared place cell and interneuron firing patterns before and after spontaneous seizures. For the pyramidal neurons we measured coherence, information content, AP firing, and total number of APs. Results: A total of 12 spontaneous seizures were recorded from six rats. Of 87 cells recorded in these six rats, 20 met the requirements for a place cell and were detected during all four recording sessions (two before and two after the seizure). In these cells there were significant decreases in coherence, information content, firing rate and total spikes following the seizure (Figure). In addition, eight cells that did not have place firing prior to the seizure developed firing fields following the seizure. Nine cells that had firing fields on both recording sessions prior to the seizure could not be recorded following the seizure. Seven interneurons were recorded from four rats were recorded. The seizures had no effect on firing frequency of the interneurons. Conclusions: Following seizures there was a dramatic decrease in firing rate of action potentials. In addition, firing fields were aberrant with reduced coherence and information content. In addition, to postictal suppression of firing patterns, seizures lead to the emergence of previously silent cells. Interneuron firing was not affected by seizures. The concept that postical impairment is due to simple neuronal exhaustion is no longer tenable. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of seizures are complex, affecting neuronal function in a cell specific manner.

Ardesch, 1 Laetitia J.J.C. Wagener-Schimmel, 2,3 Hans E. Van Der Aa, 1 Gerard Hageman, and 3 Hendrik P.J. Buschman ( 1 Neurology, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 3 Twente Institute for Neuromodulation, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: Few adverse events on heart rate have been reported with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for refractory epilepsy. This effect may be caused by electrical stimulation of the efferent nerve fibers innervating the heart. We describe three cases with intraoperative bradycardia during device testing. Methods: From 1999 until 2006 approximately 90 patients with medically refractory epilepsy have been implanted with a VNS system in our centre. We review 3 patients who showed a bradycardia during intraoperative device testing (Lead Test) and their VNS-therapy follow-up outcome. Results: Patient 1, a 32 year old female with complex partial epilepsy, experienced a bradycardia of 43 beats/min during the first Lead Test, and 25 beats/min during a second test. Ten days after the operation the VNS system was activated under ECG-monitoring. No cardiac events occurred. Patient 2, a 52 year old male with partial epilepsy, experienced bradycardia of 40 beats/min. Ten days after implantation no cardiac effects were recorded when VNS therapy started. Patient 3, a 59 year old female with tonic clonic seizures, had a change in heart rate from 63 beats/min to 54 beats/min. No change in cardiac rhythm occurred when VNS therapy started. All three have had 4?6 years of chronic stimulation without cardiac side effects. The effect on epilepsy varied between 30%? > 50% reduction in seizure frequency. They also had less severe seizures and improved postictal recovery. Patient 1 and 2 have received a new pulse generator when battery was depleted. During the subsequent intraoperative Lead Tests no cardiac changes on ECG occurred. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bradycardia during intraoperative device testing does not have to be a reason for aborting the operation. However, postoperative VNS-therapy onset should be done carefully and under ECG monitoring. Furthermore, long-term VNS in these patients seems safe in respect to heart rate. 1 Edward Bromfield, 1 Barbara Dworetzky, 2 Shelley Hurwitz, 1 Zina Eluri, 1 Lara O?Brien, 1 Sonia Replansky, and 3 David Mostofsky ( 1 Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA ; 2 Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 3 Psychology, Boston University, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Fatty acids reduce seizures in animal models, but there is little human data. In a recent randomized trial (Epilepsy and Behavior 2005;7:253?8), patients with intractable epilepsy showed only a transient response. We are reporting the second such trial. Methods: Adults with uncontrolled epilepsy (at least 4 seizures/mo) were randomized 1:1, double-blinded, to PUFA (eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA), 2.2 mg/d in a 3:2 ratio) or placebo (mineral oil). Following a 4-wk prospective baseline and 1-wk titration phase, subjects entered a 12-wk treatment period. Quality of life was assessed (QOLIE-31) before and after treatment. Upon completion, subjects had the opportunity to participate in a 1-mo open-label PUFA trial. Nonparametric statistics were used. Results: 27 subjects were randomized; 4 decided not to participate before entering baseline (3 had been randomized to placebo and 1 to PUFA). 2 other subjects, both randomized to placebo, were dropped during baseline, 1 because of noncompliance and the other because of increased seizures. Completers included 12 PUFA subjects (7F, 5M; ages 25?55 (mean 37)), vs 9 on placebo (5F, 4M; ages 22?62 (mean 39)). 10 on PUFA and 6 on placebo had focal epilepsy, while 2 and 3 had generalized epilepsy (cryptogenic/symptomatic in 2 and 1, idiopathic in 2 on placebo). Subjects took from 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs, with no significant group differences. 2 on placebo vs. 0 on PUFA had >50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline during the 12-week treatment (p = 0.17). Seizure frequency increased 6% on PUFA and decreased 12% on placebo (p = 0.21). On the other hand, of 19 subjects completing the 4-wk open-label PUFA trial, 15 experienced fewer seizures than during baseline (p = 0.02), 5 by at least 50%; 4 of these 5 had previously been on placebo. QOLIE-31 scores increased an average of 1 point among PUFA subjects, and decreased 6 points among placebo subjects (p = 0.23). PUFA subjects during the randomized trial and all subjects during the open-label phase showed no differences in serum drug concentrations other than lamotrigine, which declined by a mean of 17% among 6 patients. Conclusions: In this trial, PUFA was not superior to placebo as a treatment for intractable epilepsy. Given PUFA's absence of adverse effects and efficacy in animal models, additional trials of different doses or EPA:DHA ratios could be justified, particularly a longer, larger trial including children as well as adults. Adequate controls will be needed to account for what can be a strong placebo effect.

Buschman, 2 Jasper R. Sikken, 3 Willem Kersing, 2 Peter H. Veltink, and 1,4 Hans E. Van Der Aa ( 1 Institute for Neuromodulation (TWIN), Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Biomedical Signals  3 Otolaryngology and Phoniatrics, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 4 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: VNS is an effective treatment for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. It is generally accepted that VNS owes its antiepileptic effect from afferent nerve fiber stimulation. Co activation of efferent fibers can cause side-effects. One of the most frequent reported side-effects is hoarseness due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. At high stimulation amplitudes even spastic contractions of ipsilateral intrinsic laryngeal muscles can occur. For a group of VNS-therapy users this side-effect interferes severely with their daily activities. We investigated the recruitment properties of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and analyzed electromyographic and morphometric alterations on the vocal folds during VNS. Methods: Vocal fold EMG experiments were conducted intra-operatively during the implantation of a VNS system. When the patient was anesthetized the endotracheal EMG tube (XOmed) was inserted, and the recording wires connected to the Monitor. During surgery the VNS-therapy stimulation lead and pulse generator were implanted following normal procedure. The pulse generator was then programmed to stimulate in magnet mode for 14 seconds at 2 Hz, and one of the following pulse durations: 130, 250, 500, 750, or 1000 micros. At each pulse width the EMG-threshold current was determined by electrical stimulation of the VN with increasing stimulation currents. When EMG signal amplitude saturated upon stimulation a second pulse duration was randomly selected and the above procedure repeated. Laryngostroboscopic examination was performed 1 and 6 months after surgery. Special attention was given to the effects of spontaneous stimulation on the larynx. If no effect was noticed a higher intensity stimulation cycle was given by means of ?magnet-activation?. Results: The vocal fold EMG and morphodynamic changes in the larynx have been analyzed in 5 patients. In all patients left vocal fold EMG threshold was between 0.25 and 0.50 mA. Pulse duration had little influence on the EMG threshold level. Vocal fold EMG saturation levels were reached between 0.75 and 1.00 mA. Videostroboscopic monitoring at therapeutic levels (1.25 ? 2.25 mA) showed that VNS is well tolerated. ?Magnet? stimulation induced an adductory spasm of either the ipsilateral vocal fold or the vestibular fold, and was present remarkably irrespective of the presence of hoarseness. Conclusions: VNS causes pronounced effects on the vocal folds even at low stimulation amplitudes. At therapeutic levels the effect on the vocal folds is maximal even at the lowest stimulation pulse durations. The vocal fold contractions, however, do not necessarily give audible effects (hoarseness). 1 Robert S. Fisher, and SANTE Study Group ( 1 Neurology, Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, CA; and See Listing on Epilepsycontrol.com ) Rationale: We present an interim report for the SANTE (Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus for Epilepsy) trial, to illustrate the structure of the trial. Methods: The subject pool consists of patients 18?65 years old, inclusive, with partial onset seizures with or without generalization, and with observable clinical seizure manifestations. Seizures must be documented by prior video-EEG monitoring, and they must average at least six per month. Patients must have failed at least three AEDs, with dosing stable for 30 days prior to enrollment. Women must be using a reliable method of birth control. Excluded are patients with IQ < 70 or inability to complete neuropsychological testing, progressive lesions or diseases, or psychiatric hospitalization, suicide attempt or psychosis (excluding postictal psychosis) within five years. If present, a VNS is to be explanted at time of thalamic implantation. After a three-month baseline, eligible subjects receive bilateral anterior thalamic nuclei implantation of a dual-channel Medtronic Model 7428 Kinetra Neurostimulation System with Model 3387 DBS Brain Leads. One month later, stimulation is initiated at either 0 (placebo) or 5 (active treatment) V, with pulse width 90 us, 145 pulses per second, on for 1 minute and off for 5. The double-blind period continued for 3 months, after which there is 9 months of systematic variation of certain stimulation parameters. Results: As of 3/27/06, 98 patients were enrolled and 58 implanted at 15 US medical centers. Of these, 25 discontinued prior to implantation. Reasons included withdrawal of consent, inability to maintain stable antiepileptic drugs, status epilepticus, insufficient numbers of seizures in the baseline, and miscellaneous other reasons. Among 85 patients completing the baseline visit, age (mean ± SD, range) was 35.4 ± 10.9 (18.5?60.9) years, 45 male, 40 female. Epilepsy duration was 22.2 ± 13.1 (2?60) years. AEDs numbered 1 in 9 patients (11.3%), 2 in 37 (46.3%), 3 in 32 (40.0%), and 4 in 2 (2.5%). A vagus nerve stimulator previously had been implanted in 36 (42.4%); 17 (20.0%) had prior epilepsy surgery and 12 had both epilepsy surgery and VNS implantation. Conclusions: The SANTE trial is proceeding satisfactorily. Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed and presented after 102 patients have completed the blinded phase.

Vining ( 1 Epilepsy, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; 2 Nutrition, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Neurology, Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet is not typically offered to adults with epilepsy due to the significant lifestyle alterations needed for its use. The modified Atkins diet has been recently demonstrated to be therapeutic for children with intractable epilepsy without the need for admission, weighing foods, and fluid, calorie, and protein restrictions. We hypothesized the modified Atkins diet would be similarly well tolerated and effective for adults. Methods: Study inclusion criteria included age over 18, and at least weekly seizures and 2 attempted anticonvulsants. Carbohydrates were initially restricted to 15 grams/day, fats encouraged, and fluids, protein, and calories were ad lib. Medications were unchanged for the first 3 months. Patients were examined and laboratory results obtained at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months on the diet. Results: Thirty patients, median age 36 years (range, 18 to 53), 19 (63%) female, consented and 29 started the diet. The median number of prior medications was 8 (range, 2?14); seizures were occurring 10 times per week (range, 1?140). Twelve patients had vagus nerve stimulators, 8 had failed resective surgery. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, approximately 40% had a >50% seizure reduction after 1 and 3 months on the diet. In those with seizure reduction, the median time to improvement was 2 weeks (range, 1 week to 2 months). Improvement was slightly higher in those with moderate to large urinary ketosis at the 1-month visit, p = 0.08. The mean weight loss was 6.9 kg; mean BMI decreased from 29.0 to 26.5, p = 0.001. Cholesterol increased from a mean of 182 to 201 mg/dl after 1?3 months, p = 0.02. Compliance was problematic; 11 (37%) discontinued the diet prior to 3 months. Conclusions: A modified Atkins diet appears to be an effective therapy for adults with intractable epilepsy and can also induce weight loss. Considering the high dropout rate, a 2-month trial appears to be adequate. (Supported by General Clinical Research Center, NIH/National Center for Research Resources grant M01-RR00052.) 1 Kevin Novak, 2 JoAnn Hoeppner, 1 Ruzica K. Ristanovic, 1 Lawrence P. Bernstein, 1 Jesse Taber, and 3 Jeffrey Cozzens ( 1 Neurology, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare; Northwestern University, Evanston, IL ; 2 Pediatrics ; and 3 Neurosurgery ) Rationale: Patients receiving VNS therapy for refractory epilepsy often appear on follow-up to be more alert, attentive, and energetic, independent of the effects of VNS on seizure frequency. This effect has not been fully demonstrated, and potential mechanisms of action have not been explored. We hypothesized that the apparent improvement in attention and energy results from a reduction in IEDs, which may interfere with cognitive processes. Methods: A heterogeneous group of 12 subjects with medically refractory, localization related epilepsy was evaluated at baseline, and at 6 months after VNS implantation surgery. Subjects had different epilepsy syndromes, baseline seizure and IED rates, and baseline IQs. During a 6 hour EEG recording session, an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to test for global cognitive function in several domains, with particular emphasis on attention. EEG spikes were detected with Persyst software, while custom software was used for EEG noise reduction and analysis of power spectrum, coherence, and statistics. Quality of life was examined with the QOLIE-31 questionnaire. Seizure frequency was recorded by subject and caregiver report. The paired Student's t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05 considered significant). Results: The group had nonsignificant reductions in seizure frequency (mean 10.0 to 2.4/month, p = 0.07) and IED rate (64.1 to 7.7 spikes/hr, p = 0.08). There were no significant changes in relative EEG power acutely (VNS-on vs -off) or chronically (baseline vs VNS-off), although there was a trend of decreased delta and increased alpha power after VNS. Coherence did not change acutely with stimulation, but 9 of 12 subjects had significant chronic changes. Quality of life trended toward improvement (QOLIE-31 raw score 52.5 to 61.9, p = 0.17). No changes were seen in any of the cognitive domains examined in standard neuropsychological testing, but the longer lasting of the two computerized tests of sustained attention/vigilance trended toward improvement (Steer clear driving: 7.02 vs. 4.95 cows/min hit, p = 0.11). The longer duration sustained attention driving test performance was correlated with baseline IED rate (r2 = 0.27, p = 0.05), and improved performance correlated with decreased IED rate after VNS (r2 = 0.31, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Although nonsignificant, 6 months of VNS in a small number of subjects resulted in a trend of reduced seizure frequency and IED rate, but had no measurable effect on cognition. The trend of reduced IED rates significantly correlated with improved ability to sustain attention in a longer duration task. Perhaps a larger study on a more homogeneous group of subjects selected for high IED rates and low to moderate baseline cognitive function would show larger changes in cognition.

Barkley ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ; 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 3 NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA ) Rationale: A significant percentage of women with epilepsy (WWE) have reported increased seizure frequency during the perimenstrual period (catamenial epilepsy). We first documented catamenial exacerbation of epileptiform activity using the Responsive Neurostimulator System (RNS) in 2005 [M V Spanaki, et al. Epilepsia 2005;46(Suppl 8):222]. In this study we continuously measured epileptiform activity in two WWE over a total of 17 menstrual cycles. Methods: As part of a FDA-approved multicenter feasibility study investigating the safety and potential efficacy of the RNS for epilepsy, we have implanted two WWE who were not good surgical candidates. The patients kept diaries of their menstrual periods. After seizure onset patterns were identified for both patients, detectors were programmed to identify electrocorticogram (ECOG) patterns that occurred prior to clinical seizures. These patterns appear epileptiform and occur frequently, but the vast majority of these bursts do not result in clinical seizures. Detection data from the RNS were then analyzed in multi-day windows around the date of menses onset and compared to detection rates on days exclusive of these perimenstrual windows to determine if the daily detection rate differed between the menstrual and non-menstrual intervals. Results: Data was gathered for 9 and 8 menstrual cycles for patients H and M, respectively. The detection rates for the different windows are shown in the graph. [figure 1]The detection data show statistical difference for both patients at window sizes of ± 3 days relative to the onset of the patient's menstrual cycle at the alpha = 0.05 level (95% confidence). Conclusions: The RNS has detection and diagnostic capabilities that allow objective measurement of epileptiform activity over prolonged periods of time in ambulatory patients. Use of RNS has confirmed the existence of perimenstrually exacerbated seizure activity. (Supported by: The RNS is limited by U.S. law to investigational use only.

Koepp ( 1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom ; 2 MRC Human Nutrition Research, Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom ; and 3 MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Fatty acids (FA) have important roles in determining optimal structural and functional properties of neuronal membranes and may have an important impact on epilepsy. Pharmacology studies have shown that the FA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, an omega-3 FA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an omega-3 FA) and arachidonic acid (AA, an omega-6 FA) can increase seizure thresholds. One study showed that the ketogenic diet increased plasma concentrations of EPA, DHA and AA. This increase may be a factor in the diet's anti-seizure effects. In a double blind study examining effects of omega-3 FA supplementation in people with epilepsy, we also examined FA profiles prior to and following supplementation. Methods: Patients with chronic epilepsy were randomised to receive capsules providing EPA (1g) and DHA (0.7g) daily or placebo (mixed vegetable oils) in a 12-week double blind study. Seizure counts, adverse events, AEDs and 28 different red blood cell (RBC) FA concentrations were assessed during the study. The effect of concomitant AEDs on baseline FA concentrations was assessed by comparing those on AEDs with those not on the AEDs, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results: The RBC FA profile obtained in 56 subjects prior to the start of the study showed mean% of AA, EPA and DHA of 13.1, 0.9 and 3.9. Carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) appear to affect baseline FA concentrations, so analysis was done comparing those on CBZ (26) and those on OXC (20) with those taking neither CBZ nor OXC (10). Those taking CBZ showed 22% lower mean DHA (p < 0.05), 20% lower long chain omega-3 FA (p < 0.05) and 5% lower monosaturated FA (p < 0.01). Those taking OXC showed non-significantly higher EPA (23%), DHA (14%) and AA (6%) levels, which together contributed to a higher total polyunsaturated FA of 8% (p < 0.05). Like CBZ, OXC was also associated with lower (8%) monosaturated FA (p < 0.001). Following 12 weeks of supplementation, the 29 subjects in supplement group showed a 13% reduction in AA (p < 0.001), 216% increase in EPA (p < 0.001) and a 55% increase in DHA (p < 0.001). Caution needs to be taken in interpreting these results as no correction factor was applied for the multiple analyses undertaken. Conclusions: CBZ appears to be associated with lower DHA and long chain omega-3 FA whilst OXC appears to be associated with higher total polyunsaturated FA. Hence OXC appears to be associated with a potentially more favourable FA profile. These findings need to be confirmed in subjects starting on these drugs as monotherapy. This study also showed that EPA and DHA concentrations are increased with omega-3 FA supplementation. (Supported by Seven Seas Ltd. UK provided study medication.) 1 Ann Bergin, 2 Karen Costas, 2 Vanessa Ludlow, 1 Francie Mandel, and 3 Virginia Kimonis ( 1 Neurology, Childrens Hospital ; 2 GI/Nutrition ; and 3 Genetics, Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Angelman syndrome (AS) is associated with deletion of the maternal chromosome 15q11.2?15q13 in >70% of cases. Uniparental disomy, mutations of the UBE3A gene or of an imprinting center, cause an additional 15% of cases. Refractory epilepsy is particularly common in deletion-associated cases. Multiple seizure types occur including atypical absences and prolonged non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Anticonvulsant drugs (AEDs), often in combination, are incompletely effective. Each of the molecular mechanisms known to be associated with AS causes dysfunction of the UBE3A gene product, the E3 ubiquitin-ligase protein. In deletion cases other genes, including the gene encoding g-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ?3 subunit is deleted. A model for AS, mice lacking the ?3 subunit, show myoclonic jerks, abnormal EEG and seizures with motor and learning defects. The ?3 subunit deficit may result in abnormal thalamocortical functioning, favoring atypical absence seizures and NCSE. The ketogenic diet (KD) is an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy. The mechanisms by which the KD exerts its anticonvulsant effect are not known. Proposed molecular targets include mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, potassium channels and, of interest for deletion-positive AS patients, GABA-ergic neurotransmission favoring inhibitory effect. In this context we present 3 patients with Angelman syndrome and refractory epilepsy who were successfully treated with the ketogenic diet. Methods: A modified ketogenic diet (brief fast, full hydration, acid-base correction) was initiated in hospital after neurological, nutritional and neurometabolic testing revealed no contraindication to the KD. Final KD ratio was determined based on efficacy and level of ketosis. Results: A: 3 year old girl, deletion positive AS and refractory NCSE, on 4 AEDs. Seizure free without complications on KD. Improved alertness, motor control, respiratory health, wellbeing. B: 2 year old boy, deletion positive AS, on 2 AEDs. Seizure free off AEDs on KD. More alert, more progress. C: 14 year old boy, one of 2 affected sibs with linkage to 15q11?13 but no mutation, with refractory status epilepticus, on 5 AEDs. Decrease in admissions for status epilepticus from 5/year to 1/3 years. Continued rarer seizures. Improved alertness, wellbeing. No adverse effects. Conclusions: Epilepsy in 2 deletion-positive AS cases was completely controlled, and a useful response occurred in an undeleted case. Based on these initial observations we recommend consideration of KD treatment early in the course of refractory epilepsy in AS individuals. Different molecular pathology may underlie the differential response seen in these cases. There are now 2 animal models of AS available with different molecular characteristics. Further clinical and in vivo studies of the KD in AS may clarify the role of the KD and offer insights into the pathophysiology of epilepsy in AS and into KD mechanisms. 1 A.G. Christina Bergqvist, 2 Joan I. Schall, 1 Erica L. Richard, 3 Paul R. Gallagher, and 2 Virginia A. Stallings ( 1 Division of Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 3 Division of Biostatistics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The purpose of this study was to determine if hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia predicts clinical ketogenic diet (KD) response by evaluating first morning blood glucose during the initial 21 days after initiation of the KD in a cohort of children with intractable epilepsy. In addition, the correlation between change in weight status and blood glucose was explored. Methods: First morning fasting whole blood glucose was measured daily for the first 21 days after KD initiation. Moderate hypoglycemia was defined as a glucose < 60 mg/dL at any time during the 21 days; severe hypoglycemia as < 45 mg/dL; and hyperglycemia as > 100 mg/dL. Z-scores for weight (WAZ) and height (HAZ) were obtained at baseline, the day of discharge, 0.5 and 1 month of full KD therapy. Associations between clinical response to the KD, responder defined as > 50% reduction of seizure frequency at 3 months, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, style of KD initiation (fasting or gradual) and weight status were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and longitudinal mixed effects models. Results: Forty-five subjects ages 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 ± 2.7 y) participated. Growth status was suboptimal before KD initiation (WAZ ?0.3 ± 1.6 and HAZ ?0.4 ± 2.0). Weight status declined over 1 month of KD therapy (to ?0.6 ± 1.7 for WAZ). KD responder status was not associated with low or elevated blood glucose. A fasting or gradual KD initiation was also not associated. Children who had declining weight status during KD initiation were more likely to be hypoglycemic during full KD therapy, but this was unrelated to response to KD. Conclusions: Low blood glucose during KD therapy was not necessary for response to KD with clinically significant seizure reduction. Hypoglycemia was related to declining weight status. An effective KD can be provided in a manner to minimize side-effects and maximize efficacy.

Buzzerd ( 1 Clinical, Associates In Behavioral Health, Tunkhannock, PA ) Rationale: Roughly 500,000 children and adolescents across the U.S. suffer from seizure activity. Currently, medication management programs are the primary intervention with only varying success at controlling seizure activity. Increased attention and study needs to be focused on non-pharmacological intervention strategies like stem cell therapy. This case study evaluated the effectiveness of human, umbilical cord stem cell (hUCSC) therapy over a ten month period of time in an eight year old male with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Methods: Direct observations and indirect measures (such as standardized assessment tools) were conducted and administered; interviews with support persons were also conducted. Seizure activity, motor skills, communication skills and academic performance baseline were evaluated for change following two stem cell injections (1.8?2.0 and 2.8?3.0 million stem cells) administered six months apart. A single subject research design was used to collect baseline and post-injection data. Results: A t-test analysis of data groups presented statistical significance (at p = .05) in seizure activity. The post injection data represented the subject as exhibiting approximately a 90% reduction in both seizure frequency and duration during the period of this study. Conclusions: Although a single case study does not serve as ?proof? that stem cell therapy is an effective treatment. Studies into this new area of science must critically evaluate all outcomes that may be discovered. (Supported by Private Funder.) 1 Maria G. Dahlin, 2 Lena Hjelte, and 1 Per E. Amark ( 1 Neuropediatrics, Astrid Lindgrens Childrens Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden ; and 2 Cystic Fibrosis, Astrid Lindgrens Childrens Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-protein, very low-carbohydrate diet used in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy in children. Its anticonvulsant mechanism is still unclear but alterations of fatty acid (FA) levels has been proposed as a mechanism of action. We examined the influence of the KD on FA levels and seizure control. Methods: The levels of seventeen FAs in plasma phospholipids were determined before and 1, 6, and 12 months after initiation of the KD in 25 children (mean age 6.3 years) with severe epilepsy. The majority were on a KD ratio of 4:1 (fats:proteins and carbohydrates). After 1 month, the KD was supplemented with polyunsaturated omega-3 FAs by adding fish-oil (4?8 g/day). Seizures were quantified. Results: Highly significant changes in the levels of several FAs were found in relation to the KD. After 1 month on KD significant changes were seen in the levels of 8 FAs, after 6 months on KD in 10 FAs and after 12 months on KD in 12 FAs. Changes were found in the levels of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated as well as saturated FAs. Among others, increases were seen in linoleic acid (18:2 n6) and EPA (20:5 n3) and decreases in arachidonic acid (20:4 n6). The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 FAs decreased from 7.0 before diet to 4.9 at 12 months after diet start. However, no correlation of FA levels to seizure response was found. Conclusions: The ketogenic diet induced prominent changes in several major plasma fatty acid levels but a correlation to seizure control was not found. A decreased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids was observed which may be of benefit to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed on how different diet compositions, in terms of type and amount of various fatty acids, affect blood fatty acid profile, in order to define an optimal diet regime for maximal seizure control as well as minimal cardiovascular risks.

Jobst ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH) Methods of terminating seizures Patient Epileptic focus Praying Talking Swallowing Listening Writing Rubbing 1 Right + + + 2 Right + 3 Right + 4 Right + 5 Right + 6 Left + + + 7 Left + + Rationale: Patients often report that they can terminate seizures with certain cognitive tasks. Case reports decribe the ability of cognitive tasks to suppress/interrupt seizure activity. A systematic review of such experiences has not yet been documented in the literature. Is it not known whether cognitive activity arresting seizures is hemispheric specific, and whether it correlates with side of seizure onset. Methods: 20 adult patients with mesial temporal epilepsy were retrospectivley interviewed by telephone or in writing. All patients had unilateral temporal lobe seizure onset and underwent temporal lobectomy. Patients were asked to describe, whether they developed a cognitive method/technique to terminate seizures, when they were preceded by an aura. In addition a list of cognitive activities specific to each hemisphere was presented to all patients. Results: Seven patients reported cognitive acitivities that terminated seizures after an aura occured.Five patients had right mesial temporal seizure onset, two had left mesial temporal seizure onset. Patients with right mesial temporal onset seemed to control their seizures with praying, while patients with a left mesial temporal onset controlled their seizures via rubbing or tapping the contralateral affected limb (see table). The small number of patients precluded statistical analysis. Conclusions: Despite being a limited study, this survey provides an interesting observation. Some patients with right sided mesial temporal seizure onset can terminate their seizures with right hemispheric activities such as praying. Some select patients with a left mesial temporal seizure onset are able to terminate their seizures using left hemispheric tasks, such as talking, writing, tapping and rubbing the right side. Neurocognitive tasks represented in close proximity to the seizure focus could influence electrical seizure activity. Neurocognitive therapy could evolve as treatment option for epilepsy. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study with objective validation. 2 Celina C. Martinez, 1 Adam L. Hartman, and 1 Eric H. Kossoff ( 1 Pediatric Epilepsy, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; and 2 School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Approximately 10% of children on the ketogenic diet become seizure-free after its initiation. The diet typically is discontinued after 2 years, but there is no information regarding the likelihood and severity of seizure recurrence. Methods: A retrospective chart review examined children who became seizure-free on the ketogenic diet at our institution over a 12-year period; the indication for discontinuing the diet was freedom from seizures. All children had at least 6 months of seizure freedom and were on the diet for that period prior to discontinuation. Results: Sixty-six children discontinued the diet after a median of 2.1 years due to seizure freedom; 92% were medication-free. Twelve (18%) had recurrence of their seizures at a median of 3.0 years after the diet was stopped. Seven (58%) became seizure-free a second time, 2 after reinstitution of the diet. Four patients restarted the diet but remain intractable to date. The presence of recent electrographic epileptiform activity and an abnormal MRI each significantly increased the likelihood of recurrence (45% and 38%, respectively); age, seizure type, seizure frequency, medication freedom, and time to initial diet response did not. Three patients with recurrent seizures had tuberous sclerosis complex. Conclusions: The risk of recurrent seizures subsequent to discontinuing the diet after achieving seizure freedom was approximately 1 in 5, and more than half became seizure-free again, usually with anticonvulsants alone. The risk of recurrent intractability was three times less; however the diet, when restarted in these patients, was not as successful. Obtaining a recent EEG prior to discontinuing the diet in this situation may be advisable in counseling families. 1 Hrisimir Kostov, 1 Pål G. Larsson, and 2 Geir K. R?ste ( 1 Department of Neurodiagnostics, The National Center for Epilepsy, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Sandvika, Norway ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is accepted as an effective and safe treatment for refractory partial epilepsy. Its value for treating patients with refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is not well documented. Methods: All patients with medically refractory IGE, with EEG/video documented seizures, implanted with VNS in our epilepsy surgery program between 1995 and 2006 were included. A total of 12 patients (2 M, 10 F) from 11 to 48 years (mean age: 30.7 ± 14.4 years) were identified. Mean follow-up period was 18 months (±14; range, 3 ? 48). Patients were treated with an average of 2.25 AEDs/patient at implantation time. Wilcoxon's paired signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Results: There was 62% seizure reduction for generalized tonic-clonic seizures (p = 0.0020), 58% for absence seizures (p = 0.0003) and 40% for myoclonic seizures (p = 0.0156). Eight patients were considered responders (≥ 50% seizure reduction); two of these patients became seizure-free. Two patients had < 50% seizure reduction, and two patients showed no change in seizure frequency. At the last follow-up visit, the patients were receiving an average of 1.67 AEDs (?0.58 AEDs/patient; p = 0.0625). Two patients (both responders) are currently being treated with VNS therapy only. Most commonly used stimulations parameters were: pulse width 250 ?s, frequency 20 Hz, 30 seconds on and 5 minutes off. Median output current at the last follow-up was 1.5 mA. Due to lack of response in four patients, parameters were changed to rapid cycling (7 sec. on and 0.2/0.3 min off); two of these patients became then responders. An improvement in alertness (?better? or ?much better?) was observed in 6 of the patients. According to 5 patients, the magnet was always or most times effective. Nine patients reported some side effects, which were mild and tended to decrease over time. Conclusions: In this patient population, VNS therapy was effective and safe for the treatment of medically refractory IGE. Rapid cycling seems to be effective for some of the non-responders. There was an improvement in alertness in half of the patients, and a trend towards a reduction in the number of AEDs/patient. 1,2 Elizabeth A. Leleszi, 1,2 Eishi Asano, and 1,2 Gyula Acsadi ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Celiac disease can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including ataxia, epilepsy, dementia, neuropathy, myopathy, cerebral calcification, cerebellar atrophy and leukoencephalopathy, which are mostly related to the metabolic consequences of severe malabsorption. We describe a four year-old child, presenting with myoclonic epilepsy described as head drops and occasional upper extremity clonus. The seizures continued to happen up to thirty times a day for several months even on multiple antiepileptic medications. An ictal EEG showed generalized high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with duration lasting 1?2 seconds. A brain MRI was normal. As part of an allergy workup, high antigluten antibodies were found and the HLA typing (HLA-DQB1*0302, 0301) was also consistent with celiac disease. Unfortunately, a jejunal biopsy was not preformed. After the patient was started on a gluten-free diet, the seizures resolved completely within three days and the EEG was normalized. The anti-epileptic medications were gradually discontinued without any relapse for at least four more months. Conclusions: Gluten from dietary sources may evoke an immune response of the gastrointestinal cells via gliadin and tissue transglutaminase in susceptible individuals and lead to celiac disease with multiorgan manifestations. However, the clinical and immunological consequences of asymptomatic gluten intolerance are not well established. This is the first case report describing a complete resolution of seizure activity with a gluten-free diet alone. Our case suggests a possibility that the epilepsy was caused by a so far unknown immunological process directed to the central nervous system (e.g. antibodies to some ion channels.) Further investigations are necessary to determine a relationship and pathomechanism between intractable epilepsy and gluten intolerance. 1 Jullie W. Pan, 2 C.J. Segal-Issacson, and 2 Brandy Cowell ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 2 Epidemiology and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: A number of reports have found that low carbohydrate (e.g., Atkins) or low glycemic index diets may help in reducing seizure frequency. Given the relatively lower ketosis achieved in such diets as compared to the ketogenic diet, it is possible that the effect of seizure control is not via direct ketone (or ketone derivatives) levels in the brain, but through a physiological mechanism. We examined for such a mechanism by studying the effects of 4 weeks of an Atkins diet on cerebral energetics in n = 7 healthy overweight control adult volunteers. Methods: We used high field 31P whole brain MRSI to study healthy overweight (n = 7, mean age 34.7 ± 10.0years, 4F) volunteers, examining them prior to initiating a low carbohydrate diet (Atkins Phase 1) and after 4 weeks of sustaining this diet. For optimum diet control, meals from a licensed caterer were provided to the subjects, and the macronutrient distribution of the diet was 65% fat: 30% protein: 5% carbohydrate. The mean body mass index at baseline was 34.0 ± 2.7, and after 4 weeks of the diet was 31.2 ± 2.2. Weight loss was achieved by all volunteers, averaging 6.7 ± 3.2 kg. 31P MRSI was performed at 4Tesla. Including scout imaging and calibrations, the duration of the 31P study was ?75min. The 31P acquisition has an effective sampling radius of 1.4cm; previous studies have shown the reproducibility to be 10%. Quantification was performed accounting for tissue volume, coil loading and relaxation. Plasma samples were frozen at ?80C until analysis; b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were spectrophotometrically assayed after each study using a COBAS-FARA analyzer. Results: A mild ketosis was achieved in all subjects, with plasma BHB rising from 0.24 ± 0.05 to 1.64 ± 0.93. Example data (position and spectra) are shown in Fig. 1, showing PCr, ATP and inorganic phosphate Pi. Data and loci of spectral analysis are shown in the Table. From all volunteers, the ATP and PCr concentrations in the hippocampus and thalamus rose significantly between D0 to D28, while there was no significant change in occipital cortical tissue. Conclusions: Cerebral energetics changed with use of a low carbohydrate diet, with increased ATP and PCr concentrations in the thalamus and hippocampus. The data are consistent with a view that the change in fuel type and availability is characterized by an alteration in energetics particularly in subcortical brain structures. The increased availability of high energy phosphates in key limbic structures may be an important factor in how a low carbohydrate diet affects seizure control.

Methods: Three client-owned epileptic dogs refractory to AED treatment were studied. All dogs were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy based on the history of generalized seizures, normal neurological examination, unremarkable brain MRI and EEG features. Affected dogs were followed for at least 60 days before and after rTMS. A calendar of the seizures was kept to evaluate the interval between seizures before and after rTMS. Each dog received multiple AED treatment including phenobarbital, potassium bromide and levetiracetam. No dosage change was made in the two months prior to and following the study. A total amount of five treatments were delivered to each dog over five consecutive days (1 treatment per day). The technique of stimulation consisted in a 9 cm focal point coil located over the skull in proximity of the vertex. Different rates of stimulation were used between dog 1 and dogs 2 and 3. In dog 1, each treatment consisted in low-rate rTMS delivered in 20 consecutive trains of 90 pulses each at 1 Hz frequency and 60% of the maximal coil output. The inter-train interval (ITI) was 120 seconds. Dog 2 and 3 received a treatment protocol consisting of two consecutive sessions at different rates. The first session consisted of priming the cerebral cortex with high-rate rTMS characterized by 20 trains (40 seconds ITI) of 60 pulses each at 6 Hz frequency and 55% of the maximal coil output. The second session of stimulation consisted in low-rate rTMS characterized by 10 trains (60 seconds ITI) of 60 pulses each at 1 Hz frequency and 60% of the maximal coil output. The longest seizure-free interval during the pre-rTMS period was compared with the seizure-free interval immediately post-rTMS. Results: Dog 1 and 3 had a short-term improvement of the seizure interval in the immediate post-rTMS period (27 days and 14 days respectively) as compared to the longest seizure-free interval of the pre-rTMS period (20 days and 12 days respectively). Dog 2 had an equal seizure-free interval between the immediate post-rTMS period (19 days) and the longest seizure-free interval of the pre-rTMS period (19 days). Conclusions: Regardless of the technique of stimulation used in this study (low-rate rTMS versus high-rTMS followed by low-rate rTMS), an equal or prolonged seizure-free interval in the immediate post-rTMS period was observed in all dogs suggesting the possible short-term beneficial effect of rTMS in canine epilepsy.

Schmidt ( 1 Neurology and Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ; and 2 Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: Caged compounds are inert prodrugs that are capable of releasing small bioactive molecules when excited by light at the appropriate wavelength. They were initially developed to facilitate rapid, step increases in the local concentration of neurotransmitters and are typically activated with a very brief pulse from a mercury bulb or laser. We wondered whether we could use low levels of light from an ultraviolet diode (UV LED) to release GABA from a new caged analog and modulate seizure-like activity in cultured neurons. Methods: We used cultured hippocampal neurons after about 2 weeks in vitro and recorded in whole cell bridge or voltage clamp mode. GABA was applied by whole bath perfusion or by uncaging 4-[[(2H-1-benzopyran-2-one-7-amino-4-methoxy)carbonyl]amino]butanoic acid (BC204). A UV LED (Nicchia 365 nm/100 mW) was activated by a custom fabricated driver for 4 seconds in the uncaging experiments. Results: We first verified that our UV LED was capable of generating sufficiently high GABA concentrations to activate GABAA receptors in our cultures. We found that driver currents between 25 and 250 mA produced readily detectable currents in the presence of BC204 (30 ?M). These currents are well below the maximum capacity of the UV LED (700 mA). The current elicited by 150 mA corresponded to a 10 ?M GABA current, when normalized to a GABA dose response curve. The currents produced by uncaging BC204 were reduced by 89% in the presence of picrotoxin (100 ?M). BC204 itself at 30 ?M is a very weak GABAA blocker, reducing 3 ?M GABA currents by about 5%. When cultures were exposed to medium lacking magnesium, they generated increased synaptic activity, paroxysmal depolarization shifts, and often ?seizure like? discharges that were abolished by perfusion with GABA as low as 3 ?M. In the presence of BC204 (30 ?M), a 4 second illumination with 100?200 mA also eliminated spontaneous activity. The figure below shows the effect of a 4 second light pulse on bursting. [figure 1]Illumination in the absence of BC204 produced no detectable current. Conclusions: These results suggest that it may be possible to utilize a compact, low power UV LED in combination with locally applied caged GABA to activate tonic GABAA and GABAB receptors and modulate paroxysmal activity. These receptors can be activated by GABA concentrations in the low micromolar range, which it may be possible to achieve in vivo.

Stallings ( 1 Pediatrics/Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Pediatrics/Division of GI, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The aims of this study were to describe vitamin D status including dietary intake in a contemporary cohort of children with intractable epilepsy prescribed newer anti-epileptic drugs (AED), and to determine the effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on serum vitamin D status over 15 months. Methods: Prepubertal children 1?14 years with intractable epilepsy were eligible. Serum vitamin D (25-OHD and 1,25-OHD) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were obtained prior to initiation of KD therapy and every three months thereafter. Three-day weighed dietary records were obtained at baseline and one month on KD therapy, and included vitamin and mineral supplementation. Results: 45 children with intractable epilepsy (age 5.1 ± 2.7 years) enrolled in the study. At baseline 4% had deficient and 51% had insufficient serum 25-OHD levels. Vitamin D intake was inadequate; 46% consuming less than the recommended intake. Adequate vitamin D intake, fewer AED and generalized seizures were associated with higher serum 25-OHD levels (p < 0.01). After 3 months on the KD, vitamin D status improved, 25-OHD levels increased (p < 0.001), and PTH declined (p < 0.001). Over the next 12 months of KD exposure, the 25-OHD levels steadily declined (p < 0.001), while 1,25-OHD and PTH were not significantly changed. Conclusions: Children with intractable epilepsy treated with newer AED had poor vitamin D intake and blood levels. KD therapy with vitamin D supplementation improved vitamin D status; however, over the next 12 months of KD therapy a decline in 25-OHD was observed.

Carney, 1 Zhao Liu, 1 Debbie Ringdahl, 1 Kelly Winger, 1 Crystal Jackson, 2 Thameshwarie Singh, 2 Lauren E. Little, and 2 Peggy R. Borum ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 2 Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Ketogenic Therapy (KT) is a treatment for intractable epilepsy that is designed to mimic metabolism during starvation. Although KT has been practiced for many decades, the guidelines for practice have often been communicated orally and based on personal experience. Subjective measurements of seizure increase or decrease and of antiepileptic drug (AED) requirements are usually used. The goal of our project was to develop an evidence based KT program for treatment of epilepsy. Methods: A review of the literature on KT over the past decade was conducted and an evidence grading system was used to document current practice. A retrospective database was developed to evaluate KT provided at our center for the past decade. There are currently 184 current and non-current patients in the retrospective database of which 95 are males and 89 are females. The average age at initiation was 7.1 ± 4.9 years old and the average time on diet from non-current patients (n = 133) was 17.7 ± 18.9 months. Patient tracking forms for pre-initiation, initiation, post-initiation, and termination of KT were created. Systems for quantifying and tracking seizures and medications were created to evaluate patients' progress on KT. This includes Clinic Seizure Score (CSS), Daily Diary Seizure Score (DDSS), and a Medication Score (MS). The CSS is dependant upon the caregiver's recollection at clinic of seizure activity since the last clinic. The DDSS is based on daily seizure records of the caregiver and used to track the total amount of seizure activity between clinic visits. The MS allows us to evaluate both the total number and dosage of all the AEDs that a patient is taking based on their age and weight. Results: The evidence based guidelines have been created by the University of Florida Pediatric Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. For initiation, pre-therapy records are collected and the patient comes in after an overnight fast and starts on a 1.5:1 ratio at full calories which is then increased by 0.5 every other meal for oral feeders and every day for tube feeders. During post-initiation, parents document daily ketones, specific gravity, and seizure activity as well as dietary intake for 24 hours per week. Patients are monitored using the CSS, DDSS, MS as well as the following lab parameters: comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, lipid profile, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and acylcarnitine profile. Data from the patient tracking forms are entered in a prospective database on a weekly basis. Conclusions: The data obtained from the databases will allow us to evaluate and expand the evidence based KG guidelines for optimal administration and monitoring of patients throughout KT. 1 Jessica A. Yankura, 1 Amy French, 1 Michael A. Rogawski, 2 Adam Hartman, and 1 Maciej Gasior ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ; and 2 Pediatric Epilepsy Center, John Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Anticonvulsant effects of the ketogenic diet seem dependent on high fat and low carbohydrate availability that results in the development of ketosis along with a modest reduction in serum glucose levels. However, it remains unclear if low glucose levels alone can decrease neuronal excitability and have anticonvulsant effects. Glucose depletion attenuates seizure activity in in vitro models whereas both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects have been reported in in vivo models (1,2). In the present study we sought to clarify the influence of glucose in regulating seizure susceptibility in vivo by simulating glucose deprivation with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a structural analog of glucose that does not undergo glycolysis. Methods: Anticonvulsant effects of 2-DG were assessed in amygdala-kindled rats and in Swiss mice in the intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and kainic acid models, and in the electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) and 6 Hz models. 2-DG (125 ? 500 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before seizure testing. Results: In amygdala-kindled rats, 2-DG had no effect on afterdischarge threshold, afterdischarge duration, behavioral seizure score and behavioral seizure duration. In mice, administration of 2-DG had no effect on seizure threshold in the PTZ test and was slightly proconvulsant in the kainic acid model. It had no effect on ECT. Only in the 6 Hz seizure test did 2-DG cause a small, yet significant, dose-dependent elevation in seizure threshold. Conclusions: In contrast to a prior study using olfactory bulb and perforant path kindling (2), we did not find 2-DG to have potent anticonvulsant efficacy in the various in vivo seizure models we studied. Our findings suggest that low glucose availability plays a limited role in the seizure protection conferred by the ketogenic diet. 1 Kirchner, A., Veliskova, J.  and 2 Neurological Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: This study examined the long-term (10 years+) psychosocial outcomes of a consecutive series of patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) compared with a group of medically managed patients. These same individuals were initially assessed in 1999 (mean 5 years follow-up) (Jones et al., 2002). This second follow-up interview occurred 6 years later in 2005. The primary focus of this study was to examine the changes maintained in actual life performance after surgery in the following areas: employment, independent living, driving and financial independence. Self-reported quality of life was also assessed. Additionally, during this second follow-up interview questions pertaining to the presence or absence of mood and anxiety disorders were included. Methods: The sample consisted of 57 adults who underwent ATL and 18 controls that were evaluated for surgery during the same time period as those who had surgery. However, the medically managed group did not have surgery and continued to receive medical management. Participants were interviewed 8?15 years after surgery or presurgical evaluation. A structured clinical interview was conducted to obtain information regarding seizure frequency and psychosocial status. Seizure frequency was evaluated for the number seizures in the year prior to the interview and number of seizures since the initial follow-up interview in 1999. Results: As indicated in the initial follow-up evaluation in 1999, significant differences in psychosocial outcomes were maintained between the surgical and medical management groups (p < .001). Favorable psychosocial outcomes were significantly more common in surgical participants (50.9%) than medically managed patients (11.1%). Individuals in the surgery group were more likely to be employed (70.2% v. 44.4%), driving (77.2% v.33.3%), living independently (80.7% v. 44.4%) and financially independent (80.7% v. 44.4%). Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of self reported quality of life. In terms of seizure frequency, 71.9% of the surgery group was seizure free in the past year compared to 27.8% in the medically managed group. Since 1999, 50.4% of participants in the surgery group have remained seizure free. Among the two groups 15.8% of the surgery participants reported a diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder in the past year compared to 17.6% in the medically managed group. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions: Surgery appears to be associated with the long-term maintenance of favorable psychosocial outcomes at a very long-term follow-up of 8?15 years after surgery. Rates of employment, driving, independent living and financial independence appear to be positively influenced by surgery. Seizure freedom and reduced seizure frequency appear to be a significant long term outcome of surgery. 1 Christine M. Bower, 1 Eric M. Cheng, 2 Susan S. Spencer, 1 Stefanie Vassar, and 1 Barbara G. Vickrey ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA ; 2 Department of Neurology, Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Although the clinical goal of resective epilepsy surgery is seizure freedom, patients may have a wide set of expectations for this invasive procedure. This study's goals were to assess the nature, range, and frequency of preoperative expectations for resective epilepsy surgery, and to explore whether expectations vary across patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: 396 adults and adolescents with refractory epilepsy were enrolled in a seven-center cohort study and underwent resective surgery. During baseline interviews, patients responded to open-ended questions about expectations for surgery. Investigators reviewed text responses and identified a preliminary set of expectation themes. Each text response was placed on a card, then ?sorted? into piles representing distinct themes (expectations) by consensus of three investigators. Differences in the frequencies for which each expectation theme was identified were explored across gender, ethnicity, education, whether temporal or extratemporal lobe epilepsy, and side of surgery, using chi-square. Results: Among 391 respondents, nine unique expectations themes were identified by >15% of the sample: driving (n = 241, 61.6%); job/school (n = 166, 42.5%); independence (n = 115, 29.4%); seizure cessation (n = 100, 25.6%); social functioning (n = 90, 23.0%); quality of life (n = 82, 21%); medication discontinuance (n = 78, 20.0%); physical activities (n = 71, 18.2%); and cognition (n = 67, 17.1%). Non-whites and whites differed on 3 of 9 expectation themes: non-whites (n = 72, 18% of sample) endorsed job/school and cognition more frequently and driving less frequently than did whites (p < 0.03). Respondents with a higher level of education (n = 95, 24% of sample with bachelor's degree or higher) endorsed cognition more frequently than those with less education (p < 0.003). Subjects with a right-sided resection (n = 190, 49% of sample) endorsed social functioning more frequently than those with a left-sided resection (p < 0.05). There were no differences in expectations by gender or temporal versus extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Conclusions: Patients awaiting resective epilepsy surgery have definable expectations for surgery, the most predominant of which are driving and employment/educational attainment. While the majority of these expectations were similar across a range of patient characteristics, there were differences on one-third of the most frequently reported expectations by ethnicity. Future studies are needed to explore these potential sociodemographic differences, and to understand how expectations may aide in the clinical decision-making process of resective epilepsy surgery.

A previous study with a small number of patients found out that up to 20% of those patients may eventually become seizure free (Selwa et al, 2003). This information is essential to counsel patients attended in a surgical programme. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review and telephone survey on all patients who had undergone presurgical evaluation at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) of Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain) from 1995 until 2004, but did not undergo epilepsy surgery afterwards, either because they were not considered to be good surgical candidates or because the patient declined surgery. We inquired about current seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug treatment, overall impression of change, quality of life, marital and laboral situation. Results: From a total of 167 telephone calls, we finally contacted 80 patients who agreed to answer the survey. Of them, only 7 patients (9.3%) were currently seizure free, with a mean seizure free period of 3 years (2?6). Seizure freedom was associated with use of new AEDs in 2/7 patients. Five patients (6.2%) had died, with death being possibly related to seizures (SUDEP or CRA during prolonged seizures) in all of them. Among those patients who were not seizure free, the vast majority (89%) reported that their seizure frequency was either the same or lower than at the time of presurgical evaluation. No significant differences were found between seizure free and not seizure free patients respect to the type of epilepsy, etiology, presence of a lesion on the MRI and reason not to have surgery. Overall, 54% of all patients interviewed reported feeling better and more satisfied with their lives than when they were admitted to the EMU. Although most patients did not report changes in their marital or laboral status, a higher proportion of patients in the seizure free group (71%) were actively working, compared to 32% of patients in the group with continued seizures. Conclusions: A small percentage (9.3%) of patients with refractory epilepsy who undergo presurgical evaluation but not epilepsy surgery may eventually become seizure free on drugs. Up to 6% of patients may die as a consequence of their epilepsy. In patients who do not become seizure free, seizure frequency will be, in general, similar or lower with time, and up to 50% of patients will report feeling better and more satisfied with their lives than at the moment of presurgical evaluation.

Methods: We studied a total of 544 patients with acute SAH treated with clipping (444), detachable coil embolization (37), and conservative treatment (67) at Nakamura memorial hospital between 1998 and 2004. The age ranged from 26 to 92 years old (mean 60 years old). We characterized seizures following SAH and compared risk factors of seizures between seizure group and non-seizure group. Results: Sixty-seven (12%) patients had seizures (seizure group) 58 (87%) in clipping, 7 (10%) in embolism, and 2(3%) in conservative treatment. Other 477 (88%) patients had no seizure history for 7 years follow-up (non-seizure group). Thirty (44%) of 67 patients presented seizure within 24 hours following SAH (acute onset), and 37 patients (56%) after 24 hours (late onset). Sudden generalized convulsions occurred in 27 (90%) patients in the acute onset group. Focal seizures occurred in 31 (84%) patients in the late onset group. Two (7%) patients had following epileptic seizure disorders in the acute onset group and 11 (30%) in the late onset group. Thirty-one (46%) of 67 patients in seizure group resulted in good prognosis (modified Rankin Scale0?2) and 320 (65%) of 477 patients in non-seizure group (p < 0.05) Seizure group showed more than three times higher rate of symptomatic hydrocephalus, 34(51%):76(16%); infarction due to vasospasm, 18(27%):41(9%); and other co-morbidities, 34(51%):48(10%); compared with those of non-seizure group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Seizure group revealed worse prognosis and more correlated with hydrocephalus, vasospasms and co-morbidities than non-seizure group. Seizures following SAH characterized generalized convulsions at acute onset, and focal seizures at late onset. The late onset seizure group tended to develop epileptic seizure disorders compared with acute onset seizure group. 1,2,3 Luciana L. D?Alessio, 3 Juan José J.J. López-Costa, 1 Hector H. Konopka, 1 Damián D. Consalvo, 1 Eduardo E. Seoane, 2 Laura L. Guelman, 1,3 Silvia S. Kochen, and 2 Luis María L.M. Zieher ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Ramos Mejía Hospital, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ; 2 Pharmacology Department, Medicine, Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ; and 3 CONICET, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ) Rationale: Nitric oxide (NO) is a short lived free radical with diverse functions as a biological messenger molecule, and has been implicated in numerous aspects of the physiology and pathology of the CNS including epilepsy. NO can acts as anticonvulsant or proconvulsant depending on the experimental model and the pharmacological parameters used. There is little information about changes in NO levels in human epileptic brains. Neurons containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) synthesizes NO. The aim of this study is to investigate the anatomical distribution, morphology, optical density and cell sizes of NADPH-d neurons in the temporal cortex of patients with hippocampal sclerosis who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for intractable temporal lobe seizures. Methods: Brain samples of 7 ? 5 ? 5 mm from temporal cortex were obtained from 7 patients was compared with 5 postmortem controls. Samples were fixed and incubated at 37°C in 1 mg/ml of B-NADPH and 0,2 mg/ml of nitroblue tetrazolio. NADPH d activity was measured as distribution of formazan deposits (endproduct of the histochemical reaction). Neuronal area and neuropil staining optical density was determined. Results: Sprouting (dendritic arborization) and larger NADPH-d positive neurons, with an increase in staining intensity were found in epileptic?s temporal cortex (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The increased area and the observed morphological changes in NADPH-d reactive cells found in this study indicate plastic changes and suggest an up-regulation in NO system in the neocortex. These changes could contribute to abnormal cortical excitability however, could also be involved in adaptative neuroprotective function. 1,2 Alaa Hassan, 1 Heinz Pannek, 1 Friedrich Behne, 1 Reinhard Schulz, 2 Mohammed Nayel, 2 Ahmed Issa, and 1 Alois Ebner ( 1 Preoperative Evaluation, Epilepsy Center Bethel, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cairo University, Cairo, Cairo, Egypt ) Rationale: To evaluate the long-term seizure outcome of 15 years of extratemporal neocortical epilepsy surgery of adults in the Bethel Epilepsy Center comparing the outcome between patients operated in three consecutive 5-year periods. Methods: Between 1991 and 2006, 221 adult patients with extratemporal drug resistant epilepsies were operated on. From 221 patients 28 patients (12.6%) had more than one operation, five patients (2.6%) received VNS. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of all patients. Patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis and those who only had a biopsy were excluded. Data was gathered by reviewing hospital files, outpatient reports, two-year in-patient postoperative follow-up results, and using mail and telephone questionnaires. Three patients were not available for review, six patients died, and in ten patients data was incomplete. Patients were divided into three groups, depending on the time of operation: group 1 (1991?1995), group 2 (1995?2000), and group 3 (2000?2005). Results: Group 1: (54 patients, 24.4%) mean age of patients at seizure onset in years 10.6 ± 8.8 (range 1?41), mean age at surgery 28.13 ± 10.3 (range 16?57), mean duration of epilepsy 17.4 ± 9.7 (range 1 to 38), mean duration of follow-up 11.4 ± 2.09 (range 1 to 14); outcome class 1 at the 6-month follow-up (47.0%), after 1 year (48.5%), 2 years (45.5%), 5 years (46.6%). Group 2: (90 patients, 40.7%), mean age at seizure onset 13.4 ± 10.4 (range 0.8?52), mean age at surgery 28.02 ± 10.1 (range 16?59), mean duration of epilepsy 15.6 ± 9.2 (range 0?44), mean duration of follow-up 7.6 ± 1.6 (range 2?10 yrs); outcome class 1 at the follow-up after 6 months (53.4%), 1 year (50.0%), 2 years (50.0%), 5 years (53.7%). Group 3: (77 patients, 34.4%) mean age at seizure onset 16.8 ± 15.0 (range 0.4?65), mean age at surgery 31.1 ± 13.1 (range 16?69), mean duration of epilepsy 14.2 ± 13.2 (range 0?64), mean duration of follow-up 2.6 ± 1.5 (range 0.5?5 yrs); outcome class 1 at the follow-up after 6 months (63.5%), 1 year (57.1%), 2 years (61.9%), 5 years (57.9%). A statistically significant difference was only found in the the 2-year outcome group (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The comparison of postoperative seizure outcome of extratemporal epilepsy surgery in adults over the last 15 years shows mixed results. A statistically significant improvement was seen only in the two-year postoperative outcome whereas at other points in time there was a tendency for improvement. 1,3 Frederick A. Schmitt, 2 Curtis A. Given, 1 Meriem K. Bensalem-Owen, 1 Michelle L. Mattingly, and 1 Toufic A. Fakhoury ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ; 2 Department of Radiology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ; and 3 Sanders Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ) Rationale: Presurgical evaluation of language and memory using the internal carotid WADA (ICAW) procedure is a standard approach for patients with medically intractable epilepsy. However, ICAW results often provide equivocal memory data, especially in cases with a dominant hemisphere seizure focus, as a result of aphasia with amytal injection. Therefore, selective preoperative intracarotid amytal procedures (IAP) have been developed to target hippocampal functions. Several variations of the selective IAP have been reported and include selective injections of amytal into: (1) anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and (2) posterior cerebral artery (PCA). This report focuses on a clinical series of patients who had selective amytal injections through the internal carotid artery (ICA) with temporary balloon catheter occlusion of the distal ICA beyond the AchA origin. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with intractable epilepsy were evaluated using the distal ICA occlusion approach. Three patients underwent selective procedures for both hemispheres while the remaining 24 had selective injections targeting the hippocampus in the affected hemisphere along with a standard IAP of the contralateral hemisphere. Of these patients, 7 (26%) had previously ?failed? standard IAP injections given generalized anesthetic effects on the dominant hemisphere. Memory and language were evaluated in all patients using a modified McGill protocol that required learning of 3 visual objects and 3 verbal items after selective amytal injection. Subsequent free and cued recall of these items along with recognition was completed after resolution of the patient's homonymous hemianopsia. Results: All patients demonstrated homonymous hemianopsia with the selective injection and 78% showed brief temporal slowing on EEG ipsilateral to the injected hemisphere. Evaluation of memory showed encoding specific effects on memory items for 78% of cases where selective left-sided injection resulted in proportionally poorer recall of verbally encoded items. In the 3 right-sided selective IAPs, no memory encoding effects were observed. This ?selective? memory effect was independent of the presence of temporal slowing on EEG. Conclusions: Selective WADA procedures targeting the hippocampus through temporary occlusion of the supra-clinoidal ICA and injection through the AchA can be an effective tool in the presurgical evaluation of patients when evaluating information on memory preservation post surgical resection of a seizure focus. Further, selective WADA procedures generally show memory effects that are consistent with the verbal or visual presentation mode of the memory items used in IAP assessments. 1 Georges A. Ghacibeh, 1 Jeffrey Smith, 1 Keyur Patel, 1 Sandeep Konka, and 1 Stephan Eisenschenk ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Patients with mesiotemporal epilepsy have a better chance of achieving seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery than those with neocortical epilepsy. The risk of seizure recurrence depends on several factors. Previous studies revealed that interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) on post-operative EEG did not predict the risk of seizure recurrence. However, it is not known whether there is a difference based on the type of surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the relationship between IEA on post-operative EEG and seizure recurrence after epilepsy surgery is different in patients who underwent neocortical and mesiotemporal resections. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the electronic medical records of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program of the University of Florida between January 1997 and December 2002. Post-operative follow-up clinic notes were reviewed up to the last clinic note to determine the recurrence of seizures. EEG reports of the post-operative EEG were reviewed to assess for the presence of IEA. Epileptiform abnormalities were defined as frank spikes or sharp waves or electrographic seizures. Results: A total of 94 patients who had both adequate clinic follow-up and post-operative EEGs were identified. EEGs were performed on average 106 days after surgery and patients were followed in clinic on average 32 months after surgery. Seventy patients had mesiotemporal resections. Of those, 16 (23%) had IEA on their EEGs and 22 (31%) had seizure recurrence. A chi-square test revealed no significant relationship between seizure recurrence and the presence of IEA. Twenty four patients had neocortical resections. Of those, 14 (58%) had IEA and 12 (50%) had seizure recurrence. A chi-square test revealed a significant relationship between the presence of IEA and seizure recurrence (p = 0.013). However, 14 out of the 22 mesiotemporal and 8 out of the 12 neocortical surgery patients had seizure recurrence within 3 months after surgery, prior to the post-operative EEG. Conclusions: This study revealed that epileptiform activity on early post-operative EEG correlate with seizure recurrence in neocortical but not mesiotemporal surgeries. However, since most patients have seizure recurrence within three months after surgery, evaluation of the utility of earlier EEG is needed. 1 Ryder P. Gwinn, 1 John Morgan, 1 Lisa Caylor, 1 Alan Haltiner, 1 Laura Allen, and 1 Michael Doherty ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Seattle Neuroscience Institute, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Hippocampal depth electrodes are useful in lateralizing and localizing medial temporal lobe seizures. Historically these have been placed either orthogonally or transversely using frame based or frameless stereotaxy. This method can provide quality electrical recordings of hippocampal activity, but is a blind procedure with inherent risks and limitations including bleeding, hippocampal injury, inconsistent hippocampal orientation, and incomplete sampling. We report the placement of ventricular depth electrodes under framless stereotactic and neuro-endoscopic guidance using direct visualization to assure safe and consistent placement of hippocampal recording electrodes, with quality recordings leading to successful seizure localization. Methods: Frameless stereotactic navigation (Steath Treon Plus, Medtronic) was used to guide occipito-parietal burr hole placement and endoscope trajectory. A neuro-endoscope (Channel? Neuroendoscope, Medtronic) was placed into the atria of the lateral ventricle, then guided down the temporal horn under direct visualization. A 10 contact, 5 mm spacing depth electrode (Ad-tech, Racine WI) was passed through the endoscope with 1 ? 2 contacts placed into the temporal pole. The endoscope was then removed using flouroscopy to verify stable electrode position. Electrode position was verified by co-registration of post-operative CT scan to pre-operative MRI in all patients. Results: Eleven ventricular electrodes were placed in 6 patients undergoing surgery for intracranial localization of partial seizures. Successful navigation of the temporal horn was achieved in all patients, and electrodes were verified to be touching the hippocampus in all patients visually and by post-operative imaging. No infection, neurologic injury, or post-operative hemorrhage was seen. Quality recordings were obtained from all electrodes, and seizure onsets were documented in 7/11 electrodes, with reversal potentials seen along the hippocampus using a bipolar montage. Two patients underwent anteromedial temporal resection 6 weeks post-implantation, with pathology showing gliosis adjacent to the electrode location. Conclusions: Electrocorticography may be performed using depth electrodes placed in the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Placement of temporal horn electrodes under direct neuro-endoscopic visualization can be performed safely, and provide high quality recordings of hippocampal activity without significant injury to the structure. Temporal horn electrodes are situated in a predictable anatomical relationship to hippocampal structures for reproducible recordings from the same hippocampal subfields between patients. Neuro-endoscopically placed ventricular electrodes may offer a safe and effective alternative to orthogonal and longitudinal hippocampal electrodes for localization of medial temporal lobe seizures. 1 Jeffery A. Hall ( 1 Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Proponents of tissue-sparing selective temporal resections for patients with mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable epilepsy begrudgingly acknowledge the lack of neuropsychological data demonstrating any related savings with these procedures. Seizure outcome in well-selected patients appears to be equivalent between the more ?selective? and larger traditional temporal lobectomies. One interpretation of why no obvious savings follows from selective resection is that the tissue is somehow rendered dysfunctional by the operation. Alternatively, it may be that we are not adequately probing the function of the spared temporal tissue. Methods: Ten consecutive patients who underwent transcortical (second temporal gyrus) transventricular selective amygdalohippocampectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable epilepsy were examined post-operatively with formal visual field testing. Each patient also had post-operative MRI to demonstrate the extent of resection and exclude complications. These patients were compared to a reference case of intractable non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy operated by the same surgeon. This patient underwent a more radical traditional temporal corticoamygdalohippocampectomy. Pre and post operative visual fields and MRI are available for this patient also. Results: The patient who underwent traditional temporal lobectomy demonstrated the expected homonymous superior quadrantopsia. Patients who underwent the selective procedure demonstrated some evidence of visual field loss, albeit to a lesser extent than that of the reference case. Conclusions: This finding has several important implications the most of salient of which suggests that the selective procedure results in the sparing of viable and functionally important brain tissue. Additionally, these data support the notion from recent studies of MR tractography, that the fibers of Meyer's Loop course further anterior in the temporal lobe than is generally acknowledged.

Tellez-Zenteno, 1 Samuel Wiebe, and 1 Nathalie Jette ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: In recent years, advances in surgical techniques have allowed patients without identifiable neuroimaging abnormalities to undergo epilepsy surgery. However, there is a notion that patients with normal MRI or histopathology may have worse surgical outcomes than those with lesional epilepsy. The objective of this study is to provide evidence-based estimates of the surgical outcome in patients with non-lesional epilepsy and to identify sources of results variation between published studies Methods: Medline, Index Medicus, bibliographies of reviews, original articles, and book chapters were searched to identify published articles since 1991, describing outcomes in ≥5 patients of any age who underwent resective or non-resective epilepsy surgery without an identifiable structural lesion by imaging or histopathology. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Results: Twenty-nine articles fulfilled eligibility criteria and described outcomes in 655 patients with non-lesional epilepsy surgery. Non-lesional status was defined by MRI in 56% of studies and by histopathology in 44%. Overall, 24% of patients described were non-lesional. The median proportion of seizure-free patients was 44% (95% CI 39?49) in non-lesional cases vs. 61% (95% CI 58?64) in those with lesions. The corresponding proportion was 46% (95% CI 39?53) if non-lesional status was defined by MRI, versus 42% (95% CI 35?49) if defined by histopathology. In non-lesional patients with temporal lobe surgery, 40% (95% CI 33?46) were seizure free. We explore aspects related to the validity of these results. Conclusions: Overall, non-lesional epilepsy surgery has inferior results compared with lesional cases (44% vs 61% respectively). The response after surgery was the same whether lesional status was defined using MRI or histopathology. Sources of heterogeneity are explored. 1 Hyeon-Seob Byeon, 1 Seung-Chul Hong, 1 Jong-Su Kim, 1 Jung-Il Lee, 1 Jong-Hyun Kim, 1 Do-Hyun Nam, and 2 Dae Won Seo ( 1 Neurosurgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: To compare seizure outcome in the patients with cavernous angioma treated by lesionectomy alone or further resection and to analyze the factors influencing on the surgical outcome. Methods: Fifty-nine patients (27 male) with supratentorial cavernous angioma associate with seizure were operated in our institute. Clinical, radiological and electrophysiologic data were collected retrospectively. The mean age was 32 years (ranged 2?67) and the mean follow up duration after surgery was 34.3 months (ranged 12?103). Results: Thirty-two patients underwent lesionectomy and remaining 27 patients underwent standard temporal lobectomy with tumor removal. Seizure outcome was compared using the Engel classification scheme between two kinds of technique. At the last follow up, 33 patients were involved in Engel class I, 6 patients in class II, 4 patients in class III and 2 patients were class IV. Estimated survival in patients who had shorter seizure histories and fewer preoperative seizures did not differ between the two surgical techniques. The important factors influencing the outcome were duration of seizure, location of tumor, multiple epileptic foci on electroencephalogram and surgical technique. Conclusions: These findings indicated that shorter seizure histories and fewer preoperative seizures can be effectively treated by lesionectomy alone, whereas those with longer histories and more seizures are not effectively treated by this procedure and may require epileptic surgery. And early surgical intervention is important for good treatment outcome. 1 Hariprasad Kunhiveedu, 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 1 Stephan U. Schüle, and 1 Richard C. Burgess ( 1 Department of Neurology, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Prediction of ictal onset zone by subdural interictal spike pattern has rarely been analyzed. The objective of our study was to analyze the relationship between interictal spikes and ictal onset zones on subdural EEG recordings. Methods: Fifteen patients (aged 25 to 61 years) undergoing prolonged subdural intracranial EEG recordings were included. On average 92 electrodes (range 42 to 119) were implanted. Representative interictal and ictal EEG recordings were reviewed. Interictal spike populations were identified by voltage from baseline, earliest onset, frequency of the spike population, presence of an aftergoing slow wave and duration. Distribution of the interictal activity was defined as 80% fall-off from the maximum. The electrodes with the earliest rhythmic evolution determined the ictal onset. The relationship between interictal EEG and ictal onset electrodes was analyzed. Results: Interictal spikes were seen from a discrete single focus in five patients, from two different foci in six patients and were multifocal or diffuse in four patients. Ictal onset was seen from circumscribed areas in 14 patients and was diffuse in one patient. Cases with more than one spiking pattern were not associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes. Single EEG seizure patterns were recorded in eight patients. In five patients two different EEG seizure patterns were recorded, one patient had three different EEG seizure patterns and one additional patient had five different EEG seizure patterns. Interestingly, cases with more than one subdural EEG seizure pattern were associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes (p < 0.05). In eight patients (53%) the most frequent spike focus was concordant with a subdural EEG seizure onset zone. Six out of these eight patients presented with only one subdural EEG seizure type. One of these eight patients presented with very broad spikes, but their maximum was concordant with the ictal onset zone. In three additional patients (20%) the most frequent or second most frequent spike population occurred one or two electrodes (1?2 cm) adjacent to a seizure onset zone. In three patients diffuse spiking was seen whereas the seizure onset was focal. One patient had diffuse seizure onset with focal spikes. Conclusions: Ictal onset zones on subdural EEG recordings were related to the most frequent subdural interictal spike focus in 53% of cases. After inclusion of the second most frequent spike focus and surrounding electrodes, an ictal onset zones could be predicted in 73% by interictal spiking. However, not all ictal onset zones were predicted by the interictal spike focus, in particular if a patient presented with more than one ictal onset zone. Interestingly, a higher number of implanted electrodes and a higher number of recorded ictal onset zones may be related. Analysis of interictal subdural EEG may be helpful in the prediction of the ictal onset zone. 1 Addolorata Mascia, 1 Antonio Sparano, 1 Vincenzo Esposito, 1 Sergio Paolini, 1 Roberta Morace, 1 Giancarlo Di Gennaro, and 1 Pier Paolo Quarato ( 1 Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; and Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy ) Rationale: To determine the potential effectiveness and tolerability of levitiracetam (Lev) versus oxacarbazepine (Oxc) versus placebo in preventing early postoperative seizures in patients undergoing brain surgery for mass lesions. Methods: 30 patients requiring elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain mass lesions were randomized to three groups of equal size, with a prospective, open-label, controlled design. One group receveid Lev (13.3?40 mg/kg/die) the other group receveid Oxc (18?20 mg/kg/die), the third group receveid placebo. In all the three groups the drug administration were oral with a titration performed within the 30 days preceding surgery. Early postoperative seizures (seizures occurring in the 7 days following surgery) were considered for the purpose of the study. Patients having chronic epilepsy were not included. On the contrary, heralding seizures were not considered as esclusion criterion Results: Early post-operative seizures were observed in all three groups. Patients taking Lev or Oxc showed less seizures than patients taking placebo. Conclusions: In our study Lev and Oxc seemed to be similarly effective in preventing early seizures after brain surgery. Both the drugs showed a good profile of tolerability and all patients remaining on each treatment during all the duration of the study. 1 Shearwood McClelland III, 2 Rebeca E. Garcia, 3 Daniel M. Peraza, 4 Tina T. Shih, 5 Lawrence J. Hirsch, 3 Joy Hirsch, and 2 Robert R. Goodman ( 1 Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; 2 Neurological Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ; 3 Radiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ; 4 Neurology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ; and 5 Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ) Rationale: The nondominant amygdala is crucial for processing facial expression and emotional recognition (ER) of visual stimuli, particularly in facial fear recognition. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) often incur amygdalar and hippocampal damage. Previous studies have shown that patients with right-sided (nondominant) MTS experience impaired ER if TLE onset occurred before age six. This finding has resulted in the hypothesis that early right mesiotemporal insult impairs plasticity, resulting in ER deficits, while damage later in life (seizure onset after age five) results in no deficit. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a uniformly seizure-free postsurgical population. This study was performed to examine this issue in late-onset postsurgical patients. Methods: Controls (n = 10) and late-onset patients (n = 5) were recruited. All patients underwent nondominant anteromedial temporal lobectomy (AMTL), had TLE onset after age five, Wada-confirmed left-hemisphere language dominance and memory support, MTS on both pre-operative MRI and biopsy, and were Engel class I five years after surgery. Using a standardized (Ekman and Friesen) human face series depicting neutrality and the six basic emotions conveyed by facial expression (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise), subjects were asked to match the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face. Target faces expressed fear, anger, or happiness. Results: Statistical analysis (t-test) revealed that the late-onset group had ER (as measured by percentage of faces correct and reaction time) for fear (p = 0.871), anger (p = 0.256), and happiness (p = 0.608) comparable to controls. All 95% confidence intervals included zero. Conclusions: Following curative AMTL in nondominant MTS patients, TLE onset after age five does not predict significant ER impairment for facial expressions. Future studies are needed to examine whether early TLE onset continues to impair ER following AMTL. 1 Pradeep Modur, and 2 Warren Milteer ( 1 Neurology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY ; and 2 Hazelwood Center, Louisville, KY ) Rationale: To investigate the impact of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy in institutionalized patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) with respect to emergency room (ER) utilization for seizures. Methods: We identified patients with LGS from a retrospective chart review of 98 institutionalized patients with epilepsy. LGS was defined when all of the following criteria were met: mental retardation; multiple seizure types; frequent seizures refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); and prolonged video-EEG monitoring showing 2 of these 5 findings ? slow spike-wave discharges, generalized fast activity, multifocal (≥3 sites) epileptiform discharges, tonic seizures and atypical absence seizures. The institution's protocol specified administration of intrarectal diazepam (Diastat) for seizures or seizure clusters lasting >3 minutes, and transfer to an ER if seizures persisted >10 minutes. Because of frequent seizure clusters in this population, the number of days with documented seizures was counted instead of the actual number of seizures. The comparator group consisted of patients without VNS (non-VNS group) followed over a period of 18 months. The intervention group consisted of those with VNS, and were analyzed in two periods: 6 months before and 6 months after implantation. The primary outcome measure was the number of seizure-related ER visits in the VNS group before and after implantation. Secondary outcome measures were the number of seizure days and the number of Diastat administrations in the VNS group during the same periods. Fixed effects poisson model and poisson regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: There were 9 patients with LGS, and 4 of them had been implanted with VNS. In the non-VNS group, there were 5 patients (3 males), aged 24?53 years. In the VNS group of 4 patients (2 males) aged 25?56 years, the age at implantation was 22?53 years. Compared to non-VNS patients, the VNS patients before implantation had significantly higher Diastat administrations (p < 0.0005) and ER visits (p < 0.0005) but not seizure days (p = 0.06). In the VNS group, during 6 months of follow-up after implantation, the ER visits reduced significantly (10 versus 2, p = 0.04), the number of seizure days reduced minimally (107 versus 99, p = 0.58) while the number of Diastat administrations increased slightly (36 versus 50, p = 0.13). Conclusions: In a group of institutionalized LGS patients more prone to ER visits, VNS therapy significantly reduced the number of ER visits. The observed trend towards an increase in the administration of Diastat after VNS implantation suggests that the favorable outcome with respect to ER visits may be related to the combined effect of VNS and Diastat in reducing the duration of seizures or seizure clusters. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this and evaluate other potential factors such as VNS parameters and concomitant AEDs influencing this outcome.

Brick, 1 Warren Boling, 1 Alexander Torres-Trejo, and 1 Daunice Lohr ( 1 Neurology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV; and Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: The last few years have seen an increased interest in mechanisms regulating body weight. At hippocampal level, obesity can be viewed as the result of an imbalance between the tendency to seek a reward (food) and learned inhibitory processes. Our objective was to investigate the relation between removal of different brain structures and the development of postoperative eating disorder resulting in weight gain. Methods: In order to identify significant differences in weight changes, two groups of patients with intractable epilepsy were studied: patients with medically refractory partial seizures status post amygdalohippocampectomy (n = 25) and patients with extratemporal epilepsy who underwent surgery for the same condition (n = 18). BMI was calculated at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following surgery. Differences between the two groups were analyzed. The two groups were comparable for control of postoperative seizure, medications, age, gender and co-morbidities. Results: Postoperatively, a significant difference in weight, consisting of weight gain was observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy following the amygdalectomy compared to patients undergoing extratemporal surgery. Conclusions: Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that the amygdala plays a role in eating behavior. This might involve complex neuronal circuits controlling behaviors like rewards, learning and memory formation. This finding supports a possible role for amygdala in eating disorders and challenges the traditional idea of eating disorders associated with hypothalamic disturbances. 1 Dimitris G.

Schwartz ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY ; 2 Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY ; and 3 Neurology, New York Hospital of Queens, Flushing, NY ) Rationale: Medically refractory epilepsy is amenable to neurosurgical intervention if the epileptogenic focus can be accurately localized. In some situations, the scalp EEG and MRI are discordant and/or non-lateralizing, yet the clinician is still highly suspicious that a single focus exists, either based on a dominant interictal focus or stereotypical semiology. In these situations, a bilateral intracranial survey can be helpful to lateralize the ictal onset zone. The risks and success of such bilateral surveys have not been well described. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with refractory seizures treated over a 4-year period. Patients underwent bilateral placement of subdural strip electrodes and, in 50% of cases, stereotactic implantation of depth electrodes into the mesial temporal lobes. In all cases the MRI scans and scalp EEG were not sufficiently concordant to lateralize seizure onsets. The mean age was 35.1 years and 75% of patients were male. Results: Patients were electrophysiologically monitored for an average of 7.4 days. Thirty-five percent (n = 7) subsequently underwent unilateral implantation of electrodes to more accurately localize the seizure focus. Sixty percent (n = 12) eventually underwent a therapeutic procedure. Of those, 58.3% underwent resection of epileptogenic foci without unilateral invasive mapping. Reasons for no further surgery (n = 8) included failing the WADA (37.5%), multifocal onsets (25%), refusal of further treatment (12.5%) and negative intraoperative ECoG (12.5%). There was 1 complication, involving a retained electrode fragment that was removed in a separate minor procedure. Of the surgically treated patients, 58.3% have no seizures currently, 16.7% have improved and 25% remain unchanged. Conclusions: Bilateral placement of subdural strip and depth electrodes to survey the cortex in patients with non-lateralizing scalp video-EEG and MRI but clinical suspicion for localized epilepsy is both safe and effective. Of those patients who go on to a therapeutic procedure, 75% are either improved or seizure-free. 1 Fabio Sebastiano, 1 Pier Paolo Quarato, 1 Vincenzo Esposito, 1 Angelo Picardi, 1 Antonio Sparano, 1 Addolorata Mascia, 1 Mario Manfredi, and 1 Giancarlo Di Gennaro ( 1 Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Pozzilli, Isernia, Rome, Italy; Center of Epidemiology and Health Surveillance and Promotion, Italian National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy, Rome, Lazio, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurology, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Pozzilli, Isernia, Rome, Italy; and Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy ) Rationale: To evaluate a novel method for localization of subdural electrodes in presurgical assessment of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Electrodes were detected on post-implantation brain CT scans through a semiautomated procedure based on a MATLAB routine. Then, post-implantation CT scans were fused with pre-implantation MRI to localize the electrodes in relation to the underlying cortical structures. Two independent raters tested the reliability of this procedure by comparing 3D-rendered MR images of the electrodes with electrode position as determined by intraoperative digital photography. Results: In each patient, all electrodes could be correctly localized and visualized in a stereotactic space, thus allowing optimal surgery planning. For both raters, the agreement between the procedure-generated images and the digital photographs was good in all patients. Conclusions: While our findings need confirmation on larger samples including patients with anterior epilepsy, this procedure allowed to localize subdural electrodes and to establish the spatial relationship of each electrode to the underlying brain structure, either normal or damaged, on brain convessity, basal and medial cortex. [figure 1] 1,2 Marianna V. Spanaki, 3 Kost V. Elisevich, and 1 Brien J. Smith ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ; 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery is considered to be the most effective treatment in refractory epilepsy with seizure free outcomes from 45% to 67.9% (Engel J. Surgery for seizures. N Engl J Med 1996;334:647?652). However, little data exists on the number of older patients who are treated surgically, the post surgical complications and outcome rates in this patient population. Methods: We identified all patients who were 50 years and older and had epilepsy surgery for refractory epilepsy at Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) Epilepsy Program from 1994 to 2005. Data on age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, risk factors, noninvasive and invasive video/EEG monitoring, surgery site, pathology, outcome, and medical conditions at surgery as well as complications were collected through search of the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit admission database and the HFH electronic database (CarePlus). Patients who had tumors that presented with seizures and surgery was performed in the context of tumor treatment were not included. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Thirty five patients from 50 to 70 years old (median age = 55; 19 females) underwent epilepsy surgery at HFH. Duration of epilepsy was from 6 months to 50 years (median = 35 years). Nineteen patients (54%) with inconsistent localization during scalp continuous video EEG monitoring had invasive monitoring with grids, strips and/or depth electrodes. Thirty one patients had temporal resections (16 had left anterior temporal resection), 3 extratemporal and one subpial transection. Pathology revealed mesial temporal sclerosis in 14 patients, heterotopia in 2, dual pathology in 2, cavernous angioma in 2, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor in 1. In the remainder pathology was consistent with various degrees of gliosis or non diagnostic. Duration of follow up ranged from 1 month to 13 years (median follow up = 2 years). One patient was lost to follow up. Twenty five patients (25/34; 73.5%) were seizure free after surgery, 4 of which remained seizure free off antiepileptic medication. Medical history prior to surgery was consistent with hypertension (HTN) in 6 patients, hypercholesterenemia and HTN in 3, diabetes and HTN in 2 and coronary artery disease in 3 (2 of which had previous angioplasty). One patient had right MCA infarct one day after surgery that resulted in mild left hemiparesis. Following surgery, 1 patient developed transient angina and another one pulmonary embolism that was successfully treated. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy in older patient population is a safe treatment and yields seizure freedom outcomes that are comparable to those reported in young patients. Co-morbid conditions and advanced age should not prevent physicians from offering epilepsy surgery to appropriate candidates. 1 K. Meng Tan, 1 Elson L. So, 1 Gregory D. Cascino, 2 Fredric B. Meyer, 2 W. Richard Marsh, and 1 Gregory A. Worrell ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy may be excellent candidates for epilepsy surgery. However, lateralization of the ictal onset zone is not always clear from non-invasive studies. In such cases, bilateral temporal depth electrode implantation may be undertaken prior to considering temporal lobe resection. Although intraoperative pharmacologic activation is known to increase interictal epileptiform discharges on electrocorticography, the clinical relevance of this procedure has not been established. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all epilepsy patients who underwent bilateral temporal depth electrode implantation during the period 1997?2005 and received intraoperative alfentanil activation. We identified ten patients and characterized the data provided by EEG (interictal and ictal), MRI, intraoperative electrocorticography (before and after pharmacologic activation) and subsequent prolonged intracranial EEG monitoring, with respect to localization of the ictal onset zone. We focused on the correlation between pharmacologic activation and lateralization of the epileptogenic temporal lobe as determined by intracranial EEG monitoring. Results: 6 females and 4 males meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Administration of alfentanil intraoperatively caused increased activation of epileptiform discharges bilaterally in 5 patients, and no definite activation in another 3 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, the side of pharmacologic activation did not correspond with the epileptogenic temporal lobe determined on subsequent prolonged intracranial monitoring. Conclusions: Intraoperative pharmacologic activation does not appear to be useful in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy of unclear lateralization. 1 Denise S. Taylor, 1 Heber L. Varela, 1 William O. Tatum, 1 Fernando L. Vale, and 1 Selim R. Benbadis ( 1 Neurology  if non-temporal coverage was performed, patients were excluded. Outcome used Engel's classification. Results: Over a 5-year period, 21 patients underwent bitemporal subdural strips. Out of 1,356 patients monitored, this represents 1.5% of patients. The results for the 21 patients with bitemporal subdural strips evaluation was as follows: ? 11 patients (52%) had clear lateralization (100% of seizures on one side) resulting in a temporal lobectomy: 8 class I, 2 class II, and 1 class III. ? 5 patients had a predominance but less than 100% lateralization. These were offered a temporal lobectomy and presented before surgery as an unlikely seizure free outcome but a probable improvement (?palliative? interventions). 4 patients underwent a lobectomy (2 class III, 2 class IV), and 1 declined. ? 1 patient underwent resection of a large arachnoid cyst that was contralateral to seizure onset (outcome class II). ? 4 patients (19%) had true bitemporal epilepsy without predominance and no resection was performed. Conclusions: Subdural strips achieved lateralization of TLE in about half of cases where the non-invasive evaluation failed to do so. When lateralization was 100% to one side, postoperative outcome was excellent. About 19% had true bitemporal epilepsy. 3 Fuyuki Hirashima, 1 Eric Dinnerstein, 1 Karen L. Gilbert, 2 David W. Roberts, 1 Vijay M. Thadani, and 1 Peter D. Williamson ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Section of Neurosurgery, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; and 3 Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH ) Rationale: We wished to study variables that influence outcome, in terms of seizure control, among patients with mesial temporal sclerosis who undergo surgery. We compared two surgical techniques. Some patients had a standard temporal lobectomy, and others had a selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy. In this retrospective study, we compared the outcomes of these surgical techniques with respect to seizure control. Methods: 61 patients with medically refractory epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (seen on MRI and subsequent pathological examination) were evaluated. The two groups were very similar with regard to age, age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, handedness, risk factors such as febrile seizures, and side of resection. The number of anti-epileptic medications, before and after surgery, was the same in the two groups. 30 patients had a standard temporal lobectomy, and 31 had the more selective procedure. The choice of procedure was arbitrary. Follow-up information was collected at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.38 ± 1.02 years. Outcome was assessed using the Engel classification. Patients were classified as Class I outcomes if they were seizure-free for the previous year. To simplify the statistics, patients in Classes II, III, and IV were pooled. Neuropsychological testing was done before surgery, and 6?12 months after surgery. Results: Class I outcomes ranged from 63% to 96%. A trend towards a difference between the two surgical groups, with more Class I outcomes among those who had the standard procedure, was detected 4 years after surgery (89% vs. 67%), and a statistically significant difference was apparent 5 years after surgery (96% vs. 63%, p < .01). However, if the data were analyzed with Class I defined as seizure-free since surgery, there was no difference between the two groups. Neuropsychological testing did not show a significant difference between the two groups before or after surgery. Conclusions: These data suggest that in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis a better outcome with respect to seizure control may be seen with a wider resection of the anterior-lateral temporal lobe. The difference, if there is one, depends on how a Class I outcome is defined. Roughly the same% of patients in both groups has post-operative seizures; but after several years, a higher% of those who had the wider resection has been seizure-free for at least a year. The clinical significance of this difference is uncertain. 1 Alejandro Torres-Trejo, 1 Adriana Palade, 1 Warren Boling, and 1 John F. Brick ( 1 Neurology, West Virginia Univerisity, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: After epilepsy surgery for cortical dysplasia, a high percentage of patients may remain seizure free. The clinician for various medical reasons may decide to discontinue one or more antiepileptic drugs. It is reasonable to consider discontinuation of the antiepileptic drugs (AED) to perhaps decrease some of the side effects associated with these medications. We would like to identify whether patients will continue to remain seizure free after discontinuation of AED's. Methods: We are reporting five patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for resection of epileptic focus with pathology reported as cortical dysplasia. The seizure focus was localized electrographically. Structures resected include right posterior temporal region, right central sulcus, amygdalohippocampectomy, right frontal lobectomy, and a left parietal region resection. For various medical resons all of the patients had their AED's discontinued between six months to three years. Results: All of these patients remained seizure-free between six months to three years after surgery, but had recurrent seizures after withdrawal of medications was attempted. Conclusions: Patients that had successful epilepsy surgery resecting the epileptic focus due to cortical dysplasia remained seizure free while on AED's but had recurrence of seizures when the medications were discontinued. This suggests that patients with cortical dysplasia may fail AED discontinuation despite having good seizure control postoperatively if the AED's are discontinued before three years. 1 K. Upchurch, 2 J. Stern, 2 R. Staba, 2 C.L. Wilson, 2 J. Engel Jr., and 1 I. Fried ( 1 Neurosurgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: For cases of pharmacologically refractory epilepsy in which data from noninvasive diagnostic studies (Phase I) are discordant with respect to the epileptogenic zone, a hypothesis concerning the location of ictal onset is formulated. On the basis of this hypothesis, patients may undergo invasive tests such as ictal EEG recordings via intracerebral depth electrodes (Phase II). The purpose of this study was to assess clinical outcomes (diagnostic and therapeutic) of invasive chronic depth electrode recording for patients with medically intractable epilepsy in a series of 100 patients who underwent operation by a single surgeon at a single institution. Methods: Using the UCLA Seizure Disorders Center surgical database, the history, operative course, and clinical outcomes of 100 patients with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent implantation of intracerebral depth electrodes at UCLA Medical Center between January 1993 and August 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of the 100 patients reviewed, 54 were males; mean age was 33.2 years; and age range was 12?50 years. All surgeries were performed stereotactically by the same surgeon (I.F.) with pre-operative targeting based on stereotactic cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. The average number of depth electrodes implanted for each patient was 10 (range 6 to 12). In 60/100 patients, a single epileptogenic zone was localized via the first Phase II study; 10/100 underwent a second Phase II study with subdural grids/strips; and 59/100 underwent Phase III resection. Morbidity secondary to intracerebral depth electrode implantation consisted of: (1) small intracerebral hematoma incidentally revealed on post-implant or post-deplant imaging in three asymptomatic patients; (2) contaminant bacteria on either Gram stain or culture on deplanted electrodes in two asymptomatic patients who were clinically without other evidence of infection; and one episode of fever and cerebrospinal fluid pleiocytosis during implantation in one patient whose deplanted electrodes and cerebrospinal fluid showed negative bacterial cultures. Mortality was zero. Conclusions: These data suggest that chronically implanted intracerebral depth electrodes for electrophysiologic recording are safe and continue to be important in patient selection for Phase III epilepsy surgery, despite the emergence of sophisticated noninvasive diagnostic modalities.

Buschman ( 1 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Neurology, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 3 Institute for Neuromodulation (TWIN), Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: VNS-therapy for treatment of patients with medically refractory epilepsy in the Netherlands is part of a continuous quality improvement system. This encompasses the organisatory structure, responsibilities, processes and facilities for carrying out quality care. One of the basic and core elements of a quality system is the systematic monitoring of the process of care via the quality circle. The first outcome results of VNS-therapy in patients with epilepsy within this setting in the Netherlands are presented. Methods: The quality system was developed in a close collaboration with medical specialists from 5 neurosurgery and 5 epilepsy centers. Monitoring of the VNS-quality system is performed in three phases (intake, implant, and follow-up). The main indicators are reduction of epileptic seizures and changes in seizure severity, quality of life (QOLIE-89) and adverse events. The effect of VNS during follow-up was recorded after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Results: Between 2002 and 2006, 122 patients were included following the national protocol for VNS-therapy. During the first 2 years patient referral was low (?12 patients p.y.). Thereafter ?30 patients per year were included. Of these patients 9 were excluded. Of the remaining patients, at the time of analysis, seventy had received an implant, 22 were on the waiting list for implantation and 21 were in the intake phase. The mean age at intake was 40 y (SE 1.5 y). The onset of epilepsy in these patients was at 12.7 y (SE 1.1 y), and had a history with medically refractory epilepsy of 27.7 y (SE 1.5 y). They had 60.0 (SE 11.1) epileptic seizures per month. Most patients had localized partial epilepsy (59% symptomatic and 31% cryptogenic). A medically significant (>40%) decrease on seizure frequency during VNS was observed in 35% of patients after 1 month, and 49%, 61%, 42% and 64%, after respectively 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Seizure severity was markedly reduced in 46%, 46%, 52%, 62% and 55% of patients after respectively 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. About 80% of patients used ?magnet activation? to prevent or halt a seizure. 52% of patients experience a better or much better post-ictal recovery period with VNS. Side-effects were mainly voice related (hoarseness: 68%) and throat pain (32%). Quality of life showed statistically significant improvement in ?change in health? and ?general health?. Conclusions: Monitoring the effect of VNS-therapy in a national quality-system setting guaranties high quality care. Moreover it provides an effective means to review the outcome results of the participating centers. This national data-base may eventually help identify response predictors to further improve the effectiveness of VNS-therapy, which will subsequently be implemented in the national VNS-therapy protocol. 1 Kenou Van Rijckevorsel, 2 Alexandra Volckaert, 1 Marianne De Tourtchaninoff, 1 Geraldo Vaz, and 1 Christian Raftopoulos ( 1 Reference Center for Refractory Epilepsy, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ; and 2 Psychology Faculty, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery is an effective treatment for seizure control, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Morbidity is low, often limited to visual field defect and memory problems. However, long-term cognitive and emotional effects are poorly documented, especially in selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (Sel-AH). This paper studied memory (hippocampus,) emotions (amygdala) and quality of life (QOL) in 21 TLE patients after Sel-AH. Methods: Out of 31 Sel-AH patients operated between 2001 and 2005, 21 adults (5M, mean age 35 (19?53) years, 15 left) completed the tests; 4 children or teenagers were excluded, 4 refused or did not answer, 2 died of possible SUDEP more than 2 years after AH. Memory (immediate, work and general) was tested subjectively (QAM) and objectively (MEM-III Wechsler 3rd ed). QOL was appreciated with QOLIE-31-P questionary and emotions were analyzed by presenting computed pictures of fear, sadness and joy (Mann-Witney and Greenhouse-Geisser tests). Results were compared to matched controls or control population. Results: 15 (71.43%) are seizure free since surgery. 4 complained spontaneously from memory and 4 were chronically depressed, already before AH. For memory, patients' performances are inferior to controls' in QAM for reading and movie, especially in left AH. With MEM-III test, patients are less competent than controls, but work memory is the most preserved or the best recovered without side inference of AH. There is no correlation between QAM and MEM-III results. For QOL, patients are less anxious than unoperated epilepsy controls regarding seizures and medications. However, patients are more anxious than controls in general regarding the ongoing (test) situation. In emotional testing, there are significant differences between controls and patients, for control situations (human-animal and male-female) and in emotional testings: patients made more errors and more omissions with a slightly increased reaction time (RT). However, these differences were minimal without side inference of AH. Conclusions: Memory, QOL and emotions have been tested in 21 adult Sel-AH patients, compared to matched controls or control population. Memory is less performant in patients compared to controls, but not deteriorated by surgery. QOL is improved in surgery patients compared to unoperated epilepsy patients regarding seizures and medications. For emotions, patients differ significantly from controls by making more errors and omissions with a slightly increased RT. However, these results are the same for test and emotional situations and are probably unrelated to surgery. 1 Marcos Velasco, 1 Ana L. Velasco, and 1 Francisco Velasco ( 1 Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, Hospital General de México, Mexico City, Mexico ) Rationale: Resective surgery of the epileptic focus yields very good results, nevertheless there are cases that escape this surgical possibility, i.e. patients with bilateral hippocampal foci or patients with epileptic focus located nearby eloquent areas for speech and memory (usually the left side). These latter patients cannot be operated on because it would mean having severe neurological impairment particularly related to short term memory. These patients are candidates for neuromodulating procedures. The present study evaluates the long term efficacy of ESH in the treatment of complex partial seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Nine patients were studied. They had at least a 6 month basal period during which a careful seizure record was obtained. They all underwent bilateral hippocampal electrode implantation to establish focus was laterality and location. 3 patients had bilateral and 6 had unilateral foci. Diagnostic electrodes were explanted and definitive Medtronic electrodes were implanted directed to the hippocampal foci. Position was confirmed with MRI and afterwards the DBS system internalized. Patients signed the informed consent approved by the Hospital's Ethics Committee and started a double blind stimulation protocol. Patients attended every 3 months for seizure count and neuropsychological tests. Results: Follow up went from at least 18 months to 5 years. Patients were divided in two groups: 5 had normal MRIs and 4 had hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with normal MRI had a seizure reduction of >95%. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis had a seizure reduction of 30?50%. None of the patients showed deterioration of neuropsychological function, patients who had >95% seizure reduction, showed improvement in the neurophsychological tests. No patient showed adverse effects. 1 patient had to be explanted after 2 years due to skin erosion in the trajectory of the system. 1 patient had skin erosion which was corrected with plastic surgery. Conclusions: ESH provides a non lesional method that improves seizure outcome without deterioration of memory in patients with unilateral or bilateral hippocampal epileptic focus. 1 Clarissa L. Yasuda, 1 Leonardo Bonilha, 1 Chris Rorden, 1 Helder Tedeschi, 1 Evandro Oliveira, 1 Li M. Li, and 1 Fernando Cendes ( 1 Neurology, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil; Neuropsychiatry, University of South Carolina; and Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of South Carolina ) Rationale: Resection of hippocampus (HIP)has been the standard procedure for patients with drug resistant (DR) medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) (1), with a success rate of approximately 75%(1,2). The reasons for the failure of almost 25% of the operated patients remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the influence of resection of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in addition to HIP in the surgical outcome(SO) of these patients. Methods: We studied 43 patients with DR, unilateral MTLE who underwent anteromedial temporal resection in the Epilepsy Service at UNICAMP, between 1998 and 2004. We selected patients according to our standard surgical investigation protocol (2) and included only patients with hippocampal atrophy supporting both clinical and electrophysiological findings. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. All patients underwent a routine MRI scan at least six months after the surgery, with the following parameters: T1weighted with 1 mm isotropic voxels acquired on a 2 Tesla scanner. We used the Engel's postoperative outcome scale (1) and conducted a voxel lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) (3) of their post-operative MRI to discriminate the contribution of distinct segments of the MTL cortex to the SO (4). We computed linear regressions and applied a cost function transformation of the resection maps for each patient to a common set of spatial coordinates. Results: Patients underwent surgery with the mean age of 37 (range 17?56) years, and the mean follow up period was 40 (range 11?99) months. The SO classification was: 76% as Engel I,14% as Engel II,5% as Engel III and 5% as Engel IV. We observed that the extent of hippocampal removal was associated with better outcomes (t = 2.371, p = 0.023). However, when the resection of the HIP was associated with resection of the entorhinal cortex there was a greater likelihood of seizure control after surgery (t = 3.286, p = 0.002) (Fig. 1). Figure 1. VLSM maps are overlaid in a normal T1 template. Colors that are associated with low p-values (green, yellow and red) are the most significantly associated with a good SO and correspond to the entorhinal cortex and HIP. [figure 1] Conclusions: Based upon this finding, the efficiency of the surgical treatment of MTLE can be improved by including the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal resection.

Mello ( 1 Neurology  and 2 Neurology  all kids submitted to callosal section had a 90% decrease of the generalized seizure frequency, but none was seizure-free. All patients improved their linear growth after surgery and all of them were growing at least two percentile intervals above the preoperative level. Although not statistically significant, this ?catch-up? phenomenon was clinically more noticeable in those kids submitted to callosal section. Conclusions: Children with refractory epilepsy that underwent successful epilepsy surgery caught-up with linear growth after surgery. Although this could be seen as recovery from a chronic illness in the kids with focal resections that were seizure-free postoperatively, it is unlikely that an isolated response to improved health would be responsible for the additional growth in patients submitted to callosal section, who were not seizure-free postoperatively. In this pediatric population, an inhibitory effect on growth from the epileptic activity might explain this postoperative catch-up phenomenon, especially in children with generalized epilepsy.

Frost ( 1 Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, St. Paul, MN ; and 2 United Neurosurgery Associates, United Neurosurgery Associates, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Many clinical variables are considered when selecting pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates with the objective of predicting beneficial outcome. Methods: We analyzed all pediatric patients who underwent initial resective surgery at Minnesota Epilepsy Group from Jan 2000-Dec 2002. Beneficial outcome was defined as Engel class I or II. Beneficial outcomes were compared to many diagnostic variables: attainment of early childhood milestones, presence of nocturnal seizures, history of febrile seizures, history of status epilepticus, symptomatic versus cryptogenic etiology, temporal vs. extra-temporal lobe seizures, complete vs. partial resection, and presence of multiple conflicting diagnostic variables. Outcome measurements were done at 24-months. Statistical method utilized was Fisher's Exact Test. Results: 46 consecutive subjects were identified and reviewed; 23 (50%) underwent temporal lobe only resection; extra-temporal resections included 10 (22%) frontal, 1 (2%) parietal, and 12 (26%) multi-lobe. In subjects with available follow-up data, 19/33 (58%) were seizure free at 24-months. Achievement of early childhood milestones was not associated with beneficial seizure outcome. The clinical history of nocturnal seizures, febrile seizures, or status epilepticus did not statistically separate beneficial outcomes groups. Etiology was not a statistically significant influence on beneficial outcome at 24-months (symptomatic 23/30: 77%; cryptogenic 1/3: 33%; p < 0.174); however, this is may be influenced by low numbers within the cryptogenic group. Temporal lobe surgery was statistically more successful in achieving a beneficial outcome of Engel I-II in 15/17 (88%) subjects compared to 9/16 (56%) of the extra-temporal group (p < 0.046). Complete resection of the epileptogenic zone was associated with beneficial outcome in 20/24 (83%) subjects compared to partial resections 4/9 subjects (44%) (p < 0.039). The presence of multiple conflicting diagnostic variables was the strongest predictor of beneficial outcome as 24/27 (89%) subjects achieved Engel I-II compared to none of the 6 subjects with >1 contralateral diagnostic variable (Fisher's Exact test p < 0.001). Conclusions: Favorable diagnostic variables associated with an Engel class I-II outcome following epilepsy surgery include temporal lobe resections, complete resections, and absence of multiple contralateral diagnostic variables. In this retrospective review, the absence of multiple contralateral variables was the strongest predictor. 1 Georg Dorfmüller, 1 Emidio Procaccini, 1 Martine Fohlen, 1 Christine Bulteau, 1 Claude Jalin, and 1 Olivier Delalande ( 1 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Fondation Rothschild, Paris, France ) Rationale: To present our single-center experience with a frameless robot-guided endoscopic system for the transventricular disconnection of hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) associated with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: Fourty-three patients (9 m to 34 y, median age: 10 y) were operated on either through a pterional approach (8) or by means of transventricular endoscopy (21) or subsequently by both techniques (14), in order to disconnect the HH below or at the wall of the third ventricle. For the endoscopic approach we used a frameless stereotactic robot-guided navigation (Neuromate?, Schaerer-Mayfield). The trajectory of the endoscopic approach was defined by the hamartomas plane of attachment on the hypothalamus, for which we have proposed an anatomo-topographic classification. Results: In terms of seizure outcome, we achieved the best results in HH with a vertical broad plane of attachment, extending into the third ventricle, enabling us to disconnect it through the endoscopic route. In this subtype (n = 12), 83% of the patients became seizure-free, as compared to 43% in the other three types (horizontal attachment, attachment in multiple planes and giant HH). Other parameters, such as the patients age, seizure type and frequency or the duration of illness, were not significantly related with the outcome. In all, of 42 patients followed up, 21 (50%) became seizure-free and 2 had rare events, while 17 (41%) had a worthwhile reduction in their seizure frequency, and 2 patients remained unchanged. Furthermore, improvement in several patients with disease-related cognitive and behavioural disturbances could be objectified postoperatively. In terms of surgery-related morbidity, the endoscopic approach had a significantly lower complication rate. Conclusions: Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of the disconnection of HH extending into the third ventricle with our robot-guided endoscopic approach. 1 Eliana Garzon, 2 Ajay Gupta, 2 Jennifer Haut, 2 Deepak Lachhwani, 2 Prakash Kotagal, 2 Elaine Wyllie, 3 William Bingaman, 1 Americo Sakamoto, and 2 Hans Luders ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foudation, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: In infants and young children with congenital or early onset acquired lesions, interictal scalp EEG may show generalized or multiregional abnormalities but ictal EEG concordant with semiology and brain MRI usually clarifies the epileptogenic zone for surgical option. We studied 6 children with catastrophic epilepsy whose ictal scalp EEG was classified as maximum over the unaffect hemisphere contralateral to the brain lesion. Factors leading to paradoxical lateralization of ictal scalp EEG over the unaffected hemisphere were evaluated. Methods: Of 209 patients in the pediatric epilepsy surgery database of Cleveland Clinic Foundation, clinical, EEG, brain imaging, surgery and postoperative records of 6 patients, whose EEG was classified as maximum in the unaffected hemisphere were reviewed. Digital records were restored and analyzed independently. Paradoxical lateralization was defined as scalp EEG seizure pattern that developed eiher exclusively or bilaterally but maximally contralateral to the to the side of the lesion. Results: Six patients, 4 females, 3?14 years in age at the time of the pre-surgical evaluation, were identified. Despite the paradoxical lateralization of ictal scalp EEG during recorded seizures, lateralizing signs (>1 sign in 3 patients) of focal tonic (4 patients), head versive (2 patients), hemiclonic (1 patient) and asymmetric epileptic spasm (1 patient) were noted contralateral (concordant) to the side of lesion. Interictal EEG showed generalized or lateralized and multiregional epileptiform discharges with predominance (> 65%) over the affected hemisphere in 3/6, generalized but maximum over the unaffected hemisphre in 2/6, and generalized with no focal predominance in 1 patient. Brain MRI showed extensive destructive (encephaloclastic) lesions such as stroke in 3 and encephalomalacia (post status epilepticus and infectious) in 3 patients. All patients underwent hemispherectomy and 5/6 patients were seizure free after 5 months to 3 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Extensive congenital or early onset acquired encephaloclastic lesions may produce an ictal scalp EEG pattern that appear maximum over the unaffected hemisphere. Interictal EEG in these patients may also show bilateral and multiregional abnormalities with or without any predominant region of abnormality. These scalp EEG patterns should be recognized and they do not preclude benefit from epilepsy surgery if the neurological deficits, semiology, and imaging implicate the abnormal hemisphere. Early spread to the normal hemisphere, the presence of encephaloclastic lesion modifying scalp EEG patterns, and secondary epileptogenesis may explain these findings.

Methods: The 13 patients were affected by static or progressive encephalopathies, involving the right hemisphere in 7 cases, and the left in 6. Diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by pathological study. Motor, mental, and language evaluation have been performed before surgery and at least yearly during a follow-up lasting 6?72 months (median 35.5 months). All the patient underwent peri-insular hemispherotomy. Results: Four patients had malformation of cortical development (2 hemimegalencepahly, 2 cortical dysplasia), 3 patients suffered of acquired perinatal brain damage and 6 patients were affected by Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). Age at the first seizure was 1 month ? 11 years (median 4.4 years), age at surgery was 6 months-18 years (median 7.3 years), the mean delay between the onset of seizures and surgery being 3.3 years (range 4 months-9 years). In all the patients motor deficit contralateral to the affected hemisphere, mental retardation or cognitive decline, of different severity, were present at the time of treatment. Post-op course was complicated in 2 cases (chemical meningitis, subdural hematoma). There were no life-threatening complications. Among the 10 patients followed-up for at least 12 months, surgery was judged as successful in 8 cases. Six patients became seizure-free (3/4 cases with RE, 2/2 cases with acquired brain damage, 1/2 cases with diffuse cortical dysplasia), whereas 2 children (1 with RE, 1 with cortical dysplasia) showed >50% reduction of seizures. Antiepileptic treatment was withdrawn in 3 patients, and simplified in 4. In all the 8 patients neurological condition improved: motor deficits remained unchanged in 3 patients and improved in 5; a significant cognitive and behavioural improvement was observed in 5 patients, no patient with left hemispherotomy experienced worsening in language. No improvement in seizure frequency, nor in motor and cognitive skills was, by contrast, obtained in the 2 children affected by hemimegalencephaly. Conclusions: Our data support the efficacy of peri-insular hemispherotomy in unilateral encephalopathies. As already reported, the seizure outcome is related to the underlying pathology, with the best results in acquired brain damage and in RE, and the worst in hemimegalencephaly. Our data also confirm that control of seizures is often associated with improvement of motor and mental abilities when surgery is performed in childhood. 1 Jin Sook Lee, 1 Jee Yoon Park, 1 Jin Hwa Moon, 1 Hee Hwang, 1 Ki Joong Kim, 1 Yong Seung Hwang, 2 Seung Ki Kim, 2 Byung Kyu Cho, and 3 Ho Jin Park ( 1 Pediatrics, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; 2 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 3 Pediatrics, Eulji University Hospital, Daejeon, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is a benign brain tumor and often occurs in association with medically intractable partial seizures. The authors report our experience of DNT patients treated with epilepsy surgery. Methods: A retrospective review and analysis of medical records were performed on brain MRI findings, interictal and ictal EEG features pathological findings, other clinical characteristics, and surgical outcome of 14 patients with refractory epilepsy secondary to DNT. Results: All patients showed cortical or subcortical lesions with T1 low and T2 high signal intensity, and only one case showed focal small enhancing portion within the tumor. Other MRI findings included cystic formation (6), calcification (2) and hippocampal atrophy (1). Temporal lobe was involved in 9 cases (64.3%), while frontal, parietal or occipital lobes were involved in 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Mean age at seizure onset was 7.2 years (range 0.3 ? 13.8 years). All patients presented with complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, however, one patient had previous history of infantile spasms. Ten of the 12 patients revealed abnormal findings on interictal EEG. Long-term video-EEG monitoring (VEM) was done in 5 patients. The epileptogenic lobe was correctly localized by VEM in 4 patients who had lesions in the temporal lobe. Intracranial recording was performed in one patient, in whom lesion was located in the parietal lobe but scalp VEM failed to localize ictal onset zone. Lesionectomy was done in 8 cases (57%) and temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy was done in 6 cases (43%). Pathology revealed associated cortical dysplasia (CD) in 4 patients (28.6%), and one of them showed oligodendroglioma component as well as CD. Mean follow-up period after surgery was 2.8 years (range 0.2 ? 5.9 years). All had an Engel Class IA outcome (3 patients still have been on antiepileptic drugs) without recurrence of tumor. Second operation was performed in one patient with temporal lobe involvement. Postoperative morbidity (visual field defect and hemiparesis) was observed in 2 cases who had lesions in the temporal lobe (21.4%). Follow-up MRI could not exclude the possibility of residual tumor in 3 cases, however, no further seizure was reported so far. Six of the 9 patients showed normal postoperative EEG. Conclusions: DNT most frequently involved the temporal lobe and was often associated with CD. Gross total removal is thought to ensure favorable prognosis in most cases regardless of type of surgery. However, careful resection is necessary to reduce morbidity especially in case of temporal lobe involvement. 1 Nicoletta Longoni, 1 Warren W. Boling, 3 Adriana Palade, 4 Angel Wabulya, 2 Frederick Andermann, 1 Priscah Mujuru, 4 Warf Benjamin, 6 Donald Gross, 5 Richard Bittar, 7 Gavin Fabinyi, and 8 Richard Byrne ( 1 Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 2 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montrea, QC, Canada ; 3 Neurology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 4 Community Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 5 CURE Childrens Hospital of Uganda, Mbale, Uganda ; 6 Neurosurgery, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; 7 Neurology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ; 8 Neurosurgery, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 9 Neurosurgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Since May 2005 an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) has been in place at the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda (CHU) in Mbale, Uganda, East Africa. Children are pre screened in regionalized clinics prior to evaluation at CHU comprehensive epilepsy program, the first such program in East Africa. The program is dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Prescreening relies on identifying the stereotypical signs and symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Treatment candidates must have intractable epilepsy, seizure frequency over 1 per month, and a history of two of the following: - febrile convulsions - typical aura - typical semiology of stare and/or automatisms Patients less than 6 years of age or multiple extra-temporal intracranial lesions were excluded. EEG and CTimaging are done at CHU. The data are transferred for analysis to WVU. Epilepsy surgery is performed at CHU. Results: 30 patients have been evaluated at CHU. Seizure frequency ranged between 30/day to 2/month with a mean of 2.2 seizures/day. 25 patients presented an aura. Essentially all patients had a history of malaria. 27 had febrile convulsions. To date, 19 patients have completed an evaluation in the comprehensive program. EEG recording has shown: Left temporal (5), right temporal (2), frontal (2), bitemporal (2), multifocal (3), generalized (4), and non-epileptic (1). CT showed scar in 4 cases. Four patients had convincing temporal lobe epilepsy and underwent surgery at CHU. Conclusions: Epilepsy prevalence has been estimated to be 20 per 1000 in one region of Eastern Africa, 10 times the prevalence in developed countries making intractable epilepsy a significant public health problem in the region. Malaria was essentially universal in the population screened and we suspect cerebral malaria as an important cause of intractable epilepsy. One case of ?non-epileptic spell? was identified (5% in the population studied). (Supported by USAID, American Schools and Hospitals Abroad.) 1 Angel W. Hernandez, 1 Saleem I. Malik, and 1 David Donahue ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX ) Rationale: Patients undergoing brain surgeries are at risk of developing bacterial infections post-operatively, but herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation is a rare complication. Few reports are available on patients that develop reactivation herpes virus encephalitis following epilepsy surgery. We report a case of HSV reactivation post epilepsy surgery to raise awareness of this risk and to consider treatment pre and post surgery on patient with a history of prior HSV infection. Methods: We report one case of reactivation of herpes simplex virus after epilepsy surgery on a 12 year old with pharmaco-resistant localization-related epilepsy of left temporo-parietal onset. This patient had a history of negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV as an infant. Four days after resection of the epileptogenic focus the patient developed acute repetitive seizures, meningeal signs, confusion, lethargy and high fever. PCR in the CSF was positive for HSV. Results: The patient's seizures stopped 48 hours after starting treatment with Acyclovir. The confusion and lethargy resolved 48?72 hours after initiating treatment. There were no sequelae to the infection. The patient is now 1.5 years seizure free and off anti-convulsants. Conclusions: Though early recognition and treatment of HSV encephalitis is essential, we believe that prophylactic treatment with acyclovir pre and post brain surgery is warranted in patients with prior HSV exposure to decrease the chances of this complication. 1 Manuel Marrufo, 1 Yong D. Park, 1 Ki Hyeong Lee, 2 Mark R. Lee, 2 Joseph R. Smith, and 2 Scott Y. Rahimi ( 1 Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ) Rationale: Corpus callosotomy is a treatment option for epilepsy patients who are not resective surgery candidate. EEG as predictor or outcome for corpus callosotomy cases has been studied exclusively among adult population. Methods: Patient selection: A retrospective anlysis included all patients under 18 yrs who underwent corpus callosotomy from July 02 to April 06. Data collection: The demographic data, seizure characteristics and seizure outcome was obtained from the medical records, as well as direct phone interviews at least 6 month following the surgery. The EEG findings were reviewed by two authors (YDP and MM) blinded to the outcome. Seizure and EEG patterns classification: Seizure type was classified and recorded in to two main categories: Category A for drop attacks and tonic seizures; Category B for GTCS, atypical absence, adverse postures, CPS and myoclonus. Ictal EEG was classified into two different patterns: Type A for generalized desynchronization, spike and wave, and diffuse beta activity; and Type B for focal onset confined to one hemisphere or with secondary generalization. Outcome evaluation: Two seizure outcomes were defined by the reduction of seizure: Class I ≥ 90% reduction, and Class II < 90% or less. Statistical Methods: Chi-Square test run with SPSS 13 package. Results: There were a total of 35 patients followed for 11mo (6?12mo). The average age at surgery and the average age of seizure onset were 7.4 years (range 1 ? 17 yrs) and 2.36 yrs (range 0?10 yrs) respectively. Sex ratio was 20:15 (M:F). In terms of seizure characteristic, 24 out of 35 (68%) patients belonged to category A while 11/35 (32%) to category B. When correlated with outcome of surgery, patients with Category A seizures showed a tendency to do better than Category B (Category A 85% (12/14) vs. Category B 15% (2/14), p-value 0.077). Ictal EEG pattern did not predict the outcome: Type A 47.6% (10/21) vs Type B 30.8% (4/13), p-value 0.272. Other demographic or pathology characteristics were not different between the two outcome groups. Conclusions: Our data suggest that ictal EEG pattern does not predict outcome following corpus callosotomy among the pediatric population unlike the published data on adult. However, consistent with previous reports, ?drop? seizures tended to respond better to this surgical procedure than other seizure types in our population. Careful selection of candidate regarding seizure types, not necessarily ictal EEG patterns, are recommended for corpus callosotomy. 1 Bruno Maton, 1 Prasanna Jayakar, 1 Trevor Resnick, 1 Glenn Morrison, 1 John Ragheb, 1 Catalina Dunoyer, 1 Pat Dean, and 1 Michael Duchowny ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that begins in early life is often a catastrophic disorder with pharmaco-resistant seizures and secondary neurological deterioration. Few data are available regarding epilepsy surgery performed during infancy and early childhood and no prior study has focused on TLE. Methods: We analyzed the results of temporal resection, performed for epilepsy as the primary indication, between 1979 and 2003, in children less than age 5 years at time of surgery who had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results: 20 children (14 males) were identified with a mean age at surgery of 26 months and a mean age at seizure onset of 12 months. Clinical presentation was age-dependent. Typical psychomotor seizures (n = 4; mean age at surgery 37 months) may be followed by prominent motor changes (n = 7; 30 months) that can be isolated (n = 3; 23 months). Epileptic spasms were noted in 6 patients and were frequently associated with partial seizures. The interictal EEG was lateralizing in 15 patients and ictal EEG was lateralizing in 18 patients. Brain MRI had good predictive value in 16 patients; ictal SPECT was concordant in 4/8 patients. Invasive EEG was employed in 6 cases. At mean follow-up of 5.5 years, 65% of the children were seizure-free and 15% had > 90% seizure reduction. Morbidity included infection and hydrocephalus in one case and stroke-related hemiparesis in two cases. Cortical dysplasia was identified in 8 children, tumors in 8 including 2 DNET, 2 ganglioglioma, and 4 malignant tumors. Hippocampal sclerosis was present in 4 cases as dual pathology. Conclusions: Surgery for TLE can be performed during early life with similar results as in older children and in adults. 2 Ann-Christine Duhaime, 3 Barbara C. Jobst, and 1 Richard P. Morse ( 1 Pediatrics and Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; and 3 Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) seizures are relatively common in children but there are small numbers reported in terms of surgical approach and outcome. Despite the fact that SMA epilepsy typically begins in childhood and is often refractory to AED treatment, surgical approaches to its management most often are delayed until adulthood. We report on the clinical features, evaluative test results (SPECT, invasive EEG) and surgical outcome in a series of 5 non-lesional children and adolescents, 3 of whom have had resective epilepsy surgery. Methods: Five children were characterized by means of seizure description, V-EEG, SISCOM, fMRI, and invasive intracranial recording with brain mapping, and seizures were localized to the SMA. Results: Three of the five patients have had resective surgery, with mixed outcomes. None were initially seizure-free: one has had a few seizures due to non-compliance but otherwise has gone months at a time without seizures, one required a second resection in the primary motor cortex and is now seizure-free, and one has had a >50% reduction in seizures. Of the non-operated patients, one declined surgery and one has been moderately well-controlled with AED therapy. All patients were non-lesional on MRI imaging; pathology showed cortical dysplasia in one and non-specific changes in the other two patients. The patient who required a second operation has a mild L hemiparesis, but had no deficits after the initial resection limited to the SMA, and the other two patients have no neurologic deficits. Conclusions: SMA seizures are not uncommon in children, with characteristic clinical features and seizure semiology like those described in adults. The seizures can be approached surgically with acceptable results and without deficits. Identification and characterization of SMA in children may allow for earlier successful surgical intervention, especially in cases involving focal cortical dysplasia as the underlying cause of the epilepsy. Use of adjunctive methods to localize, including SISCOM and invasive monitoring with stimulation and mapping, is essential for non-lesional cases. A common confounder appears to be the rapid propagation to the SMA from adjacent cortical areas (primary motor) or simultaneous onset, making surgery more challenging. 1 Joo Hee Seo, 2 Su Jeong You, 2 Hoon Chul Kang, 1 Heung Dong Kim, 3 Tae-Sung Ko, 4 Yong Soon Hwang, 5 Dong Suk Kim, 6 Jung-Kyo Lee, and 4 Sang Keun Park ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, Severance Hospital, Handicapped Children's Research Institute, Brain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; 2 Department of Pediatrics, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sang-gye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ; 3 Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; 4 Department of Neurosurgery, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sang-gye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ; 5 Department of Neurosurgery, Severance Hospital, Handicapped Children's Research Institute, Brain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; and 6 Department of Neurosurgery, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: We sought to evaluate the long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in refractory pediatric epilepsy. Methods: Twenty eight patients could be followed over 12 months in three tertiary care referral epilepsy centers. Data including seizure frequencies, quality of life measures and adverse events had been prospectively filed up through 5 years. Results: VNS resulted in a >50% reduction in seizure frequency in 53.6% (15/28) of children with 28.6% (8/28) patients achieving a >90% reduction. When compared a seizure reduction rate according to seizure types (generalized vs paritial seizure), etiologies (symptomatic vs cryptogenic), and seizure duration before VNS implantation, we could not find any significant difference of it. However, a seizure reduction rate had a tendency to be in inverse proportion to seizure duration. In addition, of 11 patients who had partial seizure disorders, 7 patients (63.6%) obtained a reduction of seizure frequency with >50% and then again, of 17 patients who had generalized seizure disorders, 8 patients (47.1%) did. Quality of life was also measured to be enhanced as follows, memory in 50.0% (8/16) patients, mood in 62.5% (10/16) patients, behavior in 68.8% (11/16) patients, alertness in 68.8% (11/16) patients, achievement in 37.5% (6/16) and verbal skill in 43.8% (7/16) patients. Adverse events included hoarseness in 7 patients, dyspnea at sleep in 2 patients, wound infection in 1 patient but were transient and successfully managed by careful follow-up and an adjustment of parameters. Conclusions: Our data show that VNS roles as one of alternative therapy for refractory pediatric epilepsy without any significant adverse events. 1 Nicolas Specchio, 1 Lucia Fusco, 1 Giuseppe Gobbi, 1 Federico Vigevano, and 1 Tiziana Granata ( 1 Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Rome, Italy; Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Rome, Italy; Division of Neuropediatrics, Ospedale Maggiore Cà Pizzardi, Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Roma, Roma, Italy; and Division of Child Neurology, Istituto Nazionale Neurologico C. Besta, Milano, Milano, Italy ) Rationale: Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is an acquired neurological disease characterized by intractable partial seizures and symptoms of progressive dysfunction of one cerebral hemisphere. Laboratory findings suggested the possibility of a immune-mediate component in the pathogenesis of the disease implying. However, surgical treatment still remains the preferred treatment. We report our experience on the surgical treatment of 10 RE patients collected in the context of an Italian collaborative study. Methods: The series included 10 patients with RE followed in the centers of Bambino Gesù Children's Hopsital (Roma), Neurological Institute ?C. Besta? (Milano) and Ospedale Maggiore (Bologna). Pre- and post-operative evaluations included: EEG recordings with video monitoring, MRI, assessment of motor function and cognitive evaluation based on clinical observation and standardized tests. The surgical procedures was based on functional disconnection of the affected hemisphere (hemispherotomy), performed according to vertex or peri-insular approach. Results: The series includes 10 patients (6 M,4 F), aged between 10 and 23 years (16.3 ± 3.4) observed between 1993 and 2000. The age at onset ranged between 3 and 11 years (6.5 ± 2.8); surgery was performed 8 months to 9 years from disease onset (4.1 ± 2.7). Post-surgical follow-up ranged between 5 and 10 years (6.9 ± 1.5). The disease onset was marked by partial seizures, epilepsia partialis continua and unilateral limb paresis followed by status epilepticus. Neurologic deficits appeared in all patients within 24 months. EEG recordings consistently showed slow and epileptic abnormalities over the affected hemisphere. At the time of surgery patients were treated with three or more AED. All, but one, patients became seizure-free after surgery, AE treatment has been stopped in 7 patients, and reduced in 3. Patients still treated are given a mean of 1.5 ± 1 drugs. The need for neurological evaluations and EEG monitoring reduced from monthly to yearly. Conclusions: After surgery seizures ceased in all patients, thus demonstrating the successfulness of the operative procedures. It is noteworthy that postural control improved in all patients and regained unassisted gait. Mental abilities, as evaluated by standardized scales, improved in all cases. None of them performed anymore habitual monthly EEG and neurological evaluations. Surgical treatment of RE appeared in our series as a gold standard because of its effectiveness in seizure control, dramatic improvement in cognitive evaluations and reduction in the general healthcare assistance. 1 Marino M. Bianchin, 1 Vera C. Terra-Bustamante, 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 2 Neife H. Deghaide, 1 Hélio R. Machado, 2 Eduardo A. Donadi, and 1 Américo C. Sakamoto ( 1 Department of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Medical Psychology, Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine, University of S?o Paulo, Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Division of Clinical Immunology, Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine, University of S?o Paulo, Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology. The disease has been attributed to possible viral infections or autoimmune mechanisms. HLA is the landmark of autoimmune disorders and specific alleles have been associated with different neurological diseases. Here we report the results of HLA Class-Ia study in Brazilian RE patients. Methods: After approval by the Ethic Committee of our institution and after informed consent was obtained from the patients, DNA samples were obtained from 13 Brazilian patients with pathologically confirmed RE. For the study of allele prevalence, data were compared with those for ethnically matched control population. The Fischer test was used to determine possible differences. The level of significance was established at p < 0.05. Results: No specific HLA Class-Ia was found to be strongly associated with RE in our patients.

Additionally, HLA Class-Ia molecules might have other roles in the CNS in terms of neuroplasticity and neuroprotection, or might be involved in normal brain development. In fact, HLA Class-Ia molecules have been associated with some neurological disorders like schizophrenia, autism, or dyslexia. RE is an autoimmune disorder observed mostly during the years of brain development and associated with neuroplastic alterations that leads to an intriguing form of epilepsia partialis continua. However, in spite of multiple potential roles for HLA molecules in RE, in this group of patients no specific HLA Class-Ia was found to be strongly associated with RE. We conclude that none of the specific HLA Class-Ia alleles studied here is particularly involved in RE. However, larger samples involving multicentric studies are necessary to confirm our findings.

Methods: A consecutive, retrospective analysis of seizure outcome and quality of life assessment was conducted in 83 pediatric patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for medically refractory epilepsy at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between 2002?2005. Data was collected via a chart review and examination of post-operative patients. Data collection included seizure outcome measurements as described in the Engel classification system. Quality of life assessment was performed by sending quality of life questionnaires to caregivers of our patients (QOLCE and QOLIE-AD-48). Results: The seizure outcomes for all surgery types were Class I-68.7%; Class II-12%; Class III-19.3%. If corpus callosotomies were excluded, Class I outcome was 72%. Seizure free outcome was highest in temporal lobectomies (84.2%) followed by hemispherectomies (76.2%), focal resections (61.2%), and finally corpus callosotomies (25%). Temporal lobectomies were more common among older patients. Seizure free outcome was 50% in infants; 67.9% in young children, and 78.4% in adolescents. Cortical dysplasia was predictive of a less favorable seizure free outcome. 62.7% of the QOLCE surveys and 45.8% of the QOLIE-AD-48 surveys were returned. The quality of life measures for the surveys paralleled seizure outcome. The measures of physical activity, cognition, social activity, general health, and overall quality of life were significantly better in children with a seizure free outcome than children who were not seizure free. Conclusions: Epilepsy surgery in medically refractory epilepsy in children significantly improves quality of life as well as seizure control. 1 Warren W. Boling ( 1 Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: The author describes a novel keyhole approach to selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH). The surgical technique has proven to be successful in the treatment of medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Image guidance is required in the keyhole approach to orient the cranial opening, verify cortical landmarks for positioning the corticectomy, and assess the extent of hippocampal disconnection. The restricted surgical exposure has not limited the ability to perform SAH with favorable results on reducing the seizure tendency. Methods: All patients with one year or more follow-up after keyhole SAH at West Virginia University (WVU) were included in this report. Forty-eight surgeries for temporal lobe epilepsy have been performed since 2002 by the author with over one year follow-up. Ten had keyhole SAH performed and are the subjects reported here in. Results of surgery in keyhole SAH subjects were contrasted with individuals undergoing SAH at WVU using standard craniotomy approach. All individuals since 2002 who underwent standard SAH surgery by the author for epilepsy and with over 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included in the evaluation. Results: Ten subjects had keyhole approach for SAH performed. Seven (70%) had an excellent outcome from surgery becoming seizure free (Class I). One subject had over 90% seizure frequency reduction (Class III), and 2 had less than 90% reduction in seizure frequency (Class IV). Three subjects had no stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) performed prior to keyhole SAH (all seizure free), and the remainder had SEEG performed for further confirmation of MTLE. There were no surgical complications encountered. Twenty-One surgeries were performed for SAH using a standard craniotomy approach. 81% were seizure free after surgery. Excellent outcomes compared favorably between keyhole and non-keyhole approaches (p = 0.54). Hospital stay after surgery was determined for the subjects who underwent keyhole SAH at WVU and an age matched control of patients who had SAH performed via a non-keyhole (pterional craniotomy) approach at WVU. In keyhole SAH subjects the mean length of hospital stay was 3 days (range 2 ? 4 days). Non-keyhole SAH patients stayed in the hospital a mean of 4 days (range 2 ? 6 days) after surgery representing a trend to shorter hospital stays after keyhole SAH (p = 0.11). Conclusions: The keyhole approach to SAH is a strictly image guided procedure. The corticectomy is positioned at the upper bank of T2 anterior to the precentral suclus in the dominant hemisphere and in front of the central sulcus in the non-dominant hemisphere. These cortical landmarks can only be confirmed with image guidance. The results of surgery on the seizure tendency depend on an accurate diagnosis of MTLE, and compare favorably with non-keyhole SAH and corticoamygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy. The keyhole SAH is an effective approach in patients undergoing surgery for MTLE. 1 Richard C. Burgess ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: The Cleveland Clinic has a 25 year history as a tertiary referral center for patients with epilepsy. Rigorously kept records of seizure/epilepsy classification and neurophysiologic results are saved electronically. With the advent of a hospital-wide electronic medical record, picture archiving and communication system, digtal video recordings, and other scattered electronic repositories, data about our patients is entered electronically in many areas, but is not available in an integrated fashion when needed to generate reports to referring doctors or to carry out sophisticated research queries. We sought to put all of this information at the neurologist's fingertips for clinical and research purposes, by developing a system that provides access via standard web browser. Methods: The database contains both text and graphics. Data is imported from other servers, as well as maintained by pointers. For access we employed the Faces framework deployed on a J2EE application server. Because of its deployment in a very busy clinical center, careful attention was paid to real-time performance issues, e.g. by employing asynchronous Javascript and XML to handle page display simultaneous with data retrieval. In addition to the carefully classified neurophysiologic and epilepsy information, a range of graphical and tabular information has been organized for incorporation into the database. This includes pictorial information, formerly available ad hoc from a variety of sources, such as: grid placement maps, depth placement maps, stimulation maps, ictal and nterictal discharge maps, MRI  and 2 Functional Neurosurgery Department, Neurologic Hospital, Lyon, Rhône, France ) Rationale: Intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy assessment are done in our unit using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes. Five years ago, we explored use of these electrodes to produce RFTC lesions inside the epileptogenic area. We report the results in 42 patients. Methods: 42 consecutive patients explored by video-SEEG recordings were enrolled in this study between June 2001 and February 2006. RFTCs were produced by inducing a Joule effect between electrode contacts where discharge onsets had been recorded. Four to 31 lesions (mean, 12.5) were performed per patient. The epileptic focus (EF) was located in the frontal (8 patients), occipital (7), insular (4), parietal (3) and temporal (20) lobe. Several etiologies were found: cortical dysplasia (CD) (21), hippocampal sclerosis (4), periventricular heteropia (PH) (3), posttraumatic focal atrophy (1) and cryptogenic epilepsy (13). The results were evaluated on the decrease in the number of seizures: good outcome (GO, >70%) and using a self-administered questionnaire, each patient estimated the presence (a) or absence (b) of improvement in their quality of life (QL). Results: The GO rate 1 month after the intervention (57%) decreased to 35% at the 6-month evaluation and then stabilized. The QL evaluation showed comparable mean results (a = 38%) but rose to 66% on the subgroup of patients who were inoperable after SEEG exploration. The GO rate was positively correlated with: 1) anterior location of the EF: 75, 37 and 33% of GO for insular, frontal and temporal lobe epilepsy, respectively, with no change for parietal and occipital epilepsy. 2) the etiology, with the best results for symptomatic epilepsy (37 and 33% GO in CD and PH, respectively) vs 23% GO in cryptogenic forms. No general or neurological complication occurred during the procedures other than two transient deficits (paresthetic sensations in the mouth and mild apraxia of the hand). 20 unsatisfied patients had a secondary classical intervention (19 now in Engel class 1 and 1 in class 2) Conclusions: This study reports the results at 5 years of RFTC treatment given to 42 epileptic patients during SEEG exploration. This procedure is: 1) sure: complications are rare, minor and always reversible despite treatment often targeting high-value functional cortical and/or inaccessible areas 2) effective: benefit in terms of seizure control concerns 1/3+ patients with GO maintained long term from the 6th month after treatment 3) offers improvement in quality of life, especially for the 2/3 of patients considered inoperable after invasive exploration 4) no surgical burden on prognosis: 19/20 patients operated after RFTC failure are in Engel class 1 These results changed our SEEG exploration strategy by combining diagnosis and therapeutic potential until now unknown with this technique.

Benabid ( 1 Neurosurgery Department, CHU Michallon, Grenoble, France ; and 2 Neurology Department, CHU Michallon, Grenoble, France ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medically intractable partial epilepsy in adults, and surgery (anterior temporal lobectomy or a selective amygdalo hippocampectomy) is effective in the majority of patients. We have developed since 1998 a new surgical technic to treat non lesional TLE which consists in disconnecting the whole temporal lobe from the insula and surrounding structures. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and results of temporal surgical disconnection of patients suffering from non lesional TLE. Methods: Since 1998, 62 patients suffering from TLE, or extra TLE have been treated by surgical disconnection of the epileptogenic zone. Among this group, 45 patients (mean age: 35 y ± 10) suffered from TLE and underwent temporal disconnection (left and right disconnection in 20 and 25 patients respectively). There was 16 males and 29 females, 12 were left handed and 33 were right handed. All patients underwent a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation with MRI, chronic video-EEG recording and neuropsychological assessment. 16 patients (35%) underwent pre-surgical evaluation with depth electrodes (SEEG). All patients underwent a post operative MRI, neuropsychological testing, repeated scalp EEG and visual field examination. Temporal disconnection was performed under neuronavigation and consisted in disconnecting the lateral temporal neocortex, the whole hippocampus, para-hippocampus and the amygdala. Veins and arteries were spared in order to avoid post-operative temporal lobe ischemia and subsequent temporal lobe swelling. Results: At two years follow-up, 84.4% of patients were Engel's I (58% were Ia). Four patients were class II and 3 class IV. Post-operative clinical morbidity was as follow: persistent mild hemiparesia (n = 1) or mild facial paresia (n = 1), definitive quadranopsia (n = 23), hemianopsia (n = 1). In dominant temporal lobe, verbal memory was worsened in 69%. Radiological post-operative morbidity was as follow: 2 thalamic or pallidal limited ischemia without clinical consequences, 2 temporal horn cystic dilatation (one requested reintervention without clinical consequences). At 6 months and one year follow up, scalp EEG showed temporal spikes respectively in 27% and 19% of non cured patients compared to 8.5% and 6%of patients seizure free. Conclusions: Temporal disconnection was effective in 85% of patients (Engel's Class I). Post ?operative mild contro-lateral motor deficit was found in about 4%, quadranopsia in 51% and verbal memory deficit in dominant hemisphere in about 69%. Presence of spikes in post-operative scalp EEG was less frequent in patients seizure free. Comparative studies are required to evaluate temporal disconnection as an alternative to lobectomy in non lesional TLE. 1 Anita Datta, 1 Matt B. Wheatley, 1 Tom Snyder, 1 S.N. Ahmed, 1 Donald Gross, and 1 David B. Sinclair ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ) Rationale: The objective of the study was to review our experience and compare the results of the selective amygdalohippocampectomy in children versus adults with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective case series was used in the setting of a tertiary care hospital which provides care to both children and adults. All patients underwent a selective amygdalohippocampectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon and had at least one year of follow up. Patient charts were reviewed for pertinent clinical information and the data was compared between children and adults. Outcome measures included seizure frequency, neuropsychological assessment, EEG, neuro-imaging and anti-epileptic drugs pre and post-operatively. Results: Twenty three patients, 9 children and 14 adults were studied. Age at surgery varied from 6 to 58 years. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years. Surgical outcome was variable between the two groups. Amongst the younger cohort (6?18 years of age), 5 patients had good outcome (Engel Class I or II), two patients had a poor outcome (Engel class III) and two patients had refractory seizures (Engel Class IV) that required returning to the operating room for a standard anterior temporal lobectomy. This differed from the adults, who all had a good outcome. Ten patients were seizure-free (Engel Class I) and the remainder had rare seizures (Engel Class II). Non-MTS pathology was more common in children. Thirteen of 14 (93%) had MTS in the adult population, while only 4 of 9 children (44%) had MTS. The pathology at surgery in this group included mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), brain tumors, focal encephalitis and normal pathology. Conclusions: Selective amygdalohippocampectomy can lead to favorable seizure and neuropsychological outcome in adults with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. However, preliminary results show less favorable results in children. The difference is probably related to the different pathology between the two groups. Adults most commonly have MTS, whereas children more commonly have non-MTS temporal lobe pathology. Clinicians should be aware of this difference when considering surgical management in children with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. 1 Gena R. Ghearing, 1 Drahomira Sencakova, 2 Barbara Schauble, 1 Gregory D. Cascino, 1 Elson L. So, 3 Clifford R. Jack Jr., and 1 Gregory A. Worrell ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; 2 Section of EEG and Epileptology, Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Berne, Inselspital, Berne, Switzerland ; and 3 Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Unilateral hippocampal atrophy is associated with an excellent surgical outcome after temporal lobectomy. The management of patients with bitemporal disease is more controversial and many undergo intracranial EEG (iEEG) with bitemporal depth electrodes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of intracranial monitoring for predicting surgical outcomes in patients with both asymmetric and symmetric hippocampal volumes. Methods: Volumetric hippocampal analysis was performed on the MRIs of all consecutive intractable temporal lobe epilepsy patients between the ages of 16 and 45 years who underwent bitemporal depth electrode recording at our institution over a seven year period. Symmetric hippocampal volumes were defined by a difference between the right and left hippocampus between the range ? 0.1 and + 0.3 cm3. The hippocampal volumes were compared to age matched controls, and significant atrophy defined as greater than two standard deviation difference from control. The localization of ictal and interictal discharges on scalp and iEEG were reviewed, and surgical outcome determined for each patient. Results: Of the 27 patients, 14 had asymmetric and 13 had symmetric hippocampal volumes. The surgical outcome was available for 22 patients (four did not have surgery and one was lost to follow up) with an average follow up of 51 months. Ten of 12 surgical patients with asymmetric atrophy (83%) had an Engel class 1 outcome. Nine of these patients with a favorable outcome had significant atrophy on the resected side. The predominant side of seizure onset during iEEG was concordant with the smaller hippocampus in all patients who had significant atrophy. Four out of ten surgical patients with symmetric atrophy (40%) had a favorable outcome. The degree of atrophy did not predict surgical outcome. Two of the patients with a favorable outcome (50%) and three of the patients with an unfavorable outcome (50%) had significant bilateral atrophy. Of the four patients who had a favorable surgical outcome, three had a predominance of seizures arising from the resected side during iEEG, and three of the patients who had unfavorable outcomes also had a predominance of seizures from the resected side. Conclusions: In this limited retrospective study, patients with asymmetric hippocampal atrophy had a high probability (83%) of seizure free outcome. The smaller hippocampus was concordant with the predominant side of iEEG seizure onset in all patients with significant asymmetric atrophy. Conversely, only 40% of patients with symmetric hippocampal atrophy had favorable surgical outcomes, and iEEG did not prove helpful for predicting outcome. 1 Jorge A. Gonzalez, 2 Dileep Nair, and 1 William Bingaman ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 University Heights, OH ) Rationale: Treatment of patients who fail epilepsy surgery is problematic. Selected patients may be candidates for further surgery, potentially leading to a significant decrease in seizures frequency and severity. The purpose of this manuscript is to present our long-term outcome series of highly investigated patients who failed resective epilepsy surgery and subsequently underwent re-operative resective procedures. Additionally, our intention is to identify possible factors associated with unsatisfactory seizure outcome, improving selection criteria for re-operation in failed epilepsy surgery. Methods: We performed a retrospective consecutive analysis of patients who underwent re-operative procedures due to medically intractable epilepsy at our institution from 1990 to 2001. Seventy patients underwent re-operative epilepsy surgery with 57 patients having a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We assessed the relationship between seizure outcome and categorical variables using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and the relationship between outcome and continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For all analyses, statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05. Results: Of the 57 patients, there were 29 males and 28 females. Age of seizure onset ranged from 3 months to 39 years (mean 10.7 ± 10.3 years, median 7 years). The mean age at re-operation was 24.7 ± 12 years (range 4?50 years). Follow-up ranged from 24 to 228 months (mean: 128 months, mode: 132 months). Seizure outcome were classified according to Engel's classification and divided in two groups: Favorable outcome (Engel's classes I and II) and non-favorable outcome (Engel's classes III and IV). Fifty two percent of patients had favorable outcome. Patients with tumors as initial pathology had better outcome in comparison with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Re-operation in selected patients failing epilepsy resective surgery should be considered as approximately 50% of patients may have benefit. Patients with MCD and MTS are less likely to improve after re-operation. 1 Robert E. Gross, 1 Edward K. Sung, 1 David LaBorde, 1 Michele Johnson, and 1 Klaus Mewes ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Frameless image-guidance techniques for implantation of depth electrodes for intracranial monitoring are increasingly used, but few reports have assessed the accuracy and precision of these techniques. Methods: Frameless image-guidance using the Stealth? (Medtronic) neuronavigational hardware and Cranial? software was used exclusively for the implantation of depth electrodes since 1998. Electrodes were implanted through burr holes using an orthogonal (trans-temporal) approach (n = 32 patients), typically into the amygdala and 2 ? 3 electrodes in the hippocampus or parahippocampal gyrus on each side, or occipital approach (n = 3 patients). We analyzed the implantation of all electrodes for which the intra-operative planning trajectories (saved on the pre-operative MRI scan by the Stealth) and post-operative MR imaging were available (n = 155 electrodes: 150 orthogonal, 5 occipital). The pre- and post-operative image sets were registered using the navigational software, and a vector was constructed from the ?intended? target to the ?actual? location of the electrode tip (taking into account imaging artifact around the electrode). Results: The discrepancy between the ?intended? and ?actual? location of the orthogonal electrode tips was 5.6 ± 2.9 mm. There was no significant difference between accuracy of electrodes implanted on the first vs. second side as might be expected from brain shift, nor on the left (n = 80) vs. right (n = 70) side. The direction of error could be characterized as ?too deep? for 93 electrodes as opposed to ?too shallow? for 50 electrodes probably due to difficulty in securing the electrode precisely during placement. Five electrodes implanted via an occipital approach had an error of 7.7 ± 8.0 mm, reflecting lower accuracy and greater variability likely due to the longer passage. No patients implanted via an orthogonal approach required reoperation in contrast to 1 of 3 patients implanted occipitally. No complications definitively related to post-operative MR imaging were detected over the 150 electrodes and 32 patients, although 2 patients recently implanted experienced transient neurologic deficits which in one patient may have been infectious in etiology but in the other was uncertain. Conclusions: Frameless image-guidance implantation of depth electrodes via an orthogonal approach is an effective technique with sufficient accuracy for intracranial monitoring. 1 Marc Guenot, 2 Jean Isnard, 2 Philippe Ryvlin, 2 Helene Catenoix, 2 Francois Mauguiere, and 1 Marc Sindou ( 1 Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Hop. P. Wertheimer, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France ; and 2 Department of Functional Neurology, Hop. P. Wertheimer, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France ) Rationale: Except in case of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Syndrom (MTLE), and despite their more recent refinement, the noninvasive techniques still often fail to clearly localize the epileptogenic zone in a large number of patients presenting with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Different techniques of intracranial recordings are currently available. StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG), which consists in the stereotactic orthogonal implantation of depth electrodes (5 to 15, 11 on average) into the brain, is the only one allowing to record the mesial as well as the lateral aspects of the temporal lobe, including the depth of the sulci. The object of this paper is to display the curent usefulness of SEEG in terms of surgical strategy related to temporal resection, in 100 consecutive procedures. Methods: 100 patients, suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy arising from a temporal onset, underwent a SEEG procedure between 2000 and 2005. For each of these patients, the non invasive investigation, which included clinical and neuropsychological examination, long-term video-EEG recording, functional imaging, and MRI scan, were not in favor of a MTLE syndrom, and were not congruent enough to clearly identify the epileptogenic focus. Consequently, the sites of implantation of the electrodes were chosen in order to precise: either the side of the onset of seizures, or their uni or multilobar feature, or a possible strictly neocortical or insular onset of the seizures, and also, using direct electrode stimulation, the proximity of speech area. Results: Complications occurred in 3 patients (1 superficial infection, and 2 breakages of electrodes). -? SEEG was helpful in most (91%) of the 100 patients to confirm, or cancel, surgical indication, and to adjust the extent of the resection: -? In 33% of cases, SEEG-recordings led to an indication of a strictly extra-limbic lobectomy, i.e. a tailored (temporo-basal or lateral) neocortectomy sparing the temporo-mesial structures. -? In 20% of cases, SEEG led to a limited limbic resection, which included the amygdala, as well as the pole, while sparing most of the (non-atrophic) hippocampus. -? In 25% of cases, SEEG allowed to plan an enlarged temporal resection, despite the fact that it showed a wide, or even multiple, epileptogenic zone. -? In 13% af cases, SEEG allowed to definitly exclude the patients from surgery. -? In 9% of cases, SEEG confirmed the indication of a conventional limbic resection (anterior temporal lobectomy). Conclusions: SEEG proved to be a safe and a very useful method for complex cases candidate for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. It should be considered as soon as the non invasive investigation do not display a clear MTLE syndrome. 1 Hirochika Imoto, 1 Masami Fujii, 2 Jouji Uchiyama, 1 Nobuhiro Tanaka, 3 Kimihiko Nakano, 1 Sadahiro Nomura, 1 Hirosuke Fujisawa, 2 Takashi Saito, and 1 Michiyasu Suzuki ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Minamikogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ; 2 Applied Medical Engineering Science, Graduate School of Medicine Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ; and 3 Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ) Rationale: Local brain cooling using an implantable cooling system is an attractive prophylactic technique for seizures since it has a potential to be an alternative to a surgical resection of the epileptogenic foci. In this report, we applied the newly devised local brain cooling system to intractable epilepsy in humans. Methods: We utilized a Peltier chip as the cooling device and therefore applied this cooling device to two patients with medically intractable epilepsy. During surgery, cooling was performed for two minutes in the human cortex where the epileptiform discharges (EDs) were recorded and therefore it had to be resected. Electrocorticograms and the temperature just beneath the cooling site were recorded before and during cooling. Changes of EDs between before and during cooling were quantitatively analyzed. Results: The first case was a 12-year-old girl with temporal lobe epilepsy, while the second case was a 2-year-old boy with parietal lobe epilepsy caused by tuberous sclerosis. In both cases, EDs diminished during the cooling process when the temperature of the brain surface reached less than 25°C. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of the cooling device using a Peltier chip for the treatment of human epilepsy. Owing to recent advances in the precision machinery industry, an implantable local cooling system in humans is therefore expected to become a reality in the near future. 1 Floor E. Jansen, 1 Alexander C. Van Huffelen, 1 Ale Algra, and 1 Onno Van Nieuwenhuizen ( 1 Neurology, Pediatric Neurology, Clinical Neurophysiology and Clinical Epidemiology Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Cortical tubers are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability in the majority of patients with tuberous sclerosis. Seizures are often drug resistant. Uncertainties exist concerning the selection of patients suitable for epilepsy surgery. We performed a systematic review of the available literature to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery and to identify factors related to good seizure outcome. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of Medline, Embase, and bibliographies of reviews and book chapters published from 1960 until May 2006 was performed. Studies were included if they at least reported quantitative seizure outcome, and a description of the type of surgery. Seizure outcome was analysed both as seizure freedom and good seizure outcome (seizure reduction of >90%) versus poor seizure outcome. Results: Twentyfive studies, including 177 patients, were found to be eligible. Seizure freedom was achieved in 101 patients (57%). Seizure frequency was reduced by > 90% in another 32 patients (18%). Moderate or severe intellectual disability (IQ < 70) (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2?2.8), the presence of tonic seizures (RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2?2.4) multifocal abnormality on SPECT examination (RR 7.0; 95% CI 1.1?43) and corpus callosotomy (corpus callosotomy versus resective surgery RR 2.5; 95% CI 2.1?3.0) predicted an unfavourable outcome. Conclusions: A good outcome of surgery (seizures reduction of > 90% or complete cure) was achieved in 75% of patients. Resective epilepsy surgery should be considered in all drug resistant TSC patient, as a relation between multiple seizure types with early onset, multiple cortical tubers and multifocal or generalized epileptogenicity and a poor outcome is not supported.

Smith ( 1 Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Following an antero-temporal lobectomy, one third to one half of patients who become free of any disabling seizures continue experiencing auras. The cause of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), duration of the seizure disorder and the presence of generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures have been identified as predictors of post-surgical outcome folloiwng a temporal lobectomy. A comorbid psychiatric history has also been associated with a worse post-surgical seizure outcome in these patients. Predictors of persistence of post-surgical auras in patients free of disabling seizures are yet to be identified. Methods: 97 consecutive patients, 58 men and 39 women with a mean age of 30.6 ± 10.7 years who underwent an antero-temporal lobectomy at the Rush Epilepsy Center were included in the study. The cause of TLE was: mesial temporal sclerosis in 60 (62%), lesional TLE in 18 (18.5%) and idiopathic TLE in 19 (19.5%). The mean duration of the seizure disorder was 19.7 ± 8.8 years. All patients had undergone a psychiatric evaluation as part of their presurgical evaluation (not out of suspicion of psychiatric disorder). All patients had to have a minimal post-surgical follow-up period of 2 years before being included in the study (mean post-surgical follow-up: 6.9 ± 3.0 years). The folloiwng variables were entered into a logistic regression model to identify the predictors of achieving a seizure-free state without auras: cause of TLE, duration of seizure disorder, occurrence of GTC seizures and life-time history of depression. Results: Among the 97 patients, 37 (38%) were free of any disabling seizures and auras since the time of surgery (Class IA of Engel). An additional 43 patients (44.3%) were free of disabling seizures but had auras (Class I-B). A life time prevalence of depression of 48.5% (n = 47) was identified among the 97 patients. The absence of a life-time history of depression was the only variable that predicted the achievemnet of a seizure-free outcome without auras (p < 0.0001). This model correctly classified 76% the data. A lifetime history of depression continued to be a predictor, but to a lesser degree when the post-surgical outcomes consisted of freedom of disabling seizures with or without auras (p = 0.001) and freedom of disabling seizures in the last two years (p = 0.06). On the other hand the cause of TLE became a predictor in the setting of these two outcomes (p = 0.04 and p = 0.009, respectively). Conclusions: A presurgical history of depression appears to predict the peristence of auras after an antero-temporal lobectomy in patients that become free of diabling seizures. The pathogenic mechanisms that mediate thsi phenomenon are yet to be identified. 1 Keith W. MacDougall, 1 Jorge G. Burneo, 1 Richard S. McLachlan, 1 Andrew G. Parrent, and 1 David A. Steven ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ) Rationale: In many patients being considered for epilepsy surgery, a standard pre-surgical evaluation consisting of a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional neuro-imaging and a neuropsychological assessment is sufficient to identify the epileptogenic zone. When this evaluation cannot identify the epileptogenic focus, invasive intracranial electrodes are often required. Although there is considerable data about the outcome of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, most of these investigations examine all patients (with and without invasive recordings) together. This purpose of this study was to specifically examine patients who underwent invasive EEG and to determine how many of these patients eventually underwent resective surgery. In those who had surgery, we wished to examine the eventual outcome. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts for all patients admitted to the London health Sciences Centre Epilepsy Monitoring Unit between January 2000 and July 2004 for intracranial electrode monitoring. Surgical outcomes were reported using the Engel classification. We used a multivariate analysis to determine which factors if any were associated with successful surgery. Results: There were 103 subdural electrode implantations performed by our two epilepsy surgeons in 100 patients. Of these, 78 patients went on to have resective surgery. Temporal lobectomy was performed in 39 (50%) patients. One-year follow-up was available on 66 of the 78 patients (85%). Thirty patients (45%) realized an Engel I outcome at 1 year. An additional 20 (30%) had their seizure frequency significantly reduced. Predictors of an Engel I outcome included younger age (p < 0.0001) and having a temporal lobectomy (adjusted OR = 4.17; CI = 1.12 ? 12.8). Factors that did not significantly affect outcome included the duration, area, and location of electrode coverage, the presence of a pre-operative lesion or the final pathology. Conclusions: Excellent results from eventual resective surgery can be achieved in the subset of patients needing invasive recordings. Younger patients with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to have the highest likelihood of seizure freedom. The need for bilateral or multilobar electrodes did not negatively affect prognosis. 1 Taketoshi Maehara, 1 Tadash Nariai, 1 Toshiya Momose, 1 Chihiro Hosoda, 2 Kenji Ishii, 2 Kiich Ishiwata, and 1 Kikuo Ohno ( 1 Neurosurgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental Universuty, Tokyo, Japan ; and 2 Positron Medical Cente, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan ) Rationale: With the advent of intraoperative navigation systems, structural lesions disclosed by MRI can now be removed more easily and accurately. But in cases receiving epilepsy surgery, the seizures can only be stopped by removing the surrounding epileptogenic areas together with the lesions themselves. To accomplish this, we need to functionally detect peri-lesional epileptogenic areas during surgery. Our group recently introduced a method of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and C11-flumazenil (FMZ) PET co-registration as a reference for the detection of epileptogenic areas during image-guided epilepsy surgery for patients with organic lesions. In this study we investigated the clinical role of multimodal navigation epilepsy surgery using FDG-PET and FMZ-PET. Methods: We studied a series of 10 patients who suffered from intractable epilepsy and were found to have organic lesions on MRI. All of the subjects underwent FDG-PET and FMZ-PET studies before their operations. Surgical specimens demonstrated cavernous angiomas in 2 patients and benign tumors in 8 (3 low-grade astrocytomas, 2 DNTs, 2 gangliogliomas, and 1 monomorphous angiocentric glioma). The lesions were located in the mesial temporal lobe (mT) in 6 patients and in the extra-mesial-temporal lobe (extra-mT) in 4. Our first steps were to examine the relationships between the organic lesions and hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET, and then to compare the FDG-hypometabolic areas and low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET. Next, we performed intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) in and around the hypometabolic areas to examine the epileptogenicity of the hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET and the low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET. Results: 1) The hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET were much wider than the low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET in 8 cases, and slightly wider in 3 cases. 2) Spikes on intraoperative ECoGs were recorded in the hypometabolic areas in all 6 of the mT cases. 3) The hypometabolic areas were much wider than the ECoG-spiking areas in 2 of the 4 extra-mT patients, and slightly wider in the other 2. ECoG-spiking areas were wider than the low-uptake areas on FMZ. 4) Four of the 6 mT patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy and the other 2 underwent lesionectomy along with anterior temporal resection. The extra-mT patients underwent lesionectomy along with resection of any ECoG-spiking areas which exhibited hypometabolism on FDG-PET and low-uptake on FMZ-PET. 5) All 10 patients became seizure-free during follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 24 months. Conclusions: The use of multi-modal navigation surgery by FDG-PET and FMZ-PET in combination with intraoperative ECoG may become an important method for focus resection in epileptic patients with organic lesions, especially in patients with extra-mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. 1 Michiharu Morino, 1 Yumiko Urano, 1 Masaki Yoshimura, and 1 Kenji Ohata ( 1 Neurosurgery, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan ) Rationale: Although selective amygdalohippocampectomy was developed in epilepsy surgery to spare unaffected brain tissue minimizing the cognitive consequences of temporal lobe surgery, several previous studies have shown that it was equivocal whether selective amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable epilepsy could lead to a better memory outcome or not. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of selective surgery to short-term memory outcome in patients of intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampampectomy (TSA). Methods: The 51 patients received comprehensive neuropsychological testing of verbal and nonverbal memory, attension, and delayed recall before and 1 months after unilateral TSA. Results: Significant improvements in verbal memory and delayed recall were found particularly for the right resected group. For right TSA, the outcome of verbal memory was not related to hippocampal pathology, however, the risk for a nonverbal memory decline was increased when patients had non hippocampal sclerosis. After left TSA, there were no significant decline and it indicated that all aspects of memory were preserved after surgery although the risk for a verbal memory decline was increased of patients without hippocampal sclerosis.

Conclusions: The results indicate that left TSA can lead to preserve the memory function, particularly right TSA can lead to a significant improvements in memory functions. 1 William Murphy, 1 Terry Myles, 1 Walter Hader, 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 Lorie Hamiwka, 1 Elaine Wirrell, 1 Paolo Federico, 1 Nathalie Jette, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Reports on the diagnostic accuracy of structural MRI in detecting putative lesions in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery vary substantially, and are probably influenced by MRI protocols, types of lesions, and expertise. Using histopathology as the gold standard, we assess the overall sensitivity and specificity of structural MRI in an unselected cohort of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, and provide post-tests probabilities for negative and positive studies. Methods: In a retrospective cohort of consecutive cases undergoing resective epilepsy surgery, we identified those who had histopathological tissue examination,ie., the gold standard. MRIs protocols contained a combination of general and epilepsy-specific sequences, and experts and non-experts performed MRI interpretation. The presence or absence of a putative lesion on structural MRI, using epilepsy specific protocols, was compared with the presence or absence of a histopathological lesion. We obtained sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), positive and negative likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities using a range of plausible pre-test probabilities. We also obtained 95% confidence intervals around each estimate. Factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy were assessed when the sample size allowed. Results: Of 135 consecutive patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery, 117 had MRI and histopathological analyses. Histopathological abnormalities occurred in 104 patients (prevalence of 89%), of whom the MRI found a lesion in 93, yielding a false negative rate of 11%, and a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI = 83%, 95%). Of 13 patients with normal histopathology, the MRI showed a lesion in eight, with a false positive rate of 62%, and a specificity of only 38% (95% CI = 12%, 64%). The likelihood ratios for a positive and a negative MRI were 1.44 (low) and 0.3 (medium-high), respectively. Indicating that in this analysis, the MRI seems to be more useful when negative, because its false positive rate was too high. When the chance of finding a lesion is 50%, a positive MRI increases the probability to only 59%, and a negative MRI decreases is to 22%. Conclusions: In unselected patients undergoing epilepsy surgery Structural MRI has a sensitivity of almost 90% and a specificity of only 38%. The causes for the high false positive rate of MRI in our cohort are explored. Reference Von OJ, Urbach H, Jungbluth S, et al. Standard magnetic resonance imaging is inadequate for patients with refractory focal epilepsy. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2002;73:643?647. 1 Yu-tze Ng, 2 Norman C. Wang, 2 Steve C. Chung, 3 Erin C. Prenger, 1 Harold L. Rekate, 2 Iman Feiz-Irfan, and 1 John F. Kerrigan ( 1 Pediatric Neuroscience, Barrow Neurological Institute/St. Joseph's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 3 Neuroradiology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: Hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) are rare developmental abnormalities of the inferior hypothalamus that often cause refractory, symptomatic, mixed epilepsy. Multiple surgical approaches have been described. We present a series of 39 patients where a transcortical, transventricular, endoscopic resection was performed. Methods: Forty-two patients with refractory epilepsy underwent surgical resection of HH between October 2003 and April 2005 at our institution, i.e. all patients with more than 12 month follow-up. All patients underwent endoscopic resection and were prospectively studied. Neurosurgery was performed with the endoscope held by an articulated pneumatic arm and tracked with a frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system. Data collection and follow-up was performed by personal interview. Three patients were excluded because they underwent combined surgical approaches (subfrontal and transcallosal). Results: The average age of the patients was 15.8 years (range 8 months to 55 years). There were 24 males. All 39 patients had very frequent seizures, usually multiple types. The average number of each patient's total daily seizures was 18.2 (range 0.1?192) and an average of 2.2 seizure types each. 33 (85%) patients had trademark gelastic seizures at the time of surgery. The patients were on an average of 2.0 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 25 patients had either cognitive and/or behavioral impairment. Postoperative MRI demonstrated 100% resection and disconnection of the HH from the hypothalamus in 12 patients. There were no mortalities. Significant morbidity was limited to one patient with residual hemiparesis. Two patients were lost to follow-up. At latest follow-up (average 20.1 months (range 13 to 28 months)), 18/37 (48.6%) patients were seizure-free, 26/37 (70.3%) patients had >90% reduction in their seizures and another 8/37 (21.6%) of patients had 50?90% seizure reduction. Fourteen patients were off all AEDs. Twenty-five (67.6%) patients reported either improved cognition and/or behavior. The percentage of disconnection trended toward seizure freedom (p = 0.069). The percentage of resection did not significantly correlate with seizure freedom (p = 0.11). In an endoscopic resection group of 33 patients, the average length of post-surgical hospital stay was 5.8 days (SD = 3.1) as compared to 18 patients who underwent transcallosal resection and stayed for 8.7 days (SD = 4.7). This overall difference i.e. shorter hospital stay amongst the endoscopically resected patients was statistically significant (p < 0.03). Conclusions: Endoscopic resection of HH is safe and effective for the treatment of seizures. Its efficacy appears to be comparable to transcallosal resection of HH, however with significantly shorter patient recovery time post-operatively. 1 Tomonori Ono, 1 Keisuke Toda, 1 Shiro Baba, 1 Hiroshi Baba, and 2 Kenji Ono ( 1 Neurosurgery, National Nagasaki Medical Center, Omura, Nagasaki, Japan ; and 2 Yokoo Hospital, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan ) Rationale: Surgery for bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (Bi-TLE), herein defined as seizures arising independently from both temporal lobes, has been demonstrated to have poor efficacy. However, lateralized MRI abnormality and a preponderance of interictal spikes on EEG have been identified as factors for good surgical outcome. Ictal EEG findings are also a decisive factor for determining the resection side. Predominant ictal onset side (PIOS) is considered to be a direct measure of laterality of ictogenisity, however, this has yet to be quantitative analyzed. In this study, we reviewed our surgical series of Bi-TLE patients and determined the correlation between quantitatively assessed PIOS and postoperative outcome. Methods: We analyzed data from 23 patients with Bi-TLE who had undergone anterior temporal lobectomy. Patients' ages at the time of the operation ranged from 14 to 55 years (mean 31.2 years). Diagnoses of Bi-TLE were confirmed using subdural electrode recordings, and the side of resection was determined by PIOS. Postoperative seizure outcome was assessed using Engel's outcome classification between 9 and 161 months (mean 80 months) after surgery. Percentages of ictal onset side calculated on the basis of all recorded seizures and other clinical characteristics were correlated with postoperative seizure outcome. Results: Regarding postoperative seizure outcome, 9 patients (39.1%) were class I, 8 patients (34.8%) were class II, and 6 patients (26.1%) were class III. The following items were found to be statistically significant factors for good surgical outcome: 1) no history of severe encephalitis (p = 0.03), 2) higher percentage of PIOS (class I vs. class II-III, 87.6 ± 3.1% vs. 73.7 ± 3.3%, p = 0.009), and 3) lateralized lesion (p = 0.01), or absence of bilateral abnormalities on MRI (p = 0.02). Furthermore, multivariate analyses showed that factors 1) and 2) were independent predictors of good outcome. Conclusions: Surgery for Bi-TLE results in a greater reduction of seizures if preoperative evaluations show good predictive factors. In particular, when the percentage of PIOS is greater than 85%, a more favorable outcome can be obtained. 1 Andre Palmini, 1 Eliseu Paglioli, 1 Jaderson Costa, 1 Caroline Torres, 1 Jose Victor Martinez, 1 Eduardo Portela, 1 Helio F. Silva-Filho, 1 Eduardo Paglioli, 1 Mirna Portuguez, 1 Jose-Rubiao Hoeffel-Filho, 1 Ligia Coutinho, 1 François Dubeau, and 1 Frederick Andermann ( 1 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Pontificia Universidade Católica do RS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; and Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Incomplete resections are not uncommon in surgery for epilepsy due to FCD, however, the dynamics of long-term surgical outcome following these resections have not been investigated in detail. We report on the variable patterns of seizure recurrence following incomplete resections for FCD and relate these to the histopathologic type. Methods: Forty-two children and adult patients with FCD identified through MRI and/or confirmed on histopathology were followed for a mean of 54 months. In 25, a complete resection of the dysplastic tissue was not possible in a first operation. They all underwent preoperative evaluation and surgery was guided by acute ECoG and cortical electrical stimulation. Residual lesion was identified either at the end of operation or at post-op MRI. The degree of seizure control was evaluated periodically, and classified according to Engel's outcome scale. FCD lesions were classified histopathologically in types I, IIA, and IIB. Results: Three recurrence patterns were identified: (i) in 6 patients, seizures recurred within 7 days of operation, with higher frequency and intensity than in the preoperative period. Three needed ICU admission for status epilepticus; (ii) 9 presented recurrent seizures during the first post-op month and continued seizing with similar frequency as before surgery over the years or until reoperation. Finally (iii) 10 patients had a post-op seizure free interval between 3 months and 2 years, following which seizures recurred. Histopathologic types IIA and IIB were similarly represented in all 3 recurrence patterns. Conclusions: Lasting seizure freedom was incompatible with incomplete lesion resections in FCD types II A and B. Interference with inhibitory networks associated with dysplastic lesions may explain the patterns of running up of seizure frequency and intensity, particularly early post-resection severe deterioration leading to status epilepticus.

Jobst ( 1 Neurosurgery  Class II- 3 (14%); Class III- 2 (10%); Class IV- 3 (14%) Conclusions: Interhemispheric intracranial monitoring electrodes are a safe and effective tool in epilepsy surgery. 1 Fortino Salazar, 2 Imad Najm, 3 Prakash Kotagal, 1 Ann Warbel, and 1 William Bingaman ( 1 Neurosurgery/Epilepsy Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Neurology/Adult Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 Pediatric Neurology/Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Subdural grids (SDG) have been increasingly used in the evaluation of some patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. In a small number of patients the placement of SDG is not followed by a surgical resection. There is a paucity of data about these patients and the causes behind the lack of success in their invasive evaluation. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review the data on patients who were evaluated at our center with SDG. Methods: Adult and pediatric patients who underwent the placement of SDG, followed by prolonged video-EEG monitoring but did not have resective surgery were identified from the Cleveland Clinic database and their medical records were reviewed. A total of 233 patients underwent SDG placement between January 1997 and June 2005. The placement of SDG and prolonged invasive recordings did not lead to resective surgery in 29 (12%) patients who were included in this review. Mean age was 25 years (7 were < 18 years old). There were 15 males and 14 females. Average duration of seizures was 15 years. The MRI was interpreted as normal in 12 patients, other MRI findings included malformation of cortical development, schinzencephaly and focal brain atrophy. All patients had PET studies and when indicated a Wada test. The number of electrodes used varied between 56 and 160. Average monitoring duration was 8 days (between 4 and 19). Results: Reasons for NOT pursuing surgical treatment were: a) Identification of multiregional or non-localizable epileptogenic foci (12 pts), b) presence of epileptogenic foci in eloquent cortex (8 pts), c) lack of adequate coverage of the suspected ictal onset zone (5 pts), or d) the lack of seizure recording after SDG (2 pts). In two patients the evaluation was terminated because of surgical complications. Following the SDG evaluation, 6 patients had VNS implanted and 5 others are considering this option. Three patients are considering another invasive evaluation, one had a resective surgery at a later time, and 7 patients are only considering medical treatment. Conclusions: Approximately 12% of patients were not suitable candidates to undergo surgical resection. The two most common reasons were involvement of eloquent cortex and evidence of diffuse epileptogenic zone. It is important to refine or develop better ways to identify this group of patients prior to implantation, such as the use of fMRI, MEG and sophisticated EEG to avoid costly and risky procedures. 1 Kostas N. Fountas, and 1 Joseph R. Smith ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Georgia, Macon, GA ) Rationale: Implantation of subdural strip and grid electrodes represents a common methodology in the invasive evaluation of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Although in the vast majority of cases their implantation is safe, the occurrence of implantation-associated complications can be occasionally troublesome. The purpose of our current communication is to identify the most commonly occurred complications and calculate their frequency in our institution. Methods: In a retrospective study, 185 patients (104 males and 81 females) undergoing subdural strip/grid electrode implantation during a 20-year period, were examined. Their age ranged between 16 and 48 years, while their mean age was 23.6. AdTech (AdTech, Racine,WI,USA) strip and grid electrodes were used in all our cases. The anatomical location of implantation were:26 implants in orbito-frontal area, 41 in mesial frontal,14 in mesial occipital, 13 in antero-basal area, 44 in interhemispheric areas while 180 in convexity areas (4 temporo-polar, 83 parietal, 17 occipital and 76 temporal). The monitoring period ranged from 2?25 days (mean 10.8 and median 7 days). Results: The most commonly occurred complication in our series was the development of post-operative epidural hematoma in 3/185 (1.6%) patients, requiring emergent surgical evacuation. In 2/185 (1.1%) cases transient aphasia occurred, which was spontaneously resolved. A surgical subdural hematoma developed in 2/185 (1.1%) while in another 2/185 (1.1%) an infection occurred. Interestingly, in 2 patients (1.1%) significant brain edema was post-operatively evident; one of these patients was conservatively managed with no further consequences while the other one succumbed despite aggressive management of his intracranial hypertension. Finally, one patient developed post-operatively stiff lung syndrome secondary to aspiration and eventually expired. Another interesting observation in our series was the recording of non-habitual seizures in 5/185(2.7%) patients. Conclusions: Subdural electrode complications although rare can be troublesome and occasionally disastrous. Knowledge, early identification and prompt management of potential complications can minimize the risks associated with the surgical implantation of subdural electrodes. 1,2 William O. Tatum IV, 2 Kumar Anthony, 2 Leanne Heriaud, 1,2 Selim R. Benbadis, 2 Adele Haber, and 1,3 Fernando L. Vale ( 1 Neurology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ; 2 Neurology, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ; and 3 Neurosurgery, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: Epilepsy Surgery is a standard of care in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Intracranial electrodes can help identify surgical candidates when discordant information is present from the extracranial evaluation. We analyzed our experience with intracranial electrodes over 6 years. Methods: Two-hundred and fifty-eight resective epilepsy surgeries were performed from 2000?2006, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 years (range 2?65 months). Twenty-nine females and 21 males with a mean age of 29.4 years were implanted using an electrode array based upon the results of a standardized, non-invasive, pre-surgical evaluation. All patients were implanted at a single tertiary care epilepsy center between 2000?2006 by one neurosurgeon. Discordant information following a non-invasive evaluation including scalp-based video-EEG monitoring was obtained in each case. Resective surgical procedures, implanted array, and outcome were assessed. Outcome was reported as seizure-free, seizure improved (>50% of baseline), and no improvement, and was based upon information obtained at the time of last contact. Results: Fifty epilepsy patients (19.4%) were implanted with intracranial electrodes. Twenty-four patients (48%) had bitemporal placement, 15/50 (30%) were unilateral, and 11/50 were bilateral-extratemporal (22%). Thirty-seven (74%) underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and 13/50 (26%) were rejected as surgical candidates. Seizure freedom or improvement was noted in 9/14 (64.3%) implanted with unilateral electrodes, 14/24 (58.3%) with bitemporal electrodes, and 4/10 (40.0%) with bilateral-extratemporal electrodes. Resections were temporal in 27/37 (73.0%), and extratemporal in 10/37 (27%) including frontal in 6/37 (12.5%), multi-lobar in 2/37 (5.4%), parietal in one (2.7%), and occipital in one. At last follow-up, 21/27 (81.4%) of the temporal resections were either seizure free (33.3%) or seizure improved (48.1%). Only 5/27 (13.5%) failed temporal surgery, compared with 3/8 (37.5%) extratemporal resections. MRI demonstrated an abnormality in 19/50 (38%) with neuronal migrational disorders accounting for the most common cause. The presence of a lesion did not have a more favorable outcome (8/19; 42.9%) than those with cryptogenic causes (18/29; 62.1%) (p = 0.24, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: Most epilepsy patients requiring intracranial electrodes will be candidates for resective surgery. Bitemporal electrode placement for lateralization, and temporal resections were the most frequent surgeries performed. Patients implanted only with bitemporal electrodes, were not more likely than those with a lateralized array to benefit from resective surgery. Those with lesional epilepsy had no more favorable outcome than those with a cryptogenic etiology in our series. 1 Samuel Wiebe, 1 Walter Hader, 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 Terry Myles, 1 Lorie Hamiwka, 1 Elaine Wirrell, 1 Paolo Federico, 1 Nathalie Jette, and 1 William Murphy ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: There is a notion that patients whose epilepsy is associated with a putative lesion have better surgical outcomes than those without such lesions. However, cases are often selected and other prognostic often remain unexplored. We explore seizure outcomes in unselected cases of lesional versus non-lesional epilepsy surgery, as well as the variables that impact outcomes in the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive, unselected cases assessed post-surgical seizure freedom at the time of last follow-up in patients whose MRI showed and in those in whom it did not show putative lesions. We used survival analyses for the main comparison and single and multivariate analyses to explore factors that may influence outcome, such as age, duration of epilepsy, etiology, type of surgery and location of surgery. Results: Of 113 consecutive patients, 91(81%) had putative MRI lesions. An equal proportion (70%) of lesional and non-lesional cases had temporal lobe surgery. Patients without lesions were significantly more likely to have a family history of epilepsy (p = 0.03) and they had a trend towards a younger age at surgery. Two years after surgery 57% of lesional and 36% of non-lesional cases were seizure free (p = 0.07). As compared with temporal lesional cases, extratemporal lesional cases were younger at presentation (20 vs 38 years) and at surgery (17 vs 35 years) (p < 0.01), and their seizure free rate was lower (not significant). Preoperative deficits were more frequent in non-lesional extratemporal than in temporal cases. Of patients with frontal resections, most were non-lesional (p = 0.02). Conclusions: In unselected patients undergoing epilepsy surgery those without MRI lesions have overall poorer seizure outcomes, are younger (especially extratemporal cases), more often have a family history of epilepsy, and more often have frontal lobe epilepsy. 1 Charles M.

Epilepsy surgery, with the goal of resecting epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure relief, has become a viable therapeutic option in TSC. The purpose of the current study is to determine factors associated with seizure relief postoperatively in TSC patients utilizing multicenter data. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with TSC following surgery for relief of epilepsy was performed from multiple centers. Seventy subjects were analyzed. We studied patient characteristics (presence/absence of mental retardation, age at TSC diagnosis), electrophysiological characteristics (seizure onset age, ictal/interictal focality), seizure type (i.e., presence/absence of infantile spasms), tuber number, electrophysiological/neuroimaging concordance, surgical variables (age at surgery, surgical method, and number of stages), and postoperative residual dominant tuber as determined by neuroimaging. Data were analyzed for all 70 subjects as a whole and for subjects assessed two years or less postoperatively and more than 2 years postoperatively. Results: 27/70 subjects were seizure free (Engel Class I). Subjects with ictal multifocality, mental retardation, and discordant EEG/MRI data were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. However, only associations between seizure freedom and age at seizure onset, history of infantile spasms, and interictal focality were significant at all postoperative durations. The mean age at seizure onset was 2 years in seizure free subjects compared to 7 months in those with persistent seizures. Only 5/32 subjects with a history of infantile spasms were seizure free postoperatively. Focal interictal discharges were seen in 85% of seizure free subjects versus 32% of subjects with persistent seizures. The number of tubers was significantly associated with poor outcome when measured less than 2 years postoperatively. Conclusions: In patients experiencing seizure freedom following surgery for epilepsy in TSC, ictal focality, normal development, and concordant electrophysiological and neuroimaging data are common findings. However, similar features can also be observed in subjects with postoperative seizures. The current study suggests that later age at seizure onset, no history of infantile spasms, interictal focality, and fewer cortical tubers may be determining factors in seizure freedom. 1 Carolina R. Almeida, 2,3 Kette D. Valente, 2 Silvia Vincentiis, 4 Juan Castro, 4 Hung T. Wen, 1 Renato L. Marchetti, 1 Wagner F. Gattaz, and 1 Elida B.

The polymorphisms of single nucleotide (SNPs), alterations in a single nucleotide of DNA sequence, when non-synonymous, are capable of cause changes in protein's structure and have been studied in association studies. Recent studies demonstrated controversial results about the relationship between gene polymorphism and epilepsy. Several association studies involving more than 30 genes involved in Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS) are described. However, it remains the uncertainty in associations and the imperfection in replications. The objective of this study is the molecular characterization of MTS. Methods: Thirty patients with MTS, well characterized by MRI, were pared by sex and age with 30 controls without family history of neurological or psychiatric disorders to be genotyped. The authors investigated, through search of new DNA SNPs, susceptibility genes to developmental of MTS. Initially, more than 100 genes coding to ionic channels and other genes related to neuronal migration and neurogenesis were evaluated. From these, 82 genes were selected. These genes were previously described in association studies of epilepsy or studies of families. To the moment, we found 20 non-synonymous polymorphisms in 11 different genes. Results: In the initial experimental analysis, 14 SNPs find in 5 different genes were evaluated. The data show that for the first 30 patients, 8 SNPs were confirmed in 5 different genes (EFHC1, ME2, BRD2, BDNF and TMEM1). Conclusions: The number of patients and controls limited the statistical power of the ongoing study. Knowledge of these SNPs and their effect on genes involved with MTS may be important to help a better understanding of complexes pathways that characterize the neuronal hyperexcitability and the development of new strategies for treatment and diagnosis.

Minassian ( 1 Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ; and 2 Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Protein transduction domains (PTDs) may be capable of transducing full-length fusion proteins across plasma cell membranes and the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). They are therefore considered a promising tool for the development of protein therapy aimed at the central nervous system. In this study we analysed the characteristics of TAT-PTD genetically fused to cystatin B (CSTB), the protein responsible for the Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). Methods: A PCR product containing the EPM1 coding region was cloned into the pRSET vector containing the TAT-PTD sequence. A control protein was assembled by insertion of EPM1 cDNA into this vector, followed by removal of TAT-PTD. TAT-PTD-CSTB and CSTB were expressed in bacterial cells, purified and transduced into COS-7 cells and human lymphoblasts. Whole cell lysates and cellular fractions were obtained for study by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Transduced (and control) cells were also used for analysis through immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: Initial results pointed to an apparent time and concentration-dependent transduction of TAT-PTD-CSTB. However, careful investigation demonstrated that the nuclear localization of TAT-PTD-CSTB was an artifact of fixation and that the fusion protein was adhered to the plasma membrane. Conclusions: TAT-PTD-CSTB does not penetrate the cells. For this reason, even if TAT-PTD is likely able to cross the BBB, the fusion of this protein to CSTB cannot be used as a form of replacement of the intracytoplasmic protein missing in ULD. Importantly, we discuss precautions to avoid false-positive results when working with TAT-PTD for protein therapy of neurological diseases. 1,2 Anna-Kaisa Anttonen, 2 Erika Ahonen, 3 Eija Gaily, 3 Elina Liukkonen, 4 Marjo-Riitta Aine, 5 Eila Herrgård, 3 Liisa Metsähonkala, 6 Heikki Rantala, 2 Auli Sirén, and 2 Anna-Elina Lehesjoki ( 1 Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland ; 2 Folkhälsan Institute of Genetics and Neuroscience Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland ; 3 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland ; 4 Department of Child Neurology, Lapland Central Hospital, Rovaniemi, Finland ; 5 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland ; and 6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: Mutations in SCN1A are associated with many epilepsy syndromes such as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Mutations in SCN2A2 have been described in benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures and GEFS+ but to date only one SCN2A2 mutation has been associated with intractable epilepsy. We evaluated the contribution of SCN1A and SCN2A2 mutations to infantile onset intractable epilepsy in Finnish patients. Methods: SCN1A and SCN2A2 were screened for mutations in 33 patients, 21 of which had a clinical suspicion of SMEI. We amplified all exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCN1A and SCN2A2 from genomic DNA and sequenced the PCR products with an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequences were analyzed using the Sequencher 4.5 program. Results: We found six different de novo mutations in SCN1A: One nonsense, two splice site, one frameshift-causing and two missense mutations that change highly conserved amino acids. Two of the mutations were previously described. The clinical presentation in three of the mutation positive patients is SMEI. Two patients have borderline SMEI and one has a milder phenotype with normal cognitive development. We also found one previously undescribed de novo missense mutation of a conserved amino acid in SCN2A2 in a patient with infantile onset epilepsy and episodic ataxia. None of the mutations were observed in 192 control chromosomes. Conclusions: Our findings are compatible with previous findings showing that de novo SCN1A mutations are a major cause of SMEI. SCN2A2 mutations are found only in a small subset of infantile onset intractable epilepsy. 1 Christie Barker-Cummings, 1 W. Allen Hauser, and 1 Ruth Ottman ( 1 Sergievsky Center and Epidemiology Department, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Epilepsy and febrile seizures are complex disorders with both distinct and overlapping genetic influences. Febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy (individual comorbidity). In addition, each disorder aggregates in families, and an increased risk of each disorder has been reported in the relatives of probands with the other. No single study has comprehensively examined the contributions of shared and distinct genetic influences to these observations. We aimed to evaluate the overlapping genetic contributions to epilepsy and febrile seizures by studying patterns of co-occurrence, within individuals and within families, in a large genetic epidemiologic study. Methods: The study population comprised 2279 full siblings of 879 probands with epilepsy from the Epilepsy Family Study of Columbia University. Data on febrile seizures were obtained by interview of at least one of the proband's parents. We evaluated the risks of epilepsy in siblings without febrile seizures, and febrile seizures in siblings without epilepsy, in relation to the proband's febrile seizure history and family history of febrile seizures and epilepsy in other first-degree relatives. We considered four types of family history: epilepsy alone, febrile seizures alone, both epilepsy and febrile seizures, and neither. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute rate ratios [RRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CI] for epilepsy, and logistic regression to compute odds ratios [ORs] for febrile seizures. Results: Epilepsy risk in siblings was not associated with a history of febrile seizures in the proband (RR = 0.5, CI 0.17?1.35). As expected, epilepsy risk was associated with a family history of epilepsy in other relatives (RR = 3.6, CI 1.78?7.47). Epilepsy risk was not associated with a family history of febrile seizures alone (RR = 1.4, CI 0.47?3.85), but was strongly associated with a family history of both febrile seizures and epilepsy (RR = 8.9, CI = 3.92?20.05). The risk of febrile seizures in siblings was associated with a history of recurrent febrile seizures in the proband (OR = 2.3, CI 1.17?4.60), but not with a history of a single febrile seizure in the proband. As expected, febrile seizure risk was associated with a family history of febrile seizures (OR = 4.3, CI 2.54?7.39). Febrile seizure risk was also associated with a family history of epilepsy alone (OR = 2.3, CI 0.99?5.16). As in the analysis of epilepsy, febrile seizure risk was strongly associated with a family history of both epilepsy and febrile seizures (OR = 6.1, CI 2.46?15.18). Conclusions: These results provide evidence for familial clustering of epilepsy and febrile seizures that is not attributed to individual comorbidity of the two disorders. Familial clustering was strongest in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy. The findings are reminiscent of the syndrome GEFS+, which has previously been described only in highly selected pedigrees.

A beneficial effect of transdermal nicotine has been reported in one single case. We aimed to investigate the influence of tobacco habits on seizure activity in two families with ADNFLE. Methods: Interviews focusing on the pattern of nicotine intake and seizure activity were performed in 22 adult mutation carriers belonging to two ADNFLE pedigrees with different mutations in the gene coding for the nAChR α4 subunit. Results: Ten of 14 tobacco consumers were seizure free, whereas all seven non-smokers with manifest ADNFLE had persistent seizures. In several patients, remissions and fluctuations of epileptic symptoms clearly appeared to correspond to changes in tobacco habits. Furthermore, one pharmacoresistant patient who had recently begun treatment with transdermal nicotine had experienced improvement. Conclusions: Tobacco appears to be an environmental factor which influences the course of ADNFLE. An inactivation of the mutant nAChRs by desensitization during chronic nicotine exposure may explain the beneficial effect. In pharmacoresistant patients with ADNFLE, treatment with transdermal nicotine should be considered, weighing efficacy against potential long-term harmful effects. Prospective studies are needed.

Of seven studies reporting association tests between variation in ABCB1 and response to anti epileptic drugs (AEDs), three showed positive association, while four did not. Two papers showed association in a case control design, suggesting ABCB1 variation is related to seizure susceptibility. We report the first association study on a cohort of patients and controls from the US and Canada. Methods: Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) c1236t and c3435t was performed using TaqMan assays. Samples were collected at 7 sites and all subjects (ages 3?70) were recruited according to local institutional review board policies. Blood samples were obtained and most are available as cell lines from the Coriell Institute. Both markers were typed in 297 generalized patients (70 AED resistant), 253 focal patients (88 AED resistant) and 184 controls, all of European ancestry. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was checked and alleles tested for association using chi square tests. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype effects were calculated using likelihood ratio and CHAPLIN respectively. AED response was defined as one year of seizure freedom since last checkup. Results: All markers were in HWE and the SNPs were in strong LD, p = 1 ? 10?3. Single marker analyses showed a lack of association for drug response or seizure susceptibility. However, an association was observed between AED response and the CC haplotype in generalized patients (p = 0.007). Haplotypes CC and TT were strongly associated with seizure susceptibility comparing all cases to controls p = 1 ? 10?7. Conclusions: We conclude that variation in ABCB1 is weakly associated with AED response in our generalized patients and is strongly associated with seizure susceptibility in all patients. The same haplotpye that confers drug resistance also increases risk for seizures suggesting a relationship between susceptibility and AED response.

Several key shortcomings in the study design of previous studies have been identified such as insufficient sample sizes, insufficient coverage of genes and lack of replication of detected associations. Here we attempt to integrate these factors in to the largest genetic mapping study to date in epilepsy. Methods: Through the establishment of a multinational collaborative effort, a collection of 3107 epilepsy patients phenotyped for the principal seizure and syndrome types and 1797 healthy controls was assembled. Two hundred and seventy nine candidate genes were selected. For each of these genes bioinformatically-inferred functional variants were identified. Tagging SNPs were also selected for 198 of the 297 genes. In total 4608 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate platform across all 4904 participants. Results: Preliminary analyses show an enrichment for significant p values (p < 0.05) but no one p value is strong enough to withstand correction for multiple testing. Conclusions: This result suggests that the data contain a number of risk factors but the effect of any one of these risk factors is marginal. Data analyses will be enhanced by additional genotyping currently ongoing.

Cendes ( 1 Department of Medical Genetics, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Missense mutations in the mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene have been identified to co-segregate with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) patients. In addition, functional studies have demonstrated that expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene induces apoptosis in neurons in culture. However, the exact relationship between mRib72?1/Efhc1 function and epileptogenesis is still unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene in mouse brain in order to investigate its possible role in programmed cell death during development. Methods: Balb/c mice were submitted to programmed mating to obtain animals in different developmental stages. The brains of embryos aged 15, 17 and 18 days old and of neonates aged 1, 7, 14 and 28 days old were subsequently removed. We used brain of three animals for each age studied. After RNA extraction, the relative gene expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 was determined by the real-time PCR technique using TaqMan? assay. GAPD gene expression was used as an endogenous control. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate that the expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 is higher in embryos than in neonates (p = 0.001), with a progressive decrease from embryos aged 18 days to neonates. Conclusions: The highest expression of the mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene in embryo brains in comparison to neonates suggests that the putative pro-apoptotic role of this gene may be necessary for the correct organization of the central nervous system during its initial phases of development.

Eksioglu and 1 Masanori Takeoka ( 1 Neurology/Epilepsy, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: The Aristaless-related homeobox gene, ARX, is a transcription factor with a crucial role in the development of forebrain, pancreas and testes. Located in the X chromosome (Xp22.13), ARX mutations cause a pleiomorphic array of phenotypes such as mental retardation, lissencephaly, infantile spasms, and abnormal genitalia in males. Based on human genetics and loss-of-function studies in mice, ARX appears to be crucial in the regulation of GABAergic interneuron development and maintenance of circuitry. Ohtahara syndrome consists of epileptic encephalopathy, suppression-burst EEG-pattern and refractory epilepsy with tonic spasms in young infants. Despite reports of neonatal epilepsy, Ohtahara syndrome has not been previously described in infants with ARX mutations. Methods: We describe a boy with Ohtahara syndrome who presents with refractory seizures since day-1-of-life caused by a novel mutation in the ARX-gene. His initial presentation with startle and jerking movements, evolve into brief tonic seizures, refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs including phenobarbital, zonisamide and levetiracetam. Despite a normal MRI, EEG reveals suppression-burst-pattern. He is normocephalic without dysmorphism, except for micropenis and bilateral cryptorchidism, in addition to diffuse hypotonia without weakness. Later, he develops infantile spasms with partial response to vigabatrin. Results: ARX nucleotide sequence analysis, by Athena diagnostics (Worcester, MA), including entire coding regions and intronic sequences of exon-intron splice junctions, revealed that the proband was hemizygous for a novel mutation comprising 1 base pair insertion of C after nucleotide position 1471, resulting in a frameshift at codon 491. Analysis of mother's DNA revealed that she was heterozygous for the same mutation in ARX-gene, hence, demonstrating her as a carrier(City of Hope Clinical Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Duarte, CA). Conclusions: This is the first reported case of Ohtahara syndrome as consequence of a novel mutation in exon 5 of the ARX-gene. Insertion of a C after position 1471 in the ARX gene leads to a frameshift that completely changes the structure of the ARX protein from amino acid 491, affecting the composition of the C terminal end. This leads to the disruption of the aristaless-domain, which is known to play crucial role in central nervous system regionalization with respect to its potential role in transactivation activity. The molecular pathology observed in this novel mutation reflects the complexity associated with ARX protein structure and function. The aristaless domain, localized to exon 5 in the C terminal end of the ARX protein, stands out as an important region in ARX protein signaling. Hence, further genetic/molecular studies are necessary to better understand the function of the aristaless-domain and its association with the Ohtahara syndrome in our patient with this novel mutation. 1,2,3 Marco Fedi, 1,4 Leon Bach, 1,3 Samuel F. Berkovic, 1,3 Ingrid Scheffer, and 1,5 David C.

Mutations of nAChRs subunits are linked to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), a syndrome characterized by clusters of nocturnal frontal seizures with no overt endocrinological manifestations. Here we assessed the effect of central cholinergic activation on the release of anterior pituitary hormones in individuals with ADNFLE. Methods: Thirteen subjects with the α4-Ser248Phe mutation (4 male, mean age 43.2 ± 16.8) and 41 healthy volunteers (24 male, mean age 36.2 ± 12.2) were studied. Serum levels of GH, LH, FSH, PRL, TSH, thyroxine and cortisol were measured at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes after infusion of physostigmine. Results: In controls, cholinergic activation increased the serum levels of GH (mean change + 993%, p < 0.001), PRL (169%, p < 0.001) and reduced the levels of FSH (?7.9%, p < 0.002). In contrast, in subjects with the a4-Ser248Phe mutation no changes in the release of these hormones were observed (GH 104% p > 0.2; PRL 5.2%; p > 0.8, FSH ? 0.8% p > 0.2). Physostigmine increased cortisol levels both in controls (p < 0.01) and in subjects with the mutation (p < 0.03). Between subjects repeated measure ANOVA showed a selective difference in the release of GH and PRL (time*group interaction GH p < 0.04; PRL p < 0.01) following administration of physostigmine. Conclusions: The α4-Ser248Phe mutation selectively affects cholinergic-mediated GH and PRL secretion, a finding that may be of pathophysiological significance given the role of somatostatin in experimental models of focal epilepsy. 1 Tracy A. Glauser, 1 Katarzyna Bryc, 1 Todd G. Nick, 1 Donald L. Gilbert, 1 Ericka Holt, 1 Steven Fordyce, and 2 Frank R. Sharp ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Neurology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA ) Rationale: Specific genomic profiles have been noted in the blood of patients with various neurological disorders including Down syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, Tuberous Sclerosis, and Tourette syndrome. This study aimed to determine if specific genomic profiles existed in the blood of children with newly diagnosed and untreated idiopathic epilepsy compared to normal children. Methods: Patients with untreated idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), untreated idiopathic partial epilepsy (IPE) or healthy children with no history of epilepsy (NML) were enrolled in this IRB approved study. RNA was extracted from whole blood and gene expression was determined using Affymetrix U133 2.0 PLUS microarray chips. Using microarray expression data, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with epilepsy type (IGE v. IPE v. NML), gender and age (where age was dichotomized over the median of 10 years) was used to identify genes (with a 90% confidence of having false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1) that differentiated between the three groups (IGE, IPE and NML). Pairwise comparisons were performed to identify significantly differentiated genes between groups. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed on the IGE and IPE groups from the genes that differentiated between the three groups. GO classes and parent classes with at least 5 observations in the selected subset and with an Observed vs. Expected ratio of at least 2 were reported. Results: A total of 79 children were enrolled; 21 with IPE, 30 with IGE and 28 NML patients. After adjustment for age and gender, 460 genes (with a 90% confidence of having FDR < 0.1) were differentially expressed among the epilepsy groups. Pairwise comparisons showed: IGE v. NML had 301 significantly differentiated genes, (overall p = 0.002), IPE v. NML had 308 significantly differentiated genes (overall p = 0.003) and IPE v. IGE had 26 significantly differentiated genes (overall p < 0.001). From the 460 genes which differentiated the IGE v. IPE v. NML with FDR < 0.1, two gene ontologies were found in the comparison of IGE v. IPE, where the 61 most significant genes contained no more than 5 false discoveries with 90% confidence. The two gene ontologies were intracellular non-membrane-bound organelle (GO id 0043232) and non-membrane-bound organelle (GO id 0043228) each with Observed vs. Expected ratios of 2.67. Conclusions: Specific genomic profiles exist in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and idiopathic partial epilepsy that differentiate from normal controls and from each other. These profiles may provide insight into the underlying process and may represent an additional tool for proper diagnosis and classification of pediatric epilepsy.

Debakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Mutations of ion channel genes are recognized as an important cause of defined inherited syndromes in epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias. We are reporting preliminary data on the following; (1) the prevalence of cardiac co-morbidities and (2) the frequency and spectrum of genetic variation in the five major genes associated with long QT syndrome in patients with idiopathic epilepsies (IE). Methods: 153 patients with IE were systematically recruited and detailed phenotypic data regarding epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias were collected. DNA samples were analyzed by sequencing across five major LQT genes (SCN5A, KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2). Results: Routine ECG was performed in 41/153 individuals. The study was abnormal in 13/41 (32%) subjects. 9/41 (22%) patients had both an abnormal ECG and a medical history positive for syncope, cardiac palpitations or skipped beats. 2/153 (4%) patients were lost due to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) within one year of follow-up. Interim DNA sequence analysis of the five major LQT genes in the IE population showed that 27% of all the LQT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were exon bound variants of which 45% was represented by protein altering/non-synonymous SNPs (NS-SNPs). NS-SNPs were most commonly found in the SCN5A (33%) and KCNH2 (43%) genes. SCN5A and KCNH2 NS-SNPs were also the most frequent genetic variants found in patients with dual phenotype of cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. Conclusions: The prevalence of inter-ictal cardiac arrhythmias in our cohort of idiopathic epilepsy patients was similar to the prevalence of ictal arrhythmias cited in the literature [(39%) by Nei et al.Epilepsia.2004;45(4):338?345, and (35%) by Opherk et al. Epilepsy Res.2002;52(2):117?27]. The presence of relatively frequent non-synonymous coding variants in the SCN5A and KCNH2 genes in IE patients with a cardiac phenotype suggests their involvement in the comorbid dual clinical phenotype of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

We present a young boy with early-onset infantile spasms, severe encephalopathy, tetralogy of Fallot, and bilateral cataract, in whom a deletion at Xp22 comprising the Nance Horan Syndrome (NHS) gene and CDKL5 gene was detected by array-CGH. Methods: Brain MRI, video EEG, metabolic and infectious work-up, karyotype, subtelomeric screening, and array-CGH were carried out in the proband. Results: The boy was diagnosed shortly after birth with a Tetralogy of Fallot, mild facial dysmorphism, extreme hypotonia, and bilateral microphthalmia with microcornea and congenital nucleocortical cataract. At age 7 weeks he developed myoclonic seizures, occurring most frequently post-prandial or during drowsiness. EEGs during wakefulness and sleep were normal. At age 4 months, the seizure pattern was consistent with infantile spasms, but no hypsarrhythmia was seen on EEG. At age 5 months, he developed tonic spasms, sometimes preceded by crying or accompanied by laughter or oral automatisms. A video EEG at age 6 months showed multiple myoclonic jerks without EEG correlate, as well as several tonic spasms characterized by sudden onset low voltage rhythmic diffuse 15 Hz activity followed by generalized slowing. No typical epileptiform activity was seen. Seizures were resistant to treatment with valproic acid, vigabatrine, topiramate, phenobarbital and levetiracetam. At age 10 months, he is severely retarded with no reaction to light stimuli, severe axial hypotonia, and absent midline organization. Additional investigations were normal, except for a de novo deletion of approximately 2.8 Mb at Xp22 including 16 genes of which the only known disease-associated genes are the NHS gene that causes the ophthalmologic abnormalities and the CDKL5 gene that is responsible for the severe epileptic encephalopathy. Conclusions: This is the first description of a male patient with a deletion of the NHS and CDKL5 genes, showing the involvement of CDKL5 in severe epileptic encephalopathy in males. The epilepsy phenotype was characterized by drug-resistant early-onset infantile spasms, tonic spasms and myoclonic jerks, without clear epileptiform EEG correlate.

Butman, 2 Sadat Shamin, and 2 William H. Theodore ( 1 G.H. Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Clinical Epilepsy Section and Diagnostic Radiology Department, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a form of idiopathic lateral temporal lobe epilepsy frequently caused by mutations in the leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene. Subjects with epilepsy in families with LGI1 mutations have not generally been found to have mesial temporal sclerosis or other structural brain abnormalities detected on MRI. However, in one previously reported family with an LGI1 mutation, a lateral temporal malformation was identified in 10 individuals. This result was important because it strongly supported the concept that LGI1 influences risk through a neurodevelopmental mechanism. We attempted to replicate these findings in other families. Methods: We studied 15 subjects (10 affected, 2 clinically unaffected mutation carriers, 3 unaffected non-carriers) from six ADPEAF families, each of which had a different LGI1 mutation. Subjects underwent high-resolution structural MRI on a Philips 3-tesla scanner, including MPRAGe, FLAIR, t1 and t2 sequences, and neuropsychological testing with a special emphasis on language measures. MRIs were analyzed by radiologists blinded to clinical and genetic data. Results: Subjects ranged in age from 20?81 years; nine were male and six female; and education ranged from 13?21 years. These factors were similar in affected and unaffected subjects. We found no evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis, malformations of cortical development, or abnormal gyral patterns in any of the 15 subjects. One affected individual (age 63) had bilateral T2 increases, and two unaffected subjects, neither of whom carried a mutation, had incidental findings thought to be unrelated to epilepsy (a bifrontal white matter abnormality, and marginally lower right temporal neocortical volume). Verbal IQ scores were significantly lower in subjects with epilepsy than in those without epilepsy (ave. 108 vs. 124, p = 0.012). Among subjects without epilepsy, however, verbal IQ was similar in subjects who carried a mutation (ave. = 124) and those who did not (ave. = 125), suggesting that the difference in verbal IQ was more likely to be due to epilepsy or its treatment than to the mutation per se. In contrast, average scores for the oral word association test were lower both in subjects with epilepsy (94) and clinically unaffected mutation carriers (95) than in noncarriers (120) (p = 0.048). Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the previously reported association of LGI1 mutations with a structural brain abnormality detectable on high-resolution MRI.

Kauffman, 2 Dolores Gonzalez Moron, 1 Damian Consalvo, and 1 Silvia Kochen ( 1 Centro de Epilepsia, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; and 2 Neurology Residency, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Previous studies have examined the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the promoter region of Interleukin 1b gene (IL1b ?511T) on Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and Febrile Seizures (FS) susceptibility, but they have been inconclusive. The aims of the present study were to define the role of this polymorphism on TLE and FS susceptibility and to obtain more precise estimates of the risk associated with this genetic variant. Methods: Published studies up to Febuary 2006 of TLE, FS and IL1b ?511T SNP were identified by searches of PubMed, Biosis, Web of Science and Embase databases. Meta-analysis of TLE and FS case-control data were performed to assess the association of IL1b ?511T SNP with TLE, TLE with Hippocampal Sclerosis (TLEHS) and FS. Pooled Odds Ratios were estimated by means of a genetic-model free approach. Quality of Studies included was assessed by a score. Publication Bias was investigated by Egger and Begg tests. Results: A total of 12 studies were included where 7 examined the association with TLE (with a total of 1798 subjects) and 5 examined the association with FS (with a total of 1299 subjects). The data analyzed by the genetic model-free approach indicated that the best model of inheritance is recessive. This model for allele T produced significant results in the TLE sample [fixed effects odds ratio 1.30 (1.01?1.69)] and in the TLEHS sample [fixed effects odds ratio 1.69 (1.26?2.27)] (Figure below), whereas for FS the results were non-significant [fixed effects odds ratio 1.33 (0.95?1.84)]. There was not evidence of Publication bias (Egger and Begg tests non-significant for TLE, TLEHS and FS samples). Quality was heterogeneous between studies. Conclusions: Overall, these findings support a role for IL1b ?511T gene variant in TLE under a recessive mode of inheritance. Further explorations of the involvement of the IL1b gene in the susceptibility to FS, with a greater number of studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to fully establish the role of the IL1b gene in this condition.

In epilepsy, prolonged antiepileptic drugs induce hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) TT type, which induce cerebrovascular disease and congenital fetal abnormalities such as neural tube defects. Because folic acid decreases homocysteine level, folic acid is useful treatment in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.We studied to assess factors that have affects on the decrease of homocysteine levels in epilepsy patients, especially according to single nucleotide polymorphisms. Methods: We prospectively included 75 epilepsy patients admitted at Pundang CHA Hospital between 2002 and 2005. All patients treated with antiepileptic drugs during one year and examined homocysteine levels at two times: initial and last time (one year later). When hyperhomocysteinema (homocysitne > 12?mol/L) was found at initial time, patients were supplemented with daily 400?g folic acid for one year. All patients were divided into two groups; increase group (IG) and decrease group (DG) according to the change of homocysteine levels between initial and last time. Also, all patients examined various polymorphisms, such as MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, methionine synthase A2756G, and thymidylate synthase gene polymorphisms. Results: Among 75 patients, IG was 31 patients and DG was 44 patients. Decrease of homocysteine levels during one year was observed in young age, initial high level of homocysteine, use of folic acid, presence of family history, and semiology of complex partial seizure. There were no significant differences of homocysteine levels according to polymorphisms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that folic acid can cheaply decrease homocysteine levels in epilepsy patients with hyperhomocysteinemia. We recommend administration of folic acid in old epilepsy patients with generalized and symptomatic seizures since homocyteine level did not increase in the young age patients with complex partial seizure and family history. 1 Patrick Kwan, 2 Virginia Wong, 3 Ping W. Ng, 4 Colin H.T. Lui, 5 Ngai C. Sin, 1 Andrew C.F. Hui, 1 Lawrence K.S. Wong, 1 Yu Evelyn, and 1 Larry Baum ( 1 Division of Neurology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ; 2 Department of Paediatrics, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ; 3 Department of Medicine, United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ; 4 Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ; and 5 Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong ) Rationale: There is conflicting data whether CC genotype of the C3435T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ABCB1 gene is associated with multi-drug resistance in Caucasian epilepsy patients. There is wide ethnic variation in the genotype frequencies of this SNP. We investigated whether the association might be observed in ethnic Chinese. Methods: ABCB1 3435 was genotyped in 518 Chinese patients with epilepsy, classified as drug resistant in 221 and drug responsive in 279, and 179 control subjects without epilepsy. Phenotypic definitions were similar to previous studies in Caucasian subjects. Drug resistance was defined as at least 1 seizure per month despite treatment with 2 or more antiepileptic drugs, and drug responsive as seizure free for at least 1 year on treatment. Genotype was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Results: As compared with patients with drug responsive epilepsy, patients with drug resistant epilepsy were more likely to have the TT genotype at ABCB1 3435 than CT or CC genotypes (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 ? 4.1, p = 0.004). The frequency of CC genotype was similar between patients with drug resistant and drug responsive epilepsy. There was no difference in genotype frequencies between the control subjects and the two patient groups. Conclusions: In Chinese patients with epilepsy, ABCB1 3435TT was found to be associated with drug resistance. The results contradict those reported in Caucasian subjects, and highlight the complexity of the potential role of ABCB1 3435 SNP in the pathogenesis of drug resistant epilepsy.

Bazan ( 1 LSU Neuroscience Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA ) Rationale: Experimentally induced epileptogenesis elicits profound changes in early response gene (ERG) expression in the mammalian brain. In these studies we analyzed early (0?6 hr), medium (1?7 da) and long term (2?8 wk) changes in the DNA-binding of transcription factors (TFs) AP1, AP2, Egr1, HIF-1, STAT1, NF-kB, NFIL-6, SP1 and TFIID to target DNA sequences in adult rat hippocampus after a single kainic acid (KA) injection. These TFs are enriched in the immediate promoters of the cFOS and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) ERGs. Methods: To trigger epileptogenesis, male albino Wistar rats were injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg KA using saline as a vehicle. At indicated time points (0, 1, 3, 6 hr; 1, 3, 7 da and 2, 4, 8 wk) rats were sacrificed and hippocampal and cortical cellular and nuclear proteins and total RNA were co-isolated from the same samples. TF-DNA binding was studied using gel shift and super-shift assay; RNA message levels were determined using DNA array analysis, RT-PCR and Northern blots. cFOS and COX-2 protein levels were quantified using Western immunochemistry. Results: Of the TFs examined, AP1, HIF-1, NF-kB and STAT1 binding were found to display oscillatory DNA binding profiles over the short, medium and long term. AP1-DNA binding kinetics strongly correlated with COX-2 gene activation over the short term while NF-kB-DNA binding paralleled COX-2 gene expression at longer time points. Sustained increases in TFIID-DNA binding suggested prolonged de novo induction of transcription from TATA-containing rat hippocampal genes. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that induction of the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic TFs AP1, HIF-1, NF-kB and STAT1, and their binding to specific target DNAs in ERG promoters, drives inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression in a phasic fashion. These data also support the notion of a global re-programming of hippocampal gene expression patterns long after a single KA-induced triggering of epileptogenic events.

An Italian family from Sardinia with sleep-related seizures with prominent fear and wandering is presented. Methods: Clinical information, EEG studies and blood samples were obtained. A genome-wide linkage analysis was performed, followed by electrophysiological studies of transfected HEK293 cells expressing either the newly identified nAChR alpha2 mutant subunit or the wild type receptor. Expression pattern of the genes coding for the alpha2 and 4, and beta2 nAChRs in areas of autoptic human brain was also performed. Results: Ten family members had clusters of seizures during sleep. Mean age at seizure onset was 10 years. The proband had since 6 years of age, clusters of sleep-related brief episodes with awakening, vocalization, fearful expression and movements of the tongue. The remaining individuals had nocturnal clusters of similar episodes including complex motor behaviors such as walking outside the room. The genome-wide linkage analysis showed a locus on chromosome 8p12.3?8q12.3, and a heterozygous missense mutation in the nAChR alpha2 subunit gene (CHRNA2) was detected in all 10 affected individuals. Whole-cell recordings of transfected HEK293 cells showed that the CHRNA2 mutation markedly increased the receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine. The expression pattern of alpha2 mRNA in autoptic human brain exhibited the highest level in the thalamus, but a diffuse expression was detected in the investigated samples. beta2 and alpha4 mRNA were uniformly distributed throughout the samples. Conclusions: CHRNA2 is the third nAChRs gene to be associated with familial sleep-related epilepsies. CHRNA2 mutation causes a complex ictal behavior with prominent fear and wandering. The alpha2 subunit showed the highest expression in the thalamus, hence confirming that mutations in nAChRs genes are involved in the epileptogenesis related to sleep-arousal mechanisms.

Domingues, 1 Rafael B. Marchesini, 1 Neide F. Santos, 2 Eliane Kobayashi, 2 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: The association between temporal lobe epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) has been well established; as well as the use of hippocampal atrophy (HA) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an in vivo surrogate marker of MTS. One of the risk factors associated to MTS is childhood prolonged febrile seizures. We have described a type of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with evident familial recurrence associate with HA but low frequency of febrile seizures. Previous pedigree and complex segregation analyses provided evidence for the presence of a major gene predisposing to HA in familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (FMTLE). The objective of this study was to identify the region harboring the main gene associated with HA in FMTLE by a genome-wide linkage study. Methods: Genome-wide scan was performed using a total of 332 microsatellite markers at ?12cM intervals. An additional 14 markers were genotyped in the candidate region. Two-point and multipoint LOD scores were calculated with the LINKAGE computer package. We assumed an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Results: We identified linkage to chromosome 18p11.3?11.2, with a maximum LOD score of 3.60 at ?= 0.0 for the D18S976 marker in a single family (F-10) with 11 affected individuals with HA. Multipoint and haplotype analyses localized the locus within a 6 cM interval flanked by markers D18S976 and D18S452. No other significantly positive LOD score was detected for this family in the entire genome. Conclusions: This is the first conclusive evidence that HA may be caused by genetic factors, which can have major implications in the study of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MTS and its relationship with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Murai, 1 Ricardo Horiuchi, 2 Daniel Martins, 1 Cláudia Maurer-Morelli, 2 José Camillo Novello, 3 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Biochemical Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 3 Neurology Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common and severe type of partial epilepsy, representing ?50% of all adult epilepsy patients and frequently associated with pharmaco-resistance. The relationship between MTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is well established. However, the precise pathogenesis of HS and its relationship with MTLE is not completely clarified. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) is a powerful fractionation method for complex protein mixtures. In difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) based proteomics, the experimental and control samples are labeled with different fluorophores and are run in the same gel, thereby minimizing gel preparation variation. DIGE is one of the few techniques that is capable to perform quantitative proteomics, generating statistical data to differences in protein abundances. Methods: We analyzed the proteome of three hippocampus removed from patients with refratory MTLE who underwent epilepsy surgery. Results: 2DE-DIGE identified 2 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated proteins as determined by Student's T-test (p ≤ 0.01). The observed molecular weight of the spots ranged from 28 to 93 kDa. Conclusions: The identity of these spots will be elucidated by mass spectrometry in order to gain additional information in a global scale about the mechanism of epileptogenesis in MTLE.

Methods: This family was identified through a national French campaign for familial epilepsy. It spans 4 generations and consists of 51 members with 13 affected. The medical history of all members was obtained by personal information and by consulting the medical files of each affected member. All family members gave a written consent to participate and 26 DNA were available for genetic study. Results: Clinical study: All affected members presented FS with CAE in 5 members and TLE in one. All FS stopped before the age of 6 and they recurred less than 4 times. Patients presenting CAE had recorded absences and characteristic EEG with 3 Hz spike waves. FS were simple except in one patient who had a long lasting complex FS (45 minutes) that occurred at 8 months of age. He presented later pharmaco-resistant TLE. He had a left hippocampal sclerosis on brain MRI. All family members have a normal psychomotor development.Genetic study: The FS trait segregates as autosomal dominant trait. The genetic study allowed the exclusion of any linkage with reported loci for FS and FS plus (FS+), especially with the locus of GABRG2 gene on chromosome 5q reported in a family presenting FS+ and absences. A genome wide search with 380 markers allowed us to localize a new gene responsible for FS on 3p. We could not exclude another genomic segment with positive Lodscore (Z = 1.94 at ?= 0.00). All patients presenting further epilepsy (CAE and TLE) shared a common haplotype on this locus in addition to the FS haplotype on 3p. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the genetic heterogeneity of FS. Epilepsy in association with FS could result in this family from an interaction between at least 2 genes: the gene on 3p with a modifier gene.

Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; and 3 Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Valid screening methods to identify people with a history of seizures or epilepsy are crucial for epidemiologic studies. They are also essential to identify affected family members in genetic studies. Screening relies on careful history-taking, but it is not clear what questions should be asked, or how accurately they identify affected individuals. Methods: We designed an 8-question screening interview to identify people with a history of seizures. The first question asks, ?Have you ever had, or has anyone ever told you you had, epilepsy or a seizure disorder?? If this question is answered ?no,? it is followed by a second question that asks, ?Have you ever had a seizure, convulsion, fit or spell under any circumstances?? This is followed by six additional questions that screen for symptoms possibly related to seizures (e.g., uncontrolled body movements, unexplained change in mental state, etc.). Subjects who screen positive are given a detailed diagnostic interview to confirm seizure occurrence and obtain additional clinical details. The interview was administered by telephone to 148 subjects with medical record documented incidence of unprovoked seizures from 1935?1994 while residing in Rochester, Minnesota, and 168 age- and sex-matched controls. Interviewers were blinded to case-control status. Results: Sensitivity was defined as the proportion who screened positive (?yes? or ?possible? to any screening question) among those with either epilepsy (n = 124) or an isolated unprovoked seizure (n = 24); specificity was defined as the proportion who screened negative among the controls. Sensitivity was 86% for epilepsy and 75% for isolated unprovoked seizures. Specificity was 92%. Sensitivity was significantly higher for subjects with incidence in 1955 or later than for those with earlier incidence (epilepsy: 89% vs. 71%, isolated unprovoked seizure: 82% vs 0%[0/2]). Among subjects with epilepsy who screened positive, 87% answered ?yes? or ?possible? to the first question (asking about epilepsy or a seizure disorder), 9% to the second question (asking about seizures under any circumstances), and 4% to another question. Among subjects with isolated unprovoked seizures who screened positive, 56% answered ?yes? or ?possible? to the first question and 44% to the second question. Conclusions: This screening instrument is highly effective (89% sensitivity) for identifying people with onset of epilepsy up to 50 years before interview. Subjects are more likely to be missed if they had onset of epilepsy even earlier, or had an isolated unprovoked seizure rather than epilepsy. Further analyses should address the relation of sensitivity to clinical epilepsy features, so that sensitivity can be improved by targeting new questions to particular subgroups.

Lachhwani, 2 Ajay Gupta, 2 Elaine Wyllie, and 2 Prakash Kotagal ( 1 Neurology, Section of Pediatric Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurology, Section of Pediatric Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Up to 30% of children with mental retardation (MR) have epilepsy and up to 45% of children with epilepsy have MR (Epilepsia. 2000 Sep;41(9):1214?20). The report of the Amalfi group raised concern about missing treatable causes of epilepsy; as a result diagnostic metabolic testing in children with developmental delay and epilepsy is commonly performed . (J Child Neurol. 2002 Dec;17 Suppl 3:3S98?102) A standardized approach to such testing does not yet exist, and the prevalence of metabolic disease in this population is not known. Methods: Records of the 429 children admitted to the pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit during 2005 were reviewed. We noted the presence or absence of developmental delay, type of EEG discharges (focal-mixed or generalized), and presence or absence of metabolic testing. Metabolic studies included: a) Plasma amino acids, biotinidase, lactate/pyruvate, acylcarnitines, ammonia levels, transferring isoelectric focusing, peroxisomal testing, and uric acid; b) CSF amino acids, glucose and lactate/pyruvate levels; and c) Urine organic acids, uric acid and creatine/guanidinoacetate levels. Results: 20% of our patients received some metabolic testing (85/429). Metabolic abnormalities were found in 48% of these patients (40/83), with 31% of these individuals having findings of mitochondrial dysfunction (27/85) with elevations in a) plasma alanine/proline/sarcosine (amino acids); b) plasma lactic acid; and c) urine lactic acid, 3-methyl-glutaconic acid and Kreb cycle intermediates (organic acids). Metabolic abnormalities were most common in those with focal discharges (70%; 21/30), when compared to multi-focal (53%; 8/15) and generalized (40%; 13/32) discharges. Secondary carnitine deficiency (26%, 22/85) and valproate related isolated elevations in plasma glycine (63%, 5/8) were also commonly seen. A single patient with a disorder of creatine metabolism was identified. Only 11% of the patients had CSF analysis done (10/85) with a 30% yield of abnormalities (3/10), including elevations in alanine, glutamate or glutamine. Of 9 patients with seizures but normal development, 6 had metabolic abnormalities identified (66%). Only 17 individuals received their first MRI at our institiution, with 86% (12/14) having structural abnormalities found, and one of these individuals, with a cortical heterotopia, having mitochondrial disease diagnosed. Conclusions: Metabolic abnormalities may represent a significant finding in individuals with epilepsy, especially in those with developmental delays, even despite findings of a focal structural brain abnormality. A systematic approach to the diagnoses of these individuals is needed. A consult with a metabolic specialist is encouraged in these patients if a diagnosis is not known. Disorders of mitochondrial metabolism should be placed high on the differential list. 1 Patricia A.O. Ribeiro, 2 Lourenço Sbragia, 3 Rovilson Gilioli, 4 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Pediatric Surgery, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 3 CEMIB, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 4 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Mutations in LGI1 gene were described in patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy and preliminary functional studies point to a possible involvement of LGI1 with migration and/or neuronal proliferation. However, the precise function LGI1 remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to determine the expression pattern of the Lgi1 gene in mice brain during development and in adult animals. Methods: Programmed mating was carried with Balb/c mice in order to obtain embryos of different ages. The brains of three animals at the following ages were removed: E15, E17, E18 days (E: embryo), P1, P7, P14, P28, P42 and P56 days (P: post-natal). Gene expression assays were carried out using real time PCR with the TaqMan? system. In addition we used an endogenous control (Gapdh gene) and all experiments were performed in duplicates. Results: Lgi1 gene expression was significantly low during the intra-uterine ages increasing gradually until P56 (adult animal). Samples from P28, P42 and P56 presented a seven fold increase in expression as compared to E15 samples. Conclusions: The pattern of Lgi1 gene expression that we observed suggests a predominantly inhibitory function during development of the central nervous system (low expression during embryonic stages). In addition, we may speculate that in more advanced ages, when neurons are already differentiated, its inhibitory function could be also essential, which can be suggested by the high expression in adult mouse brain.

Brodie ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Division of Cardiovascular  median age 34 years, range 14 ? 72 years) who had benefited (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency) from treatment with CBZ monotherapy were included in the analysis. Individuals who did not tolerate the drug and/or those who did not experience significant efficacy were specifically excluded. Common genetic variants in CBZ-related DMEs, including specific cytochrome P450s (CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP1A2) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1), were screened by conventional polymerase chain reaction ? restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) or direct sequencing. Associations were identified and characterised by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses, respectively. Results: All genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). No single clinical characteristic or genetic variant was sufficient to predict CBZ maintenance dose. However, a multiple logistic regression model incorporating patient age at time of optimal seizure control (OR = 1.03, 95%CI 1.00?1.07, p = 0.024), genotype of EPHX1 c.337T>C (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.22?0.87, p = 0.018) and genotype of EPHX1 c.416A>G (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.22?0.98, p = 0.044) demonstrated a significant association with maintenance dose (r2= 0.16; p = 0.009). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that a combination of age and genetic variants of the EPHX1 gene can be used to predict optimal maintenance doses of CBZ. Further investigations are required in an effort to strengthen the predictive value of this observation before its clinical utility can be realistically assessed.

Greenberg ( 1 Biostatistics, Division of Statistical Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 3 Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: In linkage genome scans of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) we found evidence for linkage on chromosome 5p with the juvenile absence phenotype. There are at least two candidate genes in this region: Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) and Programmed cell death 6 (PDCD6). Methods: We examined this region for association with Juvenile Absence Epilepsy (JAE) and Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE), genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around SDHA and PDCD6. We used case-control and family-based association methods to determine the degree of association. Results: We found that CAE is strongly associated with all SNPs tested in the PDCD6 gene (maximum chi-squared = 21.22, p < 0.0001 at rs4957014). JAE, in contrast, was not significantly associated with PDCD6 or any SNPs in the region studied. These results were confirmed in the family-based association analysis. The odds of having CAE if one carries at least one copy of the associated allele at the rs4957014 locus is 3.2 times the odds for an individual without a copy of the allele at this locus (95%CI: 1.91 ? 5.37). Conclusions: Our results suggest that not only does PDCD6 play a role in CAE susceptibility, but that different genes contribute to susceptibility in CAE and JAE; no association was seen in the JAE group. This implies that CAE and JAE cannot necessarily be treated as having the same genetic basis. Although there may be susceptibility genes common to the two (or more) syndromes, treating them as one genetic entity could mask the existence of genes for only one of the syndromes. It is especially interesting that this is at least the second apoptosis gene that appears to be related to a form of IGE.

We detected two heterozygous missense mutations (P11S, S15F) in the alternative signal peptide, exon1a of GABRB3 segregating with CAE affected members of three Hispanic families. The same missense mutations were not present in 34 other probands with CAE and 440 Hispanic healthy controls Here, we report on the functional consequences of these missense mutations. Methods: Expression constructs: We used mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-SPORT 6 into which was cloned exon1?9 of GABRB3 and pFP-N1 [GFP fusion vector]. We amplified the mutation containing Exon1a with designed primers with restriction enzyme sites, and replaced Exon1 in pCMV-SPORT6 with Exon1a with/without mutations. The construct which has the region from exon1a to exon9 without stop codon was amplified from the replaced vector. After digestion, each construct was cloned into pFP-N1. Immunoblot analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs and examined 48 hours post-transfection and homogenized. Protein samples were run on a 10% Tris-HCl gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. After blocking, the filter was processed through sequential incubations with the primary antibody for 1 h, and then with horseradish secondary antibody for 1h. Immunoreactive proteins on the filter were visualized using Typhoon software 9410. Results: Immunoblot studies revealed that both P11S and S15F mutations in exon1a decreased the expression of the protein level when compared with controls. The average densitometric image quantitation was 33%(±0.014) of control for P11S and 69%(±0.14) of control for S15F, normalized to actin density(n = 3). Conclusions: Our results indicate that both P11S and S15F mutations in exon1a decrease expression of protein levels and suggest less trafficking of the nascent peptide from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell membrane. GABRB3 is a main component of GABAR in reticular nucleus of thalamus and expressed transiently in other thalamic nuclei in the perinatal period, decreasing in adult. We speculate that the decreased expression of GABRB3 in developmental brain leads to absence seizures. 1 Simone S. Tsuneda, 1 Fabio R. Torres, 2 Maria A. Montenegro, 2 Marilisa Guerreiro, 2 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia T. Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in FLN1 gene are responsible for bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH). We identified a novel mutation (1159G>C), in a family segregating BPNH. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which this mutation lead to abnormal FLN1 protein was unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of this new mutation. Methods: Total RNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples, from 2 BPNH patients (mother and daughter) and control individuals. RT-PCR was performed by standard techniques and the cDNA was amplified using specific primers spanning the region containing exon 6 and exon7. Amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T vector, gel-purified and subsequently sequenced, using SP6 and T7 primers. Results: Analysis of the cDNA amplicon demonstrated a different pattern of electrophoretic migration between patients and controls. The sequencing of these fragments showed that amplicons from individuals with BPNH kept the intronic sequence between exons 6 and 7. Conclusions: Our data clearly showed that the molecular mechanism of the mutation 1159G>C is the abolishment of the exon 6 donor splicing, resulting in an alternative stop codon and, possibly, in a truncated protein. Thus an aminoacid substitution, as suggested previously, is not the mechanism involved in the etiology of BPNH sydrome in the patients analysed. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 V. Udani, 2 R. Shukla, 1 P. Munot, 1 L. Iyer, 2 S. Prakash, 1 S. Pujar, and 2 G. Chandak ( 1 Child Neurology  and 2 Genome Research Group, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, India ) Rationale: Cohen syndrome (MIM 216550) is an autosomal recessive disorder with features of psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, joint laxity, progressive retinochoroidal dystrophy, myopia and neutropenia. Characteristic facial features include high-arched or wave-shaped eyelids, a short philtrum, thick hair, and prominent incisors. Clinically homogenous in the Finnish population, non-Finnish patients show considerable variability. Seizures have never been described in Cohen's syndrome. The genetic locus for Cohen syndrome was recently mapped to chromosome 8q and truncating mutations in the COH1 gene were identified. In Finnish patients a founder mutation, C1117fsI1124X has been consistently found while other mutations have been associated with the atypical non-Finnish Cohen's syndrome. One of us (VPU) observed several clinical features of Cohen's syndrome in Indian patients with cryptogenic epilepsy. A pilot study confirmed eight Cohen-like features in a group of children with cryptogenic epilepsy when compared with controls. This prompted us to study the COH1 gene in such patients. Methods: We systematically studied patients with cryptogenic epilepsy and a Cohen-like phenotype for all features of Cohen's syndrome and included only those with at least 5/8 clinical features that we had found to be significant in our previous study. We initially screened for all the reported common mutations and later sequenced all 62 exons of the COH1 gene in this cohort of 24 patients. We also collected DNA from age, sex and ethnically matched controls. Results: We found several novel mutations such as Y413X, A829T and G3407R in the COH1 gene in 8 of 24 patients (33%). Interestingly, we did not find any of the earlier reported mutations including the most common mutation, C1117fsI1142X. The commonest mutation Y413X was identified in 4 patients, of which one was a compound heterozygote with the G3407R mutation. These mutations were not observed in any of the 100 controls. The mutations were mostly observed in the heterozygous condition except in one patient who was homozygous for the G3407R mutation. We could not find any clinical differences in the patients with and without mutations. However the patients with mutated COH1 had a significantly higher number of Cohen's syndome features than those without the mutations. Conclusions: We conclude that novel COH1 mutations are strongly associated with Indian patients of cryptogenic epilepsy with a Cohen ? like phenotype. There is however a possibility of additional mutations in the non-coding regions of the COH1 gene or in other genes.Functional analysis will throw more light on the mechanisms by which these mutations may be causally related to the epilepsy which is a characteristic feature in these patients.

Marques-Dias ( 1 Neurophysiology Laboratory-Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 2 Biology, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 3 LIM 21 ? Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 4 Pediatrics, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Angelman syndrome (AS) results from deletion (DEL), uniparental disomy,imprinting anomalies or UBE3A mutations. Patients determined by DEL have a severer phenotype. In 95% of AS patients caused by DEL,two main classes are found: Class I with breakpoints at BP1 (proximal) and BP3 (distal), and Class II with breakpoints at BP2 (proximal) and BP3 (distal).The remaining 5% have the distal breakpoint at BP4 and BP5.We formerly described that BP1-BP3 patients are more severely affected,on clinical grounds,than BP1-BP2 patients. The study of electroclinical data in these distinct groups of DEL patients has not been done. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the importance of breakpoint on the electroclinical phenotype in patients with DEL. Methods: The authors evaluated 18 DEL patients (6 were Class I; 10 were Class II and 2 were Class III and IV). Diagnosis was made by methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN-SNURF gene and by microsatellite profiling of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region. We characterized epilepsy by history obtained with a questionnaire including:occurrence of epilepsy;age of onset;seizure type;epilepsy aggravated by fever;severity of epilepsy determined by:daily seizures; disabling/injurious seizures;more than 3 seizure types;status epilepticus (SE) and;history of refractory epilepsy. These data were corroborated by medical records, personal contact with previous physicians, and video-EEG monitoring. Patients underwent a mean of 2.6 EEGs. Suggestive EEG patterns for AS were classified according to Boyd et al.and were studied as to morphology, duration, occurrence, frequency, amplitude and distribution. Results: Class I had more daily (p 0.0357) and disabling seizures (p 0.0350). They also presented a higher frequency of SE(p 0.0357). Both groups had similar rates of epilepsy aggravated by fever (p 0.5879); however, in Class I these events evolved to SE(p 0.0357). Polytherapy was more frequent in Class I (p 0.0350), associated with the refractoriness observed in this group.No statistical difference was observed as to age of onset, age of seizure control, seizure type and diversity of seizures presented by these patients. Background abnormalities, interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges were similar in both groups. Suggestive EEG patterns of AS were high in both groups. Occurrence of prolonged and frequent runs of these patterns did not show statistical differences. Conclusions: Epilepsy was more severe and refractory to treatment in patients with large deletions. Therefore, deletion is not a homogeneous group and breakpoint is predictive for epilepsy severity in AS, representing an important factor in parents' counseling. On the other hand, EEG patterns of AS seem to be reliable for diagnosis, despite the breakpoint.

Abramowicz ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, ULB-Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium ; 2 Medical Genetics, ULB-Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium ; 3 Pediatric Neurology, AZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium ; and 4 Pediatric Neurology, UCL-Saint Luc, Brussels, Belgium ) Rationale: Rare, mendelian forms of epilepsy amenable to positional cloning help understand the molecular mechanisms of epilepsy. Methods: Three female patients from two consanguinity loops in a large inbred Morroccan family were investigated for progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). After exclusion of known causes, linkage study and analysis of candidate genes were performed. Results: Epilepsy started between 18 and 24 months of age after normal psychomotor development. Seizure types were multifocal myoclonus affecting limbs and face and aggravated by movements, and febrile generalized tonic-clonic in one patient. EEG showed slow dysrythmia, multifocal epileptiform discharges without reproducible temporal relationship with myoclonus and occasional generalized epileptiform discharges. Photosensibility was present in one patient. Giant somatosensory evoked potentials were not found. Cerebral MR imaging and fundoscopy were normal. In 2 patients, seizures were refractory to anti-epileptic drugs. Evolution was unfavourable in both of them: one patient died from septic shock in the course of a corticosteroids trial, and the other one, now aged 9 years, showed progressive dysarthria, dementia and ataxia with lost independent walking at age 7. Epileptic seizures were controlled under lamotrigine and clonazepam in the third patient, now aged 16 years, who presented profound mental retardation and dysarthria without ataxia. GeneChip analysis of 11K SNPs showed a 15 Mb homozygous haplotype common to the 3 patients. Further analysis using microsatellite markers confirmed linkage of the disease to a 5 cM pericentromeric region of chromosome 7, with a maximum multipoint LOD of 4.2 at D7S663. In silico inspection showed the gene for a Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain homolog, KCTD7, close to D7S663 within the segment. KCTD7 contains a BTB/POZ-type domain and has strong homology with the T1 domain of the voltage-gated potassium channels. Direct sequencing of KCTD7 revealed a C to T transition creating a stop codon in exon 2, homozygous in patients and heterozygous in parents. Conclusions: PME in our patients was associated with a mutation of the KCTD7 gene encoding a putative potassium channel tetramerization domain, consistent with a defect of membrane repolarization.

AB  - To the Editor: In 1993 Valparaíso San Antonio Health Service initiated an Organizational Development Programme that included all facilities, extending from the six major hospitals to the 26 primary care clinics of the region. The programme adopted Quality Management as its model, without discarding other concepts and methods of proven effectiveness (see Walton 1992; Al-Asaf 1993; Ishikawa 1993).?In 1994 the Health Service Council identified the emergency care system as a model in need of great improvement and considered the incorporation of pre-hospital care as a top priority. The challenge was to implement a new system, affordable with a small budget, with greater satisfaction for staff and users, better coordinated and more responsive to local needs (see Ministère de la Santé 1992). ?Quality management techniques were used to adapt and develop a new model, essentially designed by local staff, based on the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and other relevant literature (Burnett  Grijseels et al. 1996; Gwinnutt  Hu  Jabbour et al. 1996; Boyington 1995). A ?network? model rather than a centralized one was chosen and implemented at a very low direct cost, optimizing existing resources.

AB  - Abstract Background: Non-operative management (NOM) of blunt splenic injuries is nowadays considered the standard treatment. The present study identified selection criteria for primary operative management (OM) and planned NOM. Methods: All adult patients with blunt splenic injuries treated at Berne University Hospital, Switzerland, between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed. Results: There were 206 patients (146 men) with a mean(s.d.) age of 38·2(19·1) years and an Injury Severity Score of 30·9(11·6). The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classification of the splenic injury was grade 1 in 43 patients (20·9 per cent), grade 2 in 52 (25·2 per cent), grade 3 in 60 (29·1 per cent), grade 4 in 42 (20·4 per cent) and grade 5 in nine (4·4 per cent). Forty-seven patients (22·8 per cent) required immediate surgery. Transfusion of at least 5 units of red cells (odds ratio (OR) 13·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 5·08 to 37·01), Glasgow Coma Scale score below 11 (OR 9·88, 1·77 to 55·16) and age 55 years or more (OR 3·29, 1·07 to 10·08) were associated with primary OM. The rate of primary OM decreased from 33·3 to 11·9 per cent after the introduction of transcatheter arterial embolization in 2005. Overall, 159 patients (77·2 per cent) qualified for NOM, which was successful in 143 (89·9 per cent). The splenic salvage rate was 69·4 per cent. In multivariable analysis age at least 40 years was the only factor independently related to failure of NOM (OR 13·58, 2·76 to 66·71). Conclusion: NOM of blunt splenic injuries has a low failure rate. Advanced age is independently associated with an increased failure rate. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.
