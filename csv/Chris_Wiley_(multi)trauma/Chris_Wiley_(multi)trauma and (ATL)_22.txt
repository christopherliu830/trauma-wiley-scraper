AB  - Abstract Although osteomyelitis (OM) remains a serious problem in orthopedics, progress has been limited by the absence of an in vivo model that can quantify the bacterial load, metabolic activity of the bacteria over time, immunity, and osteolysis. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a murine model of implant-associated OM in which a stainless steel pin is coated with Staphylococcus aureus and implanted transcortically through the tibial metaphysis. X-ray and micro-CT demonstrated concomitant osteolysis and reactive bone formation, which was evident by day 7. Histology confirmed all the hallmarks of implant-associated OM, namely: osteolysis, sequestrum formation, and involucrum of Gram-positive bacteria inside a biofilm within necrotic bone. Serology revealed that mice mount a protective humoral response that commences with an IgM response after 1 week, and converts to a specific IgG2b response against specific S. aureus proteins by day 11 postinfection. Real-time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR) for the S. aureus specific nuc gene determined that the peak bacterial load occurs 11 days postinfection. This coincidence of decreasing bacterial load with the generation of specific antibodies is suggestive of protective humoral immunity. Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of luxA-E transformed S. aureus (Xen29) combined with nuc RTQ-PCR demonstrated the exponential growth phase of the bacteria immediately following infection that peaks on day 4, and is followed by the biofilm growth phase at a significantly lower metabolic rate (p?<?0.05). Collectively, these studies demonstrate the first quantitative model of implant-associated OM that defines the kinetics of microbial growth, osteolysis, and humoral immunity following infection. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT At the time of the first meeting of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 1909, surgical treatment for epilepsy had been accepted as an alternative therapy for over two decades, but was rarely practiced, considered a last resort for carefully selected patients. Localization was based on ictal semiology and identification of a structural lesion. Very few papers on epilepsy surgery were presented at ILAE meetings or published in Epilepsia during the first half of the 20th century. A modest explosion in interest in epilepsy surgery at mid-century resulted from recognition that ?invisible? epileptogenic lesions could be identified by EEG, especially for temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery received a second boost in popularity toward the end of the 20th century with the advent of structural and functional neuroimaging, and the number of epilepsy centers worldwide doubled between the first Palm Desert conference in 1986 and the second Palm Desert conference in 1992. Neuroimaging also helped to increase application of surgical treatment to infants and young children with severe epilepsies. Epilepsy surgery was accepted as standard of care for drug-resistant focal epilepsy and was well-represented at international ILAE congresses and in Epilepsia. Advances continue into the 21st century with the introduction of laser ablation, and palliative neuromodulation approaches, which have greatly increased the population of patients who can benefit from surgery. Modern presurgical evaluation techniques have also made surgical treatment possible in many countries with limited resources. Three randomized control trials now have definitively proved the safety and efficacy of epilepsy surgery, however, this alternative therapy remains under-utilized even in the industrialized world, where less than 1% of potential candidates are being referred to epilepsy centers. Furthermore, those who are referred receive surgery an average of 20 years after onset of epilepsy, often too late to avoid irreversible disability. The major challenges in realizing the full potential of epilepsy surgery, therefore, are not as much in the continued improvement of the treatment itself, as they are in addressing the treatment gap that is preventing appropriate patients from being referred to full-service epilepsy centers.

AB  - Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder leading to significant disability and dysfunction seen by small animal clinicians. While OA and degenerative joint disease (DJD) are often considered as being almost synonymous in dogs, this may not be the case in cats. Current therapy focuses on palliative care, aiming to reduce pain and inflammation and maintain or improve joint function without altering the pathologic process in the tissues. This chapter lists three of the most common false assumptions made by clinicians and owners in the initiation of a management plan for chronic OA pain to emphasize the need for a realistic and scientifically sound approach to pain management. Weight control is essential when dealing with OA. The introduction of diets formulated with high omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is adding a whole new dimension to the management of OA. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents are the most common final component in the management of OA.
