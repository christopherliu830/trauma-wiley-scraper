AB  - Our first purpose was to describe embryonic anatomic structures by use of IUS with a 20-MHz flexible catheter-based, high resolutions, real-time miniature transducer. The number and the clarity of structures increased from 7 to 8?weeks of gestation; however, the image quality was degenerated because of the increasing fetal size at 9?weeks. At 8?weeks secondary brain vesicles, spine, midgut herniation, liver, upper and lower limb buds, and sacral tail were visualized in all fetuses. The four-chamber view was first identified at 8?weeks, as were fingers or toes. The stomach was first noted at 9?weeks. Second purpose was to compare the ultrasound visualization of the early first-trimester embryo using TVS and IUS as 6?8?weeks of gestation. The ability to view most organs was better with IUS compared to TVS, and this was especially true for the brain, spine, heart, liver, midgut herniation, extremities, and sacral tail. Moreover, it was possible to obtain finer image quality of very small embryonic structures with IUS than with TVS. Third purpose was to evaluate embryonic organ growth (liver, heart, and brain vesicles) using IUS in the early first trimester of pregnancy. The significant good correlation between each parameter and gestational age was obtained. Fourth purpose was to visualize normal embryonal surface anatomic structures using 3D-IUS at 7?9.9?weeks gestational age. At week 8, prominent forehead was evident, and upper and lower limbs and midgut herniation were clearly depicted. At week 9, fingers and toes were depicted as small digital rays, and the sacral tail protruded caudally. At week 10, embryonic face and fingers were clearly shown.

AB  - Background The optimal time at which to perform obstetric ultrasound remains controversial. Late first trimester imaging offers the possibility for early diagnosis of structural and genetic abnormalities. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) allows the entire first trimester conceptus to be contained within one or two volumes of data. Subsequent processing of this data allows optimized views of the fetus, placenta and cord to be obtained. Method Late first trimester (?12?week) pregnancies were imaged with transvaginal 3DUS. A fetal structural survey was performed, standard biometry obtained and nuchal translucency thickness (NTT) measured. The time taken to perform and assess the scans was recorded. Results A comprehensive fetal survey was obtained, fetal measurements made and NTT measured in most fetuses with average scan times of less than one minute and average volume assessment times of less than 10?min in all cases. There were no abnormal findings in this series. Conclusion 3DUS appears to be a useful tool in the ultrasound evaluation of the 12?week fetus. A detailed examination of the fetus may be performed with minimal scan time offering exciting possibilities for the use of transvaginal 3DUS as a ?one step? screening examination.

AB  - An HRT-associated reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) has been reported in the literature, although cross-sectional studies have shown conflicting data. In a prospective, controlled study we randomized 30 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 52?Â±?3?years) into two groups. Women in the HRT group (N?=?15) received 1?mg micronized 17?-estradiol daily (E2) sequentially combined with 5 or 10?mg dydrogesterone for 14?days of each 28-day cycle during 12?months, and, thereafter, 2?mg E2 combined with 10?mg dydrogesterone for a period of 3?months. The control group (N?=?15) received no treatment. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the impedance to flow (pulsatility index [PI]) within the uterine, central retinal and ophthalmic arteries in the E2-phase at baseline and after 3, 12 and 15?months. Compared to controls, 12 months of HRT was associated with a significant decrease in the mean PI of the uterine artery of ?39% (HRT ?25%, controls +14%) and in that of the central retinal artery of ?29% (HRT ?9%, controls +20%). After 3?months this effect was already evident. During HRT, the reductions in mean PI of the uterine and central retinal arteries vs. baseline were larger (both P?=?0.002) in the women with high pretreatment PI values when compared to those with low pretreatment values. The baseline PI of the uterine artery correlated positively with age and with duration of amenorrhoea (r?=?0.42, P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.48, P?=?0.008, respectively). Our 12-month study expanded on earlier reports of a reduced PI of the uterine artery. We used a combined regimen containing a low-dose of oestrogens. These results are important because the recent trend is to recommend combined HRT that contain lower dosages of oestrogens than before. Furthermore, a 29% reduction of the PI of the central retinal artery was observed, which suggests that HRT has a positive influence on the impedance of the cerebral circulation. From the point of view of atherothrombotic risk these observations are beneficial and possibly helpful in understanding the decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and of the impairment of cognitive functions associated with oestrogens in epidemiological data.

AB  - Objective In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) there are essentially two causes of perinatal death: prematurity and lung hypoplasia. We used ultrasound to try to predict these complications. Design and methods The cervical length was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in 167 pregnancies complicated by pPROM <?32?weeks of gestation. Further in 20 pregnancies with pPROM before 24?weeks of gestation peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) waveforms were recorded by Doppler technique at weekly interval until delivery and the Pulsatility Index (PI) calculated. Pregnancies were managed conservatively according to an Institutional management protocol. The occurrence of preterm delivery and pulmonary hypoplasia was evaluated and related to ultrasound findings. Results The cervical length at admission predicts the time interval elapsing between pPROM and delivery. Significant differences in PI values from PPA were present from 2?weeks onwards the pPROM between the fetuses who developed pulmonary hypoplasia and those with a normal outcome. Conclusion The measurement of the cervical length and of PPA velocity waveforms may help to establish the risk of developing prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by pPROM.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Objectives Our purpose was to evaluate the risks of malignancy in surgically removed ovarian cysts that preoperatively were characterized as unilocular by transvaginal sonography. Study design This prospective analysis included 1307 women operated at two European university Hospitals between January 1992 and December 1997. Based on ultrasonographic findings the cysts were characterized either as echo-free, without solid parts or papillary formations (group I) or cysts with solid parts/papillary formations or echogenic cyst content (group II). Ultrasonographic and macroscopic appearance of the cysts were compared with histopathological diagnosis. Results In group I seven of 670 (1.1%) proved to be borderline or malignant, and all measured â‰¥?75?mm in diameter. The corresponding figures for cysts in group II were 24 of 634 (3.8%). The frequency of borderline/malignant cysts increased significantly with the size of the cysts. Conclusion Unilocular, echo-free cysts (group I) with a mean diameter above 50?mm and all unilocular cysts with solid parts/papillary formations should be removed surgically. Serial ultrasound follow-up should be the standard procedure of unilocular, echo-free cysts less than 50?mm.

AB  - Background Intracardiac echogenic foci are controversially discussed whether or not they are marker for chromosomal aberrations. The possible association with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) and its impact were not yet analyzed extensively. Method During 30?months, prenatally detected structural CHD were prospectively analyzed for the presence of EF. Frequency, localization, number, association with chromosomal defects and pattern of CHD were assessed. Results 279 fetal CHD could be examined and EF were found in 31 cases (11.1%). The localization was in 17 cases (54%) the left, in 7 (22%) the right, and in 7 (22.5%) both ventricles. Multiple EF were found in 10 cases. 14 cases (42%) were associated with a chromosomal aberration (T18 n?=?2; T21 n?=?5, T13 n?=?3, Triploidy n?=?2, Del22q n?=?1, others n?=?1). Among the remaining 17 fetuses with normal chromosomes following heart defects were found: 3???VSD, 3???Left-persistent SVC, 2???TGA, 2???TOF, 2???Coarctation, and 1???PS, PA, Ebstein, TAC, AS each. Conclusions Compared to low-risk groups EF are more frequent in the presence of CHD and show another distribution involving more right ventricular or bilateral EF. The combination of EF and CHD is highly associated with aneuploidies. Since associated CHD include also conotruncal anomalies EF can be considered as an indication for targeted fetal echocardiography especially when EF is localized in the RV or in both ventricles.

AB  - At present there are four concepts guiding the sonographic examination of the fetal heart: (1) the fetal echocardiogram (FEC) is difficult to perform and time-consuming, (2) FEC should be performed only in high risk pregnancies, (3) the optimal time to perform FEC is 18?22?weeks gestation, (4) FEC relies on several sonographic still views. In our lecture, we will present a new systemic ?video? approach to the great vessels and the four chambers in early pregnancy using transvaginal sonography. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cardiovascular system was performed in 36?323 consecutive fetuses using a dynamic ?video? multidirectional approach. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 173 fetuses giving an overall incidence of 1 in 210 pregnancies and 1 in 238 low-risk pregnancies. Fifty-six percent of the fetuses had associated anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 90 cases. In 10 fetuses a different cardiac anomaly was observed. In four fetuses the cardiovascular anomaly was not detected in early pregnancy. In the remaining cases, postmortem examination was not performed. Early fetal heart examination is suggested in all pregnancies. Conclusions Fetal ECC should be performed: (a) transvaginally, (b) in early pregnancy (14?16?weeks), (c) in every pregnancy , (d) using the video multidirectional approach.
