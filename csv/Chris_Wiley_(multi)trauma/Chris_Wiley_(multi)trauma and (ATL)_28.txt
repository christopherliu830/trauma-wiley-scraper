AB  - Background Fetal growth is determined by its genetic potential and growth support. The aim of our prospective study was to find out does the growth support (placental factor and blood flow) or genetic potential play a primary role in fetal growth. Method From 27 to 41 gestational weeks an umbilical artery (RI1), a middle cerebral artery resistance index (RI2) and umbilical-cerebral (U/C) ratio were measured. Several US measurements in 3?4?week intervals of the same pregnancy were done. After delivery, fetuses were divided into the three groups (AGA, LGA, SGA) according to their birth-weights. Pregnancies with gestational diabetes were excluded from the study. Results There were not statistically significant differences between the average values of RI1 (age related) in the groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. However, the mean values of RI1 (according to gestational age) in the mentioned two groups of fetuses were significantly lower than in the group of SGA fetuses, as well as their mean values of U/C ratios. Conclusion Placental factor is equally and efficiently functioning in the both groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. The genetic regulating factor of fetal growth can be adequately expressed in conditions of appropriate uteroplacental and umbilical blood supply. In other words, in identical or at least similar conditions of umbilical blood supply, fetal growth is exclusively influenced by its genetic potential.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is now defined as a condition in which the fetus does not reach the optimal condition of his growth. In this situation the birthweight can be reduced below the 10th percentile or can be superior to that threshold especially when the restriction took first place in late part of the pregnancy. Therefore it is possible to identify two groups of IUGR according to the intrauterine observation and the birthweight assessment: SGA and AGA IUGR. The most important complication of IUGR is represented by the hypoxaemia caused by placental vasculopathy. Hypoxaemia is present in about 30% of IUGR fetuses with not significant difference between SGA and AGA IUGR cases, and is the major cause of the poor perinatal outcome. After recognition of the growth restriction it is necessary to apply second level tests in order to assess the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. When hypoxaemia is present the first mechanism of fetal adaptation is represented by the redistribution of the circulation. This phenomenon is easily observable by using Doppler technology. When applying the same technique on the umbilical arteries it is possible to detect an increase in the peripheral resistance proportional to the obliteration of the placental vascular bed that is the cause of the fetal hypoxaemia. By using the information offered by Doppler study on fetal and umbilical vessels it is therefore possible to optimize the clinical management of the IUGR fetuses.

AB  - Objective The 3D Color Histogram gives quantitative informations about (changes) of perfusion and vascularisation packed in indices. Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the information gained by the vascularisation and perfusion indices. In addition, to show the reproducibility of the indices according to published studies, preliminary results (transvaginal) obtained in ovarian tumors and preliminary results in phantom measurements to correct the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation using a 3D abdominal probe. Results Color Histogram indices are reproducible. Differences of perfusion and vascularisation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors could be observed in a limited number of investigations. The physical component of the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation could be calculated by mathematical algorythms according to first phantom measurements. Conclusion The 3D Color Histogram gives new possibilities to analyse neoangiogenesis.

AB  - Background Two methods are presented for the assessment of fetal behaviours under the application of Doppler effects: (a) Measurement of the velocity wave of fetal limb by vibroacustic stimulating. (b) Hydrodynamic evaluation of the transnasal amniotic velocity wave and its relation to gastric peristalsis. Method A Doppler device was employed to assess the velocimetry wave from the ?FEMORAL BONE? in motion, following vibro-acoustic stimulation in 138 phisiological pregnancy and Doppler-aided evaluation of transnasal amniotic hydrodynamics. Results and conclusion Assessment of normal fetal behaviour. Quantification of patterns of reactivity of any body structure. Reduction in the duration of explorations for biophysical profiles. (3?4?min). Fetal reflex responses slow down and become increasingly complex as maturation carries on. Both mean velocity and acceleration of fetal reactive responses experience a gradual decline throughout gestation. The time a fetus takes to respond to a stimulus increases directly with gestational age. Simultaneousness between fetal respiration episodes and phases of gastric distention and activity. (physiological conditions). Fetal active respiration can be unequivocally accounted for by Doppler assessment of the activity of intake/release of amniotic fluid along the high respiratory branches of the pulmonary tree. Amniotic respiratory dynamics are always transnasal in physiological conditions. Velocities of transnasal, decreasing steadily from the 32nd gestational age to the end of gestation.

AB  - Aim To assess agreement between fetal cord blood Hb concentration by Doppler velocimetry and a formula (Oepkes et al, Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1994; 101:680?4), and the actual Hb concentration by cord blood sampling. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 31 Rh isoimmunised fetuses undergoing Doppler cord blood velocity measurements within the 24 hs previous to cordocentesis or delivery was included. Mean aortic velocity at descent fetal aorta and maximum umbilical vein flow at intrahepatic portion were measured blindly by a single operator with pulsed Doppler and a 3.5 Mhz transducer. Cord Hb was the gold standard. Abnormality and normality were defined as a Hb level lower and higher, respectively, than the cut-off point (<7, <8, <9, <10, <11 and <12 g/dL were tested). Likelihood ratio was also calculated. Results Interval between Doppler study and cordocentesis/delivery was 24?48 hs.

AB  - The prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations seems to be a very difficult challenge, mainly for those who are beginning with the practice of ultrasound. As it would be impossible to refer to so many fetal malformations the presentation will cover a few interesting issues. These cases are not frequently diagnosed and in many cases present controversial aspects referred to their prognosis and management. Those topics are: Unilateral ventricular dilatation Fetal hyperechogenic lung lesions Umbilical vein varix Facial clefts Unilateral ventricular dilatation may be a difficult diagnosis and its prognosis is variable Fetal hyperechogenic lesions include a broad range of anomalies with a variable behaviour. Even large lesions can disappear in utero but often the lesion can persist with severe prognosis for the fetus. Varix of the umbilical vein is a relatively uncommon abnormality that carries an increased risk for fetal demise, chromosomal abnormality and hydrops. Facial clefts are a relatively common malformation and the fetal face must be properly scanned in every fetal study. 3D ultrasound helps a lot in the diagnosis of these and other malformations and we'll discuss some examples concerning this new technology.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to obtain a nomogram of the clivus-suvraocciput angle as a basis for the diagnosis of Chiari II malformation in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. Design A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 310 normal pregnant women of 16?34?weeks' gestation. A mid-sagittal section of the fetal skull was obtained and the angle between the clivus and the supraocciput was measured. 44 fetuses with ventriculomegaly due to different causes (13 Chiari II malformation, 12 dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, 7 aqueductal stenosis, 6 borderline ventriculomegaly, 3 Dandy-Walker malformation, 2 porencephaly, 1 schizencephaly) were also included into the study and the values of the angle found in the pathological cases were compared with that found in the normal population. Results The clivus-supraocciput angle did not change during gestation and was almost constant with an average value of 79,3°?±?6°. All cases of Chiari II malformation showed a value below the 10th centile of our nomogram; all the remaining cases of ventriculomegaly showed normal values of the angle. Conclusions The evaluation of the posterior fossa and particularly the measurement of the clivus-supraocciput angle is a useful parameter to differentiate the various causes of fetal ventriculomegaly and particularly to recognize Chiari II malformation. The measurement of the angle could be also useful to screen for spina bifida which is almost constantely associated to Chiari II malformation.

AB  - Introduction The hypothesis was tested whether the improvement in the human fetal cardiac diastolic and systolic functions are associated with changes in the cardiac volume blood flow, inflow blood velocity waveform characteristics, systemic venous blood flow parameters, umbilical artery velocimetry and fetal nuchal translucency. By a longitudinal study protocol the inflow and outflow blood velocity waveforms were obtained in 16 uncomplicated pregnancies at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10?weeks. Results The proportion of isovolumetric relaxation time decreased and the proportions of filling and ejection times of the cardiac cycle increased significantly from 6 to 7?weeks. The proportion of isovolumetric contraction decreased between 8 and 9?weeks. Every inflow waveform was monophasic before 9?weeks but it was biphasic in all cases at 10?weeks. Mean velocity of inflow and outflow increased between 6 and 7?weeks and Vmean of inflow increased further after 8?weeks. At 9 and 10?weeks, atrioventriculu valve recurgitation (AVVR) was present in 4 and 7 fetuses, respectively. Nuchal translucency was greater in fetuses with AVVR present at 10?weeks compared with non-AVVR cases. Conclusion Improvement in the diastolic function of fetal heart between 6 and 7?weeks is accompanied by simultaneous increase in the mean velocities across inflow and outflow tracts. Appearance of biphasic inflow pattern is associated with significant change in systolic function between 8 and 9?weeks. AVVR is a common finding at 10?weeks of gestation.

AB  - ?Classic? fetal echocardiography is based on 7 transverse planes: the upper abdomen, the traditional four-chamber view, the five-chamber view in which the aortic root is visualized, and the fourth transverse view revealing the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries, and long-axis views of the outflow tracts and aortic arch. We recently proposed the three vessel and trachea (3VT) plane of insonation be added, to facilitate and expedite fetal heart evaluation. The (3VT) is the most cephalad transverse view, visualized on a plane crossing the fetal upper mediastinum. It is obtained easily by moving the transducer cephalad and slightly oblique from the FCV, and shows the main pulmonary trunk (MPA) in direct communication with the ductus arteriosus (DA). A transverse section of the aortic arch is seen to the right of the MPA and DA. Cross sections of the superior vena cava (SVC), and posterior to it the trachea, are visualized. The clinical applicability of the 3VT was demonstrated in a recent study encompassing 1263 low-and high-risk cases scanned between 14 and 24?weeks' gestation. We consider one of the greatest advantages of our novel approach the ease with which the examiner can scan the fetal heart, beginning with the caudal upper-abdomen view. By sliding the transducer cephalad in one continuous motion, all the pertinent views are readily visualized. It was also shown to be effective in the diagnosis of such aortic arch anomalies as right and double aortic arch, among others. We showed that five short axis views including the 3VT simplified and streamlined fetal cardiac examination, without compromising diagnostic effectiveness.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.

AB  - Objective Since August 1998 we used the integrated 3-D software with the Siemens Elegra in order to evaluate fetoplacental vessels in the 3-D mode. Aim of the evaluation was to examine the feasibility of the application and to demonstrated potential clinical advantages. Methods In our antenatal clinic we recruited pregnant women between 12 and 38?weeks of gestation to take part in a feasibility study in order to evaluate the free-hand 3-D application using the 5.0?MHz transducer for routine antenatal scanning. We examined vasculatore within the placenta, intrathoracoabdominal and intracranial fetal vessels with the integrated powermode. Acquisition time for a volume date set is between 3 and 20?s depending on the resolution selected. Results Three-dimensional examination of the fetoplacental vessels is easily available using the Siemens Elegra, because no change in transducer is necessary. Our preliminary data show that we are able to demonstrate the complexity of intraplacental vasculature, which may be clinically helpful in the evaluation of twin placentas. Within the fetus the spatial arrangement of the vessels and their relation to each other can be depicted. This allows to study the fetal vascular tree and clearly discloses vascular anomalies. Conclusions Application of the integrated 3-D software within the Siemens Elegra for the first time allows the examination of the complex fetoplacental vascular tree in vivo. This may be clinically helpful in the differential diagnosis of fetal anomalies.

AB  - Doppler velocimetry give possibility of making noninvasive evaluation of the vascular modifications from the beginning of pregnancy. We have studied following vessels: Retrocorial arteries The flow increases since sixth to twelfth weeks, progressively which is explained by the increment of the conductancy and the reduction of resistance. Trophoblastic invasion of spirals arteries in the coral bed, and hormones produced during the gestation affect both values. Uterine arteries The resistance of the uterine arteries diminish since sixth to twelfth weeks, in normal pregnancy. The low increment depends on the modifications in the coral bed and of hormonal vasodilator effect. OVF Luteum gravidicus When ovary flow is greater in first stage of pregnancy suggest a favorable early gestation, and vice versa, a regress in those measures had a negative character. We could evaluate the role of Doppler examinations in the following situations: ? Abortion in any stage and variations ? Blighted ovum ? Ectopic pregnancy In all these conditions, Doppler showed to be a trusty, predictive, prognostical and diagnostical instrument of great utility. Clinical application of Doppler Uterus Corial could be used in a preventive way when the increment of the resistance in the uterine arteries appears before clinical abortion symptoms. We also applied Doppler exploration in AVF patients confirming that the deficit in uterine perfusion is significantly related with the failures in embryonary implantation. Recently, we are performing endovaginal color Doppler in the diagnoses of early ectopic gestation and trophoblastic disease with very satisfactory results.

AB  - Subacute or chronic fetal hypoxia is associated with an increase in fetal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis irrespective of the etiology of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid (AF) EPO level is often elevated in diabetic pregnancies (especially in macrosomic fetuses), and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension (HT), pre-eclampsia (PE) or/and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is shown that cerebro-umbilical arterial flow ratio (RIC/RIU) is often abnormal (less than 1) in the case of fetal hypoxia. We studied AF EPO levels in 29 diabetic pregnancies, 18 pregnancies with HT, PE or/and IUGR and 19 healthy controls. The samples were obtained during the elective amniocenteses in the case of suspected fetal hypoxia or during caesarean sections. Doppler measurements were performed not more than 24?h before amniocenesis. AF EPO levels were significantly elevated in diabetics with abnormal fetal growth (either macrosomia or IUGR) and nondiabetics with HT, PE or/and IUGR as compared with healthy controls or diabetics with normal fetal growth. AF EPO levels of fetuses with normal fetal growth in diabetic mothers were not different from those of healthy controls. There was no correlation between AF EPO levels and RIC/RIU in any of the diabetic or nondiabetic group. However, 5 fetuses had either absent end-diastolic or reversed umbilical flow. All had elevated AF EPO levels (range 16?15?800?mU/ml). We conclude that both fetal macrosomia and IUGR in diabetic pregnancies seem to cause chronic fetal hypoxia. Normal fetal growth in diabetic pregnancies is not associated with chronic fetal hypoxia. Single measurement of RIC/RIU is of little value in the diagnosis of chronic fetal hypoxia in abnormal pregnancies.

AB  - Objective Treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is complicated by the lack of readily available measures of the fetal thyroid status. Both hyper- and hypo-thyroidism of the fetus may have short and long-term detrimental effects and thus should be avoided. We therefore followed the fetal thyroidal size during treatment of maternal thyroid disorders and correlated the data with treatment and thyroidal status in the mother. Methods During 24-month period 20 patients with thyroid disorders were referred for serial fetal thyroid measurements. Thyroid size was measured by transvaginal ultrasonography between 14 and 17?weeks' of gestation and by abdominal ultrasonography between 18 and 38?weeks' gestation. Results In five women with Grave's diseases correlation between thionamide dosage and fetal thyroid size were noted. Two fetuses had an increase in the size of thyroid gland above the upper 95% confidence interval, one of them developed neonatal Grave's of which it was the only prenatal sign of fetal thyroid abnormalities. In all other three fetuses changes inthyroidal size aided in determining the dosage of the antithyroidal drugs. Conclusions Inutero ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal thyroid size can be used as a noninvasive tool for the proper management of maternal hyperthyroidism.

AB  - The color and Power Doppler gives us the opportunity to investigate the vascular anatomy as an angiography and furthermore lets us ?see? hydro jets. This singular ability leads us to make some diagnosis and confirm others. During this lecture we will show our experience in the diagnosis of some fetal anomalies such as renal agenesis, urachal cysts, megacystis microcolon Hypoperistalsis syndrome, renal displasia, Galeno vein aneurysm, anterior wall defects such as omphalocele and gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, duodenal atresia, coartation of the aorta, single umbilical artery Dandy Walker Malformation, and some fetal tumors.

AB  - Aim To prevent the syndrome of severe ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF/ET cycles at high risk for the syndome of ovarian hyperstimulation by early timed unilateral ultrasound guided aspiration of one ovary (12?h after hCG). Method. We evaluated the preventive effect of ETFA by analysing the data on 821 cycles at high risk for SOHSS performed during the years 1987?99. In all cycles the high risk for SOHSS was defined by the estradiol values >?3000?pg/ml and more than 8 follicles >?14?mm plus intermediate and small follicles in each ovary on ultrasound. Results In the group of :729 female infertility cycles at high risk for SOHSS with preventive ETFA there were no cases of SOHSS. In the control group of 92 IVF/ET female infertility without ETFA there were 12 cases of SOHSS (P?<?0.0001). No difference in live birth rate (17% vs. 16%) was noted. The results prove the preventive effect of ETFA. It is based on early timed withdrawal of paracine substances which are present in the follicular fluid. Conclusion The vaginal ultrasound guided ETFA is another successful option to decrease the incidence of severe OHSS in assisted reproduction.
