AB  - The regulation and significance of ovarian and uterine haemodynamics in human reproductive pathophysiology has been largely studied. In women, ovarian vascularization seems to be responsible for the selection and maturation of follicles both in spontaneous and stimulated IVF cycles while endometrial receptivity is related to uterine blood flow and implicated in the achievement of pregnancy. In patients who underwent to IVF cycles, the PI of both uterine and spiral arteries is significantly lower in patients who became pregnant in comparison with nonpregnant and is associated with significantly lower endometrial cell thromboxane concentrations than non pregnant patients. In poor responders women it has been demonstrated the role of l-arginine in improving uterine and follicular Doppler flow and in increasing ovarian response to gonadotrophin. Recently, in a total of 41 patients undergoing to assisted reproduction, an higher number of oocytes collected and embryos transferred was observed in normo-responders than in poor-responders patients. Furthermore follicular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) resulted inversely correlated with retrieved oocytes (r?=??0.942; p?=?0.0017). In addition significant higher uterine and perifollicular Doppler flow resistances were observed in poor-responders women. The pregnancy rate/cycle was significantly higher in normo-responders (26%) than poor-responders (6%; p?=?0.037) patients. In conclusion, vasoactive substances improve ovarian response to gonadotrophin and allow a better management of ovarian stimulation in infertile patients.

AB  - Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) offers multiple benefits and some risks to many postmenopausal women, especially to those whose menopause occurred before age 45. Improvements of image resolution by transvaginal sonography allow the investigation of very delicate anatomical structures such as the endometrium. Various diagnostic criteria including thickness and volume of endometrium, internal structure and myometrial involvement help to identify endometrial abnormality. The benefits of technologies such as sonohysterography, Doppler and 3D ultrasound are being assessed. In the postmenopausal patient without hormonal substitution, endometrial pathology may be diagnosed by measuring endometrial thickness alone. In women with postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial atrophy as the must common cause has been differentiated from endometrial cancer with a high success rate. Considering that the majority of diagnostic endometrial biopsies reveal a benign pathology, Doppler ultrasound may significantly reduce the number of these procedures. In patients with HRT, the measurement of endometrial thickness is not reliable to predict pathology. In this situation, ultrasound examination of the endometrial/myometrial border or endometrial blood flow is advantageous. Transvaginal ultrasound and Doppler blood flow analysis could prove helpful in selection and follow up of patients on HRT and maybe to prevent some unwanted endometrial effects.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Objective Fetal lung anomalies are traditionally classified into Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM), and Pulmonary Sequestration (PS). During last years we have detected several cases who presented with bizarre and overlapping findings which could not be fitted into this usual classification. We therefore suggest a new approach for classification based on embryology, 2-D and Doppler ultrasound. Method During 5-year period, patients with fetal lung lesions who were referred for detailed ultrasound evaluation at the Sheba Medical Center from the data base of this study. All cases were analyzed by 2-D ultrasound and high resolution Power Doppler technology and were classified into three major categories: I Agenesis of lung; II Lung lesion with normal vascular supply: IIa solid, IIb cystic, IIc mixed; III Lung Lesion with abnormal vascular supply: IIIa chest, IIIb abdomen, IIIc thoracoabdomial. Medical files, natural history and neonatal follow-up were recorded. Results Twenty-one fetuses were recruited, two fetuses were detected in group one, 14 in group II of normal vascular supply, and five in group III abnormal lung with abnormal vascular involvement. Conclusions Based on embryology and ultrasound a new classification system is introduced.

AB  - Background Recent reports have shown a significantly improved survival for complex congenital heart disease (CHD) when detected antenatally. This has further substantiated the need to detect CHD in utero. Since the performance of the 4-chamber view as a screening tool is rather insufficient, the issue is now to find more effective and not too expensive alternative methods to reach this aim. Method The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is an efficient method to assess health outcomes and resource costs of health interventions. We have applied this tool to prenatal detection of CHD, comparing 3 models: (1) 4-chamber view at level I; (2) outflow tracts at level I; (3) Outflow tracts at level II. To perform the analysis we have made the following assumptions: (1) the incidence of CHD at 20?weeks is 10/1000; (2) the percentage of severe CHD is 40%; (3) the monthly salary are 2500 USD and 3500 USD for level I and level II operators, respectively; (4) detection rate for CHD detectable on the 4-chamber view and on outflows only are 35%/20%, 60%/60%, and 90%/90% for the three options (level I 4-chamber, level I outflows, level II outflows). Results and conclusions Based on the forementioned assumptions, the costs for (1) a diagnosis of CHD; (2) a diagnosis of severe CHD; (3) TOP of any CHD; TOP of a severe CHD are reported below. These results, which were also submitted to sensitivity analyses, will be discussed. Costs Outcome Level I 4-ch. Level I ?Outflows Level II ?Outflows Det. Any CHD 1796 USD 1157 USD 324 USD Det Severe CHD 6510 USD 2894 USD 810 USD TOP Any CHD 5314 USD 2893 USD 810 USD TOP Severe CHD 9300 USD 4133 USD 1157 USD

AB  - Over a year I invited you here to participate to the rct for treating twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTS). Are there any data available to reconsider this? The answer is clearly no, on the contrary. Indeed large series on amniodrainage or laser therapy have become available. With serial amniodrainage overall survival for both twins is 49% or 71% where at least one baby survive. In cases where one fetus dies in utero, 20% of the survivors die, and in another 20% they have severe neurological morbidity. Laser treatment has now a survival rate of 54% for both twins and 81% for at least one survivor. Neurological morbidity seems to be less than 10%. Has this larger experience contributed to solve the question whether one or the other therapy is better? No, it only underscores that our estimate of the number of patients needed in a rct was right: 10% difference in survival rate and 15% for severe neonatal morbidity. All new data, all new studies are an urgent call for randomisation. If not, both patients and their obstetricians will continue to argue based on unsubstantiated views. Further case series will not bring any critically new element. Results Over 45 patients have now been included, all but a few in France. If we would extrapolate the number of patients randomised at our centre, only three other groups would have to recruit at the same pace to reach the 142 patients needed by the end of next year. Discussion There are many arguments to try to finish the study within a few years. It avoids the obvious bias due to improvements of perinatal resuscitation. It would keep high motivation amongst referring clinicians. I would dare to say more: at this point it has become unethical not to randomise cases with TTTS. Not laser, neither amniodrainage have become established yet as the best treatment and there is no room for empirical new techniques until the trial is completed.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate with color-power doppler sonography the arterial and venous circulation in fetal brain, in normal and pathologic circumstances. Method We studied 101 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses, 20 intrauterine growth-retarded fetuses (IUGR), 10 fetuses with cmv infections and 10 fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia. In all fetuses we obtained reliable blood flow velocity waveforms of middle cerebral and superior cerebellar artery and trasverse sinus. The pulsatility index (PI) for arterial vessels and flow velocity for venous vessels were used. Doppler measurements of AGA fetuses were compared with other fetuses. Results An increase in fetal middle cerebral PI and cerebral transverse sinus was observed in IUGR and a slightly decrease in case of fetal arrhytmia when compared with AGA fetuses. In 6 of 10 fetuses affected by cmv infection was observed a reduction in PI cerebral and cerebellar, while no difference was found for venous velocities. A longitudinal study was performed in 30 AGA and 8 IUGR fetuses. The IUGR fetuses showed a characteristic early reduction of cerebellar PI in respect to cerebral PI about 4?8?days prior the evidence of late heart rate (HR) decelerations; however, the two vessels did not differ significantly in the 4?days prior HR decelerations. Conclusion Venous and arterial cerebral circulation shown a response to pathological conditions that could affect fetal brain.

AB  - Objective To estimate the value of a new vascular score, hypoxia index (HI), in prediction of functional and/or structural brain lesions caused by fetal hypoxia and to examine the relationship between this index, Doppler cerebral-umbilical ratio (C/U) and neonatal neurosonography in growth retarded and hypoxia fetuses. Study design In the prospective study 41 growth retarded fetuses were included from 29 to 40?weeks of gestation. Flow velocity waveforms the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries were recorded each other day, at least two weeks. The C/U ratio and HI were calculated. After the birth, obstetric parameters and ultrasound of neonatal brain were used as outcome parameters. Results Doppler C/U ratio <?1 as well as HI?>?150 were associated with poor perinatal outcome. The neonatal brain damage was detected in 16 growth-retarded and hypoxic fetuses. Hypoxia index had greater statistic significance in the prediction of neonatal brain lesions. Also, specificity and sensitivity of HI was better than the last value of C/U ratio measured before delivery. Conclusions The C/U ratio and HI represent the best indicators for early detecting and assessment of fetal hypoxia. Furthermore, they may also be parameters for the prediction of poor neurological outcome in pregnancies with growth retardation. So, the use of HI would represent a significant advance in prevention of hypoxic brain lesions, which are one of the most frequent causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Methods For a total of 1506 cases undergoing ultrasonography (US) only, those receiving a combined usage of computed tomography (CT) and US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and US, and all three modalities, we compared the indications and selected imaging modalities in relation to the stream of therapeutic procedure. Results 324 cases (21.5%) judged to have no structural disease through imaging techniques at previous Hospitals underwent no further imaging examination. 420 cases (27.9%), most of which underwent surgery and/or radiation due to malignant lesions in the ovary and/or uterus, had US alone, and 564 cases (37.5%) had CT in addition to US. The main indications for ordering additional CT were suspected distant metastasis, including pelvic and paraaortic lymphnodes. 95 patients (6.3%) had US and MRI under indication of tissue characterization in tumors. 103 cases (6.8%) with difficulties in diagnosis had all modalities; US, CT and MRI. In 324 cases without imaging modalities, 60 cases (18.5%) undergoing operative procedure were those with cervical neoplasm, and 70.0% of the cases followed by chemotherapy were for ovarian cancer. Such will be further discussed in detail.

AB  - Objective In about 80% of fetuses with trisomies, Turner syndrome, and in fetuses with skeletal abnormalities, genetic syndromes, structural abnormalities and cardiac defects, there is increased collection of fluid in the neck region. This can be visualized sonographically at 11?14?weeks of gestation as increased nuchal translucency thickness. The pathophysiology of this common phenotypic expression of different chromosomal abnormalities is uncertain, but there is some evidence that the underlying mechanism may be altered composition of extracellular matrix components and/or cardiac failure. Methods We performed a number of studies investigating nuchal skin tissue for various extracellular matrix components and cardiac heart failure using molecular techniques. We used northern blotting, immunohistochemistry, electron-microscopy and in situ hybridization. Results Studies investigating the heart found increased levels of mRNA for ANP and BNP, and reduced levels of Calcium ATPase, whereas transcript levels for GATA-4 were unchanged. Studies investigating components of the extracellular matrix in nuchal skin of trisomic fetuses found overexpression of ecm genes in trisomies (collagen type VI, collagen type IV, laminin) or an altered ratio of genes between normals and abnormals (collagen type VI). Conclusions The present data provide some evidence, that chromosomally abnormal fetuses with increased nuchal translucency at 12?14?week may suffer from an altered extracellular matrix of the heart and skin or transient heart failure.

Results The 43 healthy women showed a decrease in Uterine Resistance Index (RI) from I° to II° trimester (0.72?±?0.10 vs. 0.54?±?0.09, P?<?0.001) and modifications in Diastolic function parameters: E wave velocity and E/A ratio decreased; A wave velocity and deceleration time of the E wave increased; the left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) decreased significantly (88.7?±?6.7, 75.6?±?7.7, 71.1?±?5.0 msec, P?<?0.001) showing a correlation with left atrial dimensions and RI (r?=??0.38, r?=?0.47, P?<?0.001). In the third trimester the comparison between normal and hypertensive women showed a significant reduction in (TVR) total vascular resistances (1006?±?212 vs. 1620?±?469, P?=?0.000) and IVRT (71?±?5.0 vs. 92.0?±?7.6 msec, P?=?0.000). Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between IVRT and TVR (r?=?0.68; P?<?0.01), Uterine RI and TVR were directly related (r?=?0.59, P?<?0.001). Conclusions Maternal diastolic function analysis may be useful to identify women who fully adapt to pregnancy and at risk for development of gestational hypertension.

AB  - Background Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) of a selectively growth-retarded (IUGR) monochorionic (MC) twin is associated with high morbidity/mortality in the appropriately grown (AGA) twin. Selective laser photocoagulation (SLPCV) allows precise separation of the circulations of both twins. The aim of this study was to assess SLPCV in the treatment of MC-IUGR. Methods Patients with previable MC-IUGR were offered SLPCV. Absent or reverse end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery of the IUGR twin was also required for entry. Communicating vessels were identified endoscopically as deep artery-to-vein or superficial artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein as previously described. The communications were photocoagulated with Nd:YAG laser. Results SLPCV was performed in 11 patients (GA mean = 20.9?weeks). Survival of both fetuses was n?=?5 (45%), IUFD of the IUGR twin alone was n?=?4 (36%) and IUFD of the AGA twin alone was n?=?2 (18%). There were no dual losses, or adverse effects of an IUFD on the surviving twin. Previously undescribed superficial artery-to-vein anastomosis occurred in three patients. Conclusions SLPCV can effectively create a ?functionally dichorionic? placenta. SLPCV allows the AGA twin to avoid the adverse effects associated with IUFD of the IUGR twin. Unexpected IUFD of the AGA twin may reflect more complex placentation. A new type of vascular communication, superficial artery-to-vein, may have important pathophysiologic implications.

AB  - Aim To investigate the value of 3D-ultrasound in predicting fetal weight at delivery. Patients and methods The study group consisted of 251 pregnant women (formula-finding group: n?=?125; evaluation group: n?=?126) with a singleton pregnancy and an ultrasound examination within seven days of delivery. Pregnancies with major structural or chromosomal anomalies were excluded. Ultrasound examinations included standard biometry as well as three-dimensional volumetry of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen of the fetus. All examinations were performed with a Voluson 530D MT system (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria). The results were compared with commonly used weight formulas. Results All measurements were completed successfully. Polynomial regression analysis with standard biometric parameters and volumes of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen was employed to yield the best-fit formula for prediction of fetal weight at birth. The new 3D formula (Estimated fetal weight (EFW)?=?? 1478.557?+?7.242 * thigh volume +?13.309 * upper arm volume +?852.998 * lg abdominal volume +?0.526 * BIP3) proved to be superior to established two-dimensional equations with the lowest mean error (25.8?±?194.4 g), the lowest mean absolute error (155.2?±?118.2 g) and the lowest mean absolute percentage error (6.1?±?5.0%) when studied prospectively in the evaluation group. Conclusion Fetal weight estimation by 3D?ultrasound compares favourably with conventional 2D?formulas.

AB  - Objectives To determine the value of Doppler flow velocity waveforms from the fetal arterial pulmonary branches relative to fetal biometric indices and clinical correlates in the prenatal prediction of lethal lung hypoplasia (LH) in prolonged oligohydramnios. Study design 42 singleton pregnancies with oligohydramnios associated with premature rupture of membranes (PROM, n?=?31) or bilateral renal pathology (n?=?11) were examined using a combined color coded Doppler and 2d real-time ultrasound system. Thoracic (TC), cardiac (CC) and abdominal circumference (AC) and the largest vertical amniotic fluid pocket were measured. Pulsed Doppler measurements of the arterial pulmonary branches were made at the level of the cardiac four-chamber view after visualization with color Doppler. Diagnosis of LH was based on pathological, clinical and radiological criteria. Results The prevalence of lethal LH was 43%. In the PROM-subset, combination of onset of PROM = 20?weeks; duration of oligohydramnios = 8?weeks and degree of oligohydramnios = 1?cm, presented the highest clinical prediction rate for lethal LH. For both the total group and the PROM-subset, the highest prediction rate for lethal LH from biometric and Doppler parameters was presented by TC/AC ratio, peak systolic velocity in the proximal branch and time-averaged and end-diastolic velocity in the middle branch of the pulmonary artery. In the prom subset, combination of all three clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters revealed the most favorable combination to predict lethal LH (PPV 100%, accuracy 93%, and sensitivity 71%). Conclusion Doppler velocimetry may detect changes in blood velocity waveforms from the arterial branches of the fetal pulmonary circulation in the presence of LH, but fails to be the ultimate test for the prenatal prediction of lethal LH. The best prediction can be achieved by combining clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Remarkable changes and continuous growth and development of the early maternal-fetal circulation could be studied by Doppler ultrasound. This approach seems to give more light in understanding of the early pregnancy development. Doppler ultrasound was reported accurate to separate different segments of uterine blood flow during pregnancy. Color flow is used to anatomically locate arcuate, radial and spiral arteries. Pulsed Doppler is then used to study different flow patterns of visualized vessels. Studies of maternal-fetal circulation in early pregnancy may help for better understanding of physiological and pathophysiological hemodynamic changes in the circulation. Investigation of maternal (main uterine, arcuate, radial and spiral) arteries; placental (umbilical, chorionic arterioles) vessels and embryonic/fetal (heart, aorta and intracranial circulation) arteries flow patterns may help to diagnose abnormal implantation and embryonic development. More studies are necessary in order the Doppler technique to be used for clinical assessment in early pregnancy. Safety aspects should also be considered. However, potentials of this technique are promising in study of early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities, development of pre-eclampsia and IUGR.

AB  - Background To review the literature of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow and serum hormonal profile in the patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) compared to the patients with normal menstrual cycles undergoing in-vitro fertilization treatment. Method Pertinent studies were identified through a computer MEDLINE search. References of selected articles were hand-searched for additional citations. Results The vascular impedance to uterine artery blood flow is higher during the luteal phase of PCO patients compared to the normally cycling patients and it does not show any dynamics throughout the menstrual cycle. In the normally cycling patients the active ovary shows dramatic hemodynamic changes during the cycle, therefore the vascular impedance to ovarian artery blood flow is almost constant throughout the menstrual cycle in the inactive ovary. In PCO patients the ovarian arterial blood flow in both ovaries is about the same as in inactive ovaries in the normally cycling patients. High vascular impedance to utero-ovarian arterial blood flow is associated with typical low vascular impedance of stromal ovary vascularization in PCO patients. In stimulated cycles a strong negative correlation between the vascular impedance to the uterine artery blood flow and the serum E2 concentration is found on the day of HCG administration. Taking only anovulatory PCO cycles into consideration, the above correlation is not confirmed. Conclusion Doppler analysis can be a valuable method for the assessment of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow in spontaneous and in stimulated cycles.

AB  - Background Twin-to-Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies. Particularly severe fetal and neonatal cardiac dysfunction is complicated in recipient twin and attended with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abnormal echocardiographic features and clinical complications of cardiac disease in TTTS. Method We studied 20 pregnancies complicated with TTTS. Serial fetal and neonatal echocardiography were carried out and evaluated the following parameters: cardiothoracic area ratio, aortic and pulmonary artery Doppler peak velocities, umbilical arterial resistance index, preload index of inferior vena cava, ventricular valve regurgitation and structural heart abnormalities. Result In recipients, all features had cardiomegaly, tricuspid valve regurgitation and high preload condition with increased preload index of inferior vena cava. Aortic and pulmonary artery peak velocities were increased in the recipients than those in the donors. Three cases of recipients had pulmonary valve stenosis and received balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Furthermore, three cases of donors had coarctation of aorta and also received surgical repair. Conclusion In addition to the severity of cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of aorta would be the important factors to evaluate perinatal prognosis of TTTS.

AB  - Background Absent enddiastolic flow (AEDF) velocities are associated with fetal distress and adverse fetal outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate perinatal findings of fetuses with an AEDF in fetal vessels and to investigate the neurological long-term-outcome. Method The analytical program ?Munich functional developmental diagnostics? (MFDD) was applied to the 90 children at different time intervals. The results of 40 children with an AEDF (Gr. I) and 20 children with pathological S/D-Ratio (Gr. II) were compared to the group of 30 children with normal Doppler-flow-findings (Gr. III) with the same pregnancy weeks at birth. Results The rate of C-section (92% vs. 71% vs. 36%), birthweight (1140g vs. 1725g vs. 2570g), 5?min. APGAR-Score (31% vs. 5% both) were significantly different in three groups. Brain sparing effect in the middle cerebral arteries was found in 81% in Gr. I, in 21% Gr. II and only 8% in Gr. III. At the time of neurological assessment the age of children was between 12 and 36?months. The developmental age for each functional category was evaluated and the difference between corrected age and developmental age was calculated. In 33% of all infants with a AEDF had a pathological neuromotoric development vs. 22% in Gr. II and only 15.3% in Gr. III. Conclusions The children with pathological Doppler-flow-measurements during pregnancy have not only very high risk of perinatal abnormality but also show a distinctly increased risk of impaired growth and neurodevelopmental disability comparing to the cases with a normal Doppler-flow-finding. Most of these fetuses showed brain-sparing effect. These aspects are very important to be discussed with the parents before the definitive perinatal decision is made.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow in infertile patients. Methods Seventy-six FSH stimulated cycles in 39 patients participating in a timed intercourse or iui program were studied. Transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler measurement of the dominant follicle and corpus luteum resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), maximum venous velocity (MVV) and serum p levels during mesoluteal phase were recorded. Velocimetric parameters were established and then used to classify ovarian function in normal ovulatory cycle (NOV; n?=?52), luteal phase defect (LPD; n?=?15) and luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF; n?=?9). Results The luteal PSV and MVV in the nov and LPD cycles were significantly higher (NOV: 24.3?±?12.2 vs. 13.1?±?6.5 and 8.1?±?3.30 vs. 3.6?±?1.1; LPD: 29.8?±?10.3 vs. 14.4?±?4.8 and 5.7?±?1.5 vs. 4.3?±?1.2) and luteal RI and PI were significantly lower (NOV: 0.45?±?0.06 vs. 0.55?±?0.08 and 0.62?±?0.15 vs. 0.83?±?0.22; LPD: 0.46?±?0.05 vs. 0.54?±?0.06 and 0.62?±?0.10 vs. 0.81?±?0.15) than follicular ones. LUF cycles did not show significant changes during the ovarian cycle (follicular vs. luteal PSV; MVV; RI and PI: 14.4?±?4.8 vs. 14.9?±?7.3; 4.3?±?1.2 vs. 4.2?±?2.1; 0.47?±?0.07 vs. 0.58?±?0.12 and 0.66?±?0.12 vs. 0.89?±?0.29) and no ?luteal conversion? of the Doppler signal was identified. There was significant correlation between luteal MVV and serum p (r?=?0.36). Conclusions Arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow remain unaltered during LUF cycles and P levels correlate with luteal MVV. This makes Doppler an effective noninvasive test to assess ovulation and luteal function.
