AB  - Color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis ultrasonography were used to scan 44 patients with an overt ovarian mass immediately before laparotomy. Sections of malignant tumors were analyzed for the cellular expression of TP and the intratumoral density of microvessels by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to TP and Factor VIII related antigen, respectively. Moreover, apoptotic index (AI) was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling methods. The proportion of Stage I tumors that was TP positive (16%) was significantly lower (P?=?0.022) that the corresponding value for Stages II?IV (44%), although the values for microvessel count, AI, and peak systolic velocity (PSV) were similar. AI was significantly lower in TP-positive tumors than that in TP-negative tumors (P?=?0.015). The PSV was significantly higher in TP-positive tumors (P?=?0.02). There was a significant correlation between the microvessel count and the PSV (r?=?0.34, P?=?0.024). Moreover, AI was significantly inversely related to the PSV (r?=?0.35, P?=?0.023). The PSV in a subgroup with a high microvessel count and low AI was significantly higher than that in a subgroup with a low microvessel count and high AI (P?=?0.0006). These findings significantly associated with TP expression (P?=?0.024). The intratumoral PSV, as determined by color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis might reflect the coordination of angiogenesis and apoptosis, associating with TP expression in epithelial ovarian cancer.

AB  - For a number of years the teaching of ultrasound principles has relied on slides of static, nonreal-time images. Although ultrasound originally employed only still images, the development of real-time ultrasound ushered in a new imaging modality. Unfortunately, the presentation of real-time images has not been incorporated into most presentations because of the difficulty of preparing and editing video tape recordings of the examination. With the advent of multimedia programs available for the laptop and desktop computer, it is now possible to display real-time motion sequences that duplicate the actual scanning environment. To accomplish this, however, requires the physician to become versed in the various techniques required to capture video and audio sequences from the ultrasound machine. In addition, the proper computer software must be used to optimize these images. The purpose of this presentation is to review the methodology required to (1) acquire the highest quality video images from the ultrasound machine, (2) convert the ultrasound images from a analog-to-digital format, (3) review programs required to optimize the converted digital images, and (4) examine the software programs to optimally display these images for the Windows and Macintosh platforms. At the conclusion of the presentation, the physician should be able to accomplish these tasks.

AB  - Objective To measure peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) and pulmonary vein (PV) velocity waveforms in growth restricted fetuses (IUGR) and to relate them to different Doppler indices fetal circulation and to pregnancy outcome. Design and methods 108 IUGR fetuses from singleton pregnancies (gestational age median 28.4 range 25?32) were prospectively considered for this study. Entry criteria were an ultrasonographic extimated fetal weight <?5th centile, the absence of structural and chromosomal abnormalities, and a Pulsatility Index (PI) in umbilical artery >?95th centile of our reference limits for gestation. Velocity waveforms were recorded from the PPA and in one of the PV in proximity of the inflow in the left atrium. The PI from PPA and the Pulsatility Index for the vein from PV (PIV?=?[S???D]/m) were calculated. Values obtained were compared to our reference limits for gestation and related to other Doppler indices from arterial, cardiac and systemic venous circulation and to fetal outcome. Results In IUGR fetuses both the PI from PPA (P?<?0.001) and the PIV from the PV (P?<?0.001) were increased when compared to control fetuses. An inverse relationship was found between PPA and middle cerebral artery PI. Changes in PV were present when abnormal velocity waveforms are present in the systemic venous circulation. Reverse flow during atrial contraction is present in pulmonary vein in the most severely compromised fetuses and are associated with fetal distress and imminent fetal death. Conclusions Abnormalities in arterial and pulmonary flows are present in IUGR fetuses. Changes in arterial circulation occur at an early stage of the disease while modifications in venous flows occurs later and may be the expression of an impaired function of the left ventricle close to fetal jeopardize.

AB  - Background The aim is to clarify placental shunt flow patterns in monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins and their clinical outcome after the intervention under unique criteria. Method Thirteen (13) MD twin pregnancies were studied from early pregnancy with 2D and 3D B-mode, color Doppler, power-angio mode, Doppler flow velocimetry, cardio-thoraxarea ratio (CTAR) and preload index (PLI) under tocolysis. Results Artery to artery shunt flow was detected by fetalbeat-to-beat Doppler color change and cyclic bidirectionalflow at placental surface in 8?MD twin cases but not in 5. Shunt was more clear with 3D color Doppler and power-angio. Umbilical vein flow pulsation, variable FHR deceleration andcord complications were more in placental shunt flow casesthan its absence. Deep shunt flow was prenatally detected in 2 cases and small anastomses in all postnatal placenta. Pregnancy was terminated by emergency C-section in cases of uncontrollable contractions, unidirectional shunt flow, large CTAR and PLI (>?0.4) which were frequent in large twins after 30?weeks. Neonatal cardiac failure was more in shunt flow cases than its absence but the outcome was normal. Neonatal PVL and perinatal deaths were less than the MD twins in the past.

AB  - The incidence of fetal malformation is higher in multifetal pregnancies than in singletons. In a dizygotic twin gestation there is slightly more than twice the risk per pregnancy of a fetal malformation. In a monozygotic twin gestation the rates of chromosomal and mendelian abnormalities are identical to those of a singleton pregnancy. However, there is an increased risk of structural malformations. Selective termination in a bichorionic biamniotic twin pregnancy is done with intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. The international experience show that it can be performed in all 3 trimesters with good outcomes in >?90% of cases and the loss rate is approximately 7%. In monochorionic twin gestation the aim is to arrest the umbilical cord flow completely and permanently. Several methods to achieve this goal are embolization, ligation (fetoscope of U/S guidance), laser coagulation, monopolar and bipolar thermocoagulation. The latter technique became more popular, with estimated loss rate of 20%. The techniques and results will be presented (including video), and the ethical issue will be discussed.

AB  - Background Reversed enddiastolic Doppler flow velocity waveforms on umbilical velocimetry is regarded to be associated with catastrophical perinatal outcome with a high perinatal mortality ranging from 35% to 100%. This study focused on the differences of fetal morbidity and mortality between the cases with reverse flow and other Doppler flow velocity waveforms. Method During a 10-year period we found 30 cases with reverse flow in the umbilical artery or fetal aorta (gr. I), we selected 30 cases with absent end diastolic velocities (gr. II), 30 cases with high A/B-ratio (gr. III) and 30 cases with normal A/B-ratio (gr. IV). All cases in this study were patients with similar para, gravida, maternal age and gestational ages by delivery (≤?36?weeks). Results The fetuses with reverse flow showed the highest perinatal mortality of 27% (7% in the gr. II, 10% in the gr. III and 0% in the gr. IV). In the gr. I the neonatal morbidity of 78% was also the highest (59% in the gr. II, 36% in the gr. III and 30% in the gr. IV). 80% of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) were within this group, while no IUFD has been found in the gr. IV. Furthermore, the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage by the neonates in the gr. I (28%) was also much higher than those in the gr. III (4%) and IV (0%). Conclusions Our study suggests that reverse flow represents severe fetal condition with the highest perinatal mortalities. The fetal outcome in cases with reverse flow is further worse than those with absent end diastolic flow velocity waveforms. A highest morbidity was also observed by those fetuses, especially high incidences of cerebral haemorrhage. Colour Doppler-sonography is a very useful tool to identify high risk pregnancy leading worse perinatal outcome and allows to select worst perinatal prognosis if reverse end diastolic flow is detected.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Remarkable changes and continuous growth and development of the early maternal-fetal circulation could be studied by Doppler ultrasound. This approach seems to give more light in understanding of the early pregnancy development. Doppler ultrasound was reported accurate to separate different segments of uterine blood flow during pregnancy. Color flow is used to anatomically locate arcuate, radial and spiral arteries. Pulsed Doppler is then used to study different flow patterns of visualized vessels. Studies of maternal-fetal circulation in early pregnancy may help for better understanding of physiological and pathophysiological hemodynamic changes in the circulation. Investigation of maternal (main uterine, arcuate, radial and spiral) arteries; placental (umbilical, chorionic arterioles) vessels and embryonic/fetal (heart, aorta and intracranial circulation) arteries flow patterns may help to diagnose abnormal implantation and embryonic development. More studies are necessary in order the Doppler technique to be used for clinical assessment in early pregnancy. Safety aspects should also be considered. However, potentials of this technique are promising in study of early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities, development of pre-eclampsia and IUGR.

AB  - Background To review the literature of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow and serum hormonal profile in the patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) compared to the patients with normal menstrual cycles undergoing in-vitro fertilization treatment. Method Pertinent studies were identified through a computer MEDLINE search. References of selected articles were hand-searched for additional citations. Results The vascular impedance to uterine artery blood flow is higher during the luteal phase of PCO patients compared to the normally cycling patients and it does not show any dynamics throughout the menstrual cycle. In the normally cycling patients the active ovary shows dramatic hemodynamic changes during the cycle, therefore the vascular impedance to ovarian artery blood flow is almost constant throughout the menstrual cycle in the inactive ovary. In PCO patients the ovarian arterial blood flow in both ovaries is about the same as in inactive ovaries in the normally cycling patients. High vascular impedance to utero-ovarian arterial blood flow is associated with typical low vascular impedance of stromal ovary vascularization in PCO patients. In stimulated cycles a strong negative correlation between the vascular impedance to the uterine artery blood flow and the serum E2 concentration is found on the day of HCG administration. Taking only anovulatory PCO cycles into consideration, the above correlation is not confirmed. Conclusion Doppler analysis can be a valuable method for the assessment of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow in spontaneous and in stimulated cycles.

AB  - Background Twin-to-Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies. Particularly severe fetal and neonatal cardiac dysfunction is complicated in recipient twin and attended with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abnormal echocardiographic features and clinical complications of cardiac disease in TTTS. Method We studied 20 pregnancies complicated with TTTS. Serial fetal and neonatal echocardiography were carried out and evaluated the following parameters: cardiothoracic area ratio, aortic and pulmonary artery Doppler peak velocities, umbilical arterial resistance index, preload index of inferior vena cava, ventricular valve regurgitation and structural heart abnormalities. Result In recipients, all features had cardiomegaly, tricuspid valve regurgitation and high preload condition with increased preload index of inferior vena cava. Aortic and pulmonary artery peak velocities were increased in the recipients than those in the donors. Three cases of recipients had pulmonary valve stenosis and received balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Furthermore, three cases of donors had coarctation of aorta and also received surgical repair. Conclusion In addition to the severity of cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of aorta would be the important factors to evaluate perinatal prognosis of TTTS.

AB  - Background Absent enddiastolic flow (AEDF) velocities are associated with fetal distress and adverse fetal outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate perinatal findings of fetuses with an AEDF in fetal vessels and to investigate the neurological long-term-outcome. Method The analytical program ?Munich functional developmental diagnostics? (MFDD) was applied to the 90 children at different time intervals. The results of 40 children with an AEDF (Gr. I) and 20 children with pathological S/D-Ratio (Gr. II) were compared to the group of 30 children with normal Doppler-flow-findings (Gr. III) with the same pregnancy weeks at birth. Results The rate of C-section (92% vs. 71% vs. 36%), birthweight (1140g vs. 1725g vs. 2570g), 5?min. APGAR-Score (31% vs. 5% both) were significantly different in three groups. Brain sparing effect in the middle cerebral arteries was found in 81% in Gr. I, in 21% Gr. II and only 8% in Gr. III. At the time of neurological assessment the age of children was between 12 and 36?months. The developmental age for each functional category was evaluated and the difference between corrected age and developmental age was calculated. In 33% of all infants with a AEDF had a pathological neuromotoric development vs. 22% in Gr. II and only 15.3% in Gr. III. Conclusions The children with pathological Doppler-flow-measurements during pregnancy have not only very high risk of perinatal abnormality but also show a distinctly increased risk of impaired growth and neurodevelopmental disability comparing to the cases with a normal Doppler-flow-finding. Most of these fetuses showed brain-sparing effect. These aspects are very important to be discussed with the parents before the definitive perinatal decision is made.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow in infertile patients. Methods Seventy-six FSH stimulated cycles in 39 patients participating in a timed intercourse or iui program were studied. Transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler measurement of the dominant follicle and corpus luteum resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), maximum venous velocity (MVV) and serum p levels during mesoluteal phase were recorded. Velocimetric parameters were established and then used to classify ovarian function in normal ovulatory cycle (NOV; n?=?52), luteal phase defect (LPD; n?=?15) and luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF; n?=?9). Results The luteal PSV and MVV in the nov and LPD cycles were significantly higher (NOV: 24.3?±?12.2 vs. 13.1?±?6.5 and 8.1?±?3.30 vs. 3.6?±?1.1; LPD: 29.8?±?10.3 vs. 14.4?±?4.8 and 5.7?±?1.5 vs. 4.3?±?1.2) and luteal RI and PI were significantly lower (NOV: 0.45?±?0.06 vs. 0.55?±?0.08 and 0.62?±?0.15 vs. 0.83?±?0.22; LPD: 0.46?±?0.05 vs. 0.54?±?0.06 and 0.62?±?0.10 vs. 0.81?±?0.15) than follicular ones. LUF cycles did not show significant changes during the ovarian cycle (follicular vs. luteal PSV; MVV; RI and PI: 14.4?±?4.8 vs. 14.9?±?7.3; 4.3?±?1.2 vs. 4.2?±?2.1; 0.47?±?0.07 vs. 0.58?±?0.12 and 0.66?±?0.12 vs. 0.89?±?0.29) and no ?luteal conversion? of the Doppler signal was identified. There was significant correlation between luteal MVV and serum p (r?=?0.36). Conclusions Arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow remain unaltered during LUF cycles and P levels correlate with luteal MVV. This makes Doppler an effective noninvasive test to assess ovulation and luteal function.

AB  - Background The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of three-dimensional power Doppler imaging (3D-PDI) in the assessment of the patency of the fallopian tubes during hystero-salpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Methods HyCoSy using contrast medium echovist was done on 67 subfertile women. 3D-PDI and two-dimensional (2D) gray-scale imaging were used to visualize the contrast medium in the tubes. Results Contrast medium echovist produced prominent signals on the 3D-PDI image. Free spill of the fallopian tubes which had had the proximal part visualized was demonstrated in 114 (91%) tubes using 3D-PDI technique and in 58 (46%) tubes using conventional HyCoSy. The mean duration of imaging procedure was less than 3D-PDI. A significantly lower volume of contrast medium (5.9?+?0.6?ml) was used for 3D-PDI in comparison with volume (11.2?+?1.9?ml) used for conventional HyCoSy. Conclusions The 3D-PDI method appeared to have advantages over the conventional HyCoSy technique, especially in terms of visualization of spill from the distal end of the tube which was achieved twice as often with the 3D technique. The shorter duration of the imaging and lower volume of the contrast medium used suggested that the 3D-PDI technique may have a better side-effect profile. The 3D-PDI technique allowed better storage of the information for re-analysis and archiving than 2D scanning.

AB  - Background Ultrasound malformations of the fetal genitourinary tract are well documented in the sonographic literature. However, we would like to report on some specific observations. These will include a survey of fetal pelvic kidneys, an association between single umbilical artery (SUA) and absence of one of the kidneys, and the ?Tulip sign?? an ultrasonic marker for severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Method All records of patients with ectopic kidneys over a 5-year period (1995?99) have been perused. Sonographic parameters of ectopic kidney have been evaluated. The same was done for cases of SUA and agenesis of one kidney and for cases with severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Results Pelvic kidney was diagnosed prenatally in 35 cases, of which, bilateral pelvic kidney was detected in 2 cases. There was no predilection for fetal gender, and no tendency to side of appearance. Most cases were diagnosed in late 2nd trimester of pregnancy. The association of SUA and absent kidney was detected in 6 cases. In all cases the diagnosis was made in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. In 6 cases, the specific ?Tulip sign? was detected prenatally and proven postnatally. Conclusions Unique presentations of renal anomalies can be detected prenatally. Pelvic kidney is easily dealt with, however, the association of SUA and absent kidney requires further evaluation of the fetus to exclude the VATER association. The ?Tulip sign? is helpful in diagnosing severe hypospadias.

AB  - Aim To investigate the potential usefulness of contrast enhanced three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography in the differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal lesions. Methods A total of 31 patients with complex adnexal lesions of uncertain malignancy at transvaginal B mode and/or color Doppler sonography were prospectively evaluated with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography before and after injection of the contrast agent. Presence of a penetrating pattern and a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern suggested adnexal malignancy. The results were compared with histopathology. Results There were 10 cases of ovarian malignancy and 21 benign adnexal lesions. Of the 10 ovarian cancers, 6 (60%) showed vascular distribution suggestive of malignancy at nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography. After injection of contrast agent, a penetrating vascular pattern and/or a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern were detected in all cases of ovarian malignancy with two benign lesions (fibroma and cystadenofibroma) which were misdiagnosed as malignant. The use of a contrast agent with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography showed diagnostic efficiency (96.7%) that was superior to nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography (93.5%). Conclusion Contrast enhanced 3D power Doppler sonography provides better visualizatoin of tumor vascularity in complex adnexal masses. If used together with 3D morphological ultrasound assessment, enhanced 3D power Doppler imaging might precisely discriminate benign from malignant adnexal lesions.

AB  - Background Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for identifying fetal urinary tract anomalies (UTA). Serious obstructive or dysgenetic abnormalities are often clearly detected and their implications well known. Less clear is the meaning of borderline (asymptomatic at birth) UTA, including: mild pyelectasis (MP), unilateral renal agenesis (URA), unilateral multicystic kidney (UMK) and ectopic kidney (EK). Method We determined the outcome of pregnancies and long-term renal function in 120 cases of prenatally detected borderline UTA. A prospective protocol was proposed to the parents which comprised ultrasound evaluation every 3?months until the age of 24?months, and renal function assessment in case of suspected worsening of prenatal findings. Results A total of 120 fetuses had a borderline UTA (MP n?=?58, URA n?=?14, UMK n?=?32, EK n?=?16). Eighteen of them showed some postnatal complication including: associated anomalies (3 cases), need for surgical intervention (6 cases), vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR, 5 cases) and repeated infection (4 cases). Conclusions Fetal pyelectasis, rarely requires neonatal intervention if the diameter of pelvis is included between 5 and 10?mm in the second trimester. Nevertheless, the risk of associated chromosome abnormalities should be ruled out if other risk factors are present. Unilateral multicystic kidney carries a high risk of nephrectomy and contralateral VUR, whereas unilateral agenesis or ectopic kidneys seem to carry limited, if any, negative implications, with the exception of possible undetected, associated anomalies.

AB  - The acronym ared indicates two characteristic patterns of the Doppler Velocity Waveform (DVWF) namely the observation of absence (EDFA) or reverse (RF) blood flow in diastole. ARED flow are usually observed in fetuses presenting severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or sometime are concomitant to fetal abnormalities like hydrops. The fetal condition is always severely affected mainly by hypoxaemia and/or acidaemia but at different levels according to the two patterns that are observed. Usually in the literature ared cases are presented and discussed without making difference between the two possible conditions. This approach cannot be considered correct because large differences in many clinical aspects are evident when evaluating separately EDFA or RF in 94 cases observed in our Institute. Gestational age, mean birth weight are significantly lower while perinatal mortality rate and prevalence of handicaps among survivors are significantly higher in the group presenting RF as compared to EDFA cases. As a consequence the clinical management is also different. In case of EDFA the timing of the delivery should be taken into consideration but it is not always urgent. On the contrary when RF is observed intrauterine death has to be expected within few days. Therefore the delivery should be immediate at the first observation of RF. The critical point is that also applying this policy the prevalence of handicaps among survivors is very high (35%). As a consequence when facing those clinical condition a careful and complete information must be offered to the family before choosing, if no maternal indications are present, an aggressive management.

AB  - Purpose No randomized controlled trials of treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) exist. Since severely preterm neonatal survival has increased over time, survival as an outcome measure is confounded by calendar time. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval is a calendar year independent measure of success of treatment. We wished to evaluate whether treatment of TTTS is associated with a lengthening of the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. Methods MEDLINE search supplemented by careful reference review. All TTTS series were included where the following information on each patient was available: survival, fetal demise, gestational age (GA) at diagnosis and diagnosis to delivery interval in days. Inclusion criteria GA?≤?29?weeks and diagnosis by ultrasound in the absence of maternal symptoms. Cases undergoing multiple types of treatment were excluded. Data were evaluated by Kruskal?Wallis anova, logistic regression & Wilcoxon rank sum testing. Results The 8 publications used included the following cases: controls (n?=?16), amnioreduction (n?=?61), septostomy (n?=?12), and fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagus vessels (FLOC) (n?=?51). FLOC therapy showed a significantly longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction (median 75 vs. 56?days) (p?=?0.01). There was no difference in overall survival, at least one survivor, or number of fetal deaths between the 4 groups. Logistic regression using at least one survivor as the dependent variable revealed a positive association with GA at diagnosis and with diagnosis to delivery interval, a negative correlation with fetal death, and no correlation with treatment group. Conclusions FLOC therapy for TTTS is associated with a longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction without a significant increase in survival. The lack of increase in survival appears to be due to a small sample size.

AB  - Background To decrease perinatal mortality and morbidity rate in case of multifetal pregnancy fetal reduction (MFPR) in the first trimester was introduced. Methods Combine ultrasound and Doppler evaluation of fetal chromosomal abnormality markers, fetal structure and biometry, chorionicity and amnionicity, arterial and venous circulation in fetal-placental-maternal functional system were introduced as an algorithm before MFPR. Results 355 fetuses in 112 women were examined before 141 MFPR. NT thickness was above 2.5?mm in 1,7% of fetuses and one fetus had reverse DV flow. But no fetal chromosomal defects were detected after CVS. No specific severe complications for multifetal pregnancy were registered in completed pregnancies. Average gestational age at birth was 35,5 w that was less then in essential twins but perinatal mortality rate was 5.8? and 12.8? correspondingly. Conclusion MFPR with combine fetal examination seems to be the way to improve multifetal pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to identify sources and clinical significance of 3DUS artifacts on patient diagnosis and to increase clinician and sonographer awareness to reduce misdiagnosis in 3DUS studies. To accomplish this 3DUS data were acquired and reviewed interactively. Artifacts were cataloged according to origin: B-mode, color/power Doppler or unique to 3DUS (acquisition, rendering or volume editing). Original scan planes, re-sliced planes and rendered images were evaluated. Overall our results showed a variety of artifacts. B-mode artifacts included drop-out, shadowing, etc. and depending on relationships between slice and imaging plane orientation. Color/power Doppler artifacts were related to gain, aliasing, and flash and could add apparent structure or confusion to the volume images. Rendering artifacts were due to parameter adjustment, shadowing and motion. Important structures could be removed by improper editing. In conclusion 3DUS and 2DUS are prone to similar artifacts plus others unique to 3DUS. Diagnostically significant artifacts can mimick abnormal development, masses, or missing structures thus requiring careful study before reaching a diagnosis.
