AB  - The incidence of fetal malformation is higher in multifetal pregnancies than in singletons. In a dizygotic twin gestation there is slightly more than twice the risk per pregnancy of a fetal malformation. In a monozygotic twin gestation the rates of chromosomal and mendelian abnormalities are identical to those of a singleton pregnancy. However, there is an increased risk of structural malformations. Selective termination in a bichorionic biamniotic twin pregnancy is done with intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. The international experience show that it can be performed in all 3 trimesters with good outcomes in >?90% of cases and the loss rate is approximately 7%. In monochorionic twin gestation the aim is to arrest the umbilical cord flow completely and permanently. Several methods to achieve this goal are embolization, ligation (fetoscope of U/S guidance), laser coagulation, monopolar and bipolar thermocoagulation. The latter technique became more popular, with estimated loss rate of 20%. The techniques and results will be presented (including video), and the ethical issue will be discussed.

AB  - Background Reversed enddiastolic Doppler flow velocity waveforms on umbilical velocimetry is regarded to be associated with catastrophical perinatal outcome with a high perinatal mortality ranging from 35% to 100%. This study focused on the differences of fetal morbidity and mortality between the cases with reverse flow and other Doppler flow velocity waveforms. Method During a 10-year period we found 30 cases with reverse flow in the umbilical artery or fetal aorta (gr. I), we selected 30 cases with absent end diastolic velocities (gr. II), 30 cases with high A/B-ratio (gr. III) and 30 cases with normal A/B-ratio (gr. IV). All cases in this study were patients with similar para, gravida, maternal age and gestational ages by delivery (≤?36?weeks). Results The fetuses with reverse flow showed the highest perinatal mortality of 27% (7% in the gr. II, 10% in the gr. III and 0% in the gr. IV). In the gr. I the neonatal morbidity of 78% was also the highest (59% in the gr. II, 36% in the gr. III and 30% in the gr. IV). 80% of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) were within this group, while no IUFD has been found in the gr. IV. Furthermore, the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage by the neonates in the gr. I (28%) was also much higher than those in the gr. III (4%) and IV (0%). Conclusions Our study suggests that reverse flow represents severe fetal condition with the highest perinatal mortalities. The fetal outcome in cases with reverse flow is further worse than those with absent end diastolic flow velocity waveforms. A highest morbidity was also observed by those fetuses, especially high incidences of cerebral haemorrhage. Colour Doppler-sonography is a very useful tool to identify high risk pregnancy leading worse perinatal outcome and allows to select worst perinatal prognosis if reverse end diastolic flow is detected.

AB  - This report compiles the list of recommendations derived from the Summit on Increasing Physician Nutrition Experts. The recommendations represent expert opinion on topics related to increasing the number of physicians who choose nutrition as a career option and on topics related to strengthening multidisciplinary educational programs, research activity, and clinical practice in nutrition in the future. The recommendations should not be interpreted to represent consensus, approval, or endorsement by attendees or participating societies. A simple prioritization scheme identifies those short-term recommendations that should be more feasible, receive more immediate attention, and possibly require fewer resources than those described as long-term. Many of these recommendations are already being acted upon by various groups within the participating societies. The listing of recommendations does not imply responsibility for implementation by Summit attendees. The role for any council arising from this Summit is yet to be defined but may certainly involve facilitating communication and collaboration of initiatives arising from many of the issues listed here.

AB  - Physiologic change of spiral arteries is important adaptation of maternal vascular network for ongoing pregnancy. It is characterised by destruction of muscular layer of these vessels changing them to a low resistance vascular channels. Physiologic change was found to be incomplete in pregnancies complicated by pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). These changes were detected in vitro in histrologic studies but recently were investigated in vivo using Doppler ultrasound. In normal pregnancy the impedance to blood flow in spiral arteries measured by resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices significantly decrease toward the mid trimester (P?<?0.05) and then remains stable. Similar observation was found in pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR. Both of these represent the second wave of trophoblastic invasion of spiral arteries. In pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR measured impedance indices were significantly higher compared to the matched normotensive women with normal fetal growth (P?<?0.05), representing ht failure of the complete physiologic change of the spiral arteries. This is in concordance with histologic studies. Comparing the significance levels of blood flow in proximal and distal parts of uteroplacental circulation between investigated groups, the higher significance levels were obtained in terminal parts. This can have serious implication in designing further research protocols of the screening programmes for the PIH and IUGR based on the blood flow in uteroplacental circulation.

AB  - Introduction In this screening program, 2D color Doppler (2D CD) was used as the first, and CA-125 and 3D power Doppler (3D PD) were used as second-line screening tools when 2D scoring system indicated possible malignancy. The study was designed to show whether early stages of ovarian cancer can be correctly diagnosed by 3D PD and whether 3D would perform better than CA-125. Methods All patients were either postmenopausal, or premenopausal with positive family history, or they had a persistent ovarian cyst. They were all examined by 2D CD and if values of scoring system were over cut-off point, 3D PD analysis was performed and CA-125 was tested. Results A total of 108 patients (97 postmenopausal and 11 premenopausal with family history) had a 2D scan. In 5 cases 2D scoring indicated possible malignancy after which 3D analysis was done as well as test for CA-125. In 2 cases 3D PD scoring was negative, as well as CA-125 and the lesions were simple cyst surrounded by chronic inflammatory process in the first patient and ovarian fibroma in the second. In 3 cases 3D PD scoring was positive while CA-125 measurement showed increased values only in 1 case. PHD analysis confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma in all three lesions. 3D PD correctly predicted benign or malignant nature of the lesion, while CA-125 failed to do so in two stage 1 ovarian cancers. Conclusion Although now expensive and in most hospitals unavailable, 3D power Doppler is a future screening tool in ovarian cancer screening programs. However, a lot more women should be screened before proper statistical analysis could be done.

AB  - The purpose of the first study was to evaluate whether number and size of antral follicles can predict the outcome of IVF-ET. A total of 113 patients was prospectively included into this study. After 19?days of downregulation number and size of follicles were determined by using recent three dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3-D) technology. We demonstrated that patients with a higher number of follicles between 5 and 10?mm showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate (PR), whereas patients with antral follicles >?11?mm have a higher cancellation rate due to ovarian low-response. Ultrasound visualization of the cumulus has been demonstrated years ago as an occasional finding during follicle scanning. It has never been proven, however, that cumulus-like intrafollicular structures as seen on ultrasound correlated with the recovery of mature oocytes. It was therefore our aim to investigate this possibility by using recent three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D) technology: Cumulus visualization by 3D ultrasound seems to be an indicator for mature oocytes and the fertilization rate. Follicles without visualization of the cumulus in all three planes are unlikely to contain mature, fertilizable oocytes. In the third part we wanted to evaluate the possibility of puncturing procedures under three-dimensional ultrasound control in close to real time using a new commercially available system, and to describe the technique. It will be demonstrated for follicle punctures that recent technology enables the carrying out of three-dimensional puncture procedures in real time; but this will be of more importance in other fields, e.g. in fetal medicine, oncology, and surgery.

AB  - Aim To investigate the role of 3D-ultrasound in estimating the likelihood of conception in an IVF programme. Materials and methods We studied a total of 152 women during their stimulation cycle. Apart from conventional 2D-parameters we assessed endometrial and uterine volume (sub-)endometrial blood flow (sub-)endometrial vessel density and ovarian volume by 3D-ultrasound. Results With regard to subendometrial blood flow on day 1 of the stimulation cycle, all 3D-indices were significantly lower in the conception vs. non-conception group. On the day of oocyte retrieval, any difference between the two groups failed to reach statistical significance. The same applied to endometrial volumes. The latter showed a significant corrrelation with uterine size. Ovarian volumes ≤?3?mm (1 SD below the mean) on day 1 of the stimulation cycle were associated with a nonsignificant lower conception rate. Conclusion Quantitative assessment of spiral artery blood flow and vessel density may be an early predictor of IVF success.

AB  - Objectives To compare the use a simplified ultrasound based infertility investigation of the infertile couple with the current use of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. Study design Thirty-three infertile couples underwent transvaginal ultrasound and hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography. A diagnosis was formulated based on the results of the ultrasound investigations, a semen analysis and endocrine parameters. The following day all subjects underwent a laparoscopic chrompertubation and hysteroscopy by a surgeon unaware of the ultrasound findings. A diagnosis based on the findings at laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, the same semen analysis and endocrine parameters, was then made. The two diagnoses were compared. Results A 90.9% agreement was found between the diagnoses made from the two methods used. When considering laparoscopic diagnosis the Gold Standard of tubal patency, the sensitivity to diagnose occluded tubes using hystero-contrast-sonography was 92.8%. The corresponding figures for specificity, PPV and NPV were 96.2%, 92.8% and 98.1%, respectively. Conclusions A simple, ultrasound based approach to investigate the infertile couple, can be used effectively as an initial examination modality during the couple's work-up. However, there is a need for a larger study to confirm these results.

AB  - Fetal echocardiography including colour and spectral Doppler facilitates the diagnosis of the great majority of major structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in the late first and early second trimester of gestation. Based on more than 4000 echocardographic examinations between 10 and 16?weeks of gestation (4/1993?3/2000) following data are demonstrated: 1. The four-chamber view and cross-over of the pulmonary trunk and aorta were visualised in 44% of the fetuses at 10?weeks and in 100% at 13?weeks of gestation. 2. Normative biometric data of the fetal heart has been established. The ratio of the right and left ventricle and of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta were constant during this period of pregnancy (approximately 1.00 and 1.10, respectively). 3. The detection rate for cardiac malformations was greater than 60%. Colour Doppler increased the detection rate by easier demonstration of the great arteries and of abnormal cardiac blood flow pattern (valvular incompetence and stenosis). 4. In fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (=?3?mm) (30% of those with general hydrops) the rate of aneuploidy was twice as high in fetuses with abnormal echocardiographic findings compared to fetuses with normal echocardiogram. In some aneuploid fetuses with normal cardiac structures transient tricuspid regurgitation was observed. 5. Some complex cardiac malformations were diagnosed which are very rare in later gestation, e.g. absent pulmonary valve syndrome with patent ductus arteriosus, polyvalvular stenoses of the semilunar valves.

AB  - The intrauterine development of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most interesting fields in perinatology. The brain has three-dimensional structure and rapidly changes its appearance during pregnancy. Therefore, the fetal brain should be evaluated three-dimensionally with consideration of gestational age. Sonoembryology has been established by high-frequency transvaginal sonography. Premature brain structure and ventricular system of early fetuses can be clearly demonstrated and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies has been done earlier and earlier. Application of transvaginal approach to the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters has enabled brain imaging from fetal parietal direction through fontanelles and cranial sutures, and ?neurosonography? has been established. Recent introduction of 3D ultrasound in neurosonography produced skull imaging, serial parallel images of the brain structure, volume extraction of target organ and brain circulatory images. Furthermore, advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate CNS morphology including the brain stem, which is not clearly depicted by sonography. By using all those technologies, prenatal diagnosis of CNS abnormalities has been more objective and accurate. Intracranial changes in cases with CNS anomalies have been objectively demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, intrauterine acquired brain damage such as periventricular leukomalacia, which is one of the controversial issues in perinatology, has been proven by sonography in a few cases. Further case studies will be required for investigation of CNS pathology in utero.

AB  - Background The aim of the present study is to individuate sonographic markers which make it possible to distinguish borderline ovarian tumors from benign and malignant cysts, thus allowing conservative treatment. Method We reviewed transvaginal sonograms in 23 women who presented borderline ovarian tumors histologically confirmed. Sixteen were premenopausal and 7 postmenopausal. The size and morphologic criteria of each mass and color flow Doppler characteristics were evaluated. We compared these findings with those of 337 patients with benign ovarian tumors and those of 40 patients with malignant ovarian tumors. Results Of the 16 borderline ovarian tumors in premenopause 6 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 10 serous cystoadenomas. Of the 7 borderline tumors in postmenopause 3 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 4 serous cystoadenomas. The analysis of grey scale morphologic findings revealed the presence of solid tissue in 92.5% of malignant masses, in 13.3% of benign tumors (P?<?0.01) and in 31% of LMP tumors (P?<?0.01 vs. malignant, P?=?n.s vs. benign tumors). The presence of papillae within the cysts was significantly higher in borderline tumors (21%) compared to benign and malignant tumors. Three unilocular cysts with a diameter >?5?cm were borderline tumors. Conclusion The most frequent diagnostic imaging was that of a papillae inside a cyst without other signs of complexity and also the presence of septa was frequent. Neither papillae nor septa constituted sensitive sonographic markers.

AB  - Background Urinary tract anomalies are among the most common sonographically identified anomalies in utero with the incidence about 1/250?1/1000 pregnancies. The obstruction can be unilateral or bilateral at the level of urethra, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), ureterovesical junction (UVJ). Method Obstructive uropathy cases diagnosed antenatally have been retrospectively evaluated in terms of short and long-term outcome. It is important to make early diagnosis and intervention in order to save organ function as possible. Results During last 7?years in our Department, 58 cases with fetal obstructive uropathy were examined and performed 12 interventions. They were diagnosed antenatally with different type of obstruction including posterior urethral valve syndrome, unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, multicystic kidney. Intervention was performed in 12 cases at different stage of gestation including needling, vesico-amniotic shunting and pelvic shunting. Out of 12 procedures, there was mortality in 5 cases antenatally or neonatally. Conclusion Early diagnosis of the obstruction is very important before the kidney becomes dysplastic. The type of anomalies, level and starting time of pathology and duration of severe obstruction are the main factors for prognosis. Early diagnosis and referral to tertiary center is to be encouraged in order to have early management and intervention in the case of severe obstruction and to save kidney function as early as possible.

AB  - In the context of an implementation study of nuchal translucency (NT) screening for Down's syndrome special attention was devoided to the psycho-social aspects. The impact of age, parity, religion, education together with the reasons for opting in or out for the NT measurement were recorded in 5895 patients. On a sample of 800 patients more specific aspects were addressed such as the level of knowledge about prenatal diagnosis before and after screening, the reaction to the offer of NT screening and the general women's opinion on whether this form of screening should be offered to all pregnant women. Questionnaires devised to measure the anxiety and depression produced by screening (hads) were filled before screening, at 20?weeks' gestation and after delivery by the same group of patients and by 200 controls. Preliminary results are available. 80% of the asked women, with no differences in age, religion and parity choose for NT screening. Main reason for having the NT measured was the hope of avoiding invasive testing and the wish of having more information on their pregnancy. The majority of women experienced positively NT screening even in case of an increased measurement and irrespectively of whether they would terminate an affected pregnancy or not. A slight increase in anxiety level produced by the screening normalized by 20?weeks' gestation.

Design Fetuses between 22 and 37?weeks' gestation with an estimated fetal weight below the 5th centile were included in this prospective longitudinal study. Doppler measurements in the umbilical artery, descending aorta, middle cerebral artery, transverse cerebral sinus and ductus venosus were recorded. Fetal heart rate was analyzed by a computer system according to the Dawes-Redman criteria. Results Blood flow within the midcerebral artery and that in the cerebral transverse sinus follow a mirror image distribution. Arterial redistribution is already present when alteration in the venous cerebral circulation develops. We measured a significant correlation between pulsatility index in the transverse cerebral sinus and in the ductus venosus over the study period and at delivery. There was a negative correlation between these indices and short and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate. There was a parallel increase in pulsatility in the ductus venosus and the transverse cerebral sinus. These changes were inversely correlated with fetal heart rate variability and preceded fetal distress. Conclusion Cerebral venous blood flow in IUGR fetuses may be a useful additional investigation to (1) understand better the mechanism of cerebral redistribution in hypoxemic IUGR and (2) to discriminate between fetal adaptation and fetal decompensation in chronic hypoxemia.

AB  - Background Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates 10?15% of monochorionic (MC) and is associated with high perinatal mortality and morbidity. Method Sixteen MC twin pairs were evaluated between 10?14 weeks for delta nuchal translucency (?NT) and Doppler blood flow in ductus venosus (DV). Sequential scans were performed to identify TTTS. Results Neither the 12 cases with ?NT<0.7 mm/normal flow, nor the two cases with ?NT>0.7 mm/normal flow in DV, developed TTTS. The two cases that combined ?NT>0.7 mm and abnormal flow in DV eventually developed TTTS. Conclusion The presence of abnormal blood flow in the DV in MC twins, at 10?14 weeks, may be a precocious anticipatory sign of TTTS.

AB  - We have been studying fetal centralization in the toxemic/IUGR model since 1992, by means of Doppler of the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries and ductus venosus, computerized CTG and cordocentesis. The natural history of fetal centralization may be divided into 3 phases: normoxemic centralization, hypoxemic centralization and decompensation. The natural history of fetal hypoxemia in these models and the patterns of computerized CTG were also described. Having analysed 105 cases of very high-risk pregnancies in the toxemic/IUGR model with fetal centralization, we tried to define the best parameter to indicate the ideal timing for delivery, and the presence of centralization after 28?weeks gestation appears to seems to indicate it.
