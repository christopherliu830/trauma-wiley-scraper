AB  - Menopause is associated with an increase in the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. Loss of ovarian function is characterized by significantly high values of blood and plasma viscosity. After the menopause, thromboxane production increases and correlates with duration of menopause. Large studies have shown that postmenopausal HRT is associated with reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma thromboxane and plasma viscosity in relation with Doppler flow parameters in postmenopausal patients treated with HRT. Thirty-two postmenopausal (FSH?>?40 UI/L and estradiol <?100?pmol/L) women (mean age?±?SD, 54.7?±?2.9?years) participated in the study and were submitted to continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation and 12-day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate every second month. Doppler resistances at the level of uterine and internal carotid arteries, thromboxane plasma levels and plasma viscosity were analyzed in basal condition and after 1, 3 and 6?months. During hormone supplementation, the pulsatility index significantly decreased at the level of analyzed arteries. Similarly, plasma thromboxane levels and plasma viscosity were significantly reduced. Significant correlations were found between thromboxane plasma concentrations, plasma viscosity and uterine artery resistances. Thus HRT seems to be responsible for both direct and indirect modifications at the level of the vessel wall physiology.

AB  - Background To investigate the effects of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the vascular impedance of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Method Thirty-five postmenopausal patients were analysed in basal condition and during a HRT phase at 1, 3 and 6?months. Patients were divided in two groups: 21 patients whose last menstrual bleeding was 1?5?years ago, and 14 patients with the duration of menopause >?6?years. Color Doppler analysis of the blood flow impedance was performed at the level of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Estradiol plasma concentrations were assayed on the day of Doppler examinations. Results The analysis of the uterine and inferior vesicle artery flow velocities demonstrated significant positive correlations between resistance index (RI) and years of menopause; higher impedance values were obtained in patients with longer interval from last menstrual bleeding (P?<?0.05). The impedance in patients with >?6?years duration of menopause was 0.94?±?0.03 vs., 0.89?±?0.04, in the group of patients with 1?5?years duration of menopause for uterine artery, and for inferior vesicle artery (0.91?±?0.04 vs. 0.98?±?0.02). No significant correlation between baseline RI and time since menopause was noticed (0.72 vs. 0.73, respectively, P?>?0.05) at the level of ophtalmic artery. After six months of HRT plasma estradiol levels inversely correlated with RI uterine (r?=??0.2556; P?=?0.021), inferior vesicle (R?=??0.2653; P?=?0.023) and opthalmic (r?=??0.2211; P?=?0.017) arteries. Conclusion Doppler studies of uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophtalmic artery can provide specific and precise pathophysiological information to assess blood flow variations in correlation with combined HRT administration.

AB  - Background This study was conducted to assess uterine blood flow characteristics in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the influence of myometrial invasion and cancer grading for uterine circulation. Method Transvaginal color doppler was performed on 97 women with endometrial cancer (11 in stage IA, 33 in stage IB, 37 in stage IC, 7 in stage II, 8 in stage III, and 1 in stage IV) and 51 asymptomatic postmenopausal women (control group). Intratumoral and main uterine artery blood flow was recorded and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and impedance indices (RI, PI) were calculated. Results In 90 of the 97 postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients (92%) abnormal blood flow with low impedance levels (RI: 0.39?±?0.08; PI: 0.51?±?0.15) was found within the endometrial echo or very close to it. Impedance indices in the main uterine arteries were significantly (P?<?0005) lower in women with endometrial cancer than in normal postmenopausal woman. Uterine blood flow was not modified by the cancer grading. There was, no difference in impedance indices of the uterine arteries between myometrial invasion of <?50% and >?50%. Conclusion These results suggest that uterine blood flow analysis in endometrial cancer could not predict the tumor staging and grading, but this examination can provide additional discriminatory information on tumor vascularity which can then be used with morphology for more accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Recently suggested role of tamoxifen as a preventive agent in women at high risk of breast cancer has a potential to increase significantly the number of women treated with tamoxifen agent. By the fact that tamoxifen is beneficial in taming the breast cancer, but detrimental to the uterus by increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma, hyperplasia, and development of endometrial polyps, surveillance of endometrial changes in patients on tamoxifen is needed. However, no cost-effective method has been found for screening for the rare occurrence of endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, the ACOG does not recommend routine endometrial screening of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Regardless of aforementioned recommendation, ultrasound (US) is very helpful as a first line for diagnosis of endometrial pathology in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with previous endometrial pathology. Endometrial thickness <?5?mm is reassuring,?>?5?8?mm calls for further investigation such as sonohysterography to rule out polyps. If it fails to demonstrate polyps, but cystic structures still present and letter on endometrial biopsy (or D  2. Follow up with endometrial biopsy/D  or 3.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (which acquires data as a volume, instead of a series of planes, eliminating gating) to evaluate fetal cardiac anatomy and function. We evaluated 10 human fetuses including several with congenital heart disease. Transabdominal scanning was performed using a real-time three-dimensional echocardiography system. Four 1.5 second volume clips at 20 volumes/second were obtained for each fetal heart and stored for off-line analysis. Data were reviewed on a graphics workstation. Our results showed that fetal heart data could be acquired rapidly. Fetal heart data were displayed as 3 simultaneous planes. The reviewer could manipulate plane orientation and position in the volume to optimize views. Cardiac motion could be accelerated, slowed, stopped or viewed at its original speed. Although image quality did not equal high-end equipment, cardiac structures, views and function could be consistently visualized. Abnormal structures were readily detected. In conclusion, real-time three-dimensional fetal echocardiography is a feasible and potentially important new technique that will gain importance as equipment performance improves.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to test the value of sonographic staging of twin?twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in predicting the outcome of patients treated with amniocentesis or selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV). Methods TTTS was defined as a deep vertical pocket (DVP) in the recipient twin of >?8?cm and in the donor twin <?2?cm. TTTS was staged as follows: Stage I: bladder of donor visible; Stage II: bladder of donor not visible; Stage III: critically abnormal Dopplers; Stage IV: hydrops; Stage V: demise. Patients were treated with amniocentesis or SLPCV. Results There were a statistically significant difference by stage for at least one survivor between the two techniques (Chi-square = 2.63, p?=?0.05), but analysis was limited by sample size (amniocentesis n?=?9, SLPCV n?=?70). In the amniocentesis group there was an 83% (n?=?5) survival rate for two survivors in Stage I and no survivors (n?=?3) in stages II or III. In the SLPCV group, at least one fetus survived 83% of the time, regardless of stage. Conclusion Our preliminary data suggests that analysis of survival data by in TTTS needs stratification by stage. Early stages may be amenable to treatment with amniocentesis, while later stages may not benefit. SLPCV is uniformly effective, regardless of stage, but may not be warranted in early stages of TTTS.

AB  - In the growing embryo, the brain is the first organ system to develop in such a way that it can be imaged in detail with transvaginal ultrasound. The extension of the transvaginal ultrasound technique to 3D imaging makes it possible to obtain new ultrasound images of the developing embryonic brain in planes not available in the original scan plane, to present form and shape, and to calculate volume. New information about the embryonic brain development can be obtained: volume measurements of the embryonic brain compartments reflect the phylogenetic development. The ?old? rhombencephalon is large during the early phase, while the ?young? hemispheres are very small. During a few weeks, this correlation becomes reversed. Using 3D animations this dynamic developmental process can be visualized. Ultrasound technology has reached a level where the diagnosis of embryonic malformations can be made. At present, we are at the borderline of being able to diagnose holoprosencephaly when the embryo is seven to eight weeks. At nine weeks, 3D images of anomalies such as holoprosencephaly and spina bifida have been made. We may expect the rapidly developing 3D technology, with the option of anyplane slicing, to help us establish early diagnoses in the future. Such multiplane presentations of a diagnosis will contribute to increasing the diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound in identifying fetal brain space occupying lesions. Study design A retrospective evaluation of 14 cases of fetal brain space occupying lesions has been performed. All prenatal ultrasonographic diagnoses (5 teratomas, 1 choroid plexus papilloma and 8 arachnoid cysts) were compared with the postnatal findings on the aborted fetuses or on the newborns. Results In 11 out of 14 cases the antenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed postnatally; 1 case of supratentorial arachnoid cyst was mistaken for a teratoma and 2 cases of porencephalic cysts were wrongly diagnosed as arachnoid cysts (specificity = 78.5%). The specificity was better in the subgroup of solid or complex masses (5 out of 6?=?83.3%) than in the subgroup of cystic lesions (6 out of 8?=?75%). Conclusions Prenatal ultrasonography is a useful tool to identify any intracranial space-occupying lesion. In the present study it has shown a 78.5% specificity in the diagnosis of brain masses, with better results in the solid than in the cystic lesions. The distinction between the different causes of fetal brain space occupying lesions is clinically relevant, as each one carries different prognostic implications.

AB  - The differential diagnosis of adnexal masses still represents a challenge. The main goal is to determine whether a given mass is malignant or benign, in order to establish the best therapautical approach. When a clinician face to a woman diagnosed as having an adnexal tumor several parameters may be used to determine the nature of the mass, such as patient's age, menopausal status, clinical complaints, physical examination, tumor's sonographic and Doppler features and serum tumor markers. When these data are collected may be difficult to interpret them all together and the clinician has to rely in one or two of them to predict the diagnosis and to decide the management strategy, guided many times by own experience or strict protocols. A possible solution to this question may be the use of computer modelling. This means the use of statistical or mathematical models developed, using computer aid, to predict adnexal malignancy. Currently, there are two methods that may be used: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both techniques allow to calculate the probability of a particular event has occurred, in this case a mass to be malignant or benign. By computer modelling, actual independent predictors parameters are identified and may be used combined and simultaneously to predict malignancy. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, being MLRA the statistical technique of choice and ANN a potential newer alternative to MLRA. Several studies have been published using one or both technique to predict adnexal malignancy. The results of these studies are encouraging showing a high diagnostic performance. All studies comparing MLRA to ANN showed the latter seems to be superior. However, it should be taken into account that most of these models have not tested prospectively.

AB  - The breast cancer metastases can be analyzed by ultrasound in ganglial and visceral organs. The detection of metastatic lymphonod in the axillar, cervical or supraclavicular regions and intrammamarian changes both the cancer staging and therapeutic planning. Benign lymphonode usually have an oval shape, hilum hyperechogenicity, narrow cortex and show hilar vascularization or radical central symmetric vascularization and absence of peripheral flow at Color Doppler. Malignant lymphonode are usually rounded hyporechoic, without hilar hyperechogenicity, and, in color Doppler, present multifocal aberrant vascularization, tortuous vessels or flow in the periphery. The most frequent visceral metastases of breast cancer are hepatic, the suprarenal glands and ovaries. About 86% of breast cancer hepatic metastases are hypoechoic. Ovarian cancer metastases can be detected mainly in pelvic tumors, peritonium tumors, glanglial, abdominal wall, hepatic and splenic metastases and ascites. Our study of 10 cases of splenic metastases of ovarian cancer has demonstrated six hyperechoic tumors, two hypoechoic and two tumors with necrosis. The use of color Doppler and Powerangio has demonstrated weak or moderate vascularization in glanglial and visceral metastases of gynecological tumors. The use of contrast (Levovist) has shown a more detailed vascular analysis by detecting vessels that were not identified in color Doppler and Powerangio without contrast.

AB  - Background The significance of an increased nuchal translucency measurement (NT) in relation to the fetal karyotype and pregnancy outcome has been evaluated in multiple pregnancies. Methods 115 multiple pregnancies with 252 fetuses, including 100 pairs of twins (70 pairs with dichorionic placentas and 30 pairs with nonochorionic placenta), 9 sets of triplets, 5 sets of quadruplets, and one set of quintuplets, were considered. Results NT was greater than 95th centile in one fetus in 10 out of 70 cases of dichorionic twin pregnancies (14%), in two sets of quadruplets, in 7 out of 30 monochorionic twin pregnancies (23.3%). NT greater than 95th centile in both fetuses was found in one dichorionic twin pregnancy. Two cases of trisomy 21 and one 47, XXY were found. NT greater than 95th centile in 2/2 fetuses with trisomy 21 (one dichorionic twin pregnancy and one tetrachorionic pregnancy), and not enlarged in the 47, XXY (trichorionic triplet pregnancy). A case of skeletal dysplasia and one goldenhar syndrome were found among the 10 cases of increased NT in dichorionic pregnancies. Three intrauterine deaths of both fetuses, one congenital heart disease and a case of twin-to-twin transfusion occurred in 7 cases of increased NT in monochorionic pregnancies. Conclusions An enlarged NT in multiple pregnancies indicates fetuses at risk for chromosomal abnormalities and fetal malformation, as well as monochorionic twin pregnancies at higher risk for an adverse outcome.

AB  - To purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of performing off-line sonographic examinations over the internet using 3DUS data. To accomplish this we performed complete OB, pelvic, cardiac and abdominal studies following AIUM guidelines in 100 patients with 2DUS/3DUS methods including multiple volumes. Physicians performed a ?virtual re-scan? of the patient using 3DUS data that was compared retrospectively to the 2DUS diagnosis. Our overall results showed that both abnormal and normal findings were identified for both 2DUS and 3DUS studies. Outcome depended on sonographer training, image quality and patient motion. There were few false negative/positive results with either 2DUS or 3DUS studies. Proper training was essential to acquire sufficient volumes for a complete study and for complete patient evaluation. In conclusion, off-line virtual evaluation of patients is feasible using 3DUS data but has different technical requirements for acquisition and review than 2DUS studies. Proper training of sonographers, well defined scanning protocols and acquisition of sufficient volume data are essential to obtain diagnostic studies.

AB  - Background To assess particular features of fetal extremities evaluation using three-dimensional ultrasound. Methods Total of 276 patients were selected from our routine outpatient clinic or sent for supervision from other clinics because of a suspected fetal anomaly. Patients were examined during a three year period (Jan1997-Dec1999). Pre-selected patients were examined with standard 2-D ultasonic devices, and their gestation age ranged between 12 and 40?weeks. 3-D ultrasound devices were Combison 530D and Voluson 530D MT (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria) with a 3?5?MHz annular array transducer for three dimensional volume scanning. Results In 28/276 patients the initial diagnosis was suspected by 2-D sonography at entry in the study. In 18/28 suspected cases diagnosis was determined after examination by 3-D sonography (15/28 clubfoot, 3/28 other limb anomalies). The diagnosis of clubfoot was confirmed In 17/28 cases after delivery or termination of pregnancy, meaning that 2/18 cases of clubfoot were not detected using ultrasonography. In all of 3 other cases the sonographic diagnoses of hand contractures and micromelia were confirmed after termination of pregnancy. Conclusion 3-D sonography accurately visualized angular and structural limb anomalies. In two cases of severe oligohydramnios we missed clubfoot by 3-D sonography.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fetal venous Doppler in detection of fetal hypoxia and timing of the delivery. Methods The study group consisted of patients with increased risk for developing fetal hypoxia. These were patients with diagnosed fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and patients with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), or a combination of both problems. All patients had Doppler assessment of fetal arterial (umbilical artery, aorta, middle cerebral artery) and venous circulation (ductus venosus and umbilical vein), and cardiotocography 24?h before delivery. Collection of postnatal data included pH of umbilical chord blood, admission in neonatal intensive care unit, and perinatal death. Results A total of 360 patients were included in the study (IUGR 48%, PIH 20%, IUGR +?PIH 32%). Deterioration in fetal venous return developed after fetal arterial circulation had been severely compromised. The decrease in end-diastolic flow in ductus venosus anticipated development of umbilical vein pulsatile flow. Patients with pulsations in umbilical vein blood flow had high incidence of perinatal acidosis, morbidity, and mortality. Conclusion Delivery should be performed before umbilical vein pulsations develop. Careful monitoring of ductus venosus blood flow is helpful predictor of this event.
