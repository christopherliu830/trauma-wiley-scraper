AB  - Summary Foundation programmes are compulsory for all UK graduating doctors. The programme is intended to streamline training so as to ensure that all junior doctors develop a set of core transferable skills and to reduce the bottleneck when entering the registrar grade. In addition to the clinical foundation programmes, there are a number of academic programmes where trainees have protected time to develop their research, teaching or leadership skills. In order to improve recruitment practices in the United Kingdom, many programmes including the foundation programme are using situational judgement tests (SJTs) to assess job relevant behaviours and select the best candidates for any given post. Evidence-based medicine is a central tenet of being a good doctor. Basically, evidence-based medicine involves using research findings to give clinicians much more statistical power in interpreting everyday clinical data rather than relying on anecdotal evidence.

AB  - Drawing upon findings of a four-year national research project on variations in the work and lives of teachers in England, this paper provides empirical evidence which contributes to understandings about the importance of resilience in teachers' work. The experience of resilience as perceived by teachers in this research was that it was neither innate nor stable and was much more than a capacity to survive and thrive in extremely adverse circumstances. Rather, it was perceived as being closely allied to their everyday capacity to sustain their educational purposes and successfully manage the unavoidable uncertainties which are inherent in the practice of being a teacher. Their capacity to be resilient fluctuated as a result of the influences of the personal, relational and organisational settings in which they worked. The findings have implications for initial and in-service professional development programmes, school leadership and the quality retention of teachers.

AB  - Summary Schools of surgery have been set up in recent years to facilitate the partnership between the deaneries, the Royal College of Surgeons and the trusts. The Joint Committee on Surgical Training is an advisory body to the Royal Colleges of Surgeons when it comes to matters of surgical training. It used to be the Joint Committee on Higher Surgical Training but its role has broadened to include core training. The Raven Department of Education is run by the Royal College of Surgeons of England and runs courses for surgeons from foundation stage to consultant. Training programme directors (TPDs) organise, manage and direct specialty training programmes, including core training and specialty training. They will have the support of a local faculty including assigned educational supervisors (AESs). The Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme 'provides the framework for systematic training from completion of the foundation years to consultant level'.
