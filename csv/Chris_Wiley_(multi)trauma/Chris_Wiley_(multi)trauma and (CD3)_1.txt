AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - SUMMARY With the advent of standard flow cytometric methods using two-colour fluorescence on samples of whole blood, it is possible to establish the ranges of CD3. CD 4 and CDS T lymphocyte subsets in the routine laboratory, and also to assist the definition of HIV-1-related deviations from these normal values. In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4% and CD8% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values < 25% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean±s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1·90±0·55, 1·45±0·46, 0·83±0·29 and 0·56± 0·23 ± 109/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4<0·4 ± 109/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were?physiologically? lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations?within persons? were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts <0·4 ± 109/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1·4% and 3%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show <0·4 ± 109/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency.

AB  - Abstract Background L-arginine (L-Arg) is deficient in sickle cell disease (SSD) during vasoocclusion. We investigated possible causal relationship between L-Arg deficiency and immune dysfunction in SSD in steady-state. Procedure Fifteen patients with SSD in steady-state and 13 controls were studied. Plasma L-Arg levels were measured using liquid chromatography. T cell subsets and CD3zeta (CD3?) chain expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) were evaluated with and without L-Arg. Results SSD patients had significantly lower L-Arg levels than controls. CD3 and CD19 cell populations were comparable for both groups, but SSD patients had above normal numbers of natural killer cells (P?=?0.06). Patients and controls exhibited significantly increased lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA after introduction of L-Arg to cultures; response of patients was significantly greater than values for control individuals. Proliferative response to candida in SSD patients was significantly lower than in controls; L-Arg supplementation did not increase this response. L-Arg had no effect on blastogenic response to PPD and candida albicans. No effect was likewise seen in production of IL-6 and IFN-? after addition of L-Arg. CD3? chain expression increased after addition of L-Arg in both groups; differences were insignificant. Conclusion L-Arg levels in steady-state SSD are significantly lower than in controls. L-Arg supplementation enhanced lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA for both controls and patients, but not in response to antigen. There were no significant differences in CD3? chain expression although upregulation of expression occurred after L-Arg supplementation for both groups.

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

AB  - 1 Jewell Carter, and 1 R. Edward Hogan ( 1 Neurology, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Of the more than 2 million persons in the United States with epilepsy, 400,000?600,000 are refractory to antiepileptic medication. Of these, 100,000?300,000 persons may have an epileptic region that can be surgically removed. It has already been established that the length of time a patient is referred to a tertiary epilepsy center is about 20 years. Once referred, the question becomes, what additional factors motivate a person to proceed with epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgery remains an underused treatment modality. To investigate factors associated with subjects who do or do not undergo epilepsy surgery, we compared two groups of subjects with refractory TLE, comparing subjects with and without a history of epilepsy surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all subjects who were evaluated at The Greater Midwest Epilepsy Treatment Center at Saint Louis University during the period of 1990?2001. The epilepsy surgery group was selected by consecutive review of subjects with a diagnosis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to mesial temporal sclerosis who underwent epilepsy surgery. Subjects were matched, on a case by case basis, with subjects with chronic intractable temporal lobe epilepsy with no history of epilepsy surgery. The groups were matched for age, gender and total lifetime seizures. Using Fisher's Exact test, we compared marital status, insurance, race, and employment between the groups. For the epilepsy surgery subjects, all clinical data was taken from the pre-surgical evaluation. Results: There were 15 men and 15 women in each group. Mean ages were 34.8 for surgery and 37.7 for non-surgery groups (p = 0.34). Total lifetime seizures between groups were comparable (p = 0.25). Employment between the groups was significantly different (the surgery group being more likely to be employed), p = 0.0127. Defining insurance as Medicaid with or without Medicare, there was a near-significant finding (the non-surgery group being more likely to have Medicaid), p = 0.0692. Race (defined as white/non-white) (p = 0.47), and marital status (p = 0.79) were non-significant. Conclusions: Employment is associated with subjects who underwent epilepsy surgery. While there are many factors that may lead patients to undergo epilepsy surgery, our findings are suggestive that the wish to sustain employment is an important factor, regardless of severity of epilepsy. Of note, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services research findings, identified that a major concern of persons with disabilities receiving SSDI and/or SSI was this: ?SSDI and/or SSI benefits were not sufficient to live on, but fear of loss of benefits discouraged work attempts for some, and for others the benefits disappeared too soon after first work attempts were made.? This may indicate possible hesitancy on the part of some with epilepsy to proceed with surgery. 1 Laura L. Jurasek, 1 Daphne Quigley, 1 D. Barry Sinclair, 1 Syed Nizam Ahmed, and 1 Donald W. Gross ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Alberta Hospital/Stollery Childrens Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Transition from pediatric to adult health care services can be difficult for patients and families. Barriers to transition have been identified in the literature, with little pertaining to epilepsy. The University of Alberta Comprehensive Epilepsy Program encompasses both pediatric and adult services within the same facility. Adolescent and family needs can be addressed within the nursing scope of practice. The purpose of this project was to develop and evaluate a transition program for adolescents with epilepsy and their families who are being transferred from a pediatric to an adult epilepsy program. Methods: All patients referred from the pediatric to adult epilepsy clinic were included in this study. Patient independence and the learning needs of both patients and parents were evaluated with standardized questionnaires. During the transition clinic visit (which occurred prior to the first appointment with the adult neurologist), a standardized education program was provided with patient and family needs incorporated into teaching. Evaluations were completed following the transition appointment and after the adult neurologist initial visit. Results: To date six patients have completed the transition process (one of which had significant developmental delay). The majority of adolescents had minimal knowledge to manage their own healthcare (i.e. name and dosage of medications) and lacked basic information regarding epilepsy (i.e. first aid). In identifying their own learning needs, considerable discrepancies were observed between adolescents and parents in particular relating to the areas of driving, alcohol and birth control. Patients and parents were unanimous regarding the benefits of going through the transition clinic. Conclusions: Our findings support the benefits of a formalized transition process between pediatric and adult epilepsy programs. The development and implementation of a nurse-led adolescent epilepsy transition program provides an opportunity to educate, encourage independence and alleviate fears during a period of time when other natural transitions are occurring. 1 Marian J. Kolodgie, 1 Audrey H. Scully, 1 Joan A. Conry, 1 Jay Salpekar, and 1 Andrew Renuart ( 1 Neurology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ) Rationale: Children with epilepsy may benefit from single-daily dose Depakote ER. In the presence of developmental delay parents may have concerns regarding their child's ability to swallow extended release tablets. We developed a training protocol aimed at teaching parents how to transition their child from Depakote Sprinkles to Depakote ER tablets. Methods: Subjects included 10 children diagnosed with epilepsy and developmental delay, and their parents. Subjects had no known diagnoses of feeding disorders, swallowing problems, or food aversion. Parents underwent a three step training program; 1.) Parents were interviewed about their child's swallowing abilities and previous pill-taking history. 2.) Parents received instruction on swallowing mechanics and behavior modification techniques. 3.) Pill administration was modeled by the clinic nurse and/or epilepsy nurse practitioner with each child. Mock tablets of incremental size were used during the training sessions. Children were allowed to swallow the pills with soft food or liquid but were not permitted to chew the tablets. Parents were instructed to practice with their child at home and provide a return demonstration at follow-up clinic visits. Results: Nine subjects completed the protocol successfully and transitioned from sprinkles to extended release tablets within the study timeframe. The tenth child acquired pill-taking skills shortly after the last study visit and is now taking extended release tablets. None of the subjects experienced choking, gagging, or other serious symptoms of distress. Conclusions: Developmental delay need not be an exclusionary factor in considering children's ability to swallow medication in pill form. Children with epilepsy and developmental difficulties can learn to swallow tablets through structured behavioral interventions. The ability to swallow tablets may contribute to overall compliance with treatment. (Supported by Abbott Laboratories.) 1 Sheila Koutsogiannopoulos, 1 Francine Adelson, and 1 Frederick Andermann ( 1 Nursing, Montreal Neurological Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; Social Work, Montreal Neurological Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada; and Neurology, Montreal Neurological Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: To explore circumstances around the emergence of a first seizure in adult onset epilepsy; i.e.what trends, if any, exist in the quality and quantity of life events occurring in the 12 months preceding the onset of an initial epileptic seizure. Research suggests that how individuals adjust to significant life events may explain the time of onset of a disease or chronic disorder. (Holmes, T.H., Rahe, R. The Social Readjustment Rating Scale, J Psychosom Res. 1967. 11:213?218). Although stress is recognized as a major precipitant for seizures in patients with a known seizure disorder, few studies, in any, have explored the cluster of life events associated with the onset of a first seizure in adult onset epilepsy. We also explored patients' beliefs about the causes of their epilepsy, their knowledge of seizure triggers and their sense of control. Methods: A qualitative study using a phenomenological approach. Patients were selected prospectively from the M.N.H. epilepsy clinic and monitoring unit. Interviews were audio-taped using a semi-structured interview guide and a life experiences survey. Interviews continued until data saturation was achieved and themes identified. Results: All patients reported significant life events experienced in the 12 months prior to the onset of their first seizure. Different themes were noted between men and women and among women of different age groups. All male responders reported primarily work related stressors prior to their first seizure. When significant others were present during the interviews, family stresses were also identified. Young women in their 20's identified a perception of diminished self efficacy in completing developmental tasks. Middle aged women described major losses and disruption in family relationships. None of the respondents reported irrational beliefs about the cause of their epilepsy. 93% of respondents were able to identify their seizure triggers and planned strategies to control them. The majority of patients also expressed the belief that stress increased the frequency of their attacks. Conclusions: A positive relationship between significant life events and timing of a first seizure in adult onset epilepsy was demonstrated in this limited sample. A larger sample is needed to further evaluate this finding. The majority of the patients interviewed believe that stress and seizures are related. This adds to what has been reported in other studies (Antebi, D., Bird, J. The Facilitation and Evocation of Seizures. Br J Psych. 1993.162: 759?64). The patients had the perception of high self control, were able to identify a relationship between their seizures and likely triggers, and discuss strategies to control such triggers. This study highlights the need to specifically inquire about stressors which may be present and may play a role in the triggering of adult onset epilepsy. (Supported by Savoy Foundation.) 1 Angela M. McNelis, 1 Jennifer E. Myers, 1 Joan K. Austin, and 2 David W. Dunn ( 1 School of Nursing, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ; and 2 School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Parents of children with epilepsy often lack seizure management skills due to inaccurate or incomplete information and knowledge about their children's seizure conditions. Moreover, parents have a great number of fears and worries associated with their child's condition. The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of a psychoeducational intervention designed to improve seizure management skills by reducing concerns and fears and improving knowledge about seizures. Methods: A quasiexperimental design was used to examine the effectiveness of the Be Seizure Smart intervention in a sample of parents of children with new-onset seizures. Based on each individual's pre-assessment, customized information was sent to meet the individual's unique needs. Once the information was received, a series of four 30-minute phone calls approximately one week apart were made to address the parent's identified areas of need. Pre and post assessment measures included general concerns and fears about seizures (9 items), concerns about seizure management (8 items), psychosocial care needs (6 items on information and 8 items on support), uncertainty (31 items), knowledge about seizures (20 items), mood associated with their child's seizure condition (10 items), and satisfaction with family functioning (5 items). Results: The sample consisted of 22 mothers, 2 fathers, and 1 grandmother. The children (14 females and 11 males) ranged in age from 5 to 13 years, with a mean age of 8.2 years. Parents had significantly lower scores for concerns and fears (p < .001), concerns about seizure management (p < .001), need for information and support (p < .001), and uncertainty in illness [total uncertainty (p < .001), ambiguity (p < .001), lack of clarity (p < .001), and lack of information (p < .05)] after the intervention than before. As predicted, parents had significantly higher scores post intervention for knowledge about seizures (p < .001) and mood (p < .001). Although parent scores on satisfaction with family functioning were more positive and scores on unpredictability were lower, results did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Overall, Be Seizure Smart was a successful intervention program. A major strength of the program was that it was tailored to meet each parent's individual needs, allowing parents to discuss specific concerns with the research nurse. The program can be easily transferable to the clinical setting as the pre-assessment takes only 10 minutes and the 1-page fact sheets are already developed. Follow-up phone calls to discuss the written materials could prove to be cost effective by decreasing the number of office visits and physician calls.

Restivo-Pritzl, 1 Christopher M. Inglese, 1 Veronica N. Sosa, and 1 George L. Morris III ( 1 Regional Epilepsy Center, St. Luke's Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: Health-related quality of life (H-RQOL) is a middle range nursing theory that reflects the nursing profession's emphasis upon holistic and individualized patient care. Simply defined, the concept of H-RQOL may represent an individual's satisfaction with a specific area of life that he or she has identified as vital. Wilson and Cleary identify five determinants that influence and are influenced by overall QOL to produce an individual's H-RQOL: biological and physiological variables, symptoms, functional status (including the physical, social, role, and psychological/spiritual domains), and general health perceptions. This model illustrates how the diagnosis of epilepsy may exert influence that is far-reaching and pivotal upon all aspects of an individual's life. Children and adolescents are in the midst of vital developmental stages, with the desired end result being the attainment of a sense personal and interpersonal competence as well as personal identity. Anxiety related to the fear of experiencing seizures in public, feelings of ?different-ness? from peers, dependence upon others, and the stigma that plagues the diagnosis of epilepsy may present a significant obstacle to an individual's psychosocial development, and may result in problems that affect every aspect of every day living. The purpose of this project is to explore the actual impact of the epilepsy diagnosis upon the H-RQOL among the children and adolescents care for at a regional epilepsy center, as well as to determine the necessity of including an abbreviated H-RQOL evaluation as part of the nursing assessment at clinic visits. Methods: An abbreviated H-RQOL assessment tool was developed based upon the QOLIE-31 scale. Questions were selected to represent areas of life that were deemed significant to children of school age and adolescents?self-concept, family life, social life, and medications. During scheduled appointments, as part of the interval nursing assessment, patients were provided a scoring tool and asked scripted questions by a registered nurse. Results: To date, five children have been interviewed, ranging from 10 to 15 years of age. When asked to rate their current life satisfaction on a Likert scale of 1 (?Very unhappy with life right now?) to 5 (?Very happy?), the average response was 2.4. All of the respondents stated that they worry about having a seizure, as well as feel that having seizures affects their grades. Two of the children interviewed stated that their epilepsy makes them feel different from others. Conclusions: Data collection is ongoing, and it is impossible to draw accurate conclusions with such a small sample size. However, it is clear from these few responses that the diagnosis of seizures is one that affects many areas of a child's life, and inclusion in the nursing assessment may be crucial to limit negative impact upon psychosocial development. 1 Deborah L. Shulman, 1 Bryn M. Corbett, 1 Patricia H. Miller, 1 Luann C. Helepololei, 1 Lisa M. Tapsell, 1 Katherine H. Noe, 1 Joseph F. Drazkowski, and 1 Joseph I. Sirven ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: A considerable amount of information is presented to the patient prior to their EMU admission. Much of the information is provided in an educational booklet that all patients receive from the physician during their medical appointment or in the mail after the admission date has been scheduled. Many patients have stated during their admission that they were not informed of certain issues pertaining to an EMU stay. These issues include but are not inclusive to; memory testing, use of a safety belt, and the necessity of staying in their room while being closely monitored. Some patients become upset about not being aware of aspects of their stay and become frustrated when they realize the implication of how being on the EMU affects them. A comprehensive EMU booklet is given to every patient preadmission, however, it is unclear if the information within the booklet was presented but not processed or if it was presented at all. A brief questionnaire was constructed to help guide the formation of an educational tool. This will enable us to provide adequate patient education and set appropriate expectations to promote better health outcomes Methods: Patients who were admitted to the EMU in April 2006 were surveyed by a 12 question instrument designed to assess expectations prior to the admission. Surveys were conducted by telephone retrospectively. Some aspects of the survey included; assessment of knowledge of the use of safety belts, memory testing, use of sleep deprivation to invoke seizures, use of an intravenous cannula, and if the patient received the information booklet. Results: 12 surveys were completed, 4 male and 8 female with the age range being 37?77 years and 52 the average age of respondents. Fifty-eight percent had received and read the EMU information booklet, however, these same patients all claimed they did not know they would have memory testing. 42% claimed they did not know about the use of a safety belt, and 85% did not know they would be sleep deprived. This information is contained in the booklet, and 75% of all respondents felt they were able to ask questions and discuss expectations prior to the admission. Conclusions: It would appear that adequate patient education is provided but not necessarily understood despite receiving an EMU booklet and having the opportunity to discuss its contents. This approach may not be enough to insure positive EMU outcomes that we seek. Supplementary education is needed which could include a tour of the EMU prior to admission or assessing how patients themselves define the best method for them to learn. This may assist with setting appropriate expectations to promote better health outcomes. A larger population based study is needed to define how to best structure educational programs relating to diagnostic epilepsy procedures in order to meet the needs of our patients. 1 Siv Skarstein, 1 Vibeke Snarseth, and 2 Erik Taub?ll ( 1 National Centre for Epilepsy, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy and autism represent a complex group that require specialist treatment and care. At the National Centre for Epilepsy we experienced a high readmission rate for this patient group. Carers expressed uncertainty on how best to manage these patients and their seizures. The aim of this study was to develop an educational program to increase competence among carers, thereby reducing readmission to a specialist epilepsy hospital. Methods: Sixteen consecutive adult patients (7 women, 9 men) with autism and difficult to treat epilepsy admitted to the National Centre for Epilepsy, Sandvika, Norway, from 01.01.2004 to 12.31.2005 were included. A three-phase, standardized program was designed. This consisted of: 1) a pre-hospitalization visit to establish patient needs with regard to the management of epilepsy and psychosocial problems, 2) a hospitalization phase where the individual needs of the patient revealed in phase 1 were further defined. The carers were given specialized and individualized information about epilepsy and behavioural/psychosocial problems relating to their patient, and 3) a post-hospitalization phase consisting of an individual plan and a follow-up visit at home. A survey for carer satisfaction was performed 1 month after discharge. Results: The main finding in this study is that only 1 of the 16 patients have so far been readmitted to the hospital (Mean observation time: 16.4 months, range: 8?33 months). The survey for carer satisfaction revealed that in 9 cases the carers felt that they managed the problems related to the patient's epilepsy better. In 11 cases, the initiatives suggested by the hospital were implemented at home. In 15 cases, the carers found that the defined needs of the patient established in the pre-hospital phase were adhered to. Conclusions: A new educational program aimed at increasing competence among carers of patients with epilepsy and autism was shown to be effective. The readmission rate to hospital was dramatically reduced. Carers and staff felt more secure and competent when dealing with this complex patient group. 1 Pamela L. Smith, 1 Jennifer M. Burgos, 1 George L. Morris, 1 Christopher M. Inglese, and 1 Veronica N. Sosa ( 1 Regional Epilepsy Center, Saint Luke's Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: Lamictal is an approved antiepileptic drug used as add-on-therapy for partial seizures in the adult and pediatric population. It has also been approved as initial monotherapy in adults newly diagosed with seizures, as well as conversion of Lamictal add-on-therapy to monotherapy in adults with partial sizures. Serious rashes requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment, have been reported with the use of Lamictal. The incidence of these rashed is about 0.8% in the pediatirc population (age 16 and under) and 0.3% in adults receiving Lamictal as adjunctive therapy for epilepsy. Other then age, there are no known factors that could be identifyers in predicting the rash occurrence. Nearly all cases of serious rashes have occurred within 2?8 weeks of initiation of treatment. However, rare cases have been reported after prolonged treatment. Methods: To date, a retrospective analysis of 151 medical records identified 22 adults and 4 pediatric patients (age 16 and under) on Lamictal therapy admitted for inpatient VEEG monitoring since November 2002. Results: The 22 adults or 14.57% of the admitted population, had an average hospital length of stay of 3.2 days and were receiving an average daily dose of Lamictal 400 mgm. The 4 pediatric patients or 2.65% of the admitted population, had an average hospital lenth of stay of 7.2 days and were receiving an average daily dose of Lamictal 450 mgm. Upon discharge and dose resumption, none of the patients displayed any evidence of rash. Conclusions: In this study, we saw that both adult and pediatric patients can have their Lamictal dose discontinued and reintroduced without the emergence of a serious rash. Data collection is ongoing and needs to have similar outcomes to validate these outcomes. 1 Chase A. Allen, and 1 Malachy L. Bishop ( 1 Rehabilitation Psychology and Special Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI; and Special Education and Rehabilitation Counseling, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY ) Rationale: The problematic employment situation for people with epilepsy has been well established. The unemployment rate experienced by people with epilepsy has frequently been shown to be higher than that found in the general population. Numerous efforts at understanding the employment problems faced by persons with epilepsy have revealed a complex interrelationship of causes and explanations, including seizure-related variables, psychosocial factors, negative employer attitudes and discrimination, and fear of stigma and discrimination. In an effort to further clarify the situation and update understanding of changing employer attitudes, this research explored employer attitudes toward epilepsy as compared to other chronic conditions, and the implications of describing one's epilepsy using different terms (seizure condition, seizure disorder, epilepsy). Methods: In this survey-based research we surveyed 50 human resources professionals and employers in a Southeastern United State. We presented the employers and HR professionals with several descriptions of hypothetical applicants with various chronic conditions (e.g., AIDS, epilepsy, mental retardation, cancer, heart disease) and asked them to rank and rate the applicants based on their willingness to hire a similar individual at their company. The influences of work experience, education, and other demographic variables were controlled. In addition, we varied the use of the terms seizure condition, seizure disorder, and epilepsy in describing the individual with epilepsy. Analysis of variance and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. Results: Data collection is currently ongoing, and full results will be presented, however results to date are consistent with prior similar research concerning employers' attitudes toward epilepsy and hiring individuals with epilepsy, relative to other conditions. The use of the term epilepsy appears to be less positive from the employers' perspective that the alternatives, however the results are not yet conclusive. Conclusions: The results have important implications for epilepsy professionals engaged in assisting persons with epilepsy in seeking and maintaining employment. The present study highlights, in particular, the ongoing concern about epilepsy-related stigma in the area of employment. 1 Malachy L. Bishop, and 1 Chase A. Allen ( 1 Special Education and Rehabilitation Counseling, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY; and Rehabilitation Psychology and Special Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Epilepsy, perhaps more than any other chronic illness, has the potential to impact experience across the range of physical, psychological, and social domains of living. Understanding the mechanisms through which epilepsy affects psychosocial function, and the processes that people employ to adapt to this impact are a critical focus of epilepsy research toward effective clinical intervention. This research evaluates the disability centrality model, a multi-dimensional quality of life-based model of psychosocial impact and adaptation among persons with epilepsy. Methods: This research employed a web-based survey methodology to test the assumptions of the disability centrality model. Adults were recruited through Epilepsy Foundation affiliates in the Southeast United States. A total of 42 adults with epilepsy completed a questionnaire that included the Disability Centrality Scale, which assesses the respondents' level of satisfaction, epilepsy-related impact, perceived control, and the level of importance ascribed to each of ten empirically derived quality of life domains. Additionally, demographic information, duration since diagnosis, and two well-established measures of quality of life and psychosocial adaptation were employed. Hypothesized relationships among these variables, based on the model, were assessed in a series of multiple regression analyses. Results: A number of elements of the proposed model were supported. Domain control and satisfaction mediated the relationship between perceived impact and overall QOL, and psychosocial adaptation. Domain importance moderated the relationship between epilepsy-impact and adaptation. The relationships between QOL, adaptation, and duration and demographic variables were also explored. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary investigation are consistent with larger scale investigations among persons with multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions, and support the proposed model. There are a number of important clinical and research implications. The results suggest that the psychosocial impact of epilepsy is experienced multidimensionally, across a range of life domains. Perceived domain control over the impact of epilepsy acts as an important mediator in the relationship between the experiences associated with epilepsy and one's overall QOL. In addition, the individual's perception of the personal importance of the domains moderates the impact of epilepsy. The results suggest two important venues for clinical intervention in enhancing quality of life among individuals with epilepsy: interventions aimed at enhancing perceived control, such as self-management and patient education, as well as those that expand the individual's means of attaining satisfaction. 1 Peggy Crawford, 1 Farrah M. Thomas, and 2 Noah Webster ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Sociology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Major depression is a frequently unrecognized and untreated comorbidity in chronic epilepsy. In particular, the psychological status of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery is a critical issue in clinical management and a major factor in quality of life. Changes in mood both positive and negative and psychiatric status have been noted with surgery. Multiple factors have been implicated in mood changes after surgery including epilepsy-specific variables such as laterality, location of seizures, and seizure outcome as well as psychosocial variables including personality traits. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mental health of epilepsy patients prior to surgery in order to identify disorders and symptoms amenable to treatment. Methods: Participants are two hundred and twenty-five adults (44% male, 88% Caucasian, 44% married, 42.1% employed full or part-time) aged 18?75 with medically intractable epilepsy undergoing evaluation for surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. They participated in a Health Psychology evaluation that included chart review for demographic, disease, and health-related information; clinical interview concerning current and past psychological status; and self-report measures of mood, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness Results: Based on self-report, 65% reported a positive mental health history including depression in 50.2%, anxiety 15.6%, bipolar disorder 1.3% and psychosis 2.7%. Regarding treatment, 43.8% had previously seen a mental health professional and 41.8% had used psychotropic medication. Based on pre-operative Beck Depression Inventory responses, 16.9% were mildly depressed, 27.9% moderately depressed, and 11.5% severely depressed. In contrast, only 5.8% were taking psychotropic medication. Pre-operatively, both employment (full or part-time) and marital status (married) were associated with lower depression scores. Although patients who had ever used psychotropic medication were more likely to have higher pre-operative depression scores, those currently taking psychotropic medication were not. Conclusions: Comparable to previous studies, we found high rates of depression including almost 40% of patients reporting moderate to severe depression. In spite of this, many patients had never seen a mental health professional and even fewer had taken psychotropic medication (only 5.8% at the time of the evaluation) both known to be effective treatments for depression. It is not clear why patients are not being identified and/or treated. One possibility is that both professionals and patients assume that depression is common with medically intractable epilepsy and consequently treatment is not recommended or sought. These findings support the routine assessment of all patients being considered for epilepsy surgery in order to identify and initiate treatment of depression regardless of whether or not patients have surgery. 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Sandra Dewar, 1 Itzhak Fried, 1 Zhiyi Sha, 1 David Millet, 1 Andres Gonzales, 1 Kathleen Langlois, 1 John Stern, 1 Schrader Lara, 1 Soss Jason, and 1 Engel Jerome ( 1 Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Surgery, Division of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; and Department of Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Older age at surgery is considered to carry higher surgical risk. There are few reports on surgical outcome in this age group. We report a series of 51 patients over 45 years of age who had surgery between 1992 and 2005 at UCLA. A prospective seizure outcome data collection was done. Methods: The inclusion criteria were intractable epilepsy, a minimum of 12 months follow-up, and patients 45 years and older at surgery. The last follow-up, done in 2006 for all patients included a computer assisted telephonic interview of the life fulfillment satisfaction scale (Liverpool QOL questionnaire). The following factors were considered: Satisfaction with surgery, life changes in the spheres of health, driving, working, adjustment issues, patients perception to general health and reasons for delay in obtaining surgery. Results: The mean age of surgery in the series was 52 years (range 45?74). The mean follow up was 4.3 years (range 1?11 years.) Mean duration of epilepsy was 29.3 years (range 2?55 yrs). Most patients would have had surgery earlier but gave failure to refer and lack of knowledge about surgery as reasons for delay. The age of onset was divided into 3 groups those between 1?10 years (n = 18), 11?20 years (n = 12) and more than 21 years (n = 22). Forty patients (80%) had an Engel class I outcome. Four had an outcome of II, the rest had a poor outcome. Impact of nocturnal seizures only (n = 3) (Engel class II) was high, contrary to expectations. The life fulfillment scores averaged 38 (range 16 to 49) out of a total of 52 and did not correlate to the patients perceived satisfaction with surgery and were lower for those patients with poor social recovery and multiple adjustment issues. There were 5 deaths in this group, only one of these was directly related to surgery and occurred 3 wks after surgery. Conclusions: Seizure outcome was excellent but poor social recovery and low life satisfaction scores were frequently recorded. Age should not limit access to surgery; however, the missed opportunity for psychosocial improvement, reducing the impact and promoting healthy aging and life satisfaction should prompt early surgery. 3 Kristin P. Guilliams, 2 Jesus F. Martinez, and 1 Nathan B. Fountain ( 1 Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Neurology, Hospital Nacional Rosales, San Salvador, El Salvador ; and 3 Pediatrics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Perceptions may directly or indirectly influence the quality of care physicians provide. This is particularly true in epilepsy, as misperceptions and prejudices have been noted by the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy and targeted in their ?Out of the Shadows? campaign. Physicians are a major source of health information; their beliefs have a trickle-down effect to the general population. A physician's own comfort level treating certain diseases may also influence the quality of care he or she is able to provide. We surveyed physicians in El Salvador about their perceptions and comfort levels of treating patients with epilepsy. Methods: We surveyed 27 physicians in San Salvador, El Salvador. Eight practiced in neurology-related fields (neurology, pediatric neurology, or neurosurgery). Nineteen were in primary care fields (generalist or gynecology). All reported treating patients with epilepsy. Surveys were conducted at educational meetings in San Salvador. Part A asked participants to rate their agreement on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 indicates disagreement and 5 indicates agreement for 11 statements in reference to persons with epilepsy. Part B was identical to A, except it specifically referred to persons with well-controlled epilepsy. Part C asked participants to rate their comfort level in treating patients with epilepsy on a scale from 1 to 5. It also requested age, field of medicine, and years in practice. Results: The average sum on Part A for neurology related physicians (NRP) was 45.63 out of 55; the average for primary care physicians (PCP) was 42.84. The average sum on Part B for NRPs was 49.25; the average sum for primary care physicians was 47.79. Statements with a difference of greater than 1 point between the two groups include: Part A, ?Persons with epilepsy should be open about their disease with others,? NRPs averaged 3.25 on a scale from 1 to 5. PCPs averaged 4.35 on the same statement. On the same statement in Part B, NRPs averaged 3.5, and PCPs averaged 4.7. In Part B ?Persons with well-controlled epilepsy should not be obligated to inform schools or employers of disease,? NRPs averaged 2.88 on a scale of 1 to 5, whereas PCPs averaged 3.94. The average comfort score for NRPs was 4.63, and 2.79 for PCPs. Conclusions: Salvadoran physicians appear to have positive perceptions of persons with epilepsy. Although both NRPs and PCPs treat patients with epilepsy, PCPs are significantly less comfortable treating patients with epilepsy. Further research is needed to determine patients' perceptions of physician and general population attitudes towards epilepsy. Further education is warranted to give PCPs information and confidence to become more comfortable in managing the treatment of their patients with epilepsy.

Austin ( 1 Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO ; and 2 School of Nursing, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Children with epilepsy are at risk for long-term psychosocial problems compared to healthy children or children with other health conditions, which may be due to peer difficulties. Peer relationships influence children's immediate and lifelong social and emotional well-being, and research shows that children with epilepsy have more peer difficulties than do healthy children or children with other health conditions. Few studies investigate variables related to peer problems in children with epilepsy. Inattentive behavior, anxious behavior, and academic difficulties are linked to peer problems among healthy children; these same variables are likely related to peer problems among children with epilepsy. Yet, also examining if epilepsy-related factors such as neuropsychological functioning and seizure characteristics are associated with peer difficulties is important because it may clarify why children with epilepsy are at greater risk for peer problems compared to other children. Hence, the current study determined if epilepsy-related factors such as neuropsychological deficits, greater seizure frequency, and earlier age at epilepsy onset as well as behavioral/academic factors such as inattentive behavior, anxious behavior, and academic difficulties are related to peer problems in children with epilepsy. Methods: Participants were 173 children with epilepsy, ages 8?15. Correlations among predictor and outcome variables were examined to determine their interrelations with one another; structural equation modeling was used to investigate simultaneous interrelations among latent factors. Results: The measurement model indicated that correlations among the behavioral, academic, epilepsy-related, and peer difficulty factors were significant and in the predicted direction. The structural model revealed that the neuropsychological factor mediated the relation between age at epilepsy onset and the behavioral, academic, and peer difficulty factors; anxious behavior and inattentive behavior mediated the relation between the neuropsychological and peer difficulty factors; anxious behavior mediated the relation between seizure frequency and the peer difficulty factor. Conclusions: Neuropsychological deficits and greater seizure frequency may have a direct influence on behavior problems in children with epilepsy and, therefore, may affect their peer relations. Thus, when treating behavioral and peer difficulties in children with epilepsy, mental health professionals may wish to consult with neuropsychologists and physicians regarding the potential influence of neuropsychological and seizure-related variables.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the clinical factors influencing the patient's intelligence, anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with epilepsy. Methods: Subjects were 90 epilepsy patients between the ages of 6 and 17 years (mean 11.8 ± 3.9 years) and their parents. We acquired simplified neuropsychological tests including verbal, performance and full scale IQ, the Stroop and the Trail-making test (TMT) from each patient. They also filled up the Impact of Childhood Illness Scale (ICIS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), the Questionnaire on Resources and Stress (QRS), the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES) in children with epilepsy and their families. We compared the differences across patient groups according to the clinical factors such as seizure frequency, epilepsy types and duration, mono- or polytherapy, etc. Results: Full scale IQ was lower in patients with poor seizure control than seizure free group (75.0 ± 29.0 vs. 101.6 ± 23.1; p = 0.029), and in patients with polytherapy than monotherapy (72.6 ± 27.4 vs. 102.7 ± 22.1; p = 0.029). ICIS, QRS, CBCL and Conners scale were higher when patients had poor seizure control (p = 0.011, 0.027, 0.047 and 0.075, respectively), and took more than one antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.008, 0.003, 0.022 and 0.033). STAI and RCMAS were higher in patients with epilepsy within the first 2 years or longer than 4 years (p = 0.023 and 0.043). Increased parental anxiety based on STAI were correlated with increased ICIS, RCMAS, CDI, and Conners scale (p = 0.002, 0.002, 0.009, and 0.004). Conclusions: Epilepsy patients in childhood and adolescent ages have significant impacts on their intelligence and emotions if they have poorly controlled seizures or take more than one antiepileptic medications. 1 Yolanda C. Leon, 3 Joseph Sesta, 2 Selim Benbadis, and 2 William O. Tatum ( 1 Clinical Research, Pediatric Epilepsy and Neurology Specialists?PENS, Tampa, FL ; 2 Neurology, University of South Florida/Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ; and 3 Suncoast Neuropsychology Labs, Riverview, FL ) Rationale: In recent years, increasing interest in the emotional experience of patients with seizure disorders has stimulated investigation of various emotional states. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the study of depression and anxiety. Of the studies available, relatively few, if any, have investigaged the construct of anger among patiens with seizures. Although previous studies have examined differences between patients with spileptic seizures (ES) and patients with Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), the emphasis has been on the assessment of depression and anxiety. The primary goal of this preliminary study was to examine the experience, expression and control of anger in patients with seizures utilizing the most widely researched, standardized and validated Anger measure that utilized in behavioral health settings, the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2). A secondary goal of the study was to compare Anger measures of patients with ES and PNES. Methods: Subjects were drawn from a series of adult patients referred for long-term video EEG monitoring as part of a comprehensive evaluation for refractory seizures at the USF College of Medicine?Tampa General Hospital Comprehensive Epilepsy Program. Patients with a definitive diagnosis of either ES or PNES as determined by EEG video Monitoring were included. Only those patients that did not complete the STAXI-2 were excluded. Results: Patients with ES and PNES have higher Trait Anger scores and higher Anger Expression scores than those of the normative sample. Patients with PNES have higher Trait Anger Reaction and Anger-In scores than patients with ES or the normative sample. Conclusions: The findings of the preliminary study suggest that there are significant differences in the way patients with seizures experience and express anger. Further, there are differences between patients with ES and PNES. These findings suggest that the STAXI-2 successfully differentiates ES patients from PNES patients in terms of their suppression and expression of anger. Future research is needed to investigate how different types of epilepsy patients experience anger, how it motivates their behavior and impacts their health. The implications for psychotherapeutic intervention and treatment planning should be explored. 1 Sophia Macrodimitris ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, Calgary Health Region, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Community samples of epilepsy patients experience higher rates of depression (9?25%) and anxiety (10?25%) disorders than the general population (depression 2?9%; anxiety 2.5?6.5%). In treatment resistant epilepsy, estimates are even higher (e.g., depression 25?55%). Despite these issues, many epilepsy programs do not adequately assess for or address mental health problems. This paper describes program development and referral practices during the first year of a clinical psychology service devoted to epilepsy patients. Methods: Participants: 132 consecutive SMU admissions over 10 months were explored for clinical psychology and psychiatry referrals. 1657 consecutive outpatient visits over 6 months were explored for clinical psychology referrals. All referrals were from epileptologists (n = 7). Procedure: The Clinical Psychology Service was developed separately from Neuropsychology in two phases: Phase I: Seizure Monitoring Unit (SMU); Phase II: Outpatient. Phase I SMU: Neurologists and nurses completed a referral package: referral form, patient history, and patient-completed background information questionnaire. Nurses contacted the psychologist when the referral was completed. Referrals were reviewed by the psychologist for appropriateness. Phase II Outpatient: Referral package (same as SMU) was forwarded to the psychologist for one of three possible services: assessment only; assessment and brief (up to 6 sessions) therapy; and therapy only. Clinical psychology referral information was tracked in an excel database. Overall SMU admission rates were obtained from the master SMU admission list. Number of outpatient visits for each epileptologist was provided by the Clinical Neurosciences program manager. Results: SMU: 52.5% (n = 72) received a clinical psychology assessment; 18.5% (n = 24) received a psychiatry assessment. Overlap in referrals to clinical psychology and psychiatry occurred in the first month. Psychology referrals increased in months 3?5. Referrals reduced in later months. OUTPATIENT: 2.4% (n = 40) of clinic visits to epileptologists were referred for outpatient services. Referral rates ranged from 0?4.7% per neurologist. Rates varied according to years of experience (i.e., junior neurologists referred more often) and number of visits (i.e., junior neurologists with more visits referred more often). Conclusions: Clinical psychology services are well-integrated into the SMU but referrals to the outpatient service remain low, particularly when compared to the established rates of mental health problems in epilepsy patients. The low referral rates may reflect the ?newness? of the resource. It may also reflect poor mental health assessment practices at clinic visits. Despite the low outpatient referral rate, the clinical psychology service maintains a 3?4 month waiting list, suggesting that more outpatient resources (e.g., groups) are required prior to increasing the number of referrals to the program. 1 Edna A.

Rationale: Health quality of life evaluations have been used to improve our capacity to assess the impact of diseases to the individuals. Because quality of life evaluations might be greatly dependent on subjective aspects, tools designed to assess these aspects are interesting. Donoghue and collegues (Brain 1998; 121:317?43) have designed and validated a tool to evaluate the subjective handicap of epilepsy. However, it has been validated in patients from UK, but it is uncertain whether it could be successfully used in other populations with diverse culture and distinct subjective values. Methods: The Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy scale (SHE) was translated to Portuguese and back-translated to English. After test-retest, the SHE was administered to 219 adult patients (115 men and 104 women, mean age of 35.4 (18?66) years-old with focal symptomatic epilepsy, not submitted to epilepsy surgery. Patients were divided in 4 sub-groups according to seizure frequency. Data was analyzed by a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), using Wilks' Lambda as the multivariate test and Student-Newman-Keuls as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons between the six sub-scales scores of SHE. Results are expressed in mean SHE-scale scores (95% C.I.). Results: Multivarate analysis reveled a significant difference of SHE-sub-scales means among the four groups of seizure control (Wilks' Lambda = 0.57; F= 579.23; p < 0.0001). The results of post-hoc comparisons are presented in Table. Conclusions: Here, we validate the SHE scale to Brazilian Patients. SHE scores are similar in Brazilian patients when compared to England patients. Thus, we concluded that SHE is reliable and applicable to evaluate the long-term consequences of epilepsy in our population.

Glauser, and 7CAE Study Team ( 1 Neurology, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; 2 Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 3 Neurology, The Children's Hospital, Denver, CO ; 4 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Rockville, MD ; 5 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 6 Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) is associated with a high incidence of adverse behavioral and cognitive outcomes. As part of a large, multi-center trial of CAE we are obtaining a variety of behavioral and quality of life information using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) at baseline and regular intervals thereafter. We present the baseline CBCL and QOLCE findings. Methods: To date, 153 subjects with newly diagnosed, untreated CAE have been enrolled. Included were 36 (24%) children under 6 year of age and 117 (76%) age 6 or older. All CBCL scores were reviewed by a central scorer (CO) to ensure accuracy and that problems were not counted twice. Results were then entered in a central database and computer scored. Baseline CBCL data has been coded and scored in 102 cases including 21 under age 6 and 81 age 6 or older. QOLCE scores were available in 33 (23%) children < 6 years and 109 children (77%) > age 6. Results: The mean overall CBCL scores were 53.6 (s.d.11.6), with 20 (20%) of children with abnormal scores and 12 (12%) with borderline scores. Scores were similar for both the internalizing and externalizing groupings of syndromes. For the internalizing scale 17 (17%) of children had abnormal scores and 12 (12%) had borderline scores. Similarly, for the externalizing scale 17 (17%) had abnormal scores and 5 (5%) had borderline scores. There were no major differences in scores in younger versus older children. Attentional issues were the most commonly identified complaints though they only met DSM criteria in the older children. The mean QOLCE scores in our sample were 72 and were similar in both younger and older children. These scores are substantially higher, indicating a better quality of life, than the mean score of 51 reported in the sample of children with intractable epilepsy on which the scale was normed. Conclusions: Approximately 30% of children with newly diagnosed CAE demonstrate abnormal or borderline scores on the CBCL indicating a high rate of potential problems. The QOL scores indicate less concerns than in children with refractory epilepsy. Long term follow-up of the cohort will demonstrate whether the problems in behavior and QOL improve or worsen with time and whether or not they will improve if seizures are successfully treated.

Methods: The administered instruments were the following: the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (non verbal intelligence), the Echelle Toulousaine de Coping ?ETC- (Coping styles), the Self-esteem Questionnaire (self-esteem), the Self-efficacy Questionnaire (social self-efficacy), a Quality of Life measure and a semi-structured interview on psycho-social adjustment. All these measures were administered to 50 drug resistant epilepsy and to 50 seizure-free patients. Results: We found a significant difference in coping responses between the two groups: drug resistant patients adopted more the ?denial? and the ?exclusion? strategies (p < 0.05), on the contrary, seizure-free subjects used more the ?control? (p < 0.05). A significant correlation between disengagement patterns and poorer social outcomes was pointed out, while ?control? was associated with a better social adaptation. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of the importance of coping assessment, considering the influence of these strategies on patients' well-being. The possibility to offer to epilepsy patients a psychological support which orientates their coping styles, in order to alter them from the ineffective to the more efficacious ones should be considered. 1 M. Pramuka, 2 R. Hendrickson, 3 A. Zinski, and 2,4 A.C. Van Cott ( 1 Dept of Rehab Science and Technology, University of Pittsburgh, PGH, PA ; 2 Dept of Neurology, University of Pittsburgh, PGH, PA ; 3 Dept of Health Behavior, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL ; and 4 Neurology Division, VAPHCS, PGH, PA ) Rationale: Self management approaches to reduce disability and increase emotional well being have been helpful in the treatment of chronic medical conditions. We developed a 6 week group-based self management-intervention (SMI) for IWE. We hypothesized that subjects who participated in the intervention would show an improved quality of life (QOL) compared to those in the treatment as usual group. Methods: Individuals aged ≥18 years treated for epilepsy at the University of Pittsburgh Epilepsy Center or its VA Hospital were eligible to participate. 61 adults (43 men, 18 women; age range 21?79) consented and were randomized to treatment in the SMI (31) or treatment as usual (24). Measures included the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-89 (QOLIE-89), Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI), Locus of Control (LOC), and Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale-2000 (ESES). We followed an intent-to-treat study design; 6 withdrew prior to baseline testing and 13 did not follow up after baseline assessment. Treatment analysis included 19 controls and 19 IWE who participated in the SMI and completed baseline and follow up testing. SPSS 13.0 was used for analysis. Mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals were examined between groups using ANCOVA controlling for baseline scores. Partial Eta2 effect size estimates were examined. Results: There was no significant difference between patient demographics at the two sites or the two groups, although IWE with later seizure onset and men were over represented at the VA. Statistically significant differences were not found in overall QOL or other primary outcome measures, and effect sizes were small (≤0.05). The treatment group showed a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.039) in QOLIE-Role Limitations Emotional score at follow up compared to the change in the control group. Strong and significant correlations were observed between QOL and self-efficacy (r = 0.523), QOL and psychosocial/medical function as measured by the WPSI (r =?0.768) and between QOL and locus of control (r = 0.458). Conclusions: There was no significant change in overall QOL following SMI and effect sizes were small. A statistically significant positive change was demonstrated in one parameter of QOL (Role Limitations Emotional), although this might not be clinically meaningful. The strengths of this study were: a) the development of a SMI program targeting IWE b) use of a control group and randomization c) successful recruitment of a larger sample size compared to prior studies and d) the strong associations among outcome measures. Limitations included recruitment challenges, attrition, and insufficient power to detect meaningful change. Future projects will examine alternative methods of administering SMIs to IWE.

Yacubian ( 1 Unidade de Pesquisa E Tratamento Das Epilepsias (UNIPETE)?Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Division of Neurology, Federal University of S?o Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 2 Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Quality of Life in Epilepsy?31 (QOLIE-31) has been the most worldwide used instrument due to its concise and easy evaluation. The objective of this work is to describe the cultural adaptation and psychometric properties of the QOLIE-31 for the Portuguese language. Methods: This study involved 150 outpatients: 50 pre-surgical patients with diagnosis of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS); fifty with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and uncontrolled seizures; and 50 seizure-free TLE patients, with seizure remission of at least 6 months. The patients completed the following questionnaires: QOLIE-31, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Adverse Events Profile (AEP) and a neuropsychological evaluation. Patients answered the QOLIE-31 twice on the first day (interviewers 1 and 2) and after 7 days (interviewer 1). Translation and cultural adaptation into Portuguese had the following phases: translation into Portuguese by two independent parallel translators; back-translation by two independent native English-speaking teachers, fluent in Portuguese; creation of a final version by a panel of experts. This was tested in a study including 30 outpatients with epilepsy. Results: One question needed modification: item 28 needed complementary information. It was added: ?Social Limitations, in other words, fell that you can't go out or live together with different people.? Among the 150 subjects (53% women) the mean age was 31 and the mean duration of epilepsy was 15 years. Concerning socio-demographic characteristics, 59 (39%) had primary school, 68 (45%) secondary and 23 (16%) higher education. In relation to seizure frequency, 68 (52%) had no seizures in the last 6 months, 53 (35%) 1?5, 15 (10%) 6?10 and 4 (3%) more than 10/month. High internal consistency showed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranging from 0.746 to 0.932. Inter-rater reliability was strong with ICC ranging from 0.933 (Overall Quality of Life) to 0.997 (Medication Effects, Seizure Worry and Social Function). After one week, the reliability was also high with ICC ranging from 0.917 (Overall Quality of Life) to 0.995 (Medication Effects). There was a high association between QOLIE-31 and BDI (Spearmann's correlations) (p ≤ 0.005). QOLIE-31 and NHP had an association as well as neuropsychological evaluation. The responsiveness of QOLIE-31 between the groups showed significant changes (p > 0.005). Conclusions: Our results support the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the QOLIE-31 as a measure of HRQL.

Epilepsy in general and mainly drug those resistant, represents great impact over caregiver's QOL . Objective: To evaluate and compare QOL and burden over caregivers of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and patient with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods: We evaluated 50 caregivers of patients with TLE due to MTS and 50 caregivers of patients with JME. We used Brazilian version of Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS) to assess burden over caregivers; this scale provides scores from 0 (no burden) to 88 (maximum burden). QOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Inventory 36?Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)?which evaluates different domains of QOL. A socio-demographic questionnaire was applied to characterize the population. Results: The mean age and duration of disease of patient with TLE were respectively 36.42 and 25.6 and for patients with JME were 25.48 and 14.32. There was mild to moderate burden in both groups, with ZCBS average score of 25.5 for the JME group and 30.7 for the TLE. There was a significant association among all domains of SF-36 and the burden over caregivers of patients with JME: general health (p = 0.000); functional capacity (p = 0.003); physical role (p = 0.022); emotional role (p = 0.000); bodily pain (p = 0.025); social aspects (p = 0.020); vitality (p = 0.001); mental health (p = 0.000). However in the caregivers of patients with TLE the only associations observed were seen in the domains emotional role (p = 0.011), vitality (p = 0.008) and mental health (p = 0.002), suggesting interference of emotional problems in the daily activities in the caregiver's life. No difference was observed when comparing the domains of SF-36 Inventory and ZCBS between JME and TLE in the comparison of the groups. Conclusions: Our results show significant compromising in QOL of caregivers of patient with TLE and JME. Caregivers of patients of both groups are similarly burdened. There was no difference in the QOL between the two groups studied.

The author investigated whether a ?fiction novel? on BLOG describing a girl undergoing epilepsy surgery can potentially facilitate familiarity to epilepsy surgery among the general internet users in Japan. The author also assessed whether BLOG can serve as a survey tool in psychosocial research. Methods: The author's BLOG (URL: http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/eishi_asano_md_phd) was used to publish a serial novel and to conduct a survey among internet users. The serial novel was initiated on July 13, 2005 and ended on December 4, 2005, and consisted of 125 chapters with a number of illustrations. A survey designed to measure familiarity with epilepsy surgery was prospectively conducted using the BLOG. A single questionnaire was posted on the survey section of the BLOG on November 28, 2005. It was announced that the survey would be closed on December 4, 2005, regardless of the number of responders. None of the responders were rewarded for taking part in this survey. In addition, the number of daily public accesses to the BLOG and the Official Web Site of the Japan Epilepsy Society (JES) were measured during the survey period. Results: The BLOG obtained about 80?500 daily public accesses without any external funding support, and the total number of accesses to the BLOG from July 13 to December 4, 2005 was 20,718. The mean of daily accesses during the survey period was 135 for the BLOG and 181 for the JES Web site. A total of 27 users responded to the questionnaire during the survey period. Sixteen responders indicated that this novel facilitated awareness of epilepsy surgery, and eight indicated that they have been already aware of epilepsy surgery even before reading the novel. Conclusions: A public outreach in epilepsy surgery may be possible using BLOG, but the magnitude of public outreach in this project has been quite small. Major advantages of BLOG as a tool for outreach and survey include a small cost and high speediness. Technical limitations of BLOG-based surveys include limited coverage, non-response bias, and incompatible hardware or software. A better outreach system may be required to increase the number of patients with uncontrolled seizures benefiting from epilepsy surgery. [figure 1] 1,2 Ann M.E. Bye, 2 Anne M. Connolly, 3 Clare Netherton, 3 Peter Looker, 2 Annette Burgess, and 4 Amy Lonergan ( 1 Department of Neurology, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ; 2 School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ; 3 The Learning and Teaching Unit, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ; and 4 Telemetry Unit, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ) Rationale: Changing clinical practice, increasing demands on academic staff, and advances in information technology that alter student learning practices present serious challenges to medical teaching. These factors demand exploration of current teaching approaches to ensure desired outcomes of learning are achieved. The present study investigated learner perceptions of interest, clinical confidence and usefulness of lecture content in the teaching of childhood epilepsy. Methods: The presentation of the lecture was modelled on an interactive lecturing approach utilizing open questioning, illustration of history taking with clinical cases, simulations, role plays and video. Seven lectures to fifth year medical students (n = 113) and junior doctors (n = 36) were evaluated using pre- and post-lecture rating scales, open-ended questions and focus group discussions. Critical reflection by the lecturer and observational data by independent learning consultants were also collected. Results: There were significant pre- to post-lecture increases in interest in the topic of childhood epilepsy (p = 0.001), and clinical confidence in recognizing a seizure (p < 0.0005). Females demonstrated a larger mean increase in interest following the lecture (p = 0.014). Local participants (p = 0.031) and junior doctors (p = 0.001) found the lecture content more interesting. Seventy percent of participants found the lecture very useful in assisting learning. Participants who completed their previous education in Australia (p = 0.043) and junior doctors (p = 0.001) found the lecture more useful. Open-ended questions and focus group discussion showed that videos were the most useful tool. A structured approach to the classification of epilepsy and the interactive commentary provided by the lecturer were also helpful. Lecturer reflection and peer observation supported participant data. Conclusions: The outcome measures of interest, clinical confidence and usefulness are key components in learning evaluation and important parameters that influence student perceptions of medical training. The use of video and a structured approach to teaching childhood epilepsy within an interactive lecturing format promoted interest, clinical confidence and usefulness of the lecture content in assisting learning. Determining what teaching approach is effective in achieving optimal outcomes in these three domains has broad implications for medical training beyond the topic of childhood epilepsy. 1 Angelia M. Paschal, 2,3 Liow Kore, 1 Suzanne R. Hawley, 1 Jamilia Sly, and 1 Craig A. Molgaard ( 1 Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Wichita, KS ; 2 Internal Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Wichita, KS ; and 3 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Via Christi Regional Medical Center, Wichita, KS ) Rationale: A paucity of information exists in the literature about perspectives on epilepsy educational campaigns from the patients' point of view. Information is lacking on their opinions about what should be featured in such initiatives, how these awareness efforts should be conducted, and to whom to aim them. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of epilepsy patients' opinions and preferences on these issues. Methods: A survey was administered to 165 adults treated for epilepsy. Subjects were 18 years of age and older and were mostly female (62%) and Caucasian (82%). The 48-item survey included questions about the patient's thoughts on misperceptions of epilepsy in the general public and among other epilepsy patients, and what could be done to address these misperceptions. Descriptive frequencies were run for each variable, as well as measures of central tendency for continuous variables. Correlations and independent samples t-tests were run on selected variables. Results: Results indicated that almost two-thirds (65%) of the sample believed that stress and problems in their lives would be alleviated if the public was better educated about epilepsy and seizures. Survey respondents thought the general public lacked adequate knowledge about epilepsy (90%) and that education and awareness is needed. Common misperceptions in the public pertained to inappropriately reacting to seizures, believing that all epilepsy patients suffered from severe seizures, and that epilepsy is associated with a mental illness. Educational venues considered to be most effective for the public included television ads, medical offices, and workplace programs. Patients indicated that it was very important to include information about reacting to seizures and about epilepsy in general. Additional findings are provided. The respondents (88%) were almost equally desirous of a campaign for individuals with epilepsy. The information perceived to be most useful in an education campaign for epilepsy patients pertained to treatment options and modalities, self-management of epilepsy, and general information about epilepsy. Medical offices and brochures were perceived to be the most effective modes of education promotion. Additional results are discussed. Conclusions: In summary, the need for epilepsy education and awareness campaigns among the general public as well as epilepsy patients is needed to help decrease stigma, according to the respondents in this study. The current study of patients' views about epilepsy education and awareness needs provides a new perspective as well as an important foundation for the development of interventions. 1 Amy R. Loomis-Roux, 1 Tina Smith-Bonahue, and 2 Paul R. Carney ( 1 Educational Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 2 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Epilepsy has the potential to profoundly impact a child's adjustment to school. A large body of literature documents that children with epilepsy are at increased risk for cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, special education placement, and behavioral and emotional problems (Williams, 2004). The importance of successful adjustment to school for children with chronic illnesses is also well supported by the literature, yet many children with epilepsy continue to experience difficulties with school adjustment, even in the absence of cognitive impairment or learning disabilities (Madan-Swain, Katz,  2 Division of Biostatistics, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN ; 3 Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN ; and 4 Department of Environments for Health, Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Scant information exists regarding the effect of EEG or MRI findings on seizure recurrence in neurologically normal children. Our goal was to refine patient classification into high and low risk of seizure recurrence for normal children by defining risk factors based on EEG and MRI findings. Methods: Children were prospectively recruited at the parent institutions as part of a study of child and family adaptation to epilepsy and followed to 27 months after enrollment. Inclusion criteria: children 6?14 years old who had their first recognized afebrile seizure within 3 months of recruitment and who had both EEG and MRI data. Exclusion criteria: presence of a chronic neurological illness affecting activities of living, abnormal neurologic or developmental exam, or scoring <80 on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. Absence and atonic seizure patients were excluded. These criteria left 85 patients for the study. Each child was assigned a predominant seizure type based on the ILAE classifications. EEG data was classified by a) overall interpretation, b) epileptiform discharges, c) slowing. Epileptiform activity and slowing were defined as focal or diffuse. MRI images were classified for the presence of cortical or white matter lesions, encephalomalacia, enlarged lateral ventricles, atrophy, hemorrhage, vascular lesion, prominence of extra-axial fluid spaces > 1 cm, or ?other? findings. The children were followed as clinically appropriate and had an interview every 9 months to update seizure semiology and frequency. Recurrence was defined as a 2nd unprovoked seizure occurring >24 hours after the first seizure. X2 analysis was used to compare recurrence with EEG and MRI findings. Results: A recurrent unprovoked seizure occurred in 65.9% of patients. EEG and MRI were abnormal in 64.7% and 32.9% of patients, respectively. A significant abnormality occurred in 10.6% of MRI's. No association was found between recurrence of seizures and the baseline EEG (X2 p = 0.71), between recurrence of seizures and a normal MRI (X2 p = 0.23), or between recurrence of seizures and an abnormal MRI with significant abnormalities (X2 p = 0.12). Conclusions: Our EEG and MRI findings in neurologically normal children lend support to the current practice of using the clinical course to dictate the treatment plan. Although it appears that MRI abnormalities are not predictive of seizure recurrence, a trend toward significance is noted for significant MRI abnormalities.

Bakke, 1 Ann-Sofie Eriksson, and 2 Wilson John ( 1 Pediatric Department, National Centre for Epilepsy, Sandvika, Norway ; and 2 Department of Neurodiagnostics, National Centre for Epilepsy, Sandvika, Norway ) Rationale: The EEG pattern of CSWS (continuous spike waves during slow sleep) may influence language or cognitive functions. Recently, we have seen many children with a CSWS-like EEG pattern. The aim of this study was to assess school performance and behavior in such children treated with levetiracetam (LEV). Methods: We performed a prospective open label intervention study in 50 children (age: 5?12 yr) in whom 24-h EEG showed a vast increase of epileptiform activity during slow wave sleep. We employed a new method for assessment of nocturnal epileptiform discharges developed at our epilepsy centre. The children had spike-indexes of 30?90% of slow wave sleep. 25?35% of them was either seizure free or had never experienced epileptic seizures. Language/dyslectic problems, ADHD or concentration- and behavioral problems appeared to be the most common clinical disabilities. Moreover, some patients had symptoms within the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). LEV treatment was given (usually as add on) in doses 20?25 mg/kg/day, after 4?8 weeks of titration. 24-hour EEG was performed after 3?7 months of treatment. A reduction in epileptiform activity was assessed as either reduction in percentage time of spiking or as bifocal epileptiform activity becoming monofocal. Parents were asked about changes in the children's behavior, cognitive functions or school performance. Results: LEV caused a reduction in epileptiform activity in 24-h EEG in 65% of the patients. 24-h EEG became normal within 6 months in 25% of the cases. Parents reported positive clinical effects in more than half of those cases with an improved or normalized EEG. Conclusions: Children may benefit from treatment of sleep-related epileptiform activity in EEG, also when such activity are less prominent than in classical CSWS. Perhaps CSWS is only the ?tip of the iceberg?? We believe that our observations call for further studies within this exciting field. (Supported by National centre for epilepsy, Norway.) 1 Anne T. Berg, 2 Barbara G. Vickrey, 3 Francine M. Testa, 3 Susan R. Levy, 4 Shlomo Shinnar, 3 Susan N. Smith, 3 Barbara Beckerman, and 5 Francis DiMario ( 1 Biology, NIH, DeKalb, IL ; 2 Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Pediatrics, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; 4 Neurology, Montefiore Hospital, Bronx, NY ; and 5 Neurology, CCMC, Hartford, CT ) Rationale: Seizure outcomes are usually studied at one point in time and assumed to be static. Increasing evidence indicates this is not the case. Methods: In a prospective study of 613 children with epilepsy newly diagnosed in 1993?97, patterns of remission, relapse, and poor outcome were characterized in those children with idiopathic/cryptogenic (I/C) epilepsy and followed ≥8y. Syndromes were grouped as idiopathic localization-related (ILRE), cryptogenic focal (CFE), idiopathic generalized (IGE), and undetermined (UND). The minimum time seizure-free to be considered a remission was 1y, and remission of ≥5y was considered a good outcome. Results: 437 children had I/C epilepsy of whom 393 (90%) were followed ≥8 y (max 13y). The best possible outcome, no seizures since diagnosis, occurred in 69 (18%) and the worst, failure of 2 AEDs and never achieved 5y seizure-free at any time, occurred in 36 (9%). An additional 148 (38%) were at least 5y seizure-free at last contact after having seizures during the first one (n = 99) through several years (n = 49) after initial diagnosis. Another 63 (16%) had episodes of repeated brief remissions (1?2 years long) with relapses but are now ≥5y seizure-free. Finally 24 (6%) had achieved a 5y remission at some point but then relapsed, and 59 (15%) had achieved multiple briefer (1?3y) periods of remission with repeated relapse but were never 5y seizure-free. Syndrome group was strongly associated with the seizure outcome pattern (p < 0.0001). Most of the effect was due to the ILRE group having much better outcomes than the other three groups which were generally indistinguishable from each other. The IGE group, however, was significantly less likely to have the best outcome than any of each of the other three groups (all p = < 0.01). In a total of 616 ≥1year remission periods experienced by the 393 children, 272 remission periods ended in a relapse: 35% without any apparent provocation, 12% in association with noncompliance, 6% during tapering of AEDs, 33% after all AEDs were stopped, 3% in association with illness, and 11% in other settings. Conclusions: Although most children with I/C epilepsy achieve prolonged periods seizure-free, seizure outcome patterns over many years are complex and dynamic. A simple characterization at one point in time may not be the most informative approach for studying determinates of seizure outcome or for studying the effects of seizures on social, educational, and other endpoints of interest in young people with epilepsy.

Novotny, and 1,3,4 Hal Blumenfeld ( 1 Neuroscience, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; 2 Diagnostic Radiology, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; 3 Neurosurgery, Yale University, New Haven, CT ; 4 Neurology, Yale University, Fairfax, CT ; and 5 Pediatrics, Yale University, Fairfax, CT ) Rationale: Absence seizures consist of brief 5?10 s episodes of unresponsiveness, associated with a 3?4 Hz ?spike-wave? discharges on EEG. The fundamental mechanisms of impaired attention in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) are not known. By understanding the mechanisms and brain regions crucial for impaired attention in this patient population, new treatments may be developed with the goal of blocking seizures and preserving attention. Mechanisms of impaired attention in this form of epilepsy may have implications for treating other types of epilepsy as well. Methods: We have used simultaneous EEG and fMRI while testing attentional vigilance with a continuous performance task (CPT) in pediatric patients with typical absence seizures. To increase the chance of recording absence seizures, medications were held for up to 48 hours. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were acquired using a 3T MR system with continuous EPI BOLD sequence. EEG artifact was removed by post-processing using temporal PCA-based gradient noise removal. fMRI data was analyzed using SPM2. Results: We found significant ictal BOLD signal increases in bilateral thalamus. Moderate increases were also seen in the cingulate, lateral frontal, and parietal cortex. Decreased BOLD signal was present in the retrosplenial cortex, and to a lesser degree in the bilateral frontoparietal cortex. When testing CAE patients with CPT during the interictal period, significant BOLD signal increases were seen in the bilateral fronto-polar cortex, anterior cingulate, dorsolateral frontal and parieto-occipital cortex, left fusiform gyrus, bilateral medial thalamus, upper brainstem, and cerebellum. Decreases during CPT were seen in bilateral orbital frontal cortex, precuneus, and large areas of the lateral cerebral hemispheres. Our behavioral measurements indicate ictal omission errors in 5 of 7 absence seizures that occurred during the CPT task. Omission error rate (% missed target letter X on CPT) was significantly higher in CAE patients than controls, 3.05% in CAE patients off meds, and 0.89% in controls (p = 0.04, two-tailed t-test). Variability in performance was also higher in the CAE group, where omission error rate varied from 0% to 11% between trials, while in controls it varied from 0% to 5%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining high quality EEG-fMRI during behavioral testing in pediatric patients with CAE. As in adult patients, increases and decreases were seen in frontoparietal and thalamic networks. Our initial findings also suggest that the attentional networks involved in CPT overlap with thalamocortical networks affected by CAE.

Methods: Patient 1: A 15-years teenager with no particular personal and family history was referred to our center for ?absence? seizures that were refractory to treatment with lamotrigine. Clinical and neurological examinations were normal. His mother highlighted that during the ?absence? fits, she noticed labial shivering and twitching. It is also noteworthy that a month after the onset of ?absence? seizures, he presented a tonico-clonic fit. Cerebral T2-weighted MRI showed bilateral frontal hypersignal. A video electroencephalogram revealed that peri-oral myoclonia was concomitantly associated with generalised 3?4 Hz spike-waves. We added Sodium valproate to his base-line treatment with lamotrigine. Lamotrigine was subsequently withdrawn. Patient 2: A 14-years old male (with history of generalised fit at age of 5 years treated with sodium valpoate for 7 years) presented for perioral myoclonia with loss of consciousness followed, 3 weeks later, by one episode of GTCS. A video electroencephalogram revealed a peri-oral myoclonia associated with generalised 3?4 Hz spike-waves; Cerebral MRI was normal. At presentation he was treated with sodium valproate. The GTCS was stopped but he has persistence of absence seizures. We added lamotrigine without improvement. Finally the levetiracetam decreased the rate of seizures by 50%. Results: One month after starting sodium valproate, the first patient had no more absences, and the EEG became normal. The second patient showed 50% reduction of absence after starting levetiracetam. Conclusions: We report an ?atypical? and typical new case of ?peri-oral myoclonia with absence? in one of them abnormal cerebral MRI changes were detected.It could be argued if the first patient is a variant of the condition described by Panayiotopoulos as ?peri-oral myoclonia with absence,? with the additional finding of cerebral MRI frontal disorders. Conversely, this patient may be viewed as a case with frontal cerebral abnormalities presenting with peri-oral myoclonia and absence. At the present state of knowledge, it is not known if such a distinction makes any valid difference. However, this observation probably widens the spectrum of findings in this newly described entity. Furthermore, while this condition is known to be refractory to treatment. The first patient respond favourably to sodium valproate and the second to levetiracetam. Our follow-up should, however, be continued beyond the few-month window of opportunity. 1 Marlene A. Blackman, 1,2 Elaine C. Wirrell, and 1,2 Lorie D. Hamiwka ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Alberta Childrens Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 2 Pediatrics and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: To determine the frequency of atypical clinical or electrographic features in children with BREC seen in a tertiary care children's hospital. Methods: All children diagnosed with BREC seen through the Neurology Clinic of the Alberta Children's Hospital over an 8 year period were retrospectively identified. Charts were reviewed for the presence of atypical clinical and electrographic features. Atypical clinical features included daytime only seizures, atypical semiology, status epilepticus, developmental delay or learning problems, seizures refractory to ≥2 AEDs, seizure number >25 over the course of their epilepsy. Atypical electrographic features included background slowing or location of spikes outside the centrotemporal region. Results: 66 children were identified (mean age at seizure onset 7 yrs, range 3?12, gender 45M:21F). AED treatment was initiated in 39 (59%). Atypical clinical features were present in 27 (41%) and included daytime only seizures in 10, atypical semiology in 3, status epilepticus in 2, developmental delay/learning disorders in 11, refractory seizures in 2 and high seizure number in 5. Atypical electrographic features were present in 15 (23%) including atypical location in 13 and background slowing in 2. No patient had more than one atypical electrographic feature. Atypical electrographic features did not occur more commonly amongst those with atypical clinical features (p = 0.14). Patients with atypical clinical or electrographic features were neither more likely to be treated with AEDs (p = 0.40) nor less likely to achieve a period of 1 year seizure-freedom at last follow-up (p = 0.47) compared to those without these features. Conclusions: Atypical clinical and electrographic features are commonly seen in children with BREC but do not appear to adversely affect prognosis. (Supported by Alberta Childrens Hospital Foundation.) 1 D.F. Clarke, 1 J.W. Wheless, and 2 D. Carpenter ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ; and 2 Comprehensive NeuroSciences, Inc., White Plains, NY ) Rationale: Over the past 12 years, many new epilepsy treatments have been approved. For most pediatric epilepsy syndromes no trials compare active therapies, further compounding treatment decisions. We sought to address the shortcomings by using the expert consensus method, and conducted the first European survey in pediatrics. Methods: Forty-two pediatric epilepsy experts completed the Pediatric Epilepsy Consensus Survey. The experts answered 33 questions, with 418 possible answers. Topics addressed were 1) overall treatment strategy (sequencing both drug and non-pharmacologic treatment) for common childhood epilepsies; and, 2) specific treatment choices for common childhood epilepsies. Results: Valproate was the drug of choice and the only agent felt to be first line therapy for the treatment of symptomatic myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic seizures. Vigabatrin was the drug of choice for infantile spasm secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and for symptomatic infantile spasms. Valproate was the drug of choice in treating astatic seizures in a child with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS); however, if this was not successful, then topiramate and lamotrigine were considered first line therapy. Valproate was the first choice for treatment of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), whereas ethosuximide and lamotrigine were considered first line choices. Valproate was the drug of choice for juvenile absence epilepsy, and lamotrigine was a first line choice. Valproate was the only first line agent and considered the drug of choice for the treatment of benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and valproate were all considered first line choices to treat cryptogenic complex partial seizures of childhood. Valproate and lamotrigine were considered first line agents to treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in an adolescent male or female. Rectal diazepam was the first choice for the acute treatment of a febrile seizure, while valproate was considered the first choice for preventative therapy. The treatment sequence for either complex partial or generalized tonic clonic status epilepticus (S.E.) was either intravenous (IV) diazepam or lorazepam, followed by IV phenytoin or fosphenytoin, if needed. The treatment sequence for absence SE was IV diazepam, followed by IV valproate, if needed. Phenobarbital was the first choice in treating neonatal seizures. Conclusions: The results of the first European Pediatric Epilepsy Expert Survey can be used to develop overall treatment strategies and choices of specific medications for seizure emergencies in childhood, and specific childhood epilepsy syndromes. These can be used to help guide future comparative multi-centered treatment trials in pediatric epilepsy and in specific epilepsy syndromes unique to pediatrics.

Austin ( 1 Psychology, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN ; 2 Biostatistics, Indiana University School Medicine, Indianapolis, IN ; 3 Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN ; and 4 Environments for Health, Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Children with epilepsy are at risk for behavioral problems. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been reported more frequently than any other problem. Even though children with epilepsy have higher prevalence rates of ADHD, it remains unclear if they are at risk for being under-identified and under-treated for the disorder. We sought to determine whether the proportions of children with epilepsy were identified as having ADHD equally by the school and by measures incorporating DSM criteria. Methods: Participants were 86 children with chronic epilepsy. Children were assessed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. The mean age at 24 months was 13.73 (SD = 1.97), age of seizure onset was 6.25 (SD = 3.64), 50% were females, and 15.1% were left-handed. Parents completed an educational services survey, on which they indicated whether the child was currently classified by their school as having ADHD (yes/no). In addition, parents completed the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) or Adolescent Symptoms Inventory (ASI) symptom checklists with severity scores that may be used for diagnosis of ADHD based on DSM IV criteria. Results: McNemar's test was conducted to determine whether there were similar rates of ADHD classification by the CSI/ASI and educational services survey over the 24 months. Forty eight percent of the children were classified as ADHD by CSI/ASI criteria, whereas only 29% were classified as ADHD in the educational services survey (McNemar's chi-square = 8.33, p-value = .004). There were 27 total discrepancies between the classification types. Of these 27, 6 (22%) were children not meeting the CSI/ASI criteria who were classified as ADHD by the survey (false positives), and 21 (78%) were classified as ADHD by CSI/ASI but were not classified as ADHD in the schools (false negatives). Conclusions: These findings suggest that ADHD is a common problem for children with epilepsy and careful monitoring is important. It appears children with epilepsy might be at risk for under-identification of ADHD when symptoms are present. Hence, children that could benefit from additional educational services might not have access to these important resources. (Supported by PHS R01 NR04536 from NIH/NINR to J.K.A.) 1 Laura A. Filimon, 2 Justin M. Keener, 1 H. Steve White, 1 Karen S. Wilcox, and 2 Joanna Beachy ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ; and 2 Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insults have been associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). As a result, affected patients are at an increased risk for developing mental retardation, epilepsy and/or cerebral palsy. The Levine model of HI has been modified such that the degree and length of hypoxia (6% for 1 hour) leads to a specific reduction in myelin basic protein (MBP) and decreased seizure threshold to kainic acid (KA) at P11 (Levine Am J Pathol 1960;36:1?17;Follett et al JNeurosci 2004;24:4412?20; Koh et al Epilepsia 2004;45:569?75). Thus, using this 6% rat model of PVL we evaluated the effect of HI on KA-induced seizure threshold and amygdala kindling aquisition. Additionally animals were monitored for the presence of spontaneous ictal discharges. Methods: Post-natal day 7 (P7) Sprague-Dawley rat pups were anesthetized with isoflurane and their right carotid artery ligated. Pups were allowed to recover for at least 1.5 hours and were then placed in a 6% O2 chamber for one hour; body temperature was maintained at 35°C using a heating pad. Males and females from several litters were divided into HI-lesioned and naive controls. Two pups were sacrificed at P11 and MBP damage was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The remaining animals (P90?120) were subjected to either 10 mg/kg KA (males: HI n = 8, naive n = 12; females: HI n = 6, naive n = 10) or amygdala kindling (males: HI n = 5; naive n = 6; females: HI n = 9; naive n = 14). At 9 months of age five animals were monitored for the presence of spontaneous seizures using implanted surface electrodes. Results: HI at P7 resulted in significant loss of MBP at P11. To assess KA susceptibility the following endpoints were measured: latency to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th seizures, latency to wet dog shakes, total seizure number, number of stage III and V seizures, latency to stage III and V seizures, and incidence of death. Among these endpoints no difference in KA seizure threshold was evident between HI and naive rats regardless of sex. There was no significant difference in amygdala kindling aquisition (male or female). However, the after-discharge threshold of male HI rats was lower than that of naive rats (HI = 140 mA ± 53; naive = 207 mA ± 21). Three (2 males and 1 female) of the 5 rats (3 males and 2 females) exhibited spontaneous electrographic bursts. Conclusions: Consistent with previous reports, we observed marked damage to MBP four days post HI (P11). Furthermore, HI-injured rats displayed a reduced amygdala after-discharge threshold. Consistent with a previous report using the Levine model, HI rats displayed spontaneous electrographic bursting (Williams et al Epilepsia 2004;45:1210?1218). Future video-EEG studies will evaluate the ontogeny of EEG bursts and assess the severity of clinical seizures.

Nordli, 6 Darrell V. Lewis, 4 Anthony Marmarou, 3 Shlomo Shinnar, and FEBSTAT Study Team ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, Eastern Virgnia Medical School, Norfolk, VA ; 2 GH Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 3 Neurology, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; 4 Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ; 5 Pediatric Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL ; and 6 Neurology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC ) Rationale: In children with a prolonged febrile seizure, a lumbar puncture is indicated to exclude the possibilty of an intracranial infection. There is a common belief that some degree of pleocytosis is expected simply as a result of the prolonged seizure and fever. We evaluated the CSF findings in a prospective multicenter study of febrile status epilepticus in children. Methods: FEBSTAT is a prospective multicenter study of febrile status epilepticus (≥30 min) designed to determine whether prolonged febrile seizures cause acute hippocampal damage with mesial temporal sclerosis. Although not part of the research protocol, many of these children had a lumbar puncture performed. CSF results were coded and analyzed. More than 20 WBCs in the CSF was an exclusion criterion, but no child was excluded solely as a result of having more than 20 WBCs. Results: Of the first 102 children enrolled, 80 (78%) had a lumbar punture performed. At present, CSF data on 73 of these 80 is available for analysis. Of these 73 CSF specimens, 22 (30%) had zero WBCs, 29 (40%) had one WBC, 11 (15%) had two WBCs, 4 (5%) had three WBCs and one (1%) had 4 WBCs. Six (8%) specimens had 5 or more WBCs (two with 6 WBCs, two with 8 WBCs and one each with 11 and 16 WBCs.) However, of the six cases with 5 or more WBCs, 5 were traumatic with 5100 to 51,000 RBCs. In all 5 cases, the number of WBCs was fully consistent with the RBC count. Thus there was only one atraumatic lumbar punture with more than 5 WBCs (6 WBCs) and only 2 children with more than 3 WBCs. The protein and glucose were unremakable in these children. The number of WBCs was not affected by duration of the seizure (<60 minutes vs >60 minutes,) seizure focality, the age of the child (<18 months vs ≥18 months) or peak temperature. Conclusions: CSF pleocytosis is very uncommon following even prolonged febrile seizures in children. A finding of more than five WBCs in the CSF from a nontraumatic lumbar punture should be a cause for concern in any child with a seizure and fever.

NINDS.) 1 Felicia Gliksman, 1 Li Kan, and 1 Joseph Maytal ( 1 Division of Pediatric Neurology, Schneider Children's Hospital, New Hyde Park, NY ) Rationale: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. A previous review showed levetiracetam to be most effective in children with partial onset seizures as well as being well tolerated with few reported side effects. Preliminary studies show levetiracetam to be effective for treating idiopathic generalized epilepsy in adult patients but few results are available in children with generalized idiopathic epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed in a tertiary center on children ages 2?18 years old with idiopathic generalized epilepsy that have been treated with levetiracetam up until May 2006. The data included patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy for example, myoclonic, tonic, and atonic seizures. Pure absence seizures were excluded but absence mixed with other convulsive types were accepted. Also excluded were patients with symptomatic and partial seizures. Data was recorded on: patient age, gender, type of epilepsy, existing anti-epileptic therapy, dose and duration of treatment with levetiracetam, patient/caregiver assessment of seizure frequency, and adverse events. Results: A total of 15 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. Daily levetiracetam dose ranged from 9.1 to 73.2 mg/kg/day (average 35.2 mg/kg/day). The mean number of concomitant use of other anti-epileptic drug (AED) was 0.9 which included lamotrigine, primidone, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenytoin, topiramate. The mean number of total AEDs per patient was 1.6. The demographic characteristics included: Age: 2.3?18 years (mean, 10.6 years), Sex: 9 females, 6 males, Generalized tonic clonic 11/15 (73.3%), Absence (mixed type) 6/15 (40%), Myoclonic 5/15 (33.3%), Tonic 1/15 (6.7%), Atonic 2/15 (13.3%). Nine out of fifteen patients (60%) showed a good response to levetiracetam with reduction in seizure frequency. Four out of fifteen patients (26.7%) became seizure free and 5/15 (33.3%) patients had fewer seizure frequency with therapy. Five out of fifteen patients (33.3%) had no response to therapy. Of those with generalized tonic clonic epilepsy, 4/11 (36.4%) had become seizure free, 3/11 (27.2%) had a decrease in seizure frequency, and 3/11 (27.2%) showed no response. Adverse effects occurred in four children (26.6%) including behavioral change (1/15), tiredness (1/15), decrease appetite (1/15), and reason unknown (1/15) (child was seen as an in-patient and followed at an outlying hospital). Conclusions: Treatment with levetiracetam resulted in reduction of seizure frequency in 60% of the patients included in this study. Levetiracetam was efficacious and safe for use in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with few, mild side effects reported. (Supported by UCB Pharma.) 1 Oksana V. Globa, 2 Elena G. Sorokina, 1 Natalya G. Zvonkova, 1 Natalya A. Basarnaya, and 3 Elena L. Semikina ( 1 Neurology, Scientific Center of Child Health, RAMS, Moscow, Russian Federation ; 2 Laboratory of Membranology and Genetic Group, Scientific Center of Child Health, RAMS, Moscow, Russian Federation ; and 3 Laboratory of Clinical Diagnostic, Scientific Center of Child Health, RAMS, Moscow, Russian Federation ) Rationale: We searched for the immunity changing and autoimmunity correlation in epilepsy patients. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that also triggers a neurodegeneration as a result of excessive stimulation of postsynaptic receptors in epilepsy, brain ischemia and CNStrauma. This process was hypothesized as the major cause for the neuronal loss, chronic inflammatory changes in neurological patients and may leads to the autoantibodies(aAB) to glutamate receptors(GluRs) synthesis. Clinical and experimental data support the role of immune mechanisms during epilepsy pathogenesis. Methods: The serum level of lymphocyte subpopulations (obtained by immunocytochemical methods) and the serum level of GluRs-aAB (ELISA, synthetic peptides-analogues of GluR1(AMPA) and NR2A(NMDA) subunits were used as antigens) were estimated in pediatric patients with epilepsy(Epi), mild brain trauma(BT), mitochondrial diseases(MD) and in 20 children of control group(CG). Results: In Epi(n = 60) GluRs-aAB level was significantly higher vs CG(GluR1179 ± 15,3c.u.,NR2A161,4 ± 14c.u.)(p < 0.05). In follow-up studies GluR1aAB level was decreased in E remission, NR2A was still elevated. In acute period of BT(n = 20) the GluRs-aAB was high(p < 0,05) but the elevation of NR2AaAB was higher than GluR1.In 6?12 mnths follow-up studies GluR1aABlevel was significantly elevated in children with repeated BT and posttraumatic epilepsy. In patients with MD(n = 15), even without seizures, the GluRs-aAB was high. Epileptic seizures is the common sign of MD. We have found the significant increase of CD8+lymphocytes, in activation markersCD122+, CD16 + 56+ and decrease in CD19+ in Epi patients(n = 20).We have also found the high level of CD122+, low level of CD19+ in MDpatients(n = 5), the decrease in Tlymphocytes subpopulations and the increase of CD122+ in children with BT(n = 7). The most immunological deteriorations were related to the temporal lobe focus. We did not find correlation between the immunological changes and the GluRs-aAB levels. Conclusions: Data obtained show that in E, BT and MD glutamate receptors are damaged as a result of excititoxicity. NMDARs dysfunction is observed in all diseases mentioned above. AMPARs damage is more specific for E and the elevation of GluR1aAB level is a risk for E developed in BT and MD. Changes in immological parameters in pediatric patients with epilepsies were not correlated with the glutamate-mediated autoimmunity. 1 Peter Gradisnik, and 2 Vlatka Mejaski-Bosnjak ( 1 Pediatric Department, General Hospital, Maribor, Slovenia ; and 2 Neuropediatric Department, Djecja Klinika, Zagreb, Croatia ) Rationale: Studies discussing neurological outcome with prematurely born children are mainly oriented towards motor development evaluation. It is now accepted that damage to brain-tissue partly occurs due to prenatal pathological occurrences. The present research was aimed at establishing whether antepartally developed periventricular damage of brain-tissue with prematures can cause development of epilepsy in the early ages. Methods: The research included 105 high-risk prematures with completed brain ultrasound during the first week. Following the medical documentation we categorised their ultrasound readings according to the measure of brain damage as well as regarding the approximate time of the occurrence of the damage. The potential prognostic factors were compared with the incidence of epilepsy. By the binary logistic regression method, the relative risk of the occurrence was established for the potential factors. Results: During the 6?8 years of following the cases up we have ascertained epileptic occurrence with 11.4% of our patients. Most frequent form of epilepsy was the West syndrome, occurring with 5.7% of all patients. Gestational age, birth-weight, presence of perinatal asphyxia and intrauterine growth retardation proved to be statistically unconnected with epileptic occurrences. Employment of tocolitic therapy was correlated with increased risk of epilepsy, but the difference still isn't statistically significant. Correlation of a subsequent epileptic occurrence and of hemorrhagic as well as ischemic white matter damage proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.05); however, when perinatal lesions were divided, based upon the ultrasound criteria, into antepartal and postnatal subgroups and when their respective correlation with the outcome was ascertained, the only statistically significant brain-damage related to epilepsy proved to be such as originating before birth. Conclusions: The presence of prenatal brain pathology is mostly important for the development of epilepsy in prematurely born children. The concluding process of brain cortex formation going on during the final trimester of pregnancy is likely to be opening possibility of secondary cortical brain damage following the primary exposure of white matter. 1 Sara Y. Tsuchie, 1 Marilisa M. Guerreiro, 1 Eunice Chuang, 1 Carlos E. Baccin, 1 Maria A. Montenegro, and 1 Carlos A. Guerreiro ( 1 Neurology, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: It is known that epilepsy has a severe impact in the quality of life of the patients; however, it affects the lives of all family members. The psychosocial repercussions of epilepsy are often of greater significance than the seizures themselves. Methods: This was a prospective study, conducted from January 2005 to December 2005 at the pediatric epilepsy clinic of our University Hospital. Parents were interviewed by one of the authors according to a structured questionnaire that included questions about the impact of epilepsy in the life of the patients and their family, especially their siblings. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven children, siblings of 78 patients with epilepsy were evaluated. From the 127 siblings of children with epilepsy, 60 were girls and 67 were boys. Ages ranged from 5 to 18 years-old (mean = 11.7 years). After the diagnosis of epilepsy the siblings had only negative feelings toward the disease, mostly sadness and fear. Conclusions: Our data showed that the impact of epilepsy in the lives of siblings of children with epilepsy is much more severe than previously suspected. (Supported by: Eunice Chuang and Sara Y.

Montenegro ( 1 Neurology, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Although overtreatment with antiepileptic drugs contributes to the morbidity associated with epilepsy, many children still are overtreated. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the withdrawal of at least one antiepileptic drug (AED) in children with refractory epilepsy using polytherapy enable a better seizure control. Methods: This was a prospective study. Children with refractory epilepsy using at least two AEDs were included. Once the patient, or guardian, agreed to participate in the study, one or more AED were slowly tapered off. The remaining AEDs dosages could be adjusted as needed, but a new AED could not be introduced. Results: Fifteen patients were evaluated, three girls; ages ranging from 3 to 18 (mean = 8.7 years). After at least one AED withdrawal, two (13.5%) patients became seizure free, seizures improved > 50% in 5 (33.5%) patients, did not change in 5 (33.5%), and seizure frequency became worse in 3 (20%). Adverse events improved in 12 patients (80%). Conclusions: We conclude that the withdrawal of at least one AED is a valuable option in the treatment of selected children with refractory epilepsy.

Gilio ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Sao Paulo Hospital, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Recurrence of single non-provoked epileptic seizure is generally studied in tertiary hospitals where the Universities are based. The aim of this paper is to report the evolution of first non-provoked epileptic seizure in children from the community followed in a secondary care University hospital in Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. Methods: We performed pediatric neurological prospective and consecutive follow-up of 51 children with non-provoked single epileptic seizure, aged 17 months to 15 years (mean 8.4) referred from the Pediatric emergency sector of the University of Sao Paulo Hospital, a secondary care regionalized unit which receives patients from Butanta district in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. All have performed brain CT and EEG. The EEG was read by the same neurologist who took care of the patients in the out-patient unit. Results: There were 29 boys and 22 girls. Seizures occurred in wakefulness in 29, sleep in 18, and on arousal in 4. Only one patient had a seizure lasting more than 10 min and 5 had multiple seizures (>1/24h). Focal seizures occurred in 29, generalized in 14, and not classified in 8. Only one had had previous febrile seizures (FS); 5 had relatives (first grade) with epilepsy, and 2 with FS. Mild mental retardation was present in 3. EEG was abnormal in 36, showing focal paroxysms in 20 (rolandic in 6, parietotemporal 5, occipital 3, frontal 3, and hemispheric in 2), multifocal in 1 (after a while, rolandic) and generalized in 9. Two had abnormal brain CT (arachnoid cist and non specific abnormality, not confirmed by MRI). Electroclinical analysis revealed idiopathic generalized epileptic syndrome in 8 (7 juvenile absence and 1 juvenile myoclonic epilepsy) who received VPA; CBZ was prescribed in 2 patients because of very frequent frontal discharges; 4 patients had had remote seizure and were medicated; 5 were receiving DAE since the emergency unit and the family preferred to keep it; and finally 32 remained without DAE. Eleven of these (34.4%) had seizure recurrence and AED was prescribed. The etiology was idiopathic in 40, symptomatic in 1 (frontal remote encephalic trauma) and cryptogenic in 10 (3 with mild mental retardation and 7 learning disability). The second seizure recurred in a mean time of 80 days (15 days-14 months); risk factors were male sex, focal seizures and occurrence in sleep. Conclusions: Recurrence after non-provoked single epileptic seizure in children from the community was similar to that of tertiary hospitals. This might be due to an inadequate distribution of health professionals in some peripheral areas. There is a need for specialists in these units in order to correctly perform the diagnosis of epileptic syndromes of low remission, such as juvenile absence and myoclonic epilepsies, as well as, to give the patients a better standard care, and consequently decrease the stigma of epileptic seizures in the population. 1 Barbara E. Hallinan, 1 Argirios Dinopoulos, and 1 Antonius DeGrauw ( 1 Division of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: We report a young man followed in the Neurology Clinic at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) for partial epilepsy who developed Landau-Kleffner Syndrome at the age of 14 years. The patient was admitted to our hospital in July 2004 for observation following a seizure characterized by left hand clenching, head shaking and unresponsiveness for one minute. The patient was drowsy but at his mental status baseline following the episode. Further history revealed that the patient had had two other seizures in the 18 month period prior to admission. The patient's initial EEG revealed frequent high amplitude 2 Hz independent bitemporal spike and wave discharges with no clinical correlate. Neuroimaging was normal. The patient was discharged on valproic acid with close follow-up planned. Six months later, the family reported a steady decline in school performance and behavior. The EEG showed electrographic seizures, generalized in onset, with a L > R bitemporal predominance. Lamotrigine was added. Nine months after initial admission, specific deficits in receptive and expressive language were noted. An overnight EEG revealed abnormal activity originating in the left temporal region during wakefulness. Continuous spike-wave activity during stage III sleep was noted consistent with electrical status epilepticus of slow wave sleep. Valium was added to the patient's regimen. Sixteen days later, the EEG normalized with clinical improvement in language function. Valium was tapered and a subsequent 24 hour EEG was normal. Two years after the initial diagnosis of epilepsy, the patient remains seizure-free on valproic acid and lamotrigine with some persistence of slow expressive speech. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Landau-Kleffner Syndrome in a teenager. 1 Lorie D. Hamiwka, 1 Neetu K. Singh, 1 Jodie Niosi, and 1 Elaine C. Wirrell ( 1 Pediatrics and Clinical Neurosciences, Alberta Children's Hospital/University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Although the diagnosis of seizures are common in pediatric neurology practice, first presentation is a particularly frightening event for the child and their family members. Accurate differentiation of a seizure from a non-epileptic event, such as convulsive syncope and breath holding is important, as prognosis, life style modifications and social stigma differ between these diagnoses. The goals of this study is to determine (a) the range of diagnoses presenting to a first seizure clinic, and (b) the prevalence of previous seizures in children presenting to a first seizure clinic. Methods: 127 children were seen in a tertiary care First Seizure Clinic. Inclusion criteria were age 1 mo?17 yrs with an unprovoked event suggestive of seizure. Data collected included referring physician specialty, child's age, gender, developmental status and clinical diagnosis of epileptologist (non-epileptic vs epileptic). For those with epileptic events, seizure type, syndrome (if identifiable), presumed etiology (idiopathic, cryptogenic, symptomatic), presence of prior afebrile and febrile seizures, provoking factors, family history, pre/perinatal complications and EEG results were recorded. Results: The diagnosis was epileptic in 94 (74%), non-epileptic in 31 (24%) and unclassifiable in 2 (2%). Pediatricians were more likely to refer true epileptic events (92%) than ED physicians (76%) or Family Physicians (65%). Mean age at presentation was 8 years. Fifteen percent of children were developmentally delayed and neurological examination was abnormal in 11%. For those diagnosed with epileptic events, 32 presented with generalized while 62 presented with partial onset seizures. An epilepsy syndrome was identifiable in 15 cases. Thirty eight percent experienced a prior probable seizure which was recognized by the referring physician in only one case. An EEG was done in all children with seizures and was abnormal in 41%. Conclusions: Diagnostic inaccuracy is common in first seizure. One quarter of children were incorrectly diagnosed as having a seizure while the diagnosis of epilepsy was missed in over 1/3 of children. First seizure clinics conducted by epilepsy specialists is important in the diagnosis, treatment and counseling in this group of children. 1 Allen Hauser, 1 Cigdem I. Akman, 1 Lawrence J. Hirsch, 1 Nathalie Jette, and 1 Ronald Emerson ( 1 Neurology, Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Columbia University, College of Physician  30?60 min in 5; >60 min in 1; repetitive clusters of seizures in 10 and missing in 3. First AED administered at the time of diagnosis included lorazepam (LRZ) in 14 (58%), diazepam (DZP) in 5 (20.8%) and phenytoin (PHT) in 3 (12.5%). Twenty-three children received a 2nd AED: LRZ in 12 (52%), DZP in 2 (8.6%), PHT in 4 (17.3%), and phenobarbital (PB) in 3 (13%). A third AED was administered to 18: PHT 9 (50%), DZP in 6 (33%) and PB in 3 (16.6%). A Fourth AED was used in 12 (50%), a 5th AED in 4(16.6%). All patients ultimately received continuous infusion of midazolam (MDZ) 23/24 or pentobarbital (PTB) 9/24. MDZ was effective in 15, maximum dose 0.06?1.2 mg/kg/hr and average duration of 4.4 days. PTB was effective in 6, maximum dose was 3?15 mg/kg/h with average duration of 18 days. RSE was controlled only with ACTH in 1 and high dose PB in 1 after failing MDZ and PTB infusion. In 20 patients, EEG was obtained within 24 hrs. Burst suppression was noted in 11 (45%) with MDZ or PTB infusion. Non-convulsive seizures were seen in 7 RSE cases (29%) during the course of treatment. RSE was controlled in all but one patient, 14 responded in < 2 days, 6 in 2?4d, 3 in >15d. Seizures recurred in 7 cases within 1 week of discontinuation of infusion. At discharge, mild neurological deficit was seen in 12, and severe disability in 9. Thirteen patients were released home, 5 to rehabilitation, 3 to the local hospital, and 2 expired during the course of RSE. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that etiology, recurrence of seizures and mortality rate are different in children with RSE compared to adults with RSE. CNS infection was the most common single cause, and mortality was lower than in adults. Further studies are needed to identify risk factors and optimal treatment for RSE in children. 1 Patel Hema, 1,2 Dunn W. David, 2 Scott L. Eric, and 1 Garg P. Bhuwan ( 1 Section of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Neurology, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN ; and 2 Section of Child Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University, Medical Center, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: Limited information is available on phenomenology of childhood non-epileptic seizures (NES) by developmental stages. We have studied the clinical characteristics of non-epileptic seizures (NES) in children to determine if the clinical manifestations are different in children younger than 13 years age as compared to the older children. Methods: Retrospective review of medical records and video-EEGs of all patients with NES confirmed on video-EEG monitoring at Indiana University from April 2002 to December 2005. Results: 1,967 patients were monitored in the video-EEG unit during this period. 68 patients (3.5%) had a clinical diagnosis of NES. We present data on 59/68 patients who had their habitual event recorded during the video-EEG monitoring; 9 patients did not have their habitual event during the Video-EEG study. Mean age at the time of the video-EEG diagnosis was 13.3 years (range 5years 6 months to 19 years 6 months). Mean duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis of NES was 6.8 months (range 3days to 3 years). In our study 37 of the 59 patients (62%) were females. 22 patients were less than 13 years of age (group A) and 37 were 13 years and older (group B). In group A male to female ratio was equal (11 patient each) while in group B there were more females (26 females and 11 males). Interpersonal conflicts, school related stress and family discord were the most frequent stressors in both groups. Sexual abuse was the least frequent. Cognitive dysfunction was present in 15/22 (68%) in group A and 7/37 (19%) in group B. 2/22 (9%) in group A had depression as compared to 13/37 (35%) in group B who were depressed. 15/22 (68%) in group A had epilepsy (partial epilepsy in 80%) in contrast to 11/37 (29%) in group B (partial in 45%). Prominent motor activity was more likely with NES in group B (32/37, 86%). Conclusions: We found that there were more females with NES in the older than 13 yrs age group while this gender difference was not seen in the younger children. In addition the clinical characteristics of NES are different in younger children as compared to older children. Distinct risk factors for the younger age group included cognitive dysfunction and diagnosis of epilepsy, whereas for the older children, depression and prominent motor activity were associated with NES. These findings have implications for the identification of non-epileptic seizures in children and their management in this age group. 1 Angel W. Hernandez, 1 David Donahue, 1 Saleem I. Malik, and 1 C. Thomas Black ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX ) Rationale: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is the first device-based treatment option for both epilepsy and depression. On the basis of pre-clinical trials, the manufacturer of the VNS Therapy System (Cyberonics, Inc; Houston, TX) recommends that stimulation be started 2 weeks after the device is implanted to allow for surgical recovery time. We intend to show that stimulation activation in the operating room immediately after implantation is safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents regardless of output current, pulse width, and frequency. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis was performed on 104 patients aged 8 months to 20 years (median age 7.9 years) with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and implanted with the VNS therapy device between 2001 and mid-2005. All devices were activated intraoperatively. Forty-nine devices were activated using the following stimulation parameters: output current of 0.25 mA, pulse width of 500 ?sec, and frequency of 30 Hz. Fifty-five devices were activated using the following parameters: output current of 0.25 mA, pulse width of 250 ?sec, and frequency of 20 Hz. All devices were set to a duty cycle of 5 minutes Off and 30 seconds On. Results: All patients tolerated intraoperative VNS activation. Adverse changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, or electrocardiogram (EKG) did not occur at the time of activation or thereafter. No unexpected side effects were reported acutely. Conclusions: Intraoperative activation of the VNS therapy device appears to be safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents regardless of output current, pulse width, and frequency. 1 Eila A. Herrgard, and 2 Laila Luoma ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Neurology, Kuopio University and University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland ; and 2 Department of Psychiatry, Kellokoski Hospital, Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Finland ) Rationale: Only few pre-, peri- and neonatal risk factors are recognized for febrile seizure. In some studies febrile seizures are shown to be associated with preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hyperbilirubinemia, long neonatal intensive care, sepsis and low birth weight. The aim of our study was to evaluate risk factors for febrile seizures in the study group of children including both preterm and term children. Methods: Pre-, peri- and neonatal data of 60 prospectively followed children born at or before 32 weeks of gestation, and of 60 matched term controls from the two year birth cohort were available from earlier phases of the study. Seizure data were obtained from questionnaires completed by parents, and from hospital records and parent interviews. Risk factor analysis was done by logistic regression. Results: Febrile seizures were found in 8 /60 (13%) children born at ≤ 32 weeks of gestation and in 3/60 (5%) children born at term. Fourteen of 120 children (12%) were born to pre-eclamptic mothers, 30/120 children (25%) were small for gestational age (SGA), 48 children (40%) had a neonatal intensive care longer than 28 days; neonatal sepsis was found in 4/120 (3%), respiratory or other infections during neonatal period in 26/120 (22%) and RDS in 30/120 children (25%). Risk for febrile seizures was 2.9 (CI 0.74?11.619) in the children born preterm compared to the term children. Risk for febrile seizures in offsprings of mothers with pre-eclampsia was low (OR 0.7, CI 0.09?6.25). Respectively, risk for febrile seizures in SGA children was low (OR 1.1, CI 0.28?4.60). Risk for febrile seizures in RDS children (OR 2.8, CI 0.79?9.95) and in children who had long neonatal intensive care (OR 2.9, CI 0.80?10.52) was parralel. Sepsis and other infections during neonatal period and later febrile seizures were not encountered in the same children. Conclusions: Rate of febrile seizures was increased in children born preterm. Pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, sepsis or other neonatal infections were not risk factors for febrile seizures. However, the size of the study group sets its own limitations in evaluations of risks. 1 Dale C. Hesdorffer, 1 Veronica J. Hinton, 2 Christine O'Dell, 2 David M. Masur, 3 Douglas Nordli, 4 Jack Pellock, 4 Anthony Marmarou, 5 Darrell V. Lewis, 6 L.M. Frank, 2 Shlomo Shinnar, and the FEBSTAT Study Team ( 1 GH Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Department of Neurology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY ; 3 Department of Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL ; 4 Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ; 5 Department of Neurosurgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ; 6 Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC ; and 7 Department of Neurology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA ) Rationale: Febrile status epilepticus (FSE) may be associated with the development of mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. If ongoing prospective studies support this, then prevention of FSE becomes a central concern. We, therefore, undertook an analysis to identify risk factors for FSE. Methods: This analysis combines data from two prospective studies, employing almost identical protocols and questionnaires: children with incident FSE (n = 73) from the FEBSTAT study; and children with incident simple (n = 105) and complex (n = 46) febrile seizures (FS) that were not FSE from the Columbia University Febrile Seizure study. At identification, parents were questioned about potential FS antecedents and an MRI was performed within 72 hours. Within one month of the FS, children received a neurological examination and developmental testing. Logistic regression was used to evaluate potential FSE risk factors, comparing FSE to simple FS and complex FS (not FSE) to simple FS. Results: Compared to children with simple FS, children with febrile SE were less likely to be 18 months and older (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2?0.8) and less likely to have fevers of 104.0 or more (OR = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1?0.5). Similar non-significant results were seen for other complex FS vs. simple FS. Smoking during pregnancy was strongly associated with FSE compared to simple FS (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4?9.4) as was drinking during pregnancy (OR = 9.6, 95% CI = 1.1?82.3). Smoking was also associated with a 2.1-fold non-significant increased risk complex FS compared to simple FS. No associations were observed for family history of febrile seizure, neurological abnormality, or day care attendance. Conclusions: Risk factors appear to be different for both FSE and other complex FS compared to simple FS. The reason for the robust association between smoking during pregnancy and FSE deserves further study. (Supported by R01 HD 36867 and R01 NS043209.) 1,2 Sudha V. Kilaru, 1 Anuradha Venkatasubramanian, and 1 Dennis J. Dlugos ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY ) Rationale: Clinical features of an epileptic seizure (seizure semiology) can provide important information regarding localization of the ictal onset zone. Understanding seizure semiology, and its concordance with EEG and imaging data, is particularly important in the evaluation of epilepsy surgery patients. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of pediatric seizure semiology, with an emphasis on the order of appearance of clinical signs, has not been extensively studied. As part of a continuous quality improvement initiative in an epilepsy monitoring unit, we designed a form to record and code components of seizure semiology, and tested its usability and IRR. Methods: Based on expert opinion and a literature review of lateralizing signs in adults and children, a form was constructed listing lateralizing and nonlateralizing signs commonly seen in seizures. Four major categories?eye signs, face signs, trunk/limb signs, and other signs?were delineated. Within these 4 categories, specific elements were described and lateralized. Two investigators independently reviewed and coded the video records of 33 seizures from subjects aged 2 to 18 years. The primary outcome of interest was percent agreement when identifying the first three clinical signs, including lateralization when appropriate. Across all seizures, 95 clinical signs were assessed. Percent agreement corrected for chance agreement (Kappa statistic) was explored, but correction was minimal (less than 1%) due to the large number of possible choices. Results: Agreement on behavioral state prior to the seizure occurred in 85% of records. Agreement on the presence of clinical signs occurred in 73/95 (77%) of clinical signs assessed. Lateralizing features were found in 65/95 (68%) of clinical signs assessed. In records with such features, agreement on lateralization occurred in 77% of records. Eighteen percent of lateralization disagreements (n = 2) were due to rater errors. The other disagreements were disputes of whether signs were unilateral versus bilateral (n = 7), or present or absent (n = 2). All but two disagreements on lateralization were resolved in a consensus conference. We observed that 49% of initial signs had lateralizing features, while 76% of second signs were lateralizing, and 83% of third signs were lateralizing. Conclusions: We designed a practical, easy-to-use form for coding the semiological components of individual seizures recorded on video. IRR was good-to-excellent, and most lateralization disagreements were resolved on consensus conference. The second or third signs during a seizure were more often lateralizing than the first. Based on additional experience, this form will be optimized for greater ease-of-use and reliability. Future work could correlate the order of appearance of lateralizing signs with EEG data, imaging data and outcome in children being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. 1 Hoon-Chul Kang, 2 Baik-Lin Eun, 2 Chang Wu Lee, 2 Han Ku Moon, 2 Joon-Sik Kim, 2 Dong Wook Kim, 2 Joon Soo Lee, 2 Kyu Young Chae, 2 Byung Ho Cha, 2 Eun Sook Suh, 2 Jung Chae Park, 2 Kyunghwa Lim, 2 Eun Hye Ha, and 3 Heung Dong Kim ( 1 Pediatrics, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ; 2 Korean Pediatric Topiramate Study Group, Korea ; and 3 Pediatrics, Pediatric Epilepsy Clinics, Severance Children's Hospital, Brain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: This study compares the cognitive and behavioral effects of topiramate with those of carbamazepine using efficacious doses of each drug when used as monotherapy in children with benign rolandic epilepsy. Methods: The study is a multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial with topiramate or carbamazepine given as first-line therapy. Topiramate is introduced at 25 mg per day. The target dosages are 50 mg per day in 30 kg > weighted patients and 75 mg or 100 mg per day in 30 kg < weight patients in 4 weeks. Carbamazepine is started at 10 mg/kg per day and the target dosage is 20 mg/kg per day in 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the difference between the treatments (topiramate versus carbamazepine) in change of the cognitive and behavioral function from baseline to end point (after 28 weeks of treatment), using a 95% confidence interval approach. Results: For the 22 baseline-to-end point cognitive and the 13 baseline-to-end point behavioral comparisons, one test measuring Verbal Intelligence Quotient yields a statistically significant difference between the treatments (p = 0.019), showing worsening for topiramate and improvement of scores for carbamazepine and one additional test also shows a statistically significant difference, again for a test measuring arithematics (p = 0.043), showing a larger change in the negative direction for topiramate. None of the behavioral tests shows statistically significant differences between the treatments. However, integrated functions, verbal comprehension factor including information, similarities, vocabulary and comprehension as well as attention and concentration including arithmetics, digital span and coding do not show statistically significant differences between the treatments, although those scores are in the negative direction for topiramate. Conclusions: Although the pattern of changes in the negative direction seems consistent with clinical information, the differences found between the treatments are small. An important finding of our study is that the differences between two treatments are compensated in the integrated functions. (Supported by JANSSEN, KOREA LIMITED, a Johnson  and 2 Department of Pediatrics, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sanggyepaik Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: The objectives of this study were to investigate the proportion of abnormal endoscopic lesions in intractable epilepsy children prior to KD and to reveal their relationship to patient's dietary tolerability and to know how to increase tolerability of KD in patients with abnormal endoscopic lesions. Methods: Thirty-five patients were enrolled in this study at the Epilepsy Center, Sanggye Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, from March 2002 to August 2003. Informed consents were obtained from their parents of all the patients. Gastrofiberscopy were done to all patients prior to initiation of KD. Patients with abnormal endoscopic lesions were treated with H2 receptor blocker, proton pump inhibitor, and/or prokinetics for initial 4 weeks of the KD. We observed the incidence of G-I disturbance symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, unusual irritability or cramping abdominal pain, and diet refusal for over a day in patients with abnormal endoscopic findings, as compared with the patients without such G-I lesions. We also observed the proportion of patients who showed improvement on tolerability after the active G-I medications. Results: Of the 35 patients in this study, 18 were boys and 17 were girls. The mean (±SD) age of the patients at the beginning of the diet was 62.9 (±42.5) months. Various kinds of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes were subjected for this study including infantile spasm and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Polypharmacy with more than 4 AEDs were used in 14 patients. Sixteen patients were treated with prednisolone for more than 1 month. Twenty patients (57%) revealed abnormal endoscopic lesions, showing 10 cases of erosive gastritis, 4 duodenitis, 3 hemorrhagic gastritis, 2 esophagitis, and 1 duodenal ulcer. The incidences of abnormal endoscopic lesions were higher by 78% (11/14) in polypharmacy group, and 81% (13/16) in steroid consumers. Symptoms from G-I disturbance such as nausea, vomiting, unusual irritability or cramping abdominal pain, and diet refusal for over a day, were complicated in 17 cases (85.0%) in patients with positive endoscopic lesions, and in 5 case (33.3%) in patients without endoscopic lesions. After the active management with G-I medications, G-I disturbing symptoms were subsided in most cases, except a patients who were discontinued KD from the intolerability. Conclusions: G-I disturbing symptoms were more frequently associated in patients with positive abnormal endoscopic lesions. Active management with G-I medications could increase tolerability of KD in patients treated with multiple AEDs and steroids. 1 Emily T. Klatte, 1,2 Juliann M. Paolicchi, 1 Sheri L. Hart, and 2,3 Debbie Terry ( 1 Neurology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; 2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH ; and 3 Nursing, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ) Rationale: Treatment of Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (BRE), which is 15% of childhood epilepsy, is not standardized, and typically, balances benefit and medication toxicity. Data has suggested that BRE patients can suffer neuropsychiatric deficits. This study examined treatment trends, cognitive/behavioral issues, and factors predictive of neuropsychiatric problems. Methods: From 9/04?4/06, 55 patients met BRE clinical and electrographic criteria at our institution. Medical charts were reviewed for demographics and cognitive and behavioral issues. Statistical analysis included Chi Square and Somers'd. Results: Mean patient age was 6 years (2?13), 69% male. Neuroimaging was performed in 89% of subjects; 12 (24.5%) were abnormal. The average number of ER visits per subject for seizures was 1.2 (0?5). 16 (29%) required admissions: seizures (10), status (2), or long term monitoring (6). EEG findings demonstrated that 25.5% had left, 18% right, and 55% bilateral discharges. 10 (18%) had additional EEG findings, including occipital and generalized discharges. 17(30%) were not treated with AEDs. Subjects averaged 3.6 seizures (1?15) prior to initiation of treatment. Of the 38 treated, the majority were on oxcarbamazepine (14) or carbamazepine (17). 15 subjects required a change in AEDs due to seizures or side effects, and 2 were treated with 2 AEDs. Seizure frequency varied from 1 to >20 seizures; 41% had >10 seizures. 33(60%) reported comorbidities (may be more than 1 reported): 11(20%) headaches, 15(27.3%) language difficulties, 22(40%) trouble in school, 26(43.6%) behavioral problems, 18(32.7%) attention problems, 11(20%) ADHD, and 7(12.8%) other psychiatric diagnosis. Problems in school and bilateral discharges on EEG were statistically significant (p < 0.025), but the side of discharge was not. No association existed between discharge location and language, behavior, attention, or ADHD. Of the 55 subjects, 11 (20%) had low seizure frequency (defined as 1?2 seizures), 22 (40%) medium (3?9), and 22 (40%) high (≤10). There was a significant association of higher seizure frequency and reported trouble in school (p < 0.002), ADHD (p < 0.015), attentional problems (p < 0.025), and language problems (p < 0.028). There was no association between seizure frequency and behavior or discharge location. Conclusions: BRE is less ?benign? than historically considered. Comorbidities are present in 60% of patients, the most common are behavioral problems, trouble in school, and attention impairments. The presence of bilateral EEG discharges is a significant risk factor for trouble in school. Children with high seizure frequency have an increased risk of having trouble in school, attention problems, ADHD, and language problems. Children with BRE, whether AEDs are indicated or not, should be screened for possible cognitive, behavioral, and learning disabilities. 1 Elisabeth Korn-Merker, and 1 Heilwig Fischbach ( 1 Klinik Kidron, Epilepsy Center Bethel, EvKB, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany ) Rationale: Psychogenic seizures (PS) often are underdiagnosed?especially in epileptic patients.We report about 31 adolescents referred to our epilepsy center for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. We present clinical features, EEG findings, precipitants for PS, comorbidities and treatment results. Methods: 25 girls and 6 boys (aged from 12 to 23 years) with PS were identified from our inpatient records in 2003?2005. Admission diagnosis was difficult to treat epilepsy and multiple pharmacoresitance. In nearly all of them PS were not suspected. All patients had routinely EEG with sleep, hyperventilation and photostimulation. 2/3 had Video-EEG too, MRI only those with focal EEG findings. Seizures and clinical events were observed and documented (video too) by nurses and allied staff, followed by classification as epileptic or nonepileptic. Precipitating neurologic comorbidities and psychiatric diagnosis were analysed as well as the short term impact of psychotherapeutic measures. Results: 17 patients had an active epilepsy too (9 focal, 7 generalized, 1 with focal and generalized signs). 18 patients were mentally handycapped, 9 had a positive familiy history of epilepsy. Clinically PS were clearly different from epileptic seizures and frequently dramatic. Common precipitating factors were school failure, anxiety disorder, sexual abuse and intrafamilial conflicts. A clinical setting structured by a multiprofessional team helped patients to identfy stressors, gain insight into their emotional reactions and develop coping skills (supportive milieu therapy). All patients had a significant reduction of PS. 2 were ?seizure free? on discharge and 9 after 22 months, all of them continouing psychotherapy post discharge for 6 months minimum. Conclusions: Establishing a correct diagnosis is a vital step for treating PS in adolescents. Identification of stressors and early multidisciplinary stabilization yields good long term results for control of PS. Coaching the whole familiy to increase motivation for psychotherapy after discharge ameliorates the rate of seizure freedom. 1 Florise A. Lambrechsten, and 2 Jeffrey R. Buchhalter ( 1 Rijksuniversiteit Groningen  and 2 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Relatively little data exists regarding refractory status epilepticus (RSE) in children. We aimed to determine: (i) the frequency of RSE in children, (ii) factors associated with the development of RSE, and (iii) predictors of outcome in children with RSE. Methods: Patients less than 18-years-old, hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 1994?2004, were included. Medical records with an ICD-9 diagnostic code of status epilepticus (SE) (345.3 and 345.2), epilepsy partialis continua (345.7), petit mal status (345.2), or grand mal status (345.3) were reviewed. In addition we reviewed EEG lab admission logs for diagnoses of SE. The study was IRB approved. Univariate analysis and Cox's-proportional hazards models were used for statistical analysis. Results: We identified 178 children with possible SE, 24 of which were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria or had incomplete data. Of the remaining 154 children with SE, 60 (39.0%) had RSE and 94 (61%) had non-RSE. In the RSE group, 13 children (21.7%) had a family history of seizures compared to 3 children (3.2%) in the non-RSE group (p < 0.001). A previous diagnosis of epilepsy was present in 44 children (73.3%) with RSE and in 67 children (71.2%) with non-RSE. Children with RSE and a diagnosis of epilepsy used a significantly higher number of anti-epileptic drugs (AED's) prior to the prolonged seizure episode than children with non-RSE (5 vs. 3 AED's; P < 0.001) and had a significantly higher seizure frequency score (8.53 vs 6.34; P < 0.001). Clinical factors associated with the development of RSE were non-convulsive SE and focal motor seizures at onset. Etiologies did not differ significantly between RSE and non-RSE. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.89 years (range 0.8?12.2 years). Ten children (6.5%) died during hospitalization and 9 (5.8%) during follow-up. Overall mortality was significantly higher in the RSE group (20%) than in the non-RSE group (7.4%; p = 0.021). Survivors with RSE had a higher risk for developing new neurological deficits (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.5?3.9; P < 0.001). This risk was lower if age at admission was >10 years compared to < 4 years (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.3?1.0; P= 0.05). At 4 years after dismissal, 30% of children with RSE developed epilepsy compared to 10% of children with non-RSE. This was associated with an acute symptomatic etiology (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.2?5.0, P 0.02). Conclusions: Factors associated with RSE were identified: positive family history of seizures and in cases of diagnosed epilepsy, higher seizure frequency and number of previously used AED's. Clinical factors associated with RSE were non-convulsive SE and focal motor seizures at onset. Further studies are needed to determine if more aggressive treatment strategies in children with SE at risk for developing RSE can improve outcome, particularly in those with younger age at admission and acute symptomatic etiology.

FTD varies from a linear band to an entirely malformed lobe and probably associated with maldifferentiation of the stem cells generated in the germinal zone. FTD was first described in 1997 and seen in 4% of MCDs in childhood. FTD usually occurs as an isolated finding although has rarely been reported in neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex. There has been no report of FTD caused by prenatal vascular insult (PVI). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, EEG, and neuroimages of 3 patients with FTD caused by PVI, 2 from intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and 1 from cerebral ischemia. 1 patient underwent epilepsy surgery. Results: Patient 1 is a 6-year-old-left-handed-twin B girl who was born at 28 weeks GA with IVH grade 4 and required ventilator supports for 3 months. She had multiple types of seizures including myoclonic, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and asymmetric tonic seizures. Four MRI scans were interpreted as ischemic injury in the left frontal region. FTD was diagnosed during presurgical evaluation. EEG showed epileptic focus in the left frontal and frontal vertex regions. Ictal SPECT showed left mesial frontal hyperperfusion. Resection of FTD and epileptogenic zone after subdural EEG implantation led to seizure free. Pathology revealed focal cortical dysplasia. Patient 2 is a 23-month-old-left handed girl who was born at 24 weeks GA. She had fetal distress due to abruption placenta with subsequent global developmental delay (GDD) and one seizure described as right-sided clonic jerks at age 23 months. MRI was interpreted as periventricular nodular heterotopias but apparently it was FTD in the left frontal region. Her seizure has been well controlled with oxcarbazepine. Patient 3 is a 14-year-old-right-handed girl who was born at 36 weeks GA to a mother who had severe hyperemesis requiring total parenteral nutrition at 15 weeks GA. The patient had GDD, ADHD, severe left hemiparesis, and focal epilepsy. MRI showed extensive polymicrogyria in the right fronto-centro-temporal and FTD in the right frontal region. She was found having electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES). Her cognition improves dramatically with diazepam. Conclusions: Our report suggests that PVI, either ischemia or hemorrhage, can cause FTD. FTD is probably underrecognizable as it is a relatively new type of MCD and can have varieties of clinical courses. This report may help neurologists to expand the scope and better understand the pathophysiology of FTD and to be more aware of this condition. Adequate treatment of PVI may prevent the development of FTD. 1 Jeehun Lee, 2 Dae Won Seo, 2 Seung Bong Hong, 3 Seung Chul Hong, 4 Yeon Lim Suh, and 1 Munhyang Lee ( 1 Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; 2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; 3 Neurosurgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 4 Pathology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are often associated with medically intractable epilepsy in childhood, but also with favorable outcome after epilepsy surgery. Aim of this study is to delineate the clinical characteristics of DNTs and to find an adequate method of epilepsy surgery of DNTs in childhood. Methods: A retrospective analysis was done on the clinical, pathologic, and radiological data of 19 patients, who were presented with seizure and had been found to have DNTs after surgery, between Jan 1996 and April 2005. Epilepsy surgery was performed using intraoperative electrocorticography or subdural electrodes in all patients except one. Results: Mean follow-up duration after surgery was 28 months. Of the 19 patients (mean age at surgery 12 year 6 months), All patients showed a favorable outcome (class I?18, class II?1). Temporal lobe was the most frequent site of tumor involvement (15 cases). All the lesions showing active epileptogenicity were resected with the tumor. There was associated cortical dysplasia (CD) on pathology of the resected lesion besides tumor in 12 cases. Conclusions: We found that the DNT was frequently associated with CD and the active epileptogenic lesions were associated with CD. So the precise presurgical localization of epileptic focus, perioperative brain mapping, and radical resection of the epileptogenic lesion including tumor would be the essential requirement for the favorable surgical outcome in childhood DNTs. 1 Young Mock Lee, 1 Joo Hee Seo, 2 Hoon Chul Kang, 1 Joon Soo Lee, and 1 Heung Dong Kim ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Handicapped Children, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; and 2 Department of Pediatrics, Inje University College of Medicine, Sang-gye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: This study aimed to characterize clinical and laboratory features in children with epilepsy diagnosed as mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes (MRC) defects and to provide newly postulated etiology in various epileptic condition. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory features of 21 patients with epilepsy who showed defects in MRC activity, confirmed by biochemical assay from spectrophotometry in muscle tissue. Results: 1) Mean age was 5.63 ± 3.49 years and sex ratio was 1:1.1. 2) Fourteen (66.7%) were MRC I deficiency, 5 (23.8%) of VI deficiency, 1 (4.8%) of II deficiency, and 1 case of combined deficiency of I and IV. 3) Four cases (19.0%) were classified as Leigh syndrome, 1 case (4.8%) each as MELAS and Alpers disease, but 15 cases (71.4%) were not clinically categorized for specific disease criteria. 4) Epileptic diagnoses included generalized seizure disorders in 7 cases (33.3%), partial seizure disorders in 4 cases (19.0%), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 6 cases (28.6%) and infantile spasm in 4 cases (19.0%). 5) Mean seizure onset age was 2.34 ± 2.20 years. 6) Brain MRI showed diffuse cortical atrophy in 15 (71.4%), basal ganglia signal changes in 8 (38.1%) and thalamus sinal changes in 6 cases (28.6%). 7) Positive rate for laboratory studies were: 90.5% in lactic acidosis, 72.2% in urine organic acid assay, 29.4% in serum amino acid assay, and 53.3% in MR spectroscopy. 8) Mitochondrial cocktail with coenzyme Q10 and multi-vitamin therapy showed clinical improvements in 71.4% of patients. Conclusions: MRC defect can be the important cause of epilepsy. Treatments with coenzyme and multi-vitamine have shown considerable benefits. 1 Paul M. Levisohn, 2 Samuel M. Shirk, 3 Ken R. Winston, and 1 Lisa M. Gustas ( 1 Pediatrics and Neurology, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO ; 2 Neurology and Neurodiagnostics, The Children's Hospital, Denver, CO ; and 3 Neurosurgery, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: Intermittent stimulation of the left vagus nerve is an approved adjunctive therapy for medically intractable partial onset epilepsy in children 12 years and older. Management of children less than 12 years of age with intractable epilepsy, particularly those with epileptic encephalopathies remains challenging despite the availability of new drugs. This study reports outcomes on 100 patients, aged 2?22 at implantation, including 56 ? < 12? between 1/98 and 4/06. Methods: Data were gathered using retrospective chart review. Variables included seizure frequency at the surgical visit, seizure frequency at 12 month follow-up, seizure frequency at 24 month follow-up, and seizure frequency at last visit. Frequencies were recorded as number per week, and were extrapolated from records in the patient's chart. We documented prior number of medications and post number of medications. Post operative complications were noted. Results: The average age at implantation was 10.6 years (SD = 4.9). The average reduction of seizures was 45% (SD = 40); percent reduction was defined as 100*(1- number of post seizures/number of prior seizures). 14 patients were lost to follow-up. 33 patients had incomplete data and were excluded from this calculation. 15 patients had >89% seizure reduction; 3 became seizure-free with VNS, 1 post resection. We also devised a qualitative improvement rating scale: significant improvement (70% reduction or greater), moderate improvement (1?69% reduction), no improvement (0%). 26/77 had significant, 18/77 had moderate, and 33/77 had no improvement (9 had incomplete data). An analysis of medication reduction showed no decrease. We saw no difference between the < 12 age group and the >12 group. Percent reduction showed no difference (42%,SD = 41: 46%, SD = 39). In the < 12, 13/41 had significant, 10/41 had moderate, 18/41 had no improvement. In the >12, 13/36 had significant, 8/36 had moderate, 15/36 had no improvement. 5 ?>12? and 9 ? < 12? were lost to follow-up. 28 ? < 12? were treated with the ketogenic diet, compared to 14 ?>12?. 6 patients had their VNS removed (3 due to infection), 6 stimulators were replaced. 5 patients had post-implant callosotomies (all < 12 group). 2 patients died, one from failure to thrive, one from status epilepticus. Conclusions: VNS has efficacy in children under age 12 years with generalized epilepsies. Although clearly not a cure or a sole therapy for most patients, our data support the position that VNS is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for pharmacoresistant epilepsy in children < 12 years of age. We observed no difference in the efficacy and outcomes of children < 12 treated with VNS when compared to the >12 group. 1,2 Yeou-mei Christiana Liu, 2 Amy Haw, 2 Kent Campbell, 1,2 Jeff Kobayashi, 1 Elizabeth J. Donner, 2 Olivia Lugue, 2 Susan Cohen, and 1 Rosalind Curtis ( 1 Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ; and 2 Child Development Program, Bloorview Kids Rehab, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: The objective of this study is to assess the long term growth and lipid status of children treated with the classic and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diets. There are 5 articles that reported ketogenic diet patients' growth status and only one with short term prospective growth status, but there is no long-term prospective study that examines the children's growth and lipid status. Methods: A prospective, nonrandomized study design was used to measure growth and lipid status of children, age 1 to 16 years (mean = 5.9 ± 3.7), with intractable epilepsy before and after 12 months treatment with the classic or MCT ketogenic diet. None of the children had been on earlier dietary regimens. Forty-eight consents were obtained between January, 2000 and May 2005. Thirty-three children were on the classic diet and fifteen children were on the MCT diet. Paired t tests were done on weight percentile, height percentile, percentage of ideal body weight (IBW), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides (TG). Results: Thirty-two children completed 12 months on the ketogenic diet. Percentile heights, weights and percentage of IBW at 12 months follow-up were compared to pre-diet data. In the classic diet group (n = 21), the percentile heights and weights were significantly changed from the baseline measurements (p < 0.05). Mean weight percentile was decreased by 5.2 and height percentile decreased by 10.7. There was no significant change in percentage of IBW. In MCT diet group (n = 11), the mean percentile height was significantly lower than baseline measurement (p < 0.05) with a 17 percentile reduction. The percentile weights and percentage of IBW in the MCT diet group showed no significant change. Both diets treatments resulted in height growth retardation. Only the classic diet group demonstrated weight growth retardation. For both diet groups, there was no significant increase in total cholesterol, LDL and TG at 12 months of diet when compared with their pre-diet measurements. With intensive follow-up of biochemical indexes and elevated levels corrected with polyunsaturated fat intake for both the classic and MCT diet, it appears children are able to maintain a healthy lipid level. Conclusions: Both the classic and MCT ketogenic diets result in significant height growth retardation in children at 12 months follow-up. Only the classic ketogenic diet is associated with a significant weight growth retardation. The MCT diet does not have a negative effect on weight growth. Neither diet treatment produced an increased lipid level at 12 months follow-up. Eighteen and twenty-four months data are in the preliminary analysis to be concluded in the near future. 1 Paul Maertens, 1 Renay Drinkard, and 2 Eyal Fabien ( 1 Neurology, Unversity of South Alabama, Mobile, AL ; and 2 Pediatrics, Unversity of South Alabama, Mobile, AL ) Rationale: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam monotherapy in neonates with acute stroke. Methods: This is a single center open-label study of 3 neonates (less than 24 hour of age). In all cases, focal seizures were confirmed by EEG. The focal seizures were in all three children the result of an acute perinatal stroke (non hemorrhagic in 2; hemorrhagic in one). A loading dose of 50 mg/kg of levetiracetam was administered through a nasogastric tube while children were actively seizing and only benzodiazepines were given concomitantly. Seizure control and side effects were monitored while on once a day dosing. Results: No patient stopped levetiracetam due to side effect or lack of efficacy. No other anticonvulsant had to be added to the regimen to maintain seizure control. Feeding difficulties were initially seen but cleared after a few days. Levetiracetam level was still high twelve hours after the first dose (50 mcg/dL in one child). No other adverse event was observed. All three patients were left without neurological sequellae and the follow-up imaging studies in our patients with acute brain injury showed a complete resolution of their lesion. Conclusions: Levetiracetam given once a day in neonates is well tolerated. We believe that, in neonates with acute stroke, levetiracetam has neuroprotective properties explaining the complete recovery of our patients. 1 Yu-tze Ng, and 2 Rama K. Maganti ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute/St. Joseph's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: To describe a possibly new variant of childhood idiopathic localization-related epilepsy. Methods: Seven children were reviewed in consultation who presented with similar clinical histories of distinctive, partial-onset seizures. Typically their seizures would begin as simple partial seizures involving one of their feet and/or lower limb and often progress to secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. These patients were studied prospectively and their charts reviewed in detail. Results: All patients were cognitively and neurologically normal. Their average age of first seizure was 10.4 (range 4?13) years. There were four girls. Although six patients had a total of less than 20 seizures, one patient had had about 500 seizures. A typical history involved the patient being fully aware of sensory (burning/tingling) changes involving one foot and/or shaking of that limb before secondary generalization either immediately following or with independant generalized tonic-clonic seizures. All patients underwent brain MRI scans (five on the 3-Tesla machine) which were all normal. All patients also had at least one EEG. All were normal or had normal background. Two patients showed generalized spike wave epileptiform discharges (one with left temporal also) consistent with an idiopathic epilepsy. All patients are currently doing well. Conclusions: These seven patients appear to be have consistent histories of localization-related epilepsy beginning with simple partial seizures involving one foot/lower limb. Their normal cognition and investigations as well as two ?positive? EEGs and excellent prognoses would suggest that this may be a new, childhood idiopathic localization-related epilepsy.

Methods: The study presents a cohort design. Patients served as their own control. Measurements are taken before (baseline) and during treatment with VNS. Nineteen children are included with refractory epilepsy; they are not eligible for resective surgery. Data are collected for a period of thirty months. A sensitivity analysis is carried out. Results: The response rate of the cost diary was 95.74%. Within the category ?healthcare costs,? the costs are significantly lower during the treatment with VNS in comparison with usual care costs. The total costs of the intervention are ?11.576 for each patient. The seizure diary response rate was 100%. The number of seizures is significantly lower and dropped to an average of 422 per month, a decrease of more than 17%. The cost-effectiveness ratio is 127. The results of this study show that the additional costs of the intervention are recuperated within 15 months. The results of the sensitivity analysis shows that the individual cost items have a marginal influence on the cost-effectiveness ratio. Conclusions: The incremental cost effectiveness is expressed in a cost effectiveness ratio. This ratio is 127 which means that any suppressed seizure will cost ?127,?when resulting from VNS. If the one time investment of ?11.576,?(the total costs of the intervention) is divided by the cost reduction (?764,?per month), the additional costs of the intervention will be recuperated within 15 months. On the long run, the costs of VNS in children with therapy resistant epilepsy are lower as compared to the costs of usual care.

Wilfong ( 1 Baylor College of Medicine Department of Neurology, Texas Childrens Hospital, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Reflex epilepsy is defined as seizures that are objectively and consistently evoked by a specific afferent stimulus or by activity of the patient. The afferent stimuli or activity may be elementary or elaborate[1]. Reflex seizures can be characterized by either focal or generalized seizures seizures. They are classified according to the precipitating stimuli[2]. The commonest form of reflex epilepsy is seizures triggered by flickering light. However, numerous other triggers have been described including visual stimuli, flickering light, patterns, thinking, praxis, reading, somatosensory, eating, music, and startle. The prevalence is unknown but felt to be rare. We describe two patients with symptomatic epilepsy with seizures induced by eating with a spoon. Methods: Through the comprehensive epilepsy clinic, two patients were identified with reflex epilespy with a stimuli being a spoon. They were an 11 year-old left-handed male with a chromosome 15 duplication and MRI findings of frontoparietal periventricular white matter lesions and a 5 year-old right-handed male with lissencephaly type I. Results: One patient had EEG/video monitoring performed and revealed a seizure from the left central region while being fed with a spoon. Conclusions: Eating epilepsy is characterized by seizures closely related to one or several actions of eating, and the triggers are specific and stereotyped for each patient. The seizures are typically focal motor seizures and almost always related to a symptomatic epilepsy. The epileptiform activity seen on EEG is typically localized to temporolimbic structures or suprasylvian regions. Generalized EEG activity is rare. Many patients have seizures activated by combinations of stimuli. Patients with suprasylvian lesions may be triggered by other oral activities induced by proprioceptive or by somatosenosory stimulation. These patients are, also, more likely to report that they prevent seizures by altering the characteristics of the stimulus. [3] These two patients have a form of relex epilepsy induced by a combination of eating and the use of a spoon. Both had rapid habituation with only a transient reduction in seizures following a change in feeding utensils. Alteration of the stimulus did decrease the frequency of the events but only transiently. One patient with video EEG monitoring revealed a focal seizure onset. They are both poorly controlled with underlying symptomatic etiologies. 1 Warren T. Blume?Chair, Hans O.

Wagih, and 3 Dorria Salem ( 1 Pediatric ; 2 Nuclear Medicine ; and 3 Radiodiagnosis, Cairo University ) Rationale: Intractable epilepsy is defined as the persistence of seizures despite adequate trial of antiepileptic drugs with a minimum of two first line drugs either as monotherapy or in combination as appropriate to the epileptic syndrome. Rationale of the study: The aim of this work is to assess the role of ictal and interictal SPECT in evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy  storage Weber S. (2), tuberous sclerosis (2) and NFI (1). It was found that in group A, the EEG was sensitive in detecting abnormalities in 78.2%, MRI in 39.1%, intercital SPECT in 56.5% While in group B, EEG was diagnostic in 75%, MRI in 81.2% and interictal SPECT in 87.5%. Ictal SPECT (13 cases) was localizing in 69.2%, interictal SPECT in 38.5%, MRI in 30.7% and EEG in 23.1%. Ictal SPECT was diagnostic and localizing in 4 of 8 cases (50%) in whom MRI was normal. Conclusions: Ictal SPECT was the most sensitive modality in detecting abnormalities in 76.9% compared to 69.2%, 38.5% and 46.2 with EEG, MRI and interical SPECT respectively.

Methods: The FebSTAT study includes 5500 data elements. Included are demographics, neuropsychological scoring, MRI structural analysis, EEG clinical assessment, virology, genetics, medications, seizure start and stop, continuous intermittent seizure type and follow up data. A relational database allowing entry tracking and data reporting was designed utilizing enterprise database software residing on a Dell PowerEdge 350 server. Over 150 entity- relationship tables address form data and samples including error and submission tracking. All data transmissions were HIPAA compliant. Archiving and backups of the complete database are performed nightly. Results: The system promotes efficiency of personnel via the automation of tasks such as form, sample, and data error tracking. Status of data transmission and receipt can be viewed by the investigators and study coordinators. The system eliminates the need of personnel to manually re-query outstanding data by using programmatic means (SQL) to re-query on a preset schedule. The database reflects the most recent updates of information at all times, rather than obsolete or older data which can result from the manual entry of data updates by personnel. The system is capable of performing analysis to find trends such as persistently missed questions, study center performance and CRF design problems The query system for quality control has resulted in 0.30% error rate and of 2441 queries, only 53 (2.0%) remain unresolved. Conclusions: Despite the large number of variables, the FebSTAT database optimized for this study was achievable and allows easy access for analysis and study by the FebSTAT Investigators.

Feltbower ( 1 Leeds Medical School, Leeds University, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom ; 2 Paediatric Neurology, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom ; and 3 Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Leeds, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom ) Rationale: There is little published data on the expected duration of depressed consciousness following epileptic seizures. A previous study from our group found that median recovery time in children from epileptic seizures involving impaired consciousness was 43 minutes, with febrile seizures recovering more quickly (median 15 minutes). There was a trend for recovery time following symptomatic seizures to be longer than that following idiopathic and febrile seizures, but patient numbers were too small to demonstrate this conclusively. This paediatric prospective cohort study investigates recovery time following symptomatic seizures, compared to those of other aetiologies. Methods: Children aged 1?16 years presenting to two Accident and Emergency departments and paediatric wards in Leeds hospitals (United Kingdom), suffering a witnessed seizure in which consciousness was impaired, were studied. Hourly coma scores were performed, using the Modified Paediatric Coma Scale, until a score of 15 was reached. Seizures were classified as febrile, idiopathic, remote and acute symptomatic. Factors which affect recovery time were investigated using the Poisson Regression model (p < 0.05). Results: Data from 99 seizures suffered by 75 children (33 males) was obtained. Seizures were classified as: acute symptomatic seizures (n = 26); remote symptomatic (n = 49); and idiopathic (n = 24). Recovery in hours was significantly prolonged in those children (n = 40) receiving emergency antiepileptic medication, 4.66 ± 1.64?9.21 (median hours ± interquartile range) versus 1.0 ± 0.3?2.0 in those (n = 59) not receiving medication (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11?1.68, p = 0.003). Acute symptomatic seizures took longer to recover (1.94 ± 0.2?9.12) than those of other aetiologies (remote symptomatic 1.5 ± 0.92?6.31, idiopathic 0.83 ± 0.3?2.68). When acute symptomatic seizures were compared with data for febrile seizures from our previous study (n = 59), recovery was significantly longer (0.3 ± 0.15?0.7, 95% CI 0.46?0.95, p = 0.024). Acute symptomatic seizures occurring in children with prior neurological abnormalities (acute on remote) took longer to recover than all other groups (4.0 ± 0.89?10.5). Age, sex, type and duration of seizure had no affect on recovery time. Conclusions: Symptomatic seizures take longer to recover than seizures of other aetiologies, particularly febrile seizures. The ?acute on remote? group has not been previously identified and warrants further investigation. It is recommended that a child who presents with a seizure and a fever, who has not fully recovered within 1 hour, should be investigated for an acute symptomatic aetiology. 1 Sabiha Merchant, 2 Cynthia Harden, 3 Ronald G.

The present study assesses EEG abnormalities before and 2 wk after therapy. Methods: Five subjects (2 female, 3 male, ages 3.5 to 6 yr, median 5.5) underwent direct CNS administration (2 ? 1012 particle units) of AAV2CUhCLN2 through 6 burr holes. Sixteen channel video-EEG recording was performed for 24 hours: 4 days prior to treatment and 14 days after treatment. Quantitative spike analysis was performed during wakefulness for 1 hr of each video-EEG study by 2 readers unblinded as to treatment status. All subjects had a history of generalized convulsions. Results: The initial EEGs showed generalized moderate to high amplitude spike and wave discharges with maximum amplitude occipitally. The background was characterized by diffuse 3?5 Hz rhythmic activity. Features of normal sleep patterns were generally preserved. No patients had electrographic seizures while on monitoring. This EEG background did not change significantly when assessed 2 wk post-gene therapy. The mean spike frequency over 1 hr in 5 subjects prior to gene therapy was 56.6 ± 15.5 (SD) and the mean spike frequency 2 wk after gene therapy was 38.8 ± 16.7 (SD; paired samples t-test p = 0.006). Conclusions: Initial evaluation of the effect of AAV2CUhCLN2 on EEGs as assessed by quantitative spike analysis suggests a decrease of epileptiform discharges 14 days post-vector administration. Longer follow-up for assessment of the impact of gene therapy on clinical seizure occurrence is underway. (Supported by Nathan's Battle Foundation, Greenwood, Indiana.) 1 Avani C. Modi, and 2 Tracy A. Glauser ( 1 Pediatrics ? Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Pediatrics ? Division of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Adherence to medical regimens is a significant problem for children with chronic illnesses and their families. The average estimate of non-adherence is 50% to long-term treatments. Non-adherence estimates in pediatric epilepsy range from 14 to 43% based on the measurement method (e.g., self-report, blood levels). However, these methods have proven to be unreliable compared to more objective electronic monitoring methods. The purpose of the current study was to document the course of adherence using MicroElectronic Monitoring System (MEMS) for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: Data collection is ongoing and to date, participants include six children with new-onset epilepsy (M = 8.1 years; 50% females, 50% African American/33% Caucasian/17% Biracial) and their parents. Children were diagnosed with partial (50%), absence (33%), and non-absence generalized (17%) epilepsy. Parents were asked to use the MEMS TrackCaps to assess daily medication taking to either carbamazepine or valproic acid. Results: Preliminary data regarding one-month adherence indicated that ?taking compliance? (number of doses taken/number of doses prescribed) ranged from 84.8 ? 100% (M = 93%). Patients were adherent to their medications on 87.8% of days. Patients who were 90% adherent or higher appeared to have only 1?2 seizures after initiation of medication compared to patients who had multiple seizures with adherence rates lower than 90%. Longitudinal data over a 7-month period will also be presented. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that one-month adherence rates for children with new-onset epilepsy, using an objective method of measurement, are significantly higher than what has previously been reported in the pediatric literature. Understanding the longitudinal course of adherence over time is important because it is likely that adherence rates will decrease over time. One important area of future research is to assess adherence and barriers to effective disease management for children with epilepsy in a longitudinal, systematic manner.

Perlman, 1 Maurine A. Packard, and 1 Gail E. Solomon ( 1 Child Neurology, New York Presbyterian Hospital ? Cornell, New York, NY ; and 2 Neonatology, New York Presbyterian Hospital ? Cornell, New York, NY ) Rationale: Intracranial hemorrhage is the cause of neonatal seizures in 17% full term infants, and is more commonly seen following vaginal delivery assisted with forceps or vacuum extraction. However, only some infants with intracranial hemorrhage come to clinical attention. The etiology of the intracranial hemorrhage and the compartments involved determine the clinical presentation and outcome. Previous studies have identified that primary intraparenchymal hemorrhages are the site of bleeding resulting in the greatest proportion of physical and cognitive disabilities. Right temporal lobe hemorrhage and resulting apneic seizures in a full term neonate has been reported previously, but there are very few cases reported in the literature. We report 2 neonates with apneic seizures as the initial manifestation of temporal lobe hemorrhage. Methods: Retrospective record review of 2 full term male neonates with no significant perinatal complications who presented with apneic seizures and temporal lobe hemorrhage. Results:? One full term neonate presented on day 1 of life with episodes of apnea and desaturations. CT scan and MRI revealed a left temporal intraparencymal and extra-axial hemorrhage with surrounding edema and a 4mm left to right midline shift. On day 2, conjugate eye deviation to the right was associated with the apneic events requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. EEG monitoring demonstarted multiple left hemispheric seizures, which clinically corelated with apnea and rightward eye devation. Seizures resolved after phenobarbital was loaded and there were no further apeneic events. No specific etiology for the intracranial bleed could be determined on further imaging and coagulation studies. - The second neonate presented on day 1 of life with episodes of cyanosis unrelated to feeding and on day 2 had multiple episodes of apnea and desaturations requiring bagging. He appeared well between episodes. MRI demonstrated a posterior right temporal lobe hemorrhage, with an overlying subdural hematoma, as well as a right sigmoid sinus thrombosis.Evaluation for hypercoagulable states was unrevealing. A clinical diagnosis of apneic seizures was made, phenobarbital was loaded, no further apneic episodes occurred. Subsequent continuous EEG monitoring showed slowing in the right hemisphere. Conclusions: Apnea as the sole manifestation of a seizure is rare. It is important to recognize that although uncommon, full term neonates may present with apneic seizures as the initial manifestation of either left or right temporal lobe intracranial hemorrhage. Continous EEG monitoring should be considered in a full term neonate with unexplained apnea. Early detection of seizures can lead to investigation into the etiology of the hemorrhage, facilitate prompt management, which may help reduce the degree of ensuing neuro-developmenatl disablity. 1 Kathleen J. Nolan, 2 Carol S. Camfield, and 2 Peter R. Camfield ( 1 Class of 2008, Dalhousie University Medical School, Halifax, NS, Canada ; and 2 Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ) Rationale: Basic research about Dravet Syndrome proves that this severe epilepsy is related to an SCN1A gene mutation; however, the effect of this syndrome on families has not been studied. We investigated how parents cope with and care for a child with Dravet syndrome, a catastrophic epilepsy with three distinct stages. Stage 1 begins in the first year of life with repeated episodes of febrile status epilepticus. Stage 2 starts in the second year with uncontrollable seizures of multiple types, behaviour problems, and developmental stagnation or regression. Stage 3 begins in adolescence with fewer seizures and developmental stability. Mortality is 10?15%. Methods: Participants were North American parents of children with Dravet syndrome: 24 parents participated in semi-structured interviews and 17 completed ?Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability? (ICND) scales ? a validated questionnaire assessing the impact of epilepsy on families in 4 domains: epilepsy, cognition, behaviour, and physical/neurological function. Children included 11 males and 13 females aged 2?24 years (mean = 10.2 y, SD = 5.7). Results: Stage 1: Stage 1 was the most difficult stage for parents (p = 0.03). Uncertainty about the diagnosis was the primary stressor. Seizure control was rated as worst during this time. Most parents (54%) recalled no positive experiences in caring for their child, and many negative interactions with health care. Stage 2: Seizure control was reported as slightly better in Stage 2 but remained the primary stressor (p < 0.001). Developmental stagnation and severe hyperactivity emerged. Impressive negative effects were noted on parents' relationships with family (38%), friends (63%), and spouse (54%). Parents tended to report more external coping mechanisms, such as support groups, friends, and family. Stage 3: Stage 3 brought improved seizure control (p < 0.001) but decreased cognitive level and worsening behavioral problems (p < 0.03). Parents reported increased social isolation and tended to rely on internal coping mechanisms, such as religious prayer, activities outside the home, and personal education about Dravet syndrome. Respite and relief care were extremely difficult to obtain at each stage. ICND scores at each stage mirrored the findings of the interviews. Conclusions: All three stages of Dravet syndrome present specific serious challenges for parents, based on interviews and a concurrent validated questionnaire (ICND). Seizures are persistent and severe but developmental, behavioral, and sleep issues add to the stress. In the absence of truly successful medical treatment, attention needs to shift toward helping families cope. Specific emergency protocols, assistance in locating respite care, and psychological or social work intervention for families may help.

Batista ( 1 Neurology, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do RS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; and Neurology, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do RS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil ) Rationale: Sleep disturbances are a common complain among patients with epilepsy. Studies assessing the relationship between sleep and epilepsy during infancy are scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep quality in children with epilepsy. Methods: Cross sectional study where two questionnaires regarding sleep quality, were applied to children with and without epilepsy. Data about sleep characteristics and epilepsy were also collected (type of seizure, epileptic syndrome, number of seizures, use of anticonvulsant drugs). Results: In the age group of children from 2 to 6 years old, we have observed that children with epilepsy have worst sleep habits than children without epilepsy (p < 0,05). Among the epilepsy group, children having nocturnal seizures present more frequently worse sleep habits when compared to the children with daytime seizures (p < 0,04). Children who use a single AED have better sleep habits than children with polytherapy (p < 0,01). As the delay of the neuropsychomotor development was worst, the frequency of the worst sleep habits were greater (p < 0,04). Children with epilepsy presenting an Engel score equal or greater than 7 have greater frequency of worst sleep habits when compared to children with better controled seizures (p < 0,001). Children with benign epilepsies present more frequently better sleep habits when compared to children with bad prognosis epilepsy (p < 0,04). In the group of children 7 to 14 years old, patients with epilepsy have a worst sleep quality when compared to the control group. In the group of children with epilepsy, the mean score of the questionnaire in patients with daytime seizures was lower than the group with nocturnal seizures (p < 0,001). There was no significant difference for the scores of the sleep questionnaires among the types of used drugs (p = 0,13); however, the comparison between monotherapy and polytherapy showed that the group under polytherapy had a greater score in the sleep questionnaire or worse sleep quality (p < 0,001). Children with epilepsy and neuropsychomotor developmental delay have a mean sleep score greater than children with epilepsy without delay (p < 0,001). We have observed a positive correlation among high scores of sleep questionnaire and high scores of the Engel scale (p < 0,001), meaning that patients with bad seizure control have worse quality of sleep. The analyses of seizure type showed worse quality of sleep in patients with generalized seizures (p = 0,04). Patients with severe epileptic syndromes have worse quality of sleep (p < 0,001). Conclusions: Our results showed that children with epilepsy presented greater incidence of sleep problems when compared to children without epilepsy. In the group of epileptic patients we observed that night seizures, polytherapy, developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, generalized seizures, and epileptic syndromes with unfavourable outcome were predictors for worse sleep quality.

Approximately 5?10% of the patients will have medically refractory seizures. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Therapy may reduce the frequency of absence seizures in treatment-resistant patients and/or improve their quality of life. Methods: 16 patients (9 males, 7 females) were treated with adjunctive VNS Therapy for medically refractory absence seizures. All patients had the diagnosis of childhood absence epilepsy. Mean age at implantation was 8 years (± 1.30; range, 6?12 years). Absence seizures were counted at baseline using 24-hour EEG recordings. The same evaluation was repeated every 6 months after implantation during the follow-up period of 18 months. Patients were treated with an average of 1.8 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) per patient at baseline. No changes in AEDs were allowed. Results: There was a total seizure reduction of 31% after 6 months (p-value = 0.0071; paired T test), 67% after 12 months (p-value < 0.0001; paired T test) and 76% after 18 months (p-value = 0.0156; Wilcoxon's paired signed rank test). Seizure reductions ≥ 50% were observed in 38% of the patients after 6 months, in 92% after 12 months and in 88% after 18 months of treatment. Three patients (18.7%) remained seizure free, and one patient (6.2%) showed no response to VNS Therapy at 18 months. Improvement in alertness (?better? or ?much better?) was observed in 60% of the patients. Seizures became worse when stimulation stopped in one patient due to a lead break, and in two other patients due to end of battery life, with improvement after restauration of the stimulation. Conclusions: Adjunctive VNS Therapy was effective for the treatment of medically refractory absence seizures in this patient population, allowing a seizure reduction of 76% after 18 months. The percentage of patients showing seizure reductions increased over the 18 months of treatment. Alertness improved in 60% of the patients. These results are encouraging and worth further investigation. 1 Jorge G. Burneo, 1 Asuri N. Prasad, 2 Bradley Corbett, and 3 Xuelian Sang ( 1 Epilepsy Programme, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ; 2 Research Data Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ; and 3 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Epidemiological studies of childhood epilepsy are of importance to compare incidence and prevalence rates, age distribution, inheritance, seizure types, epilepsy syndromes and treatment strategies. Few data exist on the frequency and burden of childhood epilepsy in Canada and on the impact of childhood epilepsy in the general population. We assess the point prevalence of childhood epilepsy in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two cycles of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY, N = 17,832 for cycle 2, and N = 27,668 for cycle 2). Each cycle was done over a 2-year period (cycle 2: 1996?1997, cycle 3: 1998?1999). The NLSCY captured, in a longitudinal manner, sociodemographic information, as well as age, sex, education, ethnicity, household income, and labor force status of participants since birth to 11 years old. The presence of epilepsy was probed by the use of specific questions in the survey. In the survey the following specific question was asked of the person most knowledgeable in the household. The answers were refered to conditions that have lasted or are expected to last 6 months or more. Does any of the children in the house have any of the following long-term conditions that have been diagnosed by a health professional? The list of responses included ?Epilepsy? and certain comorbid conditions (Allergies? Bronchitis? Heart condition or disease? Cerebral Palsy? Kidney Condition or disease? Mental handicap?). In addition, a subsequent question identified whether the condition was treated by means of a specific anticonvulsant medication.(Anticonvulsants or anti-epileptic pills?). Prevalence was age-adjusted by using national standard populations at the time of each survey. Results: In cycle 2, 35 of 17,832 subjects were described to have the diagnosis of epilepsy, yielding a weighted point prevalence of 3.67 per 1,000. In cycle 3, 59 of 27,668 children were described as having epilepsy, yielding a weighted point prevalence of 3.59 per 1,000. Relatively small sample sizes in the individual cycles precluded the calculation of rates stratifed by age, sex and socioeconomic variables. Conclusions: The overall results are in keeping with those obtained in other developed countries by using different ascertainment methods. We discuss methodologic aspects related to the ascertainment of epilepsy in both surveys, and to the validity and implications of our findings.

An Asymmetry Index (AI) for anterior and posterior language areas was calculated (AI =?0.1 ?+0.1; mixed dominance). Results: 9/13 children with left hemisphere (LH) seizure focus (SF) (Group A) and 4/7 with R-hemisphere (RH) focus (Group B) had bilateral language activation. 6 children (46%) in group A had RH dominance; mean anterior AI +0.67, mean posterior AI +0.34 (p = 0.25). No children in group B had RH dominance. Mean posterior AI in group A did not statistically differ from the mean posterior AI in group B (p = 0.26). Neither age of epilepsy onset or pathology affected AI. Conclusions: Bilateral language activation was seen irrespective of the side of SF; however, only children with L-SF had RH dominance. Posterior language area shifted more frequently than anterior area. Thus, while atypical patterns of language activity are common in this group of RH children with refractory epilepsy, true RH dominance was only seen in the presence of a left SF. 1 V. Reed, 1 M. Brunner, 1 R. Sälke-Kellermann, 1 S. Novak, 1 J. Kröll, 1 M. Fuchs, 1 G. Krämer, and 1 H. Jokeit ( 1 Neuropsychology, Swiss Epilepsy Center, Zürich, CH, Switzerland ) Rationale: A high comorbidity between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy has been noted in the literature. Prevalence rates and associations between type of epilepsy and ADHD are disputed. To estimate the need for better-tailored health care, we screened pediatric outpatient admissions to the Swiss Epilepsy Center for possible ADHD using translations of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale ? Revised (CPRS-R) and, to assess a wider range of behavioral problems, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Our goal was to determine the frequency and severity of attentional disorders in referrals to our clinic. We also investigated type of epilepsy, age and gender as possible associated risk factors. Methods: Parents of children with epilepsy aged 4?16 were requested to complete both questionnaires. Inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of epilepsy, no mental impairment, and fluency in German. All children underwent a neuropediatric examination with EEG. Epilepsy was diagnosed using ICD-10 criteria. The SDQ is a screening questionnaire for 4 -16 year-olds that assesses positive and negative behavioral attributes. The CPRS-R rates 27 behavioral attributes relating to ADHD. We used a cut-off of T score ≥ 66 in the CPRS-R to indicate probable presence of ADHD and a score of ≥ 17 total difficulties score in the SDQ as abnormal. Results: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 51 patients. The most frequent reasons for exclusion were no epilepsy diagnosis (10%) and mental impairment (4%). The most frequent type of epilepsy was symptomatic epilepsy (45%), followed by generalized idiopathic epilepsy (10%). The mean age was 11.2 years with 27 females and 24 males. 29 children (57%) did not exceed the critical values in either questionnaire. 19 (37%) were above the cut-off on the CPRS and 11 (22%) in both questionnaires, thus meeting strict criteria for the probably presence of ADHD. The two scales were moderately correlated (r = 0.526), with the CRS-R being the more sensitive instrument. We found no correlation in either questionnaire with age, sex or type of epilepsy and critical scores. Conclusions: Parents' ratings of ADHD symptoms in their children were highly elevated as compared to base rates. We found 22% to meet strict criteria for probable presence of ADHD. The majority with critical CPRS values also scored in the critical range on the SDQ, suggesting a wider spectrum of behavioral problems than merely ADHD symptoms exist in this population. We found no effects of age or type of epilepsy on critical scores in either questionnaire. Whereas a sex bias in favor of males is found in non-epileptic ADHD populations, we found no such association. Our findings of high rates of ADHD symptoms in children with epilepsy highlights the need for increased awareness of the comorbidity of these disorders as well as for targeted medical or psycho-behavioral treatment. 1 Frank J. Ritter, 1 Jason Doescher, 1 Michael D. Frost, and 1 Mary Gustafson ( 1 Minnesota Epilepsy Group PA, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Levetiracetam is approved for the treatment of partial seizures in children age 4 years and older. We investigated the use of initial monotherapy in children 1 month to 8 years old. There is little know about the initial treatment in children, with regard to efficacy and tolerability. Methods: This is a retrospective chart audit of 20 children who were randomly selected from a larger group of children less than 10 years old, who were initially treated for epilepsy with levetiracetam monotherapy. Charts were reviewed for demographics, efficacy, and tolerability. Results: There were 13 males and 7 females, mean age 3.8 years, with a mean follow up of 2.1 years. All had partial onset with or without secondarily generalized seizures. Nineteen of 20 had abnormal EEG. The dose of levetiracetam was between 10 and 70 mg/kg/day. Sixteen (80%) were seizure free. Of these, 5 discontinued due to adverse behavioral side effects. Three of these 5 had adverse behavior with the next medication tried. Four did not gain seizure control with levetiracetam monotherapy, but were controlled with the next medication tried. Conclusions: Initial monotherapy with levetiracetam was an effective treatment for partial onset seizures in children. Additional controlled trials would be beneficial. 1 Rana R. Said, 1 Andrea V. Andrade, and 1 Susan Arnold ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX ) Rationale: Pseudoseizures are a well described clinical entity in adolesent and adult populations. However, little is know about etiologies, co-morbity, and outcome of pseudoseizures in children less than 12 years old. Methods: Review of the Epilepsy/EEG database at Children's Medical Center at Dallas, revealed 12 children less than 12 years old with psychogenic non-epileptic paroxysmal events. Chart review and review of EEG and Video-EEG data was then done to assess age of onset, associated co-morbidities, EEG patterns, MRI findings, and psycho-social history. Follow-up data was available on 11/12 children. Results: Of the twelve children identified, 6 were girls. Age of onset of non-epileptic events ranged from 3.5 years to 11 years old (median 8 years old). 7/12 had a previous history of epilepsy and were on antiepileptic medications. One child was on Depakote for 5 years despite all events since onset likely representing non-epileptic events. The most common semiology for this younger age group was staring ahead/unresponsive to verbal stimulation, all with a volitional component and apparent secondary gain. Less frequent patterns included myoclonic jerking (1/12), pelvic thrusting (1/12), generalized shaking (1/12) and focal right arm ?waving? (1/12). In three of the 12 children, interictal EEG abnormaliteis were present, including focal discharges and generalized spike and slow wave discharges. In one child, both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures were captured during a single 36 hour prolonged video-EEG monitoring period. Significant psychosocial stressor were identified in nearly all children, with 2/12 having had recent sexual abuse, 3/12 associated with parental separation/divorce, 1/12 recently placed under Child Protective Services custody for maternal Munchausen by proxy, and the remainder having various other stressors including school bullying. Conclusions: Although likely less common than pseudoseizures in older children and adolescents, non-epileptic seizures are not rare in the younger child, seen to occur in our series in children as young as 3.5 years old for secondary gain or with a volitional component. The most common semiology in the younger child appears to be more bland, with the majority demonstrating periods of staring/unresponsive to verbal stimulation. Psychologic/psycho-social stressors must be thoroughly evaluated in the child to assist in management and treatment of pseudoseizures in this age group. 1 Justin C. Sanchez, 1 Zhao Liu, and 1 Paul R. Carney ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy often involves continuous intracranial subdural recording in which the goal is to determine the seizure onset zone. A difficulty with this approach is that the epileptologist must collect a sufficient number of seizures to evaluate if the patient is a candidate for resective surgery. Methods for interically identifying the seizure onset zone may shorten the phase 2 subdural monitoring and improve outcome. The goal of this research is to compare the interictal amplitude modulations of slow potentials, gamma, fast gamma, and neural ensemble activity for quantitatively locating the seizure onset zone. Methods: The subject participating in the study was undergoing extraoperative subdural grid evaluation for the treatment of intractable neocortical epilepsy. Multichannel subdural potentials were collected (IRB approved) while the patient was quietly awake. Neuronal activity indicated by the dashed box in Fig. 1 was recorded at 12 kHz and bandpass filtered from 1?6 kHz. To compare the seizure onset zone identification in multiple frequency bands, we define the amplitude modulation as the sum of the power of the ECoG voltage signal during interictal segments of recording (compared 10s-60min). The seizure onset zone quantified was compared to the zone as determined independently by two certified pediatric epileptologists (PRC, ZL). Results: The amplitude modulations in the ECoG data indicates that the seizure onset zone demarcation is dependent upon the frequency band. Both the gamma bands presented similar regions of maximal amplitude modulations in electrodes 45, 46, and 47. The slow potential amplitude modulations were not as distinct but modulation was posterior and temporal to the gamma bands. Neural ensemble modulation indicating the activation of large neuronal networks presented in electrodes 49?52, 25?28, and were merging into the gamma onset zones. Conclusions: A direct correspondence was found between the quantitative analysis and the visually identified seizure onset zone. Clinically, this preliminary result indicates that analysis of brief (10s-30min) ECoG recordings could potentially be used to make efficient recommendations for epilepsy surgery and could shorten phase 2 monitoring. Neurophysiologically, the primary seizure onset zone was most clearly defined by gamma and fast gamma activity implicating the potential role of dendritic activiy in ictogenesis. However, the spread of epileptic activity was primarily identified by the neural ensemble activity corresponding to the axonal output of cortical neurons.

The most common etiologies in reported cases are Rasmussen's encephalitis, cortical dysplasia and hemimegalancephaly. Methods: We reviewed our epilepsy surgery database since 1992 for cases where urgent resective surgery was performed for medically refractory status epilepticus. Results: We reviewed a total of 205 surgeries for refractory epilepsy. Four patients had urgent surgery as treatment for refractory status epilepticus. Details of the study population are described in Table 1.The duration of status before surgery was from 14 to 45 days. MR imaging demonstrated cortical dysplasia in one patient, white matter abnormalities in another, and was normal in two. EEGs showed focal seizures originating from one hemisphere in three of the patients. In the patient with cortical dysplasia and Rasmussen's encephalitis, seizures were recorded independently from both hemispheres but arose most frequently from the left occipital area. Surgery was performed with the aim of terminating status. In follow up, three patients have developmental delay and one is making developmental progress. No patient had complications related to their surgery aside from the predicted neurological deficits such as hemiparesis. Conclusions: In our experience, the number of patients in true status epilepticus at the time of surgery was very low. Following surgery, three of four patients experienced resolution of status epilepticus and had a significant reduction in seizures; two patients were seizure free. In all cases, surgery provided a specific diagnosis that was invaluable in directing management. 1 Gregory B. Sharp, 3Andrea E. Van Lierop, 1 Rolla M. Shbarou, 2Mary E. Atherton, 1 Bassem H. El-Nabbout, 1 Bernadette M. Lange, and 1 Cristian M. Ionita ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR ) Rationale: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of levetiracetam as initial monotherapy for children with a diagnosis of new onset epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was performed to identify children up to 18 years who were given a new diagnosis of epilepsy and were treated with levetiracetam as initial maintenance therapy. Treatment was initiated between January 1, 2003 and October 1, 2005. All patients were initially evaluated by a pediatric neurologist at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Outcome was determined by review of the last clinic follow-up and/or by telephone interview. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of seizure freedom for a minimum period of 6 months. Questions were asked concerning adverse effects during treatment with levetiracetam. Treatment was started following a single or prolonged seizure with electroencephalogram (EEG) findings supportive of a diagnosis of epilepsy, or following recurrent seizures with a supportive or normal EEG. Patients could have been treated with medications emergently for seizures prior to starting levetiracetam. Patients who had been treated previously with a maintenance antiepileptic drug were not included. Parents or caregivers were specifically asked if they had noted changes in behavior or other adverse events. Results: 82 children between the ages of 10 months and 17 years of age (mean 6.0 years) were identified who were treated initially with levetiracetam monotherapy for epilepsy. There were 46 males and 36 females. Seizure freedom was achieved for a period of at least 6 months in 70 patients (85.4%). Twelve patients were considered treatment failures due to peristent seizures in eight, or discontinuation of medication due to adverse effects in four (worsened behavior in 2, ataxia in 1, and rash in 1). The total dose ranged from 200 to 3000 mg per day and was divided bid. In the group with controlled seizures for a minimum of 6 months, the dose ranged from 10?36.9 mg/kg/day (mean 21.3 mg/kg/day). In the failure group, the dose ranged from 10.5?51.4 mg/kg/day (mean 25.0 mg/kg/day). There were no serious adverse events. Mild adverse events were reported in 24 patients (29.3%). Deterioration in behavior or mood was reported in 16 patients (19.5%). Behavioral problems resolved in 2 of 3 patients treated with pyridoxine, and in an additional 5 simply over time. Improved behavior was reported in one patient. Additional adverse events included sleepiness (1), dizziness (1), ataxia (1) and rash (1). Conclusions: Levetiracetam appears to be very effective and safe as initial monotherapy for children with epilepsy. Adverse effects are generally mild. Behavioral side effects were reported in almost 20% of patients, but only 2 patients discontinued the medication due to behavioral issues. Prospective evaluation of levetiracetam as monotherapy in children is warranted. 1 Silvia Vincentiis, 2 Clovis A. Silva, 2 Marilia Febronio, 2 Rosa Pereira, 3 Albertina Takiuti, 2 Maria Saito, and 1 Kette Valente ( 1 Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 2 Pediatrics, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 3 Gynecology, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Female adolescents with chronic disorders have their sexual-related issues ignored by health-related professionals and parents.It is assumed that sexual concerns do not represent a concern for these individuals.However, recent studies showed that adolescents with chronic conditions become sexually involved as their peers.The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare the sexual behaviors,sexual orientation and pregnancy rates in female adolescents with epilepsy, a chronic stigmatizing condition and compared with female adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),a visible and disabling disease,without stigma. Methods: A standard questionnaire was applied for consecutive 75 female adolescents,23 with epilepsy (G1) and 52 with SLE (G2), ages between 11 to 20 ys of age. All interviews were performed by the same physician with previous knowledge of the patients' clinical history and ancillary exams.Data regarding the 1st part of the questionnaire was obtained by direct interview addressing personal issues (social and economic class, age and schooling) and epilepsy data.The 2nd part of the questionnaire investigated gynecologic data (menarche,menstrual cycles,periodicity, dysmenorrhea,pregnancy,miscarriage,delivery,post-partum and newborn children.The 3rd and 4th parts addressed sexual behavior information and counseling, respectively. Results: G1 mean age was16.1 ys and in G2 mean age was 16.17 ys. Both groups did not present statistical differences for their demographic data, except for socio-economic-educational level.Mean age for menarche was later in G2 (12.8 ys) compared to G1 (11.6 ys) (p = 0.016).Age of the first sexual intercourse was similar in both groups.Nine patients (39.1%) out of the G1 were sexually active whereas 12 in G2(23.1%) were likewise (p = 0.1534). Mean sexual intercourse frequency per month was 2.8 in G1 and 4.3 in G2. Libido was reported by 71.4% in G1 and 100% reported attained orgasm. In G2,66.7% had libido and 50% reported orgasm (p = 0.0436).Regarding counseling, 72.7% from G1 and 83.3% from G2 reported contraceptive use,although most without appropriate orientation.Seven girls (63.6%) in G1 had at least one previous pregnancy, while only one (8.3%) in G2 had been pregnant (p = 0.0094). Conclusions: Although epilepsy is a chronic albeit not visible disorder, it is stigmatizing to the patient. On the other hand, SLE is a chronic, debilitating disorder.Despite that, questionnaire applied failed to produce a statistically difference in sexual-related behaviors between adolescents with lupus and epilepsy.Several sexual behavior landmarks were identical despite significant demographic social and academic differences. However, patients with epilepsy had a higher risk for unplanned pregnancies, suggesting that these patients have unmet counseling needs related to the stigma of this disorder.

Wical ( 1 Administration, IDEA League, Afton, MN ; and 2 Pediatric Neurology, Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Dravet syndrome is a devastating epileptic syndrome with onset very early in childhood. Major progress has been made in understanding the genetic foundation of the disorder; yet much work remains to identify co-morbid conditions commonly associated with Dravet's. Appropriate care of affected children must include identification and management of these disorders to permit optimal health and enhance our understanding of the disorder. Methods: Dravet syndrome is a rare disorder that makes systematic study of associated conditions difficult. The Dravet syndrome/SMEI Group, a support group for parents with affected children, is associated with the International Dravet syndrome Epilepsy Action League (IDEA League). At the time of data collection in 2005, 65 families participated in surveys. Not all familes answered each question. Participation was voluntary. Questions were chosen by group leaders to investigate whether other children had been affected by problems similar to their own. Questions were asked regarding: immune dysregulation and susceptibility to infections; growth, metabolic or endocrine disorders; and autism spectrum disorder. Despite the uncontrolled nature of data collection, trends emerged that are suggestive of significant co-morbid conditions occurring in the majority of children with Dravet's. Results: Of 61 respondents, 46 (75%) reported their children are prone to infection. Recurring/chronic otitis media, sinusitis, or bronchitis occurred in 50%. Fourteen of the 61 (23%) had been assessed by an immunologist, allergist, or infectious disease specialist. No child evaluated was found to have any specific immune deficiency. Thirty-eight of 61 (61%) reported their children had been assessed for endocrine, metabolic or absorbtion disorders. Mitochondrial disorders NOS had been diagnosed in 4/61 (6%). All 61 reported their children have difficulty regulating body temperature. The majority of children (38/61?61%) are underweight. Autism spectrum disorder was of concern to 35 (78%) of the 44 that responded to questions about behaviors. Autism has been diagnosed in 24% of these children. An additional 49% of children have autistic traits. 100% have communication disorders. Conclusions: Intractable epilepsy, significant cognitive impairment, and movement abnormalities are well recognized in Dravet's Syndrome. Our preliminary data suggest aspects of the syndrome go well beyond these features. Careful investigation of associated disorders in immune regulation and infection is needed. Documentation of pattern of infections is needed to separate out a true increased incidence from an apparent increase (due to increased awareness of infection as seizure trigger). Growth and nutritional assessment should be part of each child's coordinated care. Specific evaluation for autism spectrum disorders seems indicated. Associated symptoms must be sought in a prospective way to facilitate understanding of the manifestations of this complex disorder. 1 Jürgen Sperner, 2 Ingrid Tuxhorn, and 3the German Pediatric VNS Study Group ( 1 Neuropediatric Department, University Clinic Schleswig-Holstein, Lübeck, Germany ; 2 Betriebsstätte Krankenhaus Mara, Krankenhaus Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany ; and 3 Neuropediatric Department, University Clinic Schleswig-Holstein, Lübeck, Germany ) Rationale: Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a serious burden in approximately 20% of children with seizures. Nonpharmacologic, adjunctive treatments like the ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Therapy are helpful, although our knowledge of their long-term efficacy in children still remains limited. Methods: We evaluated the long-term outcome (up to 24 months) of VNS Therapy in severely disabled children and adolescents with pharmacoresistant epilepsy in a multicenter, prospective, open label, non-randomized trial. From a total of 156 patients (58% male), 90% had learning disabilities and 89% developmental delay. Median age at implantation was 10 years (range, 2.5?18), and 89 patients (57%) were younger than 12 years. Median age at onset of epilepsy was 1 year (range, 0?12). Median duration of epilepsy was 7.8 years (range, 1.6?18). Epileptic syndromes were diagnosed in 53% of the patients; acquired lesions in 23%; and genetic syndromes in 5%. Etiology was unknown in 19% of the patients. Before VNS Therapy, 60% of the patients were evaluated for epilepsy surgery, and 14% were operated (2 callosotomies, 17 lobectomies and 3 other types of epilepsy surgery). Patients were eligible after failure of at least 5 AEDs, and were evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after implantation. Efficacy and safety results, magnet use and quality of life (QoL) data were analyzed. Results: A total of 75 patients (48.1%) had 24 months follow-up. Seizure reductions ≥ 50% occurred in 32% of the patients after 3 months, and in 51% after 24 months follow-up (p = 0.01). Compared to baseline, there was a statistically significant seizure reduction at every follow-up interval (p = 0.0001). In most cases, side effects were well tolerated and could be minimized by reducing pulse width or stimulation frequency. Between 8% and 12% of the patients reported that the magnet was ?always? or ?most of the time? effective in aborting or reducing the intensity and/or duration of their seizures. Decreasing magnet effects were observed over time, except in a small group of patients (10%) where constantly satisfactory magnet effects were reported. More than 50% of the patients had improvements in alertness. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the outstanding long-term efficacy of VNS Therapy in this population of young and severely disabled children and adolescents with up to 24 months follow-up. VNS Therapy was also well tolerated and associated with QoL improvements. 1 Tammy L. Still, 1 Jodie R. Niosi, 1 Neetu K. Singh, 1 Nancy Thornton, 1 Elaine C. Wirrell, and 1 Lorie D. Hamiwka ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Witnessing seizures can be frightening for both onlookers and families. There is often a fear of death or permanent brain damage. The goal of this study was to explore the responses of families to a suspected first seizure event. Methods: A prospective cohort of 127 consecutive children with a probable first seizure referred the Alberta Children's Hospital between 01/01/2004 and 30/08/2005 were invited to participate in the study. One hundred and four families agreed. The database for the study was created prior to its initiation. Families were interviewed prior to the visit with the epileptologist and were asked open ended questions and their responses recorded. Information was documented with regards to: How parents felt at the time of the first seizure, where they went for information and the kind of resources they used, and their perceptions regarding the impact of the first seizure on the relationship with their child. Results: Seventy-four percent of children were diagnosed with epileptic events, 24% with non-epileptic events and in 2% the events were unclassifiable. Responses were similar between epileptic and non-epileptic families. The majority of parents described their responses to their child's first seizure as ?scared,??terrified,??panicked,??helpless,? feeling ?useless,??confused,??very upset,??horrible,??anxious,??shocked,??worried,??frightened,??stressed,? and ?freaked out.? One third of the families did not seek further information after their child's event; 24 (23%) relied solely on oral or written information provided by health care providers (emergency physicians, family physicians, pediatricians, paramedics, and nurses), 11 parents (11%), relied on information from the internet, 4 (4%) used library and text books, and 8 (8%) asked family and friends. Twenty-two (21%) used a combination of sources. Sixty-seven (64%) of the parents reported that the relationship between the parent and child changed. Conclusions: A presumed first seizure is clearly an emotional event for families and onlookers. A significant proportion of families did not seek further information regarding their child's event. The most common single source of information for families is health care providers. Over two thirds of families reported providing closer supervision of their children and restriction of activities. 1 Richard Tang-Wai, 1 Prakash Kotagal, 2 Ann Warbel, 1 Elaine Wyllie, and 2 William Bingaman ( 1 Neurology, Pediatric Epilepsy and Sleep Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: There is limited experience with the use of bitemporal depth electrodes in children with refractory epilepsy. We report our experience in 10 children with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent EEG monitoring with bitemporal depth electrodes to evaluate its role in seizure localization and correlate with information from other modalities. Methods: Patients were identified from the epilepsy surgery database and a systematic, retrospective chart review was carried out of children with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent bitemporal depth electrode evaluation between 1990 and 2005. Variables analyzed included (1) patient age at initial seizure and at time of surgery; (2) post-operative follow-up period; (3) seizure semiology; (4) ictal and interictal findings on scalp EEG; (5) brain imaging; (6) the indication for depth electrodes; (7) depth electrode interical and ictal findings; (8) type of surgery performed; (9) surgical pathology; and (10) seizure outcome. Results: Ten children (6 females) underwent bitemporal depth electrode evaluation. Only 1 of these patients underwent a simultaneous subdural grid evaluation. Indications for invasive evaluation included: (1) evidence of bitemporal EEG seizure patterns without localizing seizure semiology (7 patients); (2) possible neocortical onset (1 patient); (3) EEG focus and lesion incongruence (1 patient); (4) non localizable EEG ictal pattern with a lesional MRI (1 patient). Nine children (ages 11?18 years) underwent focal resection: 8 had standard anterior temporal lobectomy with resection of mesial temporal structures. The post-operative follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 26 months (mean 14.6 months). Of these, 8 remain seizure free (Engel I) and 1 patient remains refractory (Engel IV). This latter patient had a normal MRI and was found to have a lateral temporal focus; he underwent surgical resection of the superior temporal structures. The patient who did not undergo surgery was found to seizures arising independently from either temporal region without clear side predominance. Six patients were found to have hippocampal sclerosis on pathology. Conclusions: Bitemporal depth electrodes are useful diagnostic tools for children with temporal lobe epilepsy and unclear seizure localizations. In conjunction with imaging data, their use has been successful in achieving excellent surgical outcomes in the pediatric population. 1 Silvia Vincentiis, 2 Clovis Silva, 2 Maria I. Saito, and 1 Kette D. Valente ( 1 Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 2 Pediatrics, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Knowledge obtained with women with epilepsy is used to understand adolescents with epilepsy (AWE). Therefore, it is assumed that AWE have decreased libido, more anovulatory cicles and higher infertility rates. The purpose of the present study was to analyze sexuality in AWE. We also intended to evaluate whether the counseling received by these patients met their needs. Methods: We included AWE, from 10 to 20 ys, with the diagnosis of epilepsy, according to ILAE guidelines. Patients were enrolled in a standard questionnaire. All interviews were applied by the same physician with a previous knowledge of the patients' epilepsy history and ancillary exams. Data regarding the first part of the questionnaire was obtained by direct interview addressing personal issues (social and economic class, age, schooling) and epilepsy data. The second part referred to gynecologic data, such as age of menarche, menstrual cycles, periodicity, dysmenorrhea, pregnancy, miscarriage, delivery, post-partum and newborn children. The third and fourth parts consisted of a self-applicable questionnaire, addressing sexual behavior information and counseling, respectively. Results: Twenty-four AWE were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 15.9 ys. Epilepsy onset occurred during adolescence in 18 (75%) and in 6 (25%) during childhood. Four (15.3%) had focal symptomatic epilepsy, 15 (57.7%) focal cryptogenic and 5 (27%) had idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Sixteen (61.5%) patiens were under monotherapy. Mean age of menarca was 11.7 ys. Eight (32%) patients had irregular menstrual cycles. Eleven patients (42.3%) used folinic acid. Nine (34.6%) AWE were sexually active. Mean age of the first intercourse was 14.6 ys. Seven (77.7%) AWE had an unplanned pregnant and in 3, it was recurrent. Two patients became pregnant during the study.Miscarriage occurred in 2.A suspected abortion occurred in 1 patient.One newborn had a post-natal death. Regarding counseling, school was responsible for orientation for sexual activity and contraception in 8 cases (30.7%) and gynecologists in 3 (11.5%). One patient was guided by the neurologist and another by a health professional. Contraceptive methods were used by 8 patients, only 4 with appropriate guidance. From the contraceptive methods used: 7 patients used preservative in all intercourses, 1 used preservatives sporadically and none used oral contraceptives. Seven (26,9%)AWE received no counseling. Conclusions: Adolescents with epilepsy have active sexual life, despite their disease. As a result, they suffer consequences from an unconcealed sexual activity with unplanned pregnancies. It is interesting that these patients have more access to physicians than normal adolescents. However, they have less counseling, which is probably related to the fact that patients with chronic diseases are assumed as non-sexually actives. Sexual aspects and contraception requires special attention by the specialists attending adolescents with epilepsy. (Supported by FAPESP05/03309?6.) 1 Roy Wade, and 2 Richard P. Morse ( 1 Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH ; and 2 Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Pyridoxine dependent seizures are rare, with fewer than 150 cases reported worldwide. The diagnosis has been difficult to confirm and has required a challenge-rechallenge approach in the past. Recently the genetic basis has been described as well as biochemical markers that may be used to confirm the suspected diagnosis in the newborn period. In the literature of this rare disorder, seizures are often described as generalized tonic-clonic. Methods: We report a case of confirmed pyridoxine-dependent seizures in a newborn and an analysis of the seizures with video-EEG correlation. We describe the confirmation of the diagnosis by measurement of serum pipecolic acid. Results: The infant's clinical presentation was dominated by early onset irritability/encephalopathy within a few hours of delivery, and seizures which began at 22 hours of life. Seizures were described as generalized tonic-clonic by the neonatologists but on close analysis of video-EEG were either R or L-sided during clinical clonic seizures. In addition to clonic seizures, the infant had myoclonic, ?shuddering? events associated with generalized EEG discharges but these too had a hemispheric predominance. The baby had a rapid resolution of the encephalopathy with a single dose of pyridoxine 50 mg. Diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of serum pipecolic acid. Conclusions: Pyridoxine-dependent seizures are a rare occurrence and are described in the literature as generalized tonic-clonic events in the majority of infants. Close analysis of video-EEG suggests that these are not generalized tonic-clonic seizures but partial seizures. Encephalopathy is an underemphasized feature and may obscure seizures or precede them. Rapid and reliable diagnosis can be accomplished with measurement of serum markers for the disorder, which remain elevated even after treatment. Genetic testing will be available in the near future as well. Outcome can depend on early identification and treatment and a low threshold for an empiric trial of pyridoxine in neonatal seizures should continue to be our practice. 1 Ozge U. Soyuer, 2 Guzide Turanli, 2 Dilek Yalnizoglu, 2 Emel E. Bakar, and 2 Meral Topcu ( 1 Deptartment of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey ; and 2 Deptartment of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Neurology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey ) Rationale: This prospective study was performed to classify absence seizures in childhood with respect to seizure semiology and epilepsy syndrome, and evaluate treatment and outcome. Methods: Patients were referred to our pediatric neurology clinic with a diagnosis of absence epilepsy based on clinical and/or EEG features. Initial evaluation included detailed history obtained from parents, physical and neurological examination, and routine EEG, followed by video-EEG monitoring, neuroimaging, and psychometric analysis. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Results: 32 patients were studied. Age at initial symptom ranged between 10 months-15 years 5 months (mean: 8 years 9 months ± 4 years 1 month). Age at the time of diagnosis ranged between 5 years 2 months-15 years 6 months. Neuroimaging studies were available in 30 patients, 29 patients had MRI (9 were abnormal) and one had CT. Psychometric analysis was available in 17 patients and showed normal IQ results; they did not show a significant difference at follow up. Video-EEG monitoring was available in 23 patients; a total of 202 ictal recordings were obtained. 25 patients had typical absence seizures (TAS); they were classified as childhood absence epilepsy (n:8), juvenile absence epilepsy (n:10), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (n: 3), eyelid myoclonia with absences (n:2), perioral myoclonia with absences (n:1), diffuse epileptic EEG with eye closure (n:1). The remaining 7 patients without TAS were diagnosed with symptomatic/cryptogenic absence epilepsy (n: 6) and benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (n:1). 27 patients were followed for 1?17 months (mean:7,8 months), 5 had shorter follow-up periods. One patient showed poor compliance and dropped out of study at 6 months. Otherwise all patients with TAS were reportedly seizure-free and showed EEG improvement. 19 patients were started on an AED for the first time, others received add on therapy. 53.1% of the patients were on valproate, 34.4% were on ethosuximide, 9.4% were on lamotrigine, and 3.1% were on clobazam. Conclusions: Clinical evaluation, including history, physical examination, and routine EEG along with neuroimaging studies, provide major clues in the diagnosis of absence epilepsy. However video-EEG monitoring with ictal recordings are essential for precise subclassification of patients with absence seizures. Correct classification of seizures and epilepsy syndromes are crucial in determining treatment plans and prognosis. (Supported by the Hacettepe University Research Fund (01 G 010, PI: Meral Topcu).

We have tried callosotomy in pediatric Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Lennox-like syndrome patients and have got successful outcomes. But some patients showed no response. We analyzed the preoperative EEG, pathologic findings and extent of callosotomy in order to identify any relationship with the postoperative outcome of seizure. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients (19 male patients; mean age at callosotomy, 6.8 years) who were managed as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 22) and Lennox-like syndrome (n = 4) at Asan Medical Center from Apr.1993 to Dec, 2005. All the patients had multiple seizure types and mental retardation. The EEG shows generalized spike and slow waves (GSSW) or general paroxysmal fast activities (GPFA) in patients of LGS and intermittent multi-focal spike discharges (IMSD) in patients with Lennox-like syndrome. All of them were refractory to antiepileptic drugs or ketogenic diet. Pre- and post-callosotomy seizure counts were obtained from monthly diary annotation by the family or caregivers at 1, 6 and 12 months. Results: Seizure freedom over 1 year was noted in 6 patients of 26 patients (23.1%). Mean seizure reduction rate at 1, 6 and 12 months were 74.8%, 62.2%, 58.4% respectively. The existence of family history of epilepsy, abnormal findings on brain MRI, past history of infantile spasms or febrile convulsions had no effect on seizure outcomes after callosotomy. In preoperative EEGs, 19 of 26 patients (73.1%) had generalized slow spike and wave discharges, and others have only GPFA or IMSD. Patients with GSSW discharges achieved significantly better post-operative seizure outcomes at 1 month follow-up (p < 0.05). But no outcome difference was observed between these groups at 6 and 12 months' outcomes. The patients with total callosotomy showed better seizure reduction than patients with partial callosotomy, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Though we had got relatively successful outcomes after callosotomy in LGS and Lennox-like syndrome patients, we could not find any predictive indicator for better final surgical outcomes. The existence of GSSW in preoperative EEG may predict immediate postoperative outcomes only. Further studies should be required to know the predictive factors for post-callosotomy outcomes in LGS patients. 1 Guojun Zhang, 1 YogendraSinh H. Raol, and 1,2 Amy R. Brooks-Kayal ( 1 Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Pediatrics and Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Development of spontaneous seizure following prolonged status-epilepticus (SE) is age dependent and a number of molecular and morphological changes occur following SE have been suggested to contribute to development of spontaneous seizures. Astrogliosis is one such prominent feature of epileptic brain and may play an important role in epileptogenesis. In the present study, we assessed the effect of prolonged SE induced at different ages on GFAP mRNA expression in dentate gyrus (DG). Methods: SE was induced in P10, P20 and adult rats using either lithium/pilocarpine (Li/Pilo) or kainic acid (KA). One, seven and 21 days after SE induction, rats were sacrificed and GFAP mRNA expression was examined in acutely dissected DG using antisense RNA amplification (aRNA) technique. Results: GFAP mRNA expression in DG was increased 3 fold in the adult rats 7 days after Li/Pilo-induced SE and remained high at 21 days. In P20 rats, GFAP mRNA expression was increased 2 fold 1 day after SE and 3 fold 7 days after Li/Pilo or KA induced SE. In contrast, in P10 rats, GFAP mRNA expression did not change at any time point (1 and 7 days) studied following KA induced SE. Conclusions: This study shows that GFAP mRNA expression in DG after SE is age dependent but not model specific. Further, as increase in GFAP occurs prior to and in association with development of epilepsy after SE, these findings support the hypothesis that astrogliosis may be related to epileptogenesis.

Stenhouse ( 1 Fraser of Allander Neurosciences Unit, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ; and 2 Duncan Guthrie Institute of Medical Genetics, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Mutations in the SCN1A gene are associated with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) and several related epilepsy phenotypes commencing in early infancy. These infantile epilepsies are typically refractory to standard anti-epileptic medication (AED) and may result in an epileptic encephalopathy with progressive cognitive impairment. Syndrome specific reports have suggested three medications or combinations which may be helpful. These are sodium valproate and topirimate, the bromides and stiripentol. Certain medications may exacerbate symptoms such as myoclonus. In November 2005 a service looking for mutations in SCN1A was established in our institution. Our aim was to determine if knowledge of a child's mutation status influenced prescription patterns. Methods: This service was available in Scotland at inception and UK wide in May 2006. SCN1A has 26 exons (7848bp) which are amplified in 40 fragments. A pre-screen is performed using Conformational Sensitive Capillary Electrophoresis (CSCE) and fragments containing apparent changes are sequenced. A detailed pre-test questionnaire helps us to attempt a syndromic classification. A joint molecular genetic and paediatric epileptology report is issued. Results: To date we have tested and reported on 51 casese of infantile onset epilepsy and selected parents. To date all 5 cases of classical SMEI have identified mutations. 1/2 cases of SMEB have mutations and one child with a focal epilepsy has a mutation. All mutations are de novo. 5 individuals have had their medication altered as a result of the analysis. There is clinical improvement in 3 to date with reduction in seizure frequency and increased levels of alertness. Follow up is too short to comment on call cases. Conclusions: Identification of a mutation not only allows a family of a child with a devastating epilepsy to begin to understand why their child is affected but also allows consideration of medication changes both specific additions and withdrawals. Appropriate medication can reduce seizure frequency, potentially ameliorating the epileptic encephalopathy therefore reducing the acquired learning disability. This may be particulaly relevant to the young infant with suspected SMEI and frequent seizures who does not yet fulfill all the syndrome criteria. Prospective studies are ongoing with the use of the detailed questionnaire to determine phenotype and target testing to the most appropriate cases.

Dogan, 1 Rengin Bilgen, 1 Burcu Ekmekci, and 1 Berrin Aktekin ( 1 Neurology, Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey ) Rationale: To assess the effectiveness, tolerability and side effects of oxcarbazepine (OXC) in adult epilepsy patient population. Methods: A total of 194 (108 male, 17?81years) patients, 139 new-onset epilepsy, were studied. The demographic variables, reasons and date of OXC administration and/or cessation of the drug, dosages and seizure outcomes (total seizure freedom, partial improvement or poor seizure control) were recorded. The approximate follow-up period was 25.6 months (minimum 3, maximum 144 months). Mean administered dose of oxcarbazepine was 951.03 ± 349 miligrams. 164 patients (84.5%) received OXC as monotherapy and 30 patients (15.5%) were add on a second antiepileptic drug because of poor seizure control despite maximum tolerable dose of first antiepileptic drug. Patients were divided into 3 subgroups; symptomatic, cryptogenic and unclassified. Symptomatic group consisted of ischeamic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular diseases, central nervous system infections (menengitis/meningoencephalitis), intracerebral tumours, cortical development abnormalities, mesial temporal sclerosis and post-traumatic etiologies. 116 patients (59.8%) were in the symptomatic group, 67 patients were in the cryptogenic group (34.5%) and 11 patients were in the unclassified group (5.7%). Results: When the efficacy is considered; total seizure remission was achieved at 149 patients (76.8%), number of patients with > 50% seizure decrease was 29 (14.9%), number of patients with partial remission was 8 (4.1%) and number of patients with no response was 8 (4.1%). OXC dosage was decreased or ceased at 29 patients for several reasons. Reasons for cessation were; symptomatic hyponatremia (n = 3), liver enzyme abnormalities (n = 7), severe anaflactic reactions (n = 2), intolerability of the patient due to dizziness, somnolans, nausea and/or vomitting (n = 7), additional medication need for concomittant medical problems which may interfere with OXC (n = 4) and pregnancy (n = 6). Conclusions: OXC provides a remarkable efficacy for seizure control or significant improvement with ignorable and rare side effects. 1 Mohammad S. Al-Humayyd ( 1 Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Central, Saudi Arabia ) Rationale: The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of carbamazepine (CBZ) in adult Saudi epileptic patients in order to improve on dosing schedules. Methods: One hundred and fifty two steady- state serum CBZ concentration measurements were collected during normal routine care of 76 patients receiving CBZ (100?1000 mg/day) in monotherapy. Steady- state trough CBZ serum concentrations, CBZ dosing history and associated information were collected prospectively. Data were analyzed by the non- linear mixed- effect modeling (NONMEM) technique with a one- compartmental model of first- order absorption and elimination. The apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and their inter-individual variabilities were estimated using the program. Results: The population estimates for clearance (CL; modeled independently of dose) and volume of distribution were 12.6 ± 0.5 l/h and 535 ± 40 l, respectively. However, CL increased as a function of dosing rate and consequently was modeled as a linear function of steady- state concentration. In order to validate these results, the predictions of the population model were tested against data from 14 further patients subjected to the same inclusion criteria but who were not included in the original analysis. The predictions were good, being unbiased (p = 0.29), and had an average deviation from the observed values of 16%. Conclusions: The observed covariate regression model reasonably predicted concentrations in the separate validation Saudi patient data set. The correlation between CBZ clearance and patient- specific characteristics may thus allow dosage adjustment to be made to achieve target steady- state plasma concentrations.

This study aimed to investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ESL once-daily (qd) and twice-daily (bid) regimens in healthy subjects. Methods: Single centre, open-label, randomised, crossover study in 12 (6 males and 6 females) healthy volunteers. The study consisted of 8-day treatment periods separated by a washout period of 10?15 days. On each treatment period, the volunteers received either an oral dose of ESL 900 mg qd or ESL 450 mg bid. Results: ESL was extensively and rapidly metabolized to eslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine, BIA 2?194), the main active metabolite. Plasma levels of the parent drug (ESL) were systematically below the limit of quantification of the assay. Following the last dose of the 8-day ESL 900 mg qd and 450 mg bid regimens, the eslicarbazepine pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 1. 1 Eslicarbazepine pharmacokinetic parameters following ESL 900 mg qd and ESL 450 mg bid Dosage regimen Cmax (ng/mL) tmax (h) AUCτ (ng.h/mL) t1/2 (h) ESL 900 mg qd 22210 (7257) 3.0 (1.5?4.0) 294019 (58364) 9.12 (1.19) ESL 450 mg bid 16667 (3981) 2.0 (1.0?2.0) 142080 (25933) 9.17 (1.49) Cmax? maximum observed plasma concentration; tmax ? time to Cmax; AUCτ? are under the curve of plasma concentrations versus time during the dosing interval (24 h and 12 h in case of the qd and bid regimens, respectively); t1/2 ? apparent elimination half-life. Results are expressed as arithmetic means with the corresponding standard deviations (SD) in parentheses. tmax values are median with range values in parentheses The rate of systemic exposure to eslicarbazepine, as assessed by Cmax, was 33% higher following ESL 900 mg qd in comparison with ESL 450 mg bid. Extent of systemic exposure to eslicarbazepine during a 24-h interval, as assessed by comparing the AUCτ of the ESL 900 mg qd regimen (AUC0?24h) with 2 times the AUCτ of the ESL 450 mg bid regimen (2 x AUC0?12h), was 3% higher following ESL 900 mg qd in comparison with ESL 450 mg bid. Incidence and characteristics of treatment-emergent adverse events or drug-related adverse events were similar with both treatment alternatives. Conclusions: The extent of exposure to eslicarbazepine during a 24-h interval was similar following ESL 900 mg qd and ESL 450 mg bid regimens, but the rate of exposure was 33% higher following ESL 900 mg qd in comparison with ESL 450 mg bid. Tolerability was similar between qd and bid regimens. (Supported by BIAL (Portela  STD 10.4). Weight ranged from 43?146 kg (Mean 84 kg; STD 29). A morbidly obese patient weighing 146 kg (IBW 70 kg) also received LEV via NGT and had a two hour serum concentration of 23 ?g/mL. All patients in the EMU were alert before and after load and reported no adverse events. No patients on the EMU had any seizure within 24 hours after load. LEV was well-tolerated in the ICU patients hemodynamically. All were obtunded prior to addition of LEV. Conclusions: Our data suggest that serum concentrations of LEV typical for the treatment of epilepsy may be obtained rapidly and safely after a 1500 mg loading in adults with epilepsy. These data also suggest that oral loading may be used to hasten discharge from the EMU or as adjunctive therapy in status epilepticus though additional study is needed. Loading dose also achieved a therapeutic level in morbid obesity consistent with the high water solubility of the drug. 1 Gennaro Barbato, 1 Pasquale Alfieri, 1 Rossana Arlomede, 2 Giacomo Visco, and 3 Annamaria M. Terracciano ( 1 Neurologia, ASLNA1, Napoli, Napoli, Italy ; 2 Neurologia, ASLNA5, Sorrento, Napoli, Italy ; and 3 Neuropsichiatria, Clinica SantaMaria Del Pozzo, Somma Vesuviana, Napoli, Italy ) Rationale: Epilepsy in the elderly is often cryptogenic and the seizure occor without a defined provoking factor or a remote or current neurological pathology clinically or instrumentally evident.Aim of this open label trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of Levetiracetam as monotherapy in elderly patients with cryptogenic epilepsy. Methods: 14 patients more 60 years old (mean age 68 years) with newly diagnosis of cryptogenic epilepsy have been enrolled in the study, with at least 2 seizures before entering the study. 10 out 14 had CPC, 4 out 14 had GTCS. 8 patients received 1000 mg/die (500 ? 2) of LEV starting with 250 mg/die for a week, uptitrared of 250 mg of everyweek up to 1000 mg/die; 6 patients received 2000 mg/die. Every 3 months all patients performed a visit to access efficacy and safety through neurological examination,seizure diary,EEG,complete blood test, MMSE,SF12,NPI. 8 patients suffered from hypertension, 4 patients fron diabets and 2 osteoporosis. Results: After follow-up of 12 months all patients were seizure free: 8 patients at 1000 mg/die and 6 patients needed for a higher dose(to 2000 mg/die). After LEV treatment, all patients showed an improvement in quality of life as the level of autonomy and relationships is increased. LEV was well tolerated without any interaction with others concomitants treatments. Sonnolence,dizziness,headache,agitation and irritability, all mild and temporary(few days). All patients completed the Study. Conclusions: Levetiracetam as monotherapy showed a good efficacy and safety for Cryptogenic Epilepsy in the Elderly,even at low doses,without interactions with others concomitant therapies and without persistent side effects. 1 Michel J. Berg, and 1 Robert A. Gross ( 1 Strong Epilepsy Center, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY ) Rationale: Issues surrounding the substitution of generic anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in the US are not fully understood. In addition, current experiences of US physicians have not been thoroughly examined. Here, views of patients and physicians toward generic substitution of AEDs and insights into physicians' current experiences across the US are reported. Methods: Online-based surveys were carried out with 550 adult patients diagnosed with epilepsy and 606 physicians treating epilepsy from the US. Results: The efficacy of generic AEDs was a concern to 75% of physicians and 65% of patients. The vast majority (90%) of physicians agreed that generic substitution of a controlled patients' regular, effective AED may cause the onset of breakthrough seizures. Fully 65% of physicians reported that they had had a patient experience a breakthrough seizure caused by a switch from a branded to a generic AED. Additionally, one-third (34%) of patients think that substitution with a generic AED is linked to breakthrough seizures. Almost two-thirds (62%) of patients surveyed and 75% of physicians surveyed were aware that pharmacists may substitute a branded AED for a generic without physician consent. But less than half (43%) of physicians were aware of mandatory generic substitution laws for branded prescription medications. Eighty-one percent of patients and 87% of physicians agreed that the pharmacist should only be able to substitute an AED with a generic with physician consent. Half (53%) of physicians surveyed would be uncomfortable prescribing a generic medication to treat their patients' epilepsy. Over half of physicians (64%) and patients (57%), in general, prefer generic AEDs if there were a potential cost savings. Among those surveyed, fewer physicians (52%) and patients (44%) were concerned about efficacy of generic medications for acute care. Concerns about safety of generic AEDs existed amongst 56% physicians, compared with 40% for generic acute care medications. Ninety-four percent of patients would require at least a small amount of education or counseling from a healthcare professional if they were to switch their current AED for a generic. Conclusions: Both patients and physicians are concerned about the efficacy and safety of unrestricted generic AED substitution and nearly two-thirds of physicians reported that they had a patient experience a breakthrough seizure due to generic substitution. However, generic substitution practices are not well-understood by patients or by physicians. Physicians and patients recognize the cost savings of generic AEDs, but the perception that generic drugs are less effective may outweigh the cost benefit in many cases. The findings raise questions about the value of mandatory generic substitution requirements for medications with narrow therapeutic windows, such as AEDs. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 Jean M. Bidlack, and 2 Harold H. Morris III ( 1 Pharmacology and Physiology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY ; and 2 Neurology, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT ) Rationale: To correlate the appearance of phenobarbital (PB) withdrawal seizures in a patient with a decrease in the number of GABAA receptors (GABAR) seen during PB withdrawal in PB-dependent rats. Methods: A patient, seizure-free for three years following removal of a cavernous angioma of her right anterolateral temporal lobe, had been taking PB for 11 years before surgery and was maintained on PB 150 mg/d for 3 years after surgery. The patient had a baseline of one psychic aura every two weeks. The decision was made to taper PB and to replace it with a non-inducing anti-epileptic drug. The patient kept accurate daily records of auras and seizures on a long-term continuous basis. Results: A gradual reduction of PB was started and lamotrigine (LTG) slowly titrated, but typical complex seizures occurred when PB taper reached 60 mg/d. Conversion to LTG failed because of rash. PB was increased back to 90 mg/d and levetiracetam (LEV) was initiated and titrated to a dose of 500 mg BID. PB was then reduced by 15 mg every three weeks. When the patient was on PB 45 mg/d and LEV 500 mg BID, the frequency of auras increased, and LEV was increased to 750 mg BID. Seizures appeared when the patient was on PB 30 mg/d and LEV 750 mg BID. During the first week after PB was stopped and the patient was on LEV 1000 mg BID, there were 4 seizures. The seizures continued for 3 weeks after PB was stopped. After this time, there were no additional seizures and the dose of LEV remained constant at 1000 mg BID. The patient experienced anxiety and insomnia during the slow PB taper. Conclusions: This case demonstrates a ?threshold? for PB withdrawal seizures at 45 to 60 mg/d and cessation of withdrawal seizures following PB discontinuation. At a dose of PB 90 mg/d, the patient had a plasma PB level of 11 mcg/ml. Assuming clearance did not change, withdrawal seizures appeared when the PB level was 5?8 mcg/ml. Withdrawal seizures were not controlled by LEV but ceased three weeks post complete withdrawal. Our data are explainable by a ?resetting? of her GABAR. [3H]Muscimol binding to GABAR in rat brain homogenates was reduced by 25% in withdrawing animals for up to 10 days after chronic PB exposure (Tanaka et al., 1991). Similarly, there was a decrease in the α1 subunit of the GABAR in rat pups that had been exposed to PB for 30 days (Raol et al., 2005). Attenuation in the number of GABAR during PB withdrawal may account for the presence of PB withdrawal seizures in a patient who had been seizure-free. Termination of the withdrawal seizures may be associated with a resetting of the levels and types of GABAR. [figure 1] 1 Leonilda Bilo, 2 Roberta Meo, 1 Patrizia Ruosi, 1 Maria Fulvia de Leva, 3 Roberto De Simone, and 1 Salvatore Striano ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurological Sciences, Federico II University, Naples, Italy ; 2 Neurology Outpatients Service, Azienda Sanitaria Locale Napoli 1, Naples, Italy ; and 3 Department of Neurological Sciences, Federico II University, Naples, Italy ) Rationale: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of levetiracetam (LEV) in patients with epilepsy and chronic liver disease. Methods: Eleven patients with epilepsy and chronic liver disease entered the study. Eight suffered from Focal Epilepsy and three from Generalized Epilepsy. Liver disease consisted of HCV-related epatopathy in 6 cases (2 of whom had cirrhosis), HBV-related epatopathy in 4 (2 of whom with colesthasis) and porphyria cutanea tarda in 1. At study entry all patients were already treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in mono- or polytherapy; all had uncontrolled seizures. In all patients LEV was initially given as add-on therapy, with a slow titration. Contemporarily, the associated AED treatment was slowly reduced, resulting in complete withdrawal in 3 cases. A laboratory work-up, including blood count and evaluation of liver function, was serially performed during titration and follow-up; seizure frequency was also serially evaluated, considering as baseline frequency the mean seizure frequency reported in the 6 months preceding study entry. Results: Three patients dropped out of the study because of adverse effects (2 patients, with drop out during titration) or because of adverse effects and worsening of seizures (1 patient, during follow-up). All the remaining 8 patients were responders to LEV treatment in add-on or monotherapy, with a >50% reduction of seizure frequency in 6 cases and complete disappearance of seizures in 2. None of these 8 patients showed worsening of liver function during follow-up. In all these patients follow-up lasted at least 12 months. Conclusions: With the limitations due to the small number of patients, our study suggests that LEV may be a good choice for epileptic patients with liver disease. Due to the absence of liver metabolism, LEV can be employed in high dosages, resulting in improved seizure control without liver toxicity. 1 Eric Bourne, 1 Kevin Nanry, 2 Herndon Harding, 1 James Graham, 1 Jeremy Roberts, and 1 Robert Leadbetter ( 1 Psychiatry, GlaxoSmithKline, RTP, NC ; and 2 Psychiatry, Florida State University, Winter Park, FL ) Rationale: The current analysis evaluated changes in weight and body-mass index (BMI) in patients treated with lamotrigine in the presence and absence of concomitant valproate or antipsychotics. Methods: A post hoc analysis was conducted from a prospective, open-label study of lamotrigine in 1175 patients with bipolar I disorder designed to assess the rate of rash in patients with or without specific dermatological precautions. Lamotrigine was administered for 12 weeks, including a 5-week titration period (target dosage 200 mg/day). Weight and BMI was measured at baseline, week 5 and week 12 visits. Results: Baseline weight was statistically significantly higher in patients taking concomitant valproate versus without (199.1 ± 49.07 versus 184.7 ± 47.53 lb, p < 0.0001) and was statistically significantly higher in patients taking concomitant antipsychotics versus without (192.7 ± 47.31 versus 186.1 ± 48.48 lb, p < 0.05). Statistically significant changes in weight were not observed between treatment groups. Weight changes from baseline to week 12 were ?0.2 ± 6.82 lb with valproate, 0.0 ± 8.40 lb without valproate, ?0.4 ± 7.99 lb with antipsychotics, and 0.0 ± 8.14 lb without antipsychotics (p > 0.05 for all group comparisons). Statistically significant changes in BMI were not observed between treatment groups. BMI changes from baseline to week 12 were 0.0 ± 1.07 with valproate, 0.0 ± 1.41 without valproate, ?0.1 ± 1.34 with antipsychotics, and 0.0 ± 1.34 without antipsychotics (p > 0.05). Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous findings that lamotrigine is weight neutral in patients with bipolar disorder and suggest that lamotrigine may be given to patients with concomitant medications that are frequently associated with increased body weight without causing additional weight gain.

Pierre-Louis, and 2 Arthur Evans ( 1 Division of Neurology, Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, IL ; and 2 Department of Medicine, Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: After FDA approval of once-a-day DepakoteER for the treatment of epilepsy, the pharmacy at our county hospital stopped carrying delayed release Depakote(DR). Since the majority of our adult epilepsy out-patients obtain their medications at no cost from the hospital pharmacy, a cohort of patients were switched from Depakote(DR) to DepakoteER in a relatively short period of time. We monitored this group prospectively for changes in seizure frequency, medication adverse effects and preparation preference and now report those findings. Methods: At the patient's index visit, we obtained data on seizure frequency over the previous 6 months, as well as information about possible medication side effects (fatigue, GI upset, hair loss and weight change). Patients completed a scored 20 item questionaire about the effect, if any, of hand tremor on various daily activities and were asked to copy an Archimedes spiral. The patient was weighed. At this initial visit, Depakote(DR) was switched to DepakoteER (with an approximately 20% increase in total dose). The same information was obtained at 3 and 6 month follow-up visits. Change in seizure frequency was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Before and after questions concerning specific side effects were analyzed using McNemar's test. Spirals were graded on a 1 to 5 scale (best to worst) by 2 trained, blinded raters. The pateints were asked which Depakote preparation they preferred and what schedule they actually used for DepakoteER. Results: Forty seven patients were enrolled. Thirty eight completed all 3 visits, 5 completed 2 visits and 4 were lost to follow-up after the initial evaluation. There was no significant change in seizure frequency in the 6 month period following the switch to DepakoteER (a non-significant trend for improvement in seizure frequency was observed, P = 0.08). Concerning side effects, before and after questions about fatigue, GI upset and hair loss indicated no change (p > 0.2) after the switch to DepakoteER. There was no significant weight change at 6 months (p = 0.4). Scoring of Archimedes spirals showed no significant change at 3 or 6 months. The questionaire about hand tremor in various activities showed significant improvement at 3 (p = 0.03) and 6 (p = 0.05) months using the paired T-test. Most patients (62%) preferred DepakoteER but more than a quarter used it more than once daily (10 twice, 2 three times a day). Conclusions: DepakoteER was as effective as Depakote(DR) for control of seizures. Side effect measurements were unchanged except for improvement in patients' perception of hand tremor in daily activities. Most patients preferred DepakoteER, though some continued to use BID or TID dosing. (Supported by Abbott Laboratories.) 1 Martin J. Brodie, 2 Pedro Gonzales, 1 Graeme J. Sills, 2 Stuart Parks, and 2 David Keating ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Division of Cardiovascular  and 2 Electrodiagnostic Imaging Unit, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, United Kingdom ) Rationale: This study was designed to differentiate between retinal dysfunction associated with vigabatrin (VGB) therapy and non-specific visual field defects in people with treated epilepsy. Methods: A total of 204 people with epilepsy were grouped according to antiepileptic drug therapy as follows: current VGB treatment (n = 56), previous VGB treatment (n = 49), current GABAergic treatment (no VGB exposure; n = 46) and current non-GABAergic treatment (no VGB exposure; n = 53). Groups were matched for age, sex, seizure-type, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent wide-field multifocal electroretinography (WF-mfERG)1, logMar visual acuity testing, colour vision assessment, static perimetry (Humphrey) and ISCEV standard electroretinography. Results: When assessed by static perimetry, bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 33 current-VGB patients (59%) and 21 of the previous VGB group (43%). However, clinically significant abnormalities were also demonstrated in 24 patients (24%) with no prior exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function by WF-mfERG revealed abnormal responses in 25 current VGB patients (48%) and 11 previous-VGB patients (22%), but none (0%) of the patients with no exposure to VGB. By way of comparison, 21 VGB-exposed patients (20%) demonstrated visual field abnormalities with no associated retinal dysfunction, whereas only 3 patients (3%) had demonstrable retinal dysfunction with no apparent visual field problems. Unlike with visual field abnormalities, the incidence of retinal dysfunction segregated according to median VGB drug load (dysfunction, n = 31, 9012g versus no dysfunction, n = 40, 5065g; p = 0.0035). There was no difference between groups in terms of visual acuity, colour vision and standard electroretinography assessments. Conclusions: Visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history. Bilateral concentric visual field constriction may be a surrogate clinical marker of the neuroretinal toxicity associated with VGB use, but its assessment by conventional static perimetry is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify all affected individuals. Patients with current or previous exposure to VGB should be considered for WF-mfERG, which is more likely to reflect retinal toxicity associated with vigabatrin usage.

Brandenburg, 3 Montserrat Vera-Llonch, 3 Gerry Oster, and 4 Xiao Xu ( 1 Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, West Haven, CT ; 2 Pfizer Inc, NY, NY ; 3 PAI Inc, Boston, MA ; and 4 Covance Inc, Gaithersburg, MD ) Rationale: To examine the perceived impact of seizure versus selected medication adverse effects (AE) in patients with partial-onset epilepsy. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 201 adult patients with partial-onset epilepsy receiving 2+ antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and with 1+ seizure in the past year. Patients were asked to rate their health state by recording a number from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) based on their health today, hypothetical health if they were to experience a seizure today, and hypothetical health if they were to experience selected AEs today (incoordination, diplopia, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache, nausea, sleepiness, poor concentration, anomia). Decrements in health rating (HLTH) with a seizure today or an AE today were calculated as change from HLTH today. To contrast the relative impact of having a seizure to an AE, differences in decrements related to each AE (SZ-AE) were calculated. Higher positive SZ-AE values indicate a greater perceived decline in health status associated with experiencing a seizure; negative SZ-AE values indicate the AE negatively impacts health status more than a seizure does. Analyses were based on seizure frequency and recency. Results: Overall health status ratings declined as seizure frequency increased [mean (SD) HLTH: once/6?12 months 76.2 (18), once/1?3 months 73.3 (20), 1+/week 65.6 (21); p = 0.01]. Mean (SD) perceived decrements in HLTH with a seizure were greatest for patients with the least frequent seizures [once/6?12 months 37.3 (29), once/1?3 months 30.2 (27), 1+/week 21.2 (23); p = 0.001]; as well as for seizure recency [last seizure 4+ months ago 36.8 (28), 1 week-3 months ago 33.5 (30), within the past week 21.4 (20); p = 0.004]. Perceived decrements in HLTH associated with having a seizure compared to experiencing an AE (SZ-AE) differed significantly (p < 0.05 except for incoordination and weakness) across seizure recency groups. Among patients with last seizure 4+ months ago SZ-AE ratings were 10.1 ? 27.0, implying perception of a new seizure was much worse than an AE; with last seizure 1 week-3 months ago SZ-AE ratings were 1.3 ? 9.3, implying perception of seizure was somewhat worse than an AE; and with seizures within the past week SZ-AE ratings were ?3.2 to ?10.4, implying AE symptoms were more troublesome than seizures. Conclusions: Lack of seizure control is associated with decrements in health status. Patients perceived the effects of seizures and AEs differently. Patients with the least recent seizures may be most concerned with maintaining seizure control, while patients with more recent seizures are more sensitive to AED side effects, perhaps because their seizures remain uncontrolled. Our findings should help healthcare providers understand the risk-benefit concerns of patients when addressing the efficacy and AEs of AEDs. (Supported by Pfizer Inc.) 1 Alan Gevins, 2 Kimford J. Meador, 1 Linda K. McEvoy, 2 David W. Loring, 3 Patty G. Ray, and 1 Brynn M. Evans ( 1 San Francisco Brain Research Institute, SAM Technology, San Francisco, CA ; 2 Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 3 Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ) Rationale: The relative cognitive and neurophysiological effects of levetiracetam (LEV) and carbamazepine (CBZ) are uncertain. Methods: This study compared the effects of LEV and CBZ using a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover design in healthy adults. Mean (SD) maintenance doses and blood levels were: LEV mean dose = 2000mg/day (0), LEV mean blood level = 32 mcg/ml (11); CBZ adjusted by blood level to a mean dose = 564 mg (110); CBZ mean blood level = 7.5 mcg/ml (1.5). The results of the primary outcome measures (i.e., 33 variables from 11 standard neuropsychological tests) have been previously reported in abstract form. In this abstract, we report the results of a cognitive neurophysiological test (CNT) of working- and episodic memory which included measures of EEG/EP, cognitive performance, and subjective effects (22 variables). Testing was done at screening, baseline pre-drug treatment, end of each maintenance phase (4 weeks), and end of each washout period after drug treatment. Results: 28 adults (mean age = 33; range = 18?51 years) completed the study. Relative to LEV and non-drug, CBZ produced both subjective and cognitive performance impairments. In addition, CBZ produced an increase in low frequency (<10Hz) EEG power and changes in ERP measures. Linear discriminant analysis revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity for detection of CBZ relative to either LEV or non-drug conditions using EEG neurophysiological measures; detection was less accurate when using neuropsychological variables from the CNT or from the original full neuropsychological battery. Conclusions: CBZ produces more untoward neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects than does LEV at the dosages and timeframes employed in this study. EEG neurophysiological measures improve detection of these effects.

Esposito ( 1 Neurosciences, Hospital ?G. Rummo,? Benevento, Benevento, Italy ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV) is a well-tolerated antiepileptic drug used worldwide as an adjunctive treatment in adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Its efficacy and tolerability were demonstrated in some pivotal clinical studies (1?2), and can be safely initiated at 2,000 mg daily without a titration period (3), but little data exist regarding its use in status epilepticus(SE). Methods: We describe a case of refractory SE requiring 9 days of pharmacological coma with subsequent excellent neurological recovery after adjunctive nasogastric LEV. On December 29th, 2005, a 25-years old man with SE presented to hour hospital. He had endotracheal intubation and admitted to the emergency unit. SE showed partial crisis as clonic and mioclonic crisis and tonic-clonic crisis. The patient had a post-surgery panhypopituitarism for craniopharyngioma and he had never had any convulsions. The treatment protocol started with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg/hour/die e.v. and phenobarbital (PB) 100 mg i.m. SE didn't stop and the day after PB was increased at 200 mg daily. On January 3th, midazolam was substituted with propofol 1 mg/ml i.v., PB was reduced at 100 mg/daily and sodium valproate (sVLP) 25 mg/Kg/daily i.v. was added but without success, so on January 5th, 2006, PB was stopped and nasogastric LEV 1000 mg three times daily, without titration, was added. Results: The patient showed a dramatic recovery when nasogastric LEV was added and while EEG performed on day 4th, showed polyspike-wave complex on left temporo-central-occipital derivations combined with slow activity and burst-suppressions of short duration (Fig.1a), EEG performed on day 11th, showed low amplitude polyspikes on left fronto-central derivations (Fig. 1b) and EEG updated on day 40th, showed no epileptiform activity (Fig. 1c). CT scan performed on day 10th (Fig. 1d), and MRI performed on January 3th, 2006 (Fig. 1f) and on January 27th, 2006 (Fig. 1g), showed no differences compared by an MRI performed on june 2005 (Fig. 1e). Conclusions: For our knowledge this is the first case of 3000 mg daily, without titration, nasogastric LEV treatment of refractory SE resistant at midazolam iv plus PB im and sVLP iv, at propofol iv plus sVLP. In fact only the LEV 3,000 mg daily added via nasogastric stopped dramatically status epilepticus. No significant adverse events were noted. In this case-report we showed that levetiracetam as add-on, had a rapid protection against clonic and mioclonic seizures. We conclude that adjunctive LEV should be considered for patients with status epilepticus unresponsive to initial therapy. [figure 1] 1 Lauren C. Frey, 1 Laura A. Strom, 1 Archana Shrestha, and 1 Mark C. Spitz ( 1 Neurology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: Specific withdrawal syndromes have been well-documented following the cessation of treatment with many drugs that affect the central nervous system, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Studies have investigated withdrawal symptoms associated with some of the older antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), but the existence of withdrawal syndromes associated with newer AEDs, including lamotrigine, has not yet been investigated. Methods: We reviewed the medication profiles of all patients seen by two of the authors at the University of Colorado epilepsy clinic in a six month period. Patients taking lamotrigine were identified and their charts reviewed for complaints of adverse effects of lamotrigine use. In addition, we reviewed the medication profiles of all patients seen in our epilepsy monitoring unit in the same six month period and identified those patients in whom lamotrigine had been decreased or stopped during the EMU admission. Results: We identified five clinic patients who complained of new psychological symptoms while taking lamotrigine. These symptoms included anxiety, emotional lability, irritability, feeling ?out of it? and having racing thoughts. In each case, these symptoms resulted in marked subjective distress and reliably occurred in the one to two hours before the patients were due to take their next dose of medication. All the patients were taking lamotrigine either once or twice a day. In addition, 29 of 84 consecutive EMU patients were taking lamotrigine, either alone or in combination therapy. Of those patients in whom only lamotrigine was withdrawn in the EMU, two complained of symptoms similar to those described by our clinic patients following their reduction in lamotrigine dose. These symptoms also caused notable patient distress. Conclusions: Withdrawal symptoms, although not widely reported in the literature, can occur in patients taking lamotrigine. This withdrawal syndrome consists largely of anxious feelings, irritability, and asthenia and can be very distressing to patients. Lamotrigine withdrawal symptoms can occur as an end-of dose phenomenon in the outpatient setting and can also complicate inpatient evaluation in the EMU setting. End-of-dose withdrawal from lamotrigine is a clinically significant adverse effect that can hamper successful treatment with this medication. Further study of withdrawal symptoms in this medication and the other newer AEDs is clearly needed. 1 Barry Gidal, 2 Jacqueline French, 3 Patricia Grossman, 4 Gwenael Le Teuff, and 5 Celine Bugli ( 1 School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ; 2 School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; 3 Global Outcomes Research, UCB, Atlanta, GA ; 4 Keyrus Biopharma, Levallois Perret, France ; and 5 LACO, Diegem, Belgium ) Rationale: While prevalence of antiepileptic drug/non-antiepileptic drug (AED) concomitant medication and interaction is described for elderly, few data exist regarding gender and age patterns of potentially clinically important PK interactions. Specifically, we report on prevalence of polytherapy across age and gender groups, but also describe patterns of cardiovascular and psychotropic drug. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in epilepsy patients using a US claims database (1/2001?12/2004). Patients were sub-grouped: enzyme inducing AEDs (EIAEDs) or non-inducing (NEIAEDs).Usage of concomitant medications taken during the six month after AED initiation was compared using Chi-squared tests for: Young Adults (YA)(18?34yo), Adults (A)(35?54), Older Adults (OA)(55?64), Young Old (YO)(65?74), Middle Old (MO)(75?84), Elderly (E)(85+). Results: A total of 9526 patients with epilepsy were identified: 6134 females and 3392 males; 5970 receiving EIAED and 3556 NEIAED. Overall, polytherapy was common and increased with age (table 1). Females are more likely to receive a concomitant medication regardless of AED use: EIAED (86%vs76%,p < 0.001); NEIAED (86%vs79%,p < 0.001). Compared to general population data (Sloan Survey, 2004), epilepsy patients in every age and gender group appeared to be significantly more likely to be receiving at least 5 concomitant medications: 23% of men and 39% of women with epilepsy age18?44 were on 5+ medications vs 2?3% in general population. In men and women age 45?64, this figure was 47?60% vs 10?15% in general population. Most frequent comedications are antipsychotics (YA:10%-YO:19%), SSRI antidepressants (YA:20%-YO:28%), TCA antidepressants (YA:7%-OA:11%), Calcium channel blockers (YA:3%-E:35%) and statins (YA:2%-YO:41%). Antidepressants are more common for females (SSRI:25%vs16%;TCA:9%vs5%). Concomitant Medications use in AED users by age and enzyme inducer 18?34 35?54 55?64 65?74 75?84 85+ Female EI 4.1 5.8 7.7 7.4 6.6 6.8 Female NEI 4.0 6.8 8.2 8.8 6.2 7.6 Male EI 2.2 4.1 5.8 6.5 6.7 7.8 Male NEI 2.8 5.2 7.2 7.2 8.9 7.4 Conclusions: Concomitant drug use occurs across all age groups, not simply the elderly. Not surprisingly, the occurrence of polypharmacy with potentially interacting medication appears to steadily increase with age. Discrimination in AED selection based upon potential PK interactions was not seen. While no specific gender differences were seen with cardiovascular medications, differing patterns of gender specific psychotropic drug use may exist. These findings suggest that clinicians must be mindful of polypharmacy and potential non-AED interactions in all age groups, not only elderly patients.

Elger ( 1 Epileptology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV), one of the newer antiepileptic drugs, is considered a save and successful drug against epilepsy in adults and children with symptomatic and also idiopathic epilepsy. Recent observations of aggression and irritability under LEV raised the question as to whether this effect depends on dose or drug load and whether personality traits represent a risk factor for negative behavioral change. Methods: The study comprised 288 consecutive pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients (mean age 38yrs., m/f 145/143) who were chronically on LEV (90% polytherapy). Efficacy and effects on cognition, mood and behavior were evaluated per structured interview, analogue rating scales, questionnaires on personality and impulsiveness, and per file inspection. Incidence and type of positive or negative effects as well as possible mediators like personality traits, dose of LEV, total drug load, seizure control, type of epilepsy, age and gender were of interest. Proxy reports were available from 135 relatives. Results: Good seizure control (no or very rare seizures) under LEV was reported by 40% of the patients, improvement (few remaining seizures) by another 40%, and no benefit by 20% (mean dose ?1000 mg, mean duration on LEV 2.3 yrs). Good responders had less AED and lower doses of LEV. Patients with symptomatic and idiopathic epilepsy responded equally well. Negative behavioral effects were reported from 37% of the patients (12% severe, 25% moderate), positive effects by 22% (6% very, 16% moderate). Side effects in either direction were independent of the time on LEV, dose, and drug load but they were significantly related to seizure control and personality traits. Positive change corresponded to analogue ratings of better concentration and memory and of greater activity and energy, and negative change to ratings of aggression (physical), agitation, impulsivity or depressed mood. Finally, negative side effects were related to symptoms related to organic brain syndrome and to non-planning impulsiveness. Analyses of proxy ratings indicated reliability of patient reports. Conclusions: A considerable number of patients subjectively experiences behavioral change under LEV. LEV appears a stimulating agent, which can act in two directions. The negative extension is characterized by reduced impulse control, emotional instability and irritability, where aggression only appears one extreme variant. The positive extension is characterized by increased activation/arousal and by positive effects on cognitive performance. Most importantly behavioral change is closely related to efficacy, in that good responders show more positive and less negative side effects than poor responders. [figure 1] (Supported by UCB Pharma.) 1 Helle Herrman, 1 Erik Taub?ll, and 1 Leif Gjerstad ( 1 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV) is a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug with a favourable safety profile. Haematological side effects including leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are rare, but are potentially serious. This is the first report of a patient who developed reversible trombocytopathia secondary to LEV use. Methods: A 57 year-old female with generalized tonic-clonic seizures of unknown etiology since the age of 31 developed marked ecchymoses 1 month after initiation of LEV. The ecchymoses remained as long as she was taking LEV (13 months), but disappeared immediately after cessation of the drug. The patient did not use any other drugs, was otherwise healthy, had never had any haematological diseases or bleeding predisposition before, and there was no family history of such. Results: The platelet count was unchanged during LEV treatment with 244, 276 and 275 ? 109/l before, during and after LEV treatment. Bleeding time on LEV treatment, however, was pathologically increased to 12 min (normal value 3?10), compared to 7.5 min without drug. Screening for other haematological parameters including coagulation factors VIII, IX, Von Willebrand factor, Ristocetin Co., white blood cell count, and general haematology was normal. Conclusions: This is the first report of LEV induced thrombocytopathia with increased bleeding time and ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia. Most likely, there has been a direct effect of the drug on trombocyte function. Alternatively, an effect on endothelial cells or vessel wall fragility can not be ruled out. 1,2 Erik Hessen, 1,3,2 Morten I. Lossius, 4 Ivar Reinvang, and 5 Leif Gjerstad ( 1 Helse ?st Health Services, Akershus University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ; 2 Deptartment of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ; 3 National Center for Epilepsy, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway ; 4 Deptartment of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; and 5 Deptartment of Neurology, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: The main cognitive side-effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) involve attention/vigilance, psychomotor speed and memory. Traditional neuropsychological testing has been the major method of measuring cognitive function related to the use of AEDs. Uncertainty exists regarding the degree of cognitive effects primarily because many studies do not adhere to basic standards of methodology and design. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of withdrawal of AEDs in patients on monotherapy and to evaluate the usefulness of a computerized assessment package that provide measures of reported side effects like attention, choice reaction time, psychomotor speed and memory. Methods: 150 subjects who had been seizure free > 2 years on drug monotherapy went through a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. The patients were included for 12 months or until seizure relapse. Cognitive function was assessed with the California Computerized Assessment Package at baseline and seven months after withdrawal. Results: The major finding in this study is that withdrawal of major AEDs significantly improved performance on tests that require complex cognitive processing under time pressure. Most of the subjects were medicated with carbamazepine and valproate. The outcome of withdrawal of carbamazepine was similar to the outcome for the total study population while discontinuation of valproate only revealed a non-significant tendency in the same direction. Conclusions: The results suggest that seizure-free epilepsy patients on monotherapy can obtain improvement in cognitive function if they withdraw anti-epileptic treatment and that computerized cognitive testing is useful in detecting cognitive side effects related to complex cognitive processing under time pressure.

Hirsch ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Retention, a measure of antiepileptic drug (AED) ?effectiveness,? is the percentage of patients started on a drug who remain on it after a given period of time, and is a composite measure of efficacy  3?5: refractory; 5+: very refractory. In each comparison, the individual AED was compared to the average of all other AEDs. Those who were seizure-free but stopped an AED in < 1 year due to side effects were excluded from the seizure-freedom analysis. Results: Overall, 319/413 (77.2%) patients remained on at least 1 AED for at least 1 year. The following were 12-month retention rates for each AED (*= p < 0.05 better, $= p < 0.05 worse, compared to average of other AEDs), listed from most to least effective: LTG* (75.6%; 90/119), LEV* (71.7%; 71/99), VPA (65.0%; 13/20), CLB (64.3%; 9/14), GBP (61.0%; 25/41), ZNS (58.8%; 10/17), TPM (52.4%; 11/21), PHT (50.0%; 7/14), CBZ (46.4%; 13/28), OXC$ (24.2%; 8/33). Relative rates were similar in refractory patients, except VPA (improved to 90.0%; 9/10, p < 0.1) and CBZ$ (dropped to 25%; 2/8). 12-month seizure-freedom rates were as follows (*= p < 0.05 better, $= p < 0.05 worse, compared to average of other AEDs), listed from most to least efficacious: LTG* (47.4%; 36/76), LEV (33.3%; 22/66), CBZ (23.1%; 6/26), VPA (20.0%; 3/15), GBP (17.9%; 5/28), TPM (17.6%; 3/17), PHT (16.7%; 2/12), OXC$ (6.5%; 2/31) and ZNS (0.0%; 0/15). Relative rates were similar in refractory  PHT, CBZ  2 Psychiatry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ; and 3 Pathology, Emory Univeristy School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: The treatment of women with epilepsy during pregnancy necessitates a balance between minimizing fetal exposure to AEDs while maintaining seizure control. Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is the only newer generation AED other than lamotrigine (LTG) with reasonable safety data during pregnancy. Reports of major malformation rates vary between 0?5%. However, EURAPregnancy Registry reported that use of OXC monotherapy was associated with an increased risk for GTCSzs, and the number or dosage of AEDs were most often increased in pregnancies treated with OXC or LTG monotherapy. This observational study did not report on serum concentrations or OXC clearance. About 50% of the metabolism of the 10-monohydroxy derivative (MHD) of OXC is via glucuronidation, which is especially susceptible to activation by the hormonal changes of pregnancy. MHD Clearance (Cl/F) Across Pregnancy and Postpartum: OXC Daily Dose (mg/kg)/MHD Serum Concentration (mg/L) # of Samples Cl/F (Total) % Change from Baseline Clu/F (Free) % Change from Baseline Postpartum (Baseline) 8 0.7 ± 0.2 1.6 ± 0.4 Trimester 1 2 1.0 ± 0.4 35.2 1.9 ± 1.0 22.7 Trimester 2 9 1.1 ± 0.5 54.9 2.2 ± 0.6 40.6 Trimester 3 8 1.3 ± 0.4 84.5 2.3 ± 0.7 47.3 Clearance reported as Mean ± Standard Deviation (Supported by a Specialized Center for Research P50 MH 68036.) Methods: 5 women (4 epilepsy, 1 bipolar disorder) treated with OXC (doses of 450?3000 mg/day) were consented and followed in a prospective observational study. Serum samples were obtained throughout pregnancy and until 5 months postpartum (n = 27). Postpartum samples were considered the non-pregnant baseline. Maternal plasma and umbilical cord samples were also collected at delivery (n = 4). Comparisons of the total apparent oral clearance(Cl/F) and free (unbound) apparent oral clearance (Clu/F) were made between the postpartum (baseline) and perinatal stages. Umbilical cord/maternal concentration ratios were calculated for total and free MHD. Results: Cl/F and Clu/F data from the postpartum and perinatal stages are reported in Table 1. Umbilical cord/maternal concentrations demonstrated a mean placental passage of 1.0 ± 0.3 (total) and 1.1 ± 0.2 (free) for MHD. Obstetrical outcome demonstrated mean APGAR scores of 8.5 ± 0.6 at 1 min, 9.0 ± 0.0 at 5 mins, birth weights of 3.2 ± 0.4 kg, and weeks at delivery of 39.4 ± 1.0. No major malformations were detected. Conclusions: During pregnancy, both total MHD Cl/F and free MHD Cl/F increase considerably, although the latter to a lesser degree. Substantial exposure occurs in utero with complete placental passage of OXC. Therapeutic drug monitoring of OXC may be helpful to prevent seizure deterioration during pregnancy and improve maternal and fetal outcomes. 1 Marcia J. Hunt, 1 Eljim P. Tesoro, 1 Jeffery J. Mucksavage, and 2 Yevgenya Kaydanova ( 1 Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL ; and 2 Department of Neurology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: The use of levetiracetam in the intensive care unit (ICU) has limited data. Phenytoin, a standard antiepileptic drug (AED) has numerous challenges in relation to dosing, administration, and adverse effects. Levetiracetam, a newer antiepileptic agent has a limited side effect profile and does not affect the cytochrome P450 pathway. This retrospective review will look at the use of levetiracetam in the ICU patient population at the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago (UIMCC) to date. The primary objective is to determine if levetiracetam is effective in preventing and/or treating seizures clinically and per electroencephalogram (EEG). The secondary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability, the reasons for initiating, and the usage pattern of levetiracetam in the ICUs at UIMCC. Methods: This study is a retrospective chart review of patients who received levetiracetam while in the ICU. Patients are included in this study if they are initiated on levetiracetam during January 2002 through October 2005 while they are hospitalized in the ICU. Exclusion criteria are patients <18 years of age and pregnant females. Data collected includes patient demographics, renal and liver function, EEG results, observed seizures in daily progress notes, dose of levetiracetam started, final dose of levetiracetam, rate of titration of dose, reason levetiracetam started, other AEDs patients receiving during hospitalization, and adverse events suspected of other AEDs and/or levetiracetam. Patients will be followed until levetiracetam is discontinued, patient is discharged from the hospital, or death occurs. Results: Preliminary results are available for 100 patients. Sixty-four percent of patients were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU). The most frequent initial dose (41%) and the most common final dosage (27%) of levetiracetam was 500 mg every 12 hours. Only 49% of patients had their dosage titrated up during hospitalizations. Most patients were either previously or currently on phenytoin as monotherapy (48%). Fifty-seven percent of patients were initiated on levetiracetam secondary to drug interactions or adverse effects of traditional AEDs. The most common adverse effect possibly related to levetiracetam was lethargy (8%). Eighty-seven percent of patients did not have a clinic seizure occur. Preliminary EEG results are available for 47 patients. A trend in reduction of ictal and interictal epileptiform activity was observed after initiation of levetiracetam and it appears EEGs improve as levetiracetam is continued. Conclusions: Levetiracetam is well tolerated in ICU patients and it is frequently initiated because of adverse effects and drug interactions of other AEDs. Based upon preliminary data, levetiracetam appears to have beneficial effects on EEG activity. (Supported by An unrestricted grant from UCB Pharma, Inc.) 1 Dorothee G.A. Kasteleijn Nolst Trenite, 2 Edouard Hirsch, 3 Bernd Schmidt, and 4 Jaqueline A. French ( 1 Pharmacology, NeuroActiveResearch, Bloemendaal, Netherlands ; 2 Neurology, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France ; 3 Neurology, Wittnau, Germany ; and 4 Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia ) Rationale: Despite authoritative reviews in 2005 on the subject of photosensitive patients and their epileptiform EEG responses to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS)(Fisher et al. Covanis, Verrotti et al., Kasteleijn et al.), gleaning the essential components necessary to effectively study a new AED in the photosensitivity model are not readily available. This work proposes a novel rationale for the use of the photosensitivity model in the development of new AEDs and perhaps as a surrogate marker for AED efficacy in epilepsy. The amended FDA laws (1992,1997) permit approval of a new AED on the basis of a AED's effect on a surrogate marker, one that can be reasonably expected to predict the clinical outcome (Katz R. The development of AEDs: regulatory perspective. In AEDs 5th Levy R et al.; Philadelphia 67?68, 2002). Methods: A survey of epileptologists with extensive experience in performance of studies in the photosensitivity model, was conducted to arrive at consensus statements for the clinical utility of the model in assessing the activity of potential new AEDs in epilepsy. Results: Advantages include: 1.The range of photoparoxysmal EEG responses (PPRs) is a stable, repeatable and objective measure of the epileptic state of the brain 2. The procedure of IPS establishing the photosensitivity ranges has been standardised with also clear diminishment of risks to evoke seizures (EU consensus) 3. Only a limited number of patients (20)during a limited time period (number of days 3?5) are necessary to have a reliable outcome 4. AEDs limit, reduce or even abolish the PPRs 5. The results provide some guidance as to the choice to dose in further phase II and III trials 6. Comparison of strength of effect of AEDs in the photosensitive patients 7. Correlation of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data 8. A first experience of the effect of a new AED on the EEG background can be established 9. Testing in female patients in an early stage of development 10. A PPR is found in patients with generalised as well as focal epilepsy types and syndromes and reflects a general susceptibility to epilepsy 11. AEDs effective in the photosensitivity model are effective also in epilepsy patients in general 12. Compliance is secured as well as monitoring of subjective and objective side-effects13. Flexibility of design with immediate results. Disadvantages include: 1. Only about 5% of patients above 18 years of age show a PPR 2. Photic stimulation may provoke a seizure 3. Highly skilled centers are necessary to perform such a study. Conclusions: The photosensitivity model offers an excellent way of testing efficacy and tolerability of AEDs in a very standardized, controlled and safe manner in the early development. 1 D.

Seletracetam is an investigational new drug structurally related to levetiracetam (LEV) with a higher affinity and similar high selectivity towards the specific SV2A binding site. LEV and brivaracetam have shown to be effective in this POP model before. Methods: A placebo-controlled, single blind, single period study, conducted in photosensitive patients with epilepsy, aged 18?60 years, taking no more than 2 other concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). During a 3 day period (with possible extension to 5 days) patients underwent standardized intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) to define the standard photosensitive range (SPR) at fixed time points. After the 1st day with placebo, single oral doses of seletracetam were given on the 2nd day, starting at 10 mg in a group of patients and testing subsequently lower or higher doses depending on the results of the previous group. Doses tested were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 mg. SPR was the main parameter to identify the lowest single dose of seletracetam producing maximal decrease or suppression of the IPS evoked photoparoxysmal EEG response (PPR) comparing the SPRs before and after intake of seletracetam. Plasma seletracetam was monitored up to 72 hours post-dose. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: 28 patients (23 F, 5 M) completed the study. One was excluded from the per protocol analysis due to emesis. 9 patients returned for a 2nd dosing 1?6 months later, providing a total of 36 individual exposures. Overall, 53% (19/36) patients showed a complete suppression of the epileptiform EEG response after seletracetam intake and 36% (13/36) showed an important decrease in SPR. The maximum SPR decrease from time-matched placebo was dose related and appeared to reach its maximal level at 10 mg. The pharmacokinetic and side-effect profile was similar to that in healthy volunteers. 18 patients (64%) reported 42 adverse events during the study (5 after placebo and 37 after seletracetam), without specific association with dose. Somnolence (32%), dizziness (21%), headache (14%), feeling drunk (7%) were reported following seletracetam, compared to <5% following placebo. Conclusions: Seletracetam was effective in reducing or even abolishing the photoparoxysmal EEG response in photosensitive patients with epilepsy. Maximal suppression was achieved at relatively low doses of 10 and 20 mg. Seletracetam is more potent in this model, compared to both LEV and brivaracetam. (Supported by UCB funded.) 1 Susan P. Kerls, 1 Anne E. Hammer, 1 Robert P. Kustra, and 2 Steve Chung ( 1 Neurosciences Medicine Development Center, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ; and 2 Adult Neurology Clinic, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: A recent study evaluated the cognitive effects of lamotrigine (LTG) and topiramate (TPM) adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizure disorders in adults. This analysis provides further examination of these results in patients over the age of 50. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluated the cognitive effects of TPM and LTG in addition to the safety and tolerability of TPM and LTG in older adult patients with partial seizures. Methods: Eligible patients had a diagnosis of partial epilepsy and were inadequately controlled by a regimen containing carbamazepine (CBZ) or phenytoin (PHT). Patients were evaluated and administered six cognitive tests at each of the three study phases: Baseline; Escalation (8 weeks) to 500 mg/day LTG or 300 mg/day TPM; Maintenance (8 weeks). An endpoint of the study was change from Baseline in the scores from the six standardized measures of cognition to the end of the Maintenance Phase. Statistical testing was performed using analysis of covariance methods. Results: The most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were dizziness (12% LTG, 4% TPM) and nausea (16% LTG, 4% TPM). More patients in the TPM group prematurely discontinued due to an AE (35% TPM, 28% LTG). Two of the thirteen patients in the TPM group that prematurely discontinued due to cognitive decline were considered related (15%). Ten patients in the LTG group that prematurely discontinued due to cognitive decline were not related. Of the 192 patients (96 LTG, 96 TPM) enrolled in the study, there was a statistically significant difference in three of the six cognitive tests in favor of LTG (COWA p < 0.001, Stroop Test p = 0.038, Symbol-Digit Modalities p < 0.001). Conclusions: Although no significant discontinuation rate was found, treatment with LTG compared to TPM resulted in significantly better cognitive test scores in certain cognitive domains for older adult patients with epilepsy. This finding was consistent with the result reported previously from the overall population in this study. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development.) 1 James F. Knudsen, and 2 Gerald Sokol ( 1 CDER, White Oak Research Facility, Silver Spring, MD ; and 2 H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: We and others have shown that in vitro, the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) zonisamide (ZNS) and topiramate (TPM) inhibit the zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, ion transport, and provision of HCO3?. Hippocampal neuronal GABAergic depolarization is reported to be dependent on HCO3? and thus on intracellular CA activity. We studied some aspects of cognitive impairment among patients exposed to TPM and other AEDs. Methods: We examined the incidence of treatment-emergent cognitive adverse events in placebo (PBO)-controlled studies of AEDs that are CA inhibitors (CAIs) (TPM, ZNS) vs. newer AEDs that are not known CAIs (tiagabine, TB; gabapentin, GP; lamotrigine, LG; and levetiracetam, LTA). We used data available from clinical PBO-controlled randomized add-on trials for each of the AEDs, because head-to-head comparisons of these drugs in premarketing clinical trials were lacking. Two cognitive variables examined were psychomotor slowing and concentration/memory impairment. Results: The incidence of psychomotor slowing was: TPM (n = 414) vs. PBO (n = 291), 21% vs. 2%; ZNS (n = 289) vs. PBO (n = 230), 4% vs. 2%; TB (n = 494) vs. PBO (n = 275), 10% vs. 5%; GP (n = 543) vs. PBO (n = 378), < 1% vs. < 1%; LG (n = 711) vs. PBO (n = 419), 2% vs. <1%; and LTA (n = 769) vs. PBO (n = 439), <1% vs. <1%. The incidence of impaired concentration/memory were: TPM vs. PBO, 28% vs. 5%; ZNS vs. PBO, 12% vs. 4%; and <1% for the remainder. Conclusions: From the clinically significant increase in the incidence of impaired concentration/memory in patients exposed to the CAIs TPM and ZNS vs. PBO and no observed effect of non-CAI AEDs relative to PBO, we hypothesized that CA and provision of HCO3? are important in neuronal homeostasis. CA acts as a molecular switch in the development of synchronous gamma-frequency firing of hippocampal pyramidal cells. [Ruusuvuori E., et al. J.Neurosci 2004;24:2699?2707]. GABAergic excitation and associated gamma oscillations seem dependent on CA activity, HCO3? availability, membrane pH gradients and provision for ionized calcium (adding H+ to a solution of HCO3? will generate more carbonic, CO2 and H2O). CAI may medicate some aspects of cognition as demonstrated by our report. 1,2 Marianna V. Spanaki, 1,2 Panayiotis N. Varelas, 1 Madhuri L. Koganti, and 1 Brien J. Smith ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, K-11, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment in the elderly represents a challenge due to limited data on their efficacy and side effect profile in older patients, high incidence of co-morbidities, and age-related changes in protein binding, gastrointestinal absorption, renal and hepatic clearance. In the last decade new AEDs with improved tolerability and reduced interaction potential have been available. The aim of the study was to determine whether the increased availability of new AEDs has influenced our prescribing habits in elderly epilepsy patients. Methods: We identified new referrals to Henry Ford Hospital epilepsy clinics in the last 3 years by searching our electronic database. We included patients older than 60 with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. We collected data on specialty of referring physician, age at epilepsy onset, etiology, AED upon initial evaluation, seizure control and calcium supplementation. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used for the analysis. Results: Of 349 new referrals, 49 (14%) were older than 60 (age range 60 to 91; females = 20). Primary care physicians referred 23 (47%) patients. Community neurologists referred the remainder, except for two referred by neurosurgeons. Thirty four patients (69.4%) were taking either one old or combination of old AEDs. Nineteen patients (38.7%) were on phenytoin monotherapy and 10 (20.4%) on phenytoin polytherapy. Twelve patients (24.5%) were taking carbamazepine as mono or polytherapy while 9 patients (18.4%) were on phenobarbital combination therapy. Only 11 patients (32%) on old AEDs were seizure free. In our patient group only 4 patients (8%) were taking new AED monotherapy. Calcium supplementation was recommended in only 3 patients (6%). There was a trend for primary care physicians (PCP) to prescribe older AEDs (95% of PCP vs 74% of neuro-specialists, p = 0.09) Conclusions: Our study showed that almost 70% of elderly are still being prescribed phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine despite their potential of multiple drug interactions, sedative and cognitive side effects, increased neurotoxicity at ?therapeutic doses? along with long term side effects such as osteoporosis. In our group, patients were maintained on old AEDs although they were effective in only 32% of them. Guidelines for calcium supplementation were not followed. Ten years after the approval of new AEDs, their use is still very limited in elderly for reasons that need to be further addressed. 1 Gregory Krauss, 2 Elinor Ben-Menachem, 3 Ruta Mameniskiene, 4 Nerija Vaiciene, 5 Melissa Brock, and 5 John Whitesides ( 1 Department of Neurology, John Hopkins Hospital Epilepsy Center, Baltimore, MD ; 2 Institution for Clinical Neuroscience and Physiology, Shalgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden ; 3 Department of Neurology, Vilnius University Hospital, Vilnius, Lithuania ; 4 Clinic of Neurology, Kaunas Medical University Hospital, Kaunas, Lithuania ; and 5 Schwarz Biosciences, Inc., Raleigh, NC ) Rationale: Lacosamide (LCM, SPM 927; formerly harkoseride) is a new chemical entity being developed as an oral and intravenous (iv) formulation for treatment of partial seizures and neuropathic pain. LCM has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and when given orally twice daily (bid) has been shown to reduce seizure frequency in subjects. LCM solution for iv infusion (10 mg/mL) is being developed as short-term replacement for oral LCM. Infusion of 200mg iv LCM over 30- or 60-minutes has been shown to be bioequivalent (Cmax, AUC) to 200mg oral LCM. The objectives of SP757 were to investigate whether iv LCM was safe and well tolerated when given bid as short-term adjunctive therapy in subjects with partial seizures and to identify the appropriate infusion rate(s). Methods: Subjects (n = 101) receiving adjunctive, stable, bid dosing with oral LCM (200 to 600 mg/day) were progressively studied in 3 cohorts: 30-min infusion (n = 40); 15-min infusion (n = 41); 10-min infusion (n = 20). A fourth cohort (15-min infusion, n = 60) was recently completed and those data are under review. Subjects were administered iv LCM bid for 2?5 days. Treatment duration was at the discretion of the investigator and subject. After trial completion subjects resumed treatment with oral LCM. Safety was evaluated through reported adverse events (AEs); 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital sign data collection; and clinical laboratory data. Seizure data were collected in a diary. A Data Monitoring Committee reviewed safety data from each completed cohort prior to initiation of subsequent cohorts. Results: All subjects were administered 2 days of iv LCM bid; 47 (77%) of subjects from the 15- and 10-min infusion groups were dosed for 3?5 days. A total of 16% of subjects took 200 mg/day, 48% of subjects took 300?400 mg/day and 36% of subjects took 500?600 mg/day LCM. Dizziness was the most commonly reported AE; frequency ranged from 5% in the 15- and 10-min groups to 8% in the 30-min infusion group. Infusion site related AEs were infrequently reported and did not result in discontinuation of iv LCM. Mean vital sign results remained stable during and following iv LCM infusion. Seizure patterns for individual subjects did not appear to change during the trial period. Conclusions: In this trial, lacosamide solution for intravenous infusion (administered over 10, 15, or 30 minutes) was successfully used as short-term replacement for oral lacosamide in subjects with partial seizures.

Jacobson ( 1 Neurology, Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: To examine possible interactions in patients taking both antiepileptic and psychiatric medications, thereby identifying their impact on non-compliance with these drugs. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to identify subjects with epilepsy seen in the past year at the epilepsy clinic of Temple University Hospital. 803 subjects were identified, and 500 were eligible for this study based on a clear diagnosis of epilepsy, use of at least one antiepileptic drug at the last clinic visit, and availability of mental health information in the charts. A psychiatric diagnosis was not required to be in this study. 110 subjects were then randomly selected in proportions that matched the race and gender demographical ratios of the overall epilepsy patient pool at the clinic. Results: Of 110 subjects, 41% were African-American (AA) (27 F, 18 M), 36% Caucasian (25 F, 15 M), 18% Hispanic (10 F, 10 M), and 5% Asian (3 M, 2 F). 58% of patients were female with an age range of 19 to 77 years. Males ranged from 18 to 71 years. The incidence of concurrent psychiatric and epilepsy diagnoses was 63% (n = 69). Of these, 35% (24 of 69) were non-compliant with psychiatric medication. Among this group, men had the highest rate of non-compliance (80% of Hispanics, 36% of Caucasians, 33% of AAs were non-compliant). Women had lower rates of non-compliance with psychiatric medication (33% of Caucasians, 32% of AAs, and 13% of Hispanics were non-compliant). Among compliant subjects (45 of 69), 40% (n = 18) were on antiepileptic and psychiatric medications that were known to have at least one potential interaction with each other. Of these 18 subjects, the groups with the highest prevalence rate of potential medication interactions were AA males (n = 5), Hispanic females (n = 4), AA females (n = 5), Caucasian males (n = 3), Caucasian females (n = 1), and Hispanic males (n = 0). The most common psychiatric diagnosis in patients with epilepsy was depression (52% of all psychiatric diagnoses). Conclusions: In our study, there was a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy. Among compliant subjects, there was a high rate of potential interaction between antiepileptic and psychiatric medications. Among the 110 subjects however, there were no recognized clinical events attributed to drug interactions. AA males and Hispanic females were the groups with highest rate for potential interactions, yet were more likely to be compliant with psychiatric medications than other groups. This suggests that drug interactions are not only the reason for medication non-compliance. Clinicians need to be aware of cultural, gender, and social differences among epileptic persons taking psychiatric medications. Other factors such as insurance coverage, mental health services access, neurology clinic access, communication between Psychiatrists and Neurologists, and efficacy of psychiatric and neurologic medicines will impact compliance. 1 Michael Lamson, 2 Diane Sitki-Green, 1 Gerald Wannarka, and 3 William Gershon ( 1 Pharmacokinetics, King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cary, NC ; 2 Clinical Research, Lineberry Research Associates, RTP, NC ; and 3 Clinical Research, SFBC International, Miami, FL ) Rationale: An autoinjector delivery system for intramuscular (i.m.) administration of diazepam (Vanquix? Auto-Injector) is being developed as an alternative to diazepam rectal administration, the only current treatment that can be administered by non-health care professionals for management of patients with acute repetitive seizures (ARS). Methods: The study was conducted as a 2-part, randomized, open-label, single-dose, crossover design in healthy young (ages 18?40 years) adult volunteers. Part I of the study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Vanquix? 5, and 15 mg administered i.m. into the mid outer thigh. Part II evaluated the relative bioavailability of Vanquix? 10 mg compared with diazepam rectal gel (Diastat?) 10 mg administered according to the product label. Serial sampling of plasma, vital signs, and adverse event assessments were done a specified times. Treatments were separated by a 2-week washout period. Results: A total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the study, 24 in each part. In Part I of the study, administration of Vanquix? 5, 10, and 15 mg i.m. resulted in a proportional increase of the diazepam Cmax and AUC, and a consistent Tmax of 1.0 hour at each dose level. In Part II of the study, i.m. administration of Vanquix? 10 mg resulted in plasma concentrations of both the diazepam and desmethyldiazepam that were slightly higher and less variable than those observed following diazepam rectal gel 10 mg. Two subjects had negligible absorption of diazepam from the rectal route of administration, which skewed the PK results for the reference drug. Excluding the tow outliers, the geometric mean ratio (Vanquix? Auto-Injector/Diastat?) and 90% CIs for diazepam Cmax and AUC(O-t) were 0.94 [0.84, 1.05] and 1.14 [1.08, 1.21], respectively, indicating that the overal bioavailability of Vanquix? was approximately 14% higher than that of diazepam rectal gel (Diastat?). Both treatments were generally safe and well-tolerated. Although the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was higher with Vanquix? Auto-Injector compared with Diastat? (21.7%versus 13.6%), the difference could be attributed to injection site pain. Injection site pain also correlated with the Vanquix? dose administered in Part I: 5 mg (4.3%), 10 mg (21.7%), and 15 mg (27.3%). No other AEs correlated with dose, and there was no evidence of respiratory depression with either drug. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that diazepam can be safely and reliably delivered to the systematic circulation using Vanquix? Auto Injector. The slight (14%) difference in bioavailability between Vanquix? Auto Injector and diazepam rectal gel is of questionable clinical importance and suggests that the two dosage forms could be interchanged on a mg per mg basis.

Brodie, 1 Graeme Sills, 1 Linda Stephens, and 1 Elaine Butler ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, United Kingdom ) Rationale: We undertook a randomised, open-label study to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and androgenic effects of lamotrigine (LTG) and sodium valproate (VPA) monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods: A total of 226 patients with a recent diagnosis of epilepsy were randomised (on an equal basis) to receive either LTG or VPA. Median age at recruitment was 35 years (range = 13 to 80 years). Sixty patients presented with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, 149 patients had localisation-related epilepsy, and 17 remained unclassified. Subjects were followed up at six-weekly intervals until reaching one of the study end points (1 year seizure freedom, withdrawal due to side effects, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy). In addition, basic androgenic function was assessed by longitudinal analysis of serum testosterone and androstenedione concentrations. Results: A total of 197 patients reached an end point. Median dose of VPA was 1000 mg/day (range 600 ? 3000 mg/day), while the median dose of LTG was 200 mg/day (range 100 ? 700 mg/day). Seizure freedom rates were similar for both drugs (67% and 60% for VPA- and LTG-treated patients, respectively). Withdrawal due to side effects was required in 24 VPA patients and 14 LTG patients. Similar numbers were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy (18 VPA, 15 LTG). Longitudinal assessment of androgenic function showed no significant change in either treatment arm. Conclusions: No significant differences were noted in measures of outcome (efficacy or tolerability) in groups of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy treated with either VPA or LTG. Androgenic function was not affected by either treatment. (Supported by: This study was partly supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Sanofi.) 1 P.T. Leese, 2 D.R. Goldwater, 4R.

Stockis ( 1 Phase-I Services, Quintiles Inc, Lenexa, KS ; 2 Clinical Research Unit, Parexel Inc, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Clinical Pharmacology, UCB Inc, Smyrna, GA ) Rationale: Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is an investigational new drug structurally related to levetiracetam with a higher affinity and similar high selectivity towards the specific SV2A binding site. The anticipated pharmacologically active dose in humans is around 15 mg based on animal models of epilepsy. Methods: Single and multiple rising dose studies of seletracetam were performed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled manner. Healthy male volunteers were enrolled. For the single administration, 3 alternating panels of 9 subjects received the following doses: 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mg (6 active: 3 placebo). Food effect was assessed in an additional group of 8 subjects. For the multiple dose administration, 3 different panels of 12 subjects (9 active: 3 placebo) received 20, 60 and 200 mg twice daily during 2 weeks. CNS effects were explored with psychomotor tests, rating scales and neurological assessments. Results: The maximum single dose of 600 mg and the maximum repeated dose of 400 mg/day were well tolerated. During multiple dosing, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44%, 89%, 78% and 100% of subjects receiving placebo, 20, 60 and 200 mg b.i.d., respectively. The most frequent were dizziness, drowsiness, euphoria and feeling drunk. Most appeared shortly after first dosing, were of mild or moderate intensity, and lasted for less than 12 hours. In most subjects, the AEs did not reappear when given the next dose. AE severity was mild to moderate. There were no serious AEs and no changes in laboratory, vital signs, ECGs or neurological examinations. Seletracetam pharmacokinetics were linear, dose-proportional and time invariant, with a plasma half-life of 8 hours. Co-administration with a high fat meal resulted in reduced absorption rate and no change in AUC. Conclusions: The maximum tolerated dose of seletracetam was > 600 mg after single dose and >400 mg/day after 2 weeks of repeated dosing. Its favorable pharmacokinetics and good tolerability, with AEs limited to mild to moderate CNS effects at initial dosing, are encouraging for the continued clinical development of this new antiepileptic drug.

Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX ) Rationale: Used medicinally for more 2,000 years, ginseng has been shown to have biological activity in a number of systems. The possibility that ginseng may have anticonvulsant activity was first suggested in 2002. The purpose of this study was to test the anticonvulsant activity of three preparations of American ginseng (whole root extract, whole leaves/stems extract and a partially purified extract that concentrates the Rb ginsenosides (Rb extract)) and to identify the active components in the Rb extract. Methods: One hour after treatment with normal saline or one of the ginseng preparations, seizures were induced in adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats with kainic acid (10 mg/kg), pilocarpine (300 mg/kg, preceded by methylscopolamine 1 mg/kg sc) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 50 mg/kg ip or 90 mg/kg sc). Time to onset of seizure activity, duration of seizure activity (for PTZ), seizure severity and weight change for KA and pilocarpine were determined for each animal. The brains from animals who had received kainic acid or pilocarpine were examined for neurodegeneration and severe neuronal stress, using fluorojade staining and immunoreactivity for HSP72, respectively. Results: The Rb extract had a dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect in all three models of chemically-induced seizures ? increasing the latency to the seizures, decreasing the seizure score, weight loss and subsequent neuronal damage after pilocarpine and kainic acid, and shortening the seizure duration and reducing mortality after PTZ. In some animals, the Rb extract completely blocked behavioral seizures after administration of kainic acid. The root preparation increased the mortality rate after administration of pilocarpine, but had no other significant effects. The leaves/stems preparation reduced the weight loss after pilocarpine, but had no other significant effects. The individual ginsenosides significantly increased the latency to onset of seizures after administration of kainic acid. Mixtures of purified Rb1, Rb3 with or without Rd had significant anticonvulsant effects in all three models of acutely-induced seizures demonstrating that the ginsenosides are the active components in the Rb extract. Conclusions: Ginseng extract made from either the root or leaves/stems are ineffective against chemically-induced seizures. A partial purification of the whole extract that concentrates the Rb1 and Rb3 ginsenosides has significant anticonvulsant properties. Since no one individual ginsenoside accounted for the majority of the activity of the Rb extract, the results suggest that the most effective anticonvulsant product is a combination of ginsenosides from the Rb group. In addition, the Rb extract and the individual ginsenosides have significant neuroprotective activity beyond the reduction in seizure severity and duration.

Standring ( 1 Department of Neurology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL ; and 2 Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL ) Rationale: Levetiracetam is a novel anticonvulsant with a side-effect and pharmacokinetic profile which recommends it use in a number of clinical settings,including the patient who presents to the emergency room with acute onset siezures. Levetiracetam is particularly useful if patients are taking multiple other medications since it is renally excreted, non-protein-bound and neither inhibits nor induces hepatic enxzymes. An intravenous formulation of levetiracetam is not yet available for general use and many physicians have concerns regarding oral loading of anticonvulsants in the acute setting. Concerns regarding the need to achieve a rapid therapeutic level of an anticonvulsant were addressed by means of simultaneous intravenous loading of fosphenytoin or phenytoin combined with oral loading of levetiracetam, followed by levetiracetam monotherapy. Methods: Several patients were managed in the manner described above in the acute hospital setting, mainly emergency room admissions and but also some inpatients who suffered seizures in other clinical settings. Intravenous fosphenytoin was given at doses of 15?20 mgs/kg and combined with oral loading doses of levetiracetam ranging from 1000 ? 1500 mgs. A retrospective chart review was carried out to assess the efficacy of this approach in terms of short-term seizure control and side effect profile. Results: A total of 20 patients were identified who were treated according to this protocol. No adverse events were reported related to the use of oral levetiracetam dosing (1000?1500 mgs oral loading dose) although one patient suffered purple-glove syndrome due to phenytoin infusion. All patients remained seizure free over the 72 hours following combined loading, by which time levetiracetam concentrations had acheived steady-state concentrations. The majority were discharged on levetiracteam monotherapy and these patients were followed-up on an out-patient basis to assess long-term efficacy and side-effect profile. Conclusions: An intravenous preparation of levetiracetam will be available in the near future, however approval for intravenous loading as a first line therapy in the acute setting is unlikely to be obtained in the short-term. The approach outlined in this study combines the safety and experience of intravenous fosphenytoin loading with the pharmacokinetic advantages of maintenance LEV therapy. The use of one loading dose of fosphenytoin addresses the main concern of clinicians in the acute setting, namely the acheivement of immediate theraputic anticonvulsant levels, this is combined with the pharmacokinetic advantages of levetiracetam maintenance therapy. Based on the limited data available in this retrospective analysis, this approach appears to be safe and effective in terms of immediate seizure control and long-term maintenance therapy.

Our objective was to study the efficacy and tolerability of PGB when used in every day clinical practice to treat refractory patients in two tertiary centers. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 101 patients (60 women, 41 men) who received PGB as add on treatment for refractory seizures, at the Epilepsy Units of Hospital Clínic (Barcelona, Spain) and Hospital Joseph Trueta (Girona, Spain). Mean age was 40 years (16?64), mean time from seizure onset was 22 years (7?53), mean number of concomitant AEDs was 2.8. Most patients had temporal lobe epilepsy (43 patients), followed by frontal lobe epilepsy (29), unlocalized focal epilepsy (23 patients), parieto-occipital epilepsy (4 patients) and multifocal epilepsy (2). Seizures were highly refractory, with a mean number of seizures per month of 48.5. Mean follow up was 8 months (3?14). Results: Mean PGB dose used was 412.5 mg. Fifty three patients (52%) were responders (had ≥ 50% seizure reduction). A significant number of patients (14, 13.8%) became seizure free. Seizure frequency increased in 4 patients (3.6%). Three patients reported similar number of seizures but less severity (shorter seizures or absence of generalized tonic clonic convulsions). PGB was generally well tolerated. Sixty per cent of patients reported adverse events, being weight gain > 10% the most frequent, seen in 25 patients (24.7%). Dizziness/ataxia was seen in 14 patients (13.8%). Seven patients (6.9%) displayed lower limb edema not accompanied by metabolic disturbance, and 4 patients (3.9%) had dose-dependent blurred vision. Adverse effects were generally mild to moderate in severity. Twenty two patients discontinued PGB, either because of adverse effects (9 patients), inefficacy (6) or both (7 patients). Prescribing physicians rated 18 patients (17.8%) as ?highly improved,? 42 patients (41.5%) as ?improved,? 33 patients (32%) as ?unchanged,? 6 patients (5.9%) as ?worse? and 4 patients as ?much worse? (3.9%). Conclusions: PGB, when used in every day clinical practice, is effective and safe as add-on treatment in refractoy epilepsy. In our series of highly refractory patients, 52% had at least a 50% seizure reduction and 14% of patients became seizure free. Most frequent adverse events were weight gain and dizziness/ataxia. Most patients were rated as highly improved or improved by the prescribing physician. 1 Roberta Meo, 2 Leonilda Bilo, 2 Patrizia Ruosi, and 2 Maria Fulvia de Leva ( 1 Neurology Outpatients Service, Azienda Sanitaria Locale Napoli 1, Naples, Italy ; and 2 Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurological Sciences, Federico II University, Naples, Italy ) Rationale: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy in patients with post-traumatic epilepsy. Methods: Six patients with post-traumatic epilepsy entered the study. All presented complex partial seizures, with secondary generalization in 3 cases. At study enter 3 patients were already treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): these patients were seizure free but all reported severe side effects related to AED treatment. The remaining 3 patients were not treated at study entry: two of them had received AEDs in the past, but had discontinued treatment because of side effects, while the last one was a 70-year old man who had never been treated with AEDs and who reported also severe memory disturbances after the trauma. These 3 patients still presented seizures. LEV was initially given as add on therapy in the 3 treated patients: concomitant AED treatment was slowly withdrawn in the following months and the patients were left on LEV monotherapy. The 3 untreated patients received LEV in monotherapy since the beginning. Follow up with LEV monotherapy was at least 12 months in all patients. Results: In the 3 patients who were already seizure free, switch from previous AED treatment to LEV monotherapy was accompanied by persisting complete control of seizures; side effects related to previous AED treatment disappeared with relevant improvement of quality of life. In the 3 untreated patients LEV resulted in complete seizure control without side effects. The elderly patient showed also a considerable improvement of memory disturbances, possibly related to control of infraclinic seizures. Conclusions: In our small series LEV was effective in treating post-traumatic seizures, showing also a good tolerability without adverse effects on memory, behaviour and cognitive state. This is particularly important since memory disturbances and cognitive impairment are frequent after severe head trauma. 1 John A. Messenheimer, and 2 Marianne Cunnington ( 1 Neurosciences Medicine Development Center, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ; and 2 Epidemiology, GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom ) Rationale: To characterize the overall risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) associated with exposure to lamotrigine. The international registry forms part of an epidemiologic safety program monitoring pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to lamotrigine that has been in operation since 1992. Methods: Physicians report exposure to lamotrigine during pregnancy and subsequent outcomes on a voluntary basis. Prospective reporting (prior to any knowledge regarding the possible outcome of the pregnancy) early in pregnancy is encouraged. Major congenital malformations (MCMs) are classified according to the Centers for Disease Control criteria and are reviewed by a paediatrician. The percentage of MCMs is calculated using only prospective first trimester lamotrigine monotherapy and polytherapy exposures. Conclusions are developed and endorsed by a scientific advisory committee. Results: As of September 2005, 20 MCMs were observed among 707 first trimester monotherapy exposures yeilding a risk of 2.8% (95% CI 1.8%? 4.4%). The observed risk among 118 lamotrigine and valproate polytherapy exposures was 11.8% (95% CI 6.8%? 19.3%) and was 2.7% (95% CI 1.2%? 5.8%) among 256 exposures to lamotrigine polytherapy without valproate. The mean and median monotherapy doses for subjects with MCMs respectively were 250.7 and 200 mg/day; the mean and median doses for those without defects were 281.1 and 200 mg/day. No consistent pattern of malformation types was observed. Conclusions: The current data do not indicate any substantial increase in the overall risk of major defects associated with prenatal lamotrigine exposure, though the sample size is insufficient to allow definitive conclusions concerning specific defect types. The higher frequency of major malformations following lamotrigine-valproate polytherapy exposure was consistent with publications on valproate monotherapy. Continued registration of exposed pregnancies will enhance the statistical power of the study and the data available for physicians to assess the benefit-risk of lamotrigine use in pregnancy.

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA ) Rationale: Weight gain is associated with valproic acid/divalproex sodium therapy. However, long-term data which quantifies weight changes seen in epilepsy patients receiving the drug is lacking. We report on the long-term changes that occur in patients taking the drug. Methods: Patients started on valproic acid (VPA) in the form of divalproex sodium at Penn State, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center were offered the opportunity to participate in the study. Initial weights were recorded prior to starting therapy. Weights were recorded at each visit on the same digital scale. Concomitant medications were recorded. Results: Forty-two patients entered the study. One was lost to follow-up, leaving 41 patients for analysis. There were 17 female and 24 male patients. Mean age was 33.1 years with a range of 17 to 69 years of age. Focal onset seizures were present in 27 patients, 5 were primary generalized, and 9 patients had features of both, making it difficult to determine the class. Mean VPA dosage was 1659 mg/day with mean VPA doses ranging from 500 ? 4846 mg/day. Time on therapy ranged from 12 ? 138 months with a mean of 56 months. Mean starting weight was 75.4 kg with a range from 46.4 ? 131.8 kg. Weight gain was defined as an increase in weight of 5% or more while on VPA therapy. Weight gain was seen in 26 patients (63.4%) with the mean weight gained at time of maximum weight being 19% of initial body weight. Weight gain ranged from 5.18%? 56.5% of initial weight. Four patients did not maintain maximum weight and by the end of the study, only 22 patients (53.7%) had weights greater than 5% of start weights. Mean time to maximal weight gain was 44.2 months, with a range of 10 ? 124 months. Male patients had a higher tendency toward weight gain, with 17 of the 24 males (70.8%) experiencing weight gain. Of 17 female patients, 9 (52.9%) demonstrated weight gain. A comparison based on seizure type was also looked at, but numbers were small. Fifteen of 27 (55.6%) focal onset patients and 3 of 5 (60%) patients with primary generalized onset experienced weight gain. Interestingly, 8 of the 9 patients with features of both focal and generalized onset demonstrated weight gain. Patients with weight gain were on a mean VPA dose of 1791 mg/day, compared to 1429 mg/day in patients without weight gain. Conclusions: Weight gain occurred in 63.4% of patients receiving VPA, although only 53.7% demonstrated weight gain by the end of the study. The mean maximum weight gained was 19% of initial body weight. Mean time to maximum weight was 44.2 months. Weight gain was more likely in male patients and patients on higher dosages of VPA. No significant difference was noted in focal onset versus primary generalized, although numbers for the latter were small. Interestingly, 88.9% of patients with features of both focal onset and primary generalized epilepsy (unclear onset) demonstrated weight gain. 1 James M. Miller, 1 Anne E. Hammer, 1 Robert P. Kustra, and 1 John A. Messenheimer ( 1 Neurosciences Medicine Development Centre, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: Approximately 30% of people with epilepsy (PWE) spontaneously report depressed mood as a significant problem having a negative effect on quality of life (QoL). Within the general population, over half of adults with depression also suffer from a diagnosable anxiety disorder. Increasingly, the literature suggests that PWE may also experience significant symptoms of anxiety. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) evaluates a wide number of mood states, including anxiety, and is useful for evaluating drug therapy interventions. The 31-item Quality of Life Inventory in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) is a validated questionnaire which measures epilepsy-specific items such as seizure worry and broader items such as emotional well being and social functioning. Lamotrigine (LTG) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) that has been shown to improve mood, social interaction and overall wellbeing in PWE. This analysis investigated the correlation of anxiety with depression and quality of life in PWE and comorbid depressive symptoms, and changes following the addition of LTG to AED therapy. Methods: This was a multicenter open-label study. Lamotrigine was added onto a stable AED regimen in the adjunctive phase and became a single agent in the monotherapy phase. Patients were eligible if they had epilepsy, exhibited depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) ≥ 12] but excluded if they had a Major Depressive Disorder as determined by a Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Depression was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); anxiety and quality of life were measured with the POMS anxiety domain and QOLIE-31 scale respectively. Evaluations were conducted at baseline, at the end of the adjunctive phase (Week 19) and the monotherapy phase (Week 36). Statistical analysis was done using paired t-tests and Spearman correlations. Results: A total of 158 PWE (102 women, 56 men) enrolled into the study; 96 patients completed the adjunctive phase and 66 completed monotherapy. Mean baseline, end of adjunctive and monotherapy scores for BDI-II were 17.4, 11.6, and 7.7; for POMS anxiety, the scores were 14.9, 11.8 and 9.4; for QOLIE-31 the scores were 53.1, 64.8 and 72.3. POMS anxiety scores correlated with BDI-II at baseline (0.584) and with QOLIE-31 (?0.571); after adjunctive therapy, correlations were 0.618 and ?0.591. With monotherapy, the correlations were 0.610 and ?0.631. All change scores were significant at p < 0.001 and all correlations were significant at p < 0.0001. Conclusions: This evaluation suggests that anxiety is present in PWE who also exhibit depressive symptoms, and may contribute to low QoL scores reported in this population. The addition of LTG to the AED regimen significantly improved measures of both anxiety and depression with resulting improvement in quality of life.

Bromfield ( 1 Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Early post-operative seizures are well recognized and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used despite limited evidence of a prophylactic or antiepileptogenic benefit. Phenytoin (PHT), the most commonly used AED, has well known adverse reactions. Levetiracetam (LEV) has a low incidence of serious reactions. However, its safety and efficacy in the perioperative period have not been evaluated. Methods: A research patient database was used to identify nonepileptic patients who had supratentorial neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's or Massachusetts General Hospitals, during a five year period (1/1999?12/2004) and were followed for at least 7 days. The electronic medical records of patients who received LEV monotherapy were analyzed. A control group consisting of PHT monotherapy patients (2:1 vs. LEV) was randomly selected. The following procedures were excluded: pressure measurement devices, external and internal ventricular drainage. Records were reviewed for rate of seizures (at presentation, 1 week postoperatively, and development of epilepsy in those patients followed for at least one year). The other main outcome assessed was rate of adverse reactions during the postoperative period. Chi-square and Fisher's tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Results: 105 LEV patients were identified. They were 39% male. Mean age was 55 (range 29?88). The 210 PHT patients were 47% male. Mean age was 64 (range 23?95). LEV dose ranged from 500 to 3000 mg/d, with 1000 mg/d used most frequently. The LEV diagnoses were 41% glial tumors, 10% meningiomas, 11% metastases, 21% hemorrhages, 10% vascular malformations, 4% infections, and 3% other. The PHT diagnoses were 27% glial tumors, 17% meningiomas, 13% metastases, 24% hemorrhages, 7% vascular malformations, 2% infections, and 10% other. Of the 105 LEV patients, 33 had presented with a seizure vs 57/210 PHT patients (p = 0.26). 1 LEV patient (1%) had an early postoperative seizure (within the first 7 days), vs 9 PHT patients (4%) (p = 0.28). Mean follow-up for the LEV group was 12 mo, vs 20 mo for PHT. 42 LEV patients were followed for one year or more and 11/42 (26%) developed epilepsy, vs 42/117 (36%) on PHT (p = 0.32). Adverse reactions prompting a change in AED during the hospitalization occurred in 1/105 (1%) LEV patients (visual hallucinations), vs 38/210 (18%) PHT patients (p < 0.001). These reactions consisted of allergy (2), rash (22), fever (8), tremors (1), cytopenia (3), rhabdomyolysis (1), and cognitive change (1). Of the LEV group with epilepsy followed for at least 12 months, 7/11 remained on levetiracetam (64%) vs 11/42 (26%) on phenytoin (p = 0.025). Conclusions: Both LEV and PHT are associated with a low risk of early post-operative seizures and a moderate risk of later epilepsy. LEV is associated with significantly fewer adverse reactions, an attractive feature particularly when an agent is being used prophylactically, as well as with a higher retention rate in patients who developed epilepsy.

Elliott ( 1 Neurology, Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ) Rationale: Osteoporosis (OP) is an important complication of long term anti-epileptic treatment in patients with epilepsy. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation have been traditionally used to prevent this condition. Although bisphosphonates are approved for treatment and prevention of OP in post-menopausal women and with men with osteoporosis, there is paucity of evidence measuring the efficacy of this group of medications in men receiving anti-epileptic treatment. Methods: Retrospective review of charts of all male subjects with epilepsy at our center identified subjects with OP secondary to chronic antiepileptic therapy. Treatment and response to treatment for men with OP were investigated, specifically by looking at response to bisphosphonates as assessed by DEXA scan. Standard practice in our center is to recommend calcium, vitamin D and exercise for all individuals, regardless of bone density. Results: Seventy three male subjects were screened. Twenty six had Osteopenia and 15 had OP. Nine of the OP subjects received bisphosphonates as a part of their treatment. Of these, 5 (mean age 43.6; range 23?69 years) completed a second DEXA scan by 6/1/06. Calcium, vitamin D and exercise were recommended for all 5 subjects, but only 2/5 could perform moderate exercise. Table 1 demostrates the T scores of OP subjects at baseline, and after treatment with bisphosphonates. Comparison of T scores of subjects with OP before and after treatment with bisphosphanates Subject # DEXA 1(spine) DEXA 1(hip) DEXA 2(spine) DEXA 2(hip) Interval (months) 1 ?1.8 ?3.5 ?1.9 ?3.5 17 2 ?3.6 ?2.9 ?3.3 ?2.9 18 3 ?3.7 ?1.8 ?4.7 ?1.4 26 4 ?3.0 ?2.7 23 5 ?4.1 ?1.8 ?3.2 ?1.6 30 As shown in the table, 80% (4/5) of the subjects had either stabilization or increase in their bone density after being treated with bisphosphonates. Of the 4 responders, only on demonstrated increased bone density. Conclusions: Bisphosphonate therapy appears effective in reducing the progression of osteoporosis in men using antiepileptic medications. Specific patient co-morbidities could contribute to this observation, but it may be important to prevent, screen and treat metabolic bone disease much earlier in men with epilepsy. This is an on-going study; as more males with OP complete 18 months of bisphosphonate therapy, these results may change. 1 Kevin Nanry, 2 Eugene Ramsay, 3 Martha Sajatovic, 1 Eric Bourne, and 1 Thomas Thompson ( 1 Psychiatry, GlaxoSmithKline, RTP, NC ; 2 International Center Epilepsy, University of Miami, Maimi, FL ; and 3 Psychiatry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: In spite of wide clinical use, there is a paucity of data on anticonvulsant drugs in elderly patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders. The authors conducted a systemized analysis of the literature on lamotrigine (LTG) therapy in elderly patients with BD, epilepsy, or dementia. Methods: The search included electronic databases, meeting abstracts and presentations. Results: Fourteen reports included controlled trials, retrospective analyses, and case studies. Reports of LTG in geriatric BD suggest improvement in depression, core manic symptoms and delay in mood relapse. Mean dose in larger samples was 182?240 mg/day. Controlled trials in geriatric epilepsy demonstrated efficacy and tolerability comparable to gabapentin. Compared to carbamazepine, there were fewer treatment withdrawals and fewer cases of somnolence or rash in the lamotrigine group. Preliminary reports in dementia note improvement in cognition, agitation and depression. While elimination of LTG can be affected by increasing age, disposition is more directly impacted by concurrent anticonvulsant therapy. There is extensive variability in LTG concentration/dose (C/D) ratios across the age-span, but as a group C/D ratios increase through adulthood. Conclusions: LTG appears effective and was well tolerated in older adults with BD, epilepsy and dementia. Incidence and severity of adverse events appears similar to that established in younger patient populations. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 Wayne M. Alves, 1 Yuhua Li, 2 Virinder Nohria, on behalf of the 212 Study Investigators ( 1 Research  and 2 Clinical Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Both weight gain and weight loss have been associated with many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). AED-associated changes in weight appear slowly and over the long-term with therapy. Retigabine is a novel AED that enhances the potassium currents mediated by human KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 potassium channels and is currently undergoing global phase 3 studies as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults with refractory epilepsy. In this report data from Study 212, a long-term open-label extension of a double-blind phase 2 trial [1], were analyzed to characterize weight changes with long-term retigabine adjunctive therapy. Methods: 399 patients (age range: 16?70 years, baseline seizure frequency: ≥4 seizures/month) participated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Study design included an 8-week baseline and 16-week double-blind treatment period (8-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance). Patients received placebo or retigabine 600, 900, or 1200 mg/day and up to 2 approved AEDs. 279 patients completed the study and 222 enrolled in the open-label extension (Study 212). Patients could receive 600?1200 mg/day of retigabine. Body weight and adverse events were evaluated over time. Body weight changes and absolute body weight were calculated at various times during the treatment period. Results: Of the 222 patients included in the analysis, 56.8% were male, and mean age was 36.1 years (range: 14?66 years). 47.3% of patients received retigabine 900 mg/day and 23.4% received 1200 mg/day as their maximum dosage. The mean duration of therapy was 352.5 days (range: 5?682 days). Body weight remained stable throughout the long-term extension study (Table). The mean difference in weight at 1 year was 2.2 kg (73.4?75.6 kg). Increased body weight was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) by 3 patients (1.4%), while 2 patients discontinued the study due to increased weight, although in 1 patient this was not considered to be a TEAE.

Motamedi ( 1 Department of Neurology, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC ; 2 Department of Neurology, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University, Taegu, Republic of Korea ; and 3 Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Patients who have failed treatment with an antiepileptic drug (AED) are less likely to become seizure-free on monotherapy with any other agent. There is little established evidence regarding the efficacy of specific polytherapy combinations. We compared the efficacy of polytherapy with levetiracetam (LEV) and lamotrigine (LTG) with monotherapy with either one of these agents. Methods: We reviewed antiepileptic drug regimens of 91 patients with epilepsy treated from 2000?2006. The patients' response to monotherapy with LEV (N 42) and LTG (N 37), were compared to polytherapy using LEV+LTG (N 12). These patients had failed other AEDs and were placed on LTG and/or LEV for seizure control. We measured the decrease in seizure frequency per month using paired Student's t-test. Results: Patients treated with LEV monotherapy showed a significant decrease in mean seizure frequency (from 2.02 to 0.86, p < 0.048). Patients treated with LTG monotherapy had an increase in mean seizure frequency but this difference was not significant (from 2.14 to 3.11, p < 0.56). Patients treated with LEV and LTG polytherapy showed a significant decrease in their mean seizure frequency (from 10.5 to 0.5, p < 0.07). Conclusions: These findings suggest that monotherapy with LEV and polytherapy using LEV and LTG in combination may be more effective than monotherapy with LTG alone. These results could be due to efficacy of either LEV or the LEV-LTG combination. Direct comparisons of patients sequentially treated with LEV and LTG and then with LEV and LTG together would be needed to determine this. 1 Nicola Paciello, 2 Pier Nicola Marchi, 1 Michele Chiummiento, 3 Salvatore Mazza, and 1 Marcantonio Paciello ( 1 Neuroscience Department, Neurology Unit, San Carlo Hospital, Potenza, Italy ; 2 Neurology Unit, San Giovanni di Dio Hospital, Cagliari, Italy ; and 3 Neuroscience Department, Institute of Neurology, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy ) Rationale: We describe the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (LEV) versus carbamazepine (CBZ) in treatment of epileptic elderly patients. Methods: The population of the study is composed by 24 consecutive newly diagnosed outpatient, 14 males and 10 females, referred to our epilepsy centres because of at least two unprovoked seizures in last 12 months. Each patient has performed a standard EEG, a brain MRI and a self-administered quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) at first visit. All patients have performed an EEG and a SF-36 questionnaire at 12 weeks, 24 weeks and at 48 weeks of follow up. We divided these patients in two groups: 12 patients out of 24 with LEV at dosage of 1000 mg a day (LEV group) and 12 patients out of 24 with CBZ at dosage of 600 mg a day (CBZ group). Both treatments have been used as monotherapy. Results: 17 patients, 9 out of 17 including in LEV group and 8 out of 17 including in CBZ group, showed minimal MRI abnormalities consisting of point lacunar infarcts of white and/or grey matter of the brain. 9 out of 24 patients, 6 of LEV group and 3 of CBZ group, showed minimal EEG abnormalities at basal evaluation consisting of focal theta waves that have disappeared after 12 weeks of treatment in all patients. All patients have been seizure-free for 48 weeks of follow up except 3 patients, 2 on CBZ and 1 on LEV that have presented a motor partial seizure: in these patients we have increased the dosage respectively to 800 mg a day and 1500 mg a day. All LEV group have completed the follow up period remaining on original drug with a retention rate of 100%, while 3 patients of CBZ group have discontinued therapy for intolerable side effects: 2 patients showed marked somnolence and one patient showed dizziness. For this reason the retention rate of CBZ group has been 75%. SF-36 findings showed a poor impact of treatment on quality of life in all LEV group, while data of CBZ group showed a light worsening in some items of the questionnaire in 4 out of 12 patients. Conclusions: Retention in the study has been significantly better for LEV than for CBZ. CBZ caused significantly more side effects than LEV, resulting in earlier termination of treatment. Optimal dose of both drugs may be lower in elderly compared with general epileptic population. The efficacy of LEV and CBZ is very similar, but the impact of drug on quality of life is perceived in pretty different manner by patients. Even though it is necessary a larger population, we believe that LEV should be considered as possible first-line therapy for new onset seizures in the elderly. 1 Aldo Paggi, 1 Andrea Ortenzi, 1 Nicoletta Foschi, and 1 Sheila Catani ( 1 Epilepsy Center ? Department of Neurological Sciences, Azienda Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, Italy ) Rationale: Some newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as Levetiracetam (LEV) show a better tolerability and less interaction with concomitant medications than older AEDs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of LEV as add-on therapy or as substitutive monotherapy in adolescent and adult patients (pts) with refractory epilepsy (E) or with a poor tolerability of previous AEDs treatment. Methods: prospective, open-label, not controlled trial in which LEV was given as add on therapy or in substitution of previous monotherapy. LEV was started at 500 mg/day dose and progressively up titrated over 1?2 weeks by 500 mg/day every third day to a maximum dose of 2000?3000 mg/day. We report preliminary data about 30 pts (10 M and 20 F; mean age 42.47, sd = 19.69, min 17 max 86). Pts suffering from symptomatic encephalopathies, general diseases and history of psychiatric disorders and/or pseudo seizures, which could modify the seizure semiology and their frequency, were excluded. In 17 pts LEV was given as add on (group I) and 13 switched from previous AED to LEV monotherapy (group II). The mean follow-up was 88.15 days (SD = 44.27, min.3, max 160). Demographic and aetiological aspects were comparable in the 2 groups: mean age 41 (group I) vs 43 (group II); pts mainly affected by focal epilepsy in both groups with no cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; mean seizure frequency at baseline was comparable in both groups.In group I we added LEV without modifying the previous AED therapy (number of AEDs: mean 2.18); in group II we switched previous AED to LEV. Therapy modification in group I was due to inefficacy in 9 pts, AEs in 3 pts and both in 5. In group II it was due to inefficacy in 7 pts, AEs in 3 pts and both in 3. Results: Efficacy: in group I (LEV as add on therapy) 14/17 pts resulted evaluable (2 pts withdrew consent and 1 had a too short follow-up (<30 days). At cut-off date (May 31st 2006), 9 pts (64.3%) were seizure-free, 2 (14.3%) had a > 50% seizure frequency reduction and 3 (21.4%) were unchanged or worsened seizure frequency. In group II (LEV as monotherapy) 11/13 pts resulted evaluable (1 pt withdrew consent and 1 had a too short follow-up (<30 days). At cut-off date, 7 pts (63.6%) were seizure-free, 3 (27.3%) showed a > 50% seizure frequency reduction and 1 (9.1%) remained unchanged. Seizure type or aetiology did not appear correlated to the efficacy of LEV in pts with focal E.Tolerability: 7/30 pts (23.3%) reported AEs, which led to drug discontinuation in 2 cases. The most frequent AE resulted gastralgia (3 pts). Conclusions: These preliminary results (the study foresees the enrollment of 80?100 pts and a follow up period of at least 12 months) suggest the good efficacy and tolerability of LEV in epileptic pts both as add-on therapy and as monotherapy. The study is currently ongoing and final data will be presented as soon as available. 1 Page B. Pennell, 1 Archana Koganti, 2 Limin Peng, 1 Melanee Newman, 1,3 Denicia Holley, and 3 Zachary Stowe ( 1 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ; 2 School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ; and 3 Psychiatry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Pregnancy in women with epilepsy (WWE) is accompanied by increased fetal risks due to both antiepileptic drug (AED) exposure and maternal seizures (sz). Relatively low rates of major malformations on lamotrigine (LTG) has led to its increased use during childbearing years. However, observational studies indicate that LTG clearance (Cl) markedly increases during pregnancy, and sz worsening has been reported in 45?75% of women on LTG monotherapy. Maternal seizures, especially of the convulsive type, have been associated with fetal loss, fetal hypoxia, and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: WWE on AEDs either during or planning a pregnancy were consented to participate in a prospective study. Subset analysis was performed on all WWE on LTG monotherapy who had adequate baseline information about sz frequency and preconception target LTG concs (n = 30). Although no specific protocol was mandated by the study, results of LTG concs were actively used for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Recommendations to adjust LTG dose were made according to the pt's sz type(s), epilepsy syndrome, sz frequency, history of LTG-related side effects, gestational age, and what was considered that individual's target conc. For each trimester (TM), we coded relative frequency of all-type sz's as 1 if number of sz's was greater than baseline, and 0 otherwise. For each TM, we calculated the ratio to target concentration (RTC) as LTG conc/target LTG conc from baseline. Results: Seizures worsened during pregnancy in 28% of pts and convulsive seizures worsened in 10% (Figure 1). RTC values of pts with worsened sz frequency were lower than RTC values of those with stable seizures in the 2nd TM (p < 0.001) and the 3rd TM (p = 0.05) but not the 1st TM. Similar significant findings occurred if definitions were 1.5x and 2x increase in sz frequency. Convulsive seizures doubled in 10% of pregnancies; impact of RTC was not significant. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that seizure worsening during pregnancy is associated with a low RTC, and that improved results for sz control can be achieved with an active TDM approach. However, this extent of sz control is not ideal and development of a population pharmacokinetic model that will define a treatment plan and dosing paradigm for LTG use during pregnancy, adaptable to the individual patient, is necessary to improve the maternal and fetal well-being of our patients further.

Detyniecki, and 1 Sigmund Jenssen ( 1 Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The incidence of osteoporosis varies amongst different ethnic groups, because of variations in skeletal architecture, bone turnover, and bone mass, with genetic factors also playing a role. Osteoporosis is more common amongst Caucasians as compared to African-Americans. Patients with chronic epilepsy are at greater risk for bone loss, not only due to enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs, but also due to other causes like decreased physical activity, poor dietary intake, and dietary restrictions like the ketogenic diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether African-Americans with chronic epilepsy are at less risk for developing bone loss as compared to Caucasians. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients followed at the Epilepsy Center at Drexel University College of Medicine. Inclusion criteria were: age greater than 18 years, patients on any anticonvulsant medication for at least two years, at least one DEXA scan performed two years after initiation of treatment, and being either of African-American or Caucasian race. We compared the prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis in each ethnic group. Results: 210 charts were reviewed and 49 met the inclusion criteria. Of these 26 were African-Americans and 23 were Caucasians. Mean age for the entire population was 50.02 years (range 23 to 83), with the mean age for African-Americans being 52.07 years and for the Caucasian group being 49.6 years. 24 were female (14 of these were African-American) and 25 were male (11 of these were African-American). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of osteoporosis/osteopenia between the two ethnic groups, with 17 African-American patients (8 males) and 15 Caucasian patients (10 males), representing 65% in each group, being found to have decreased bone mineral density on DEXA scan as defined by the WHO criteria (chi square = 0.083; p = 0.773). The average T value (the lowest T value at either the lumbar spine, the femoral neck, or the distal wrist) in Caucasians was ?1.98, whereas in African-Americans, it was ?2.33. Of all patients, 20 were treated for more than 10 years with AEDs, 13 of these were African-Americans. 14 of these 20 (70%) had decreased bone density, 9 of whom were African-Americans. 18 out of 29 patients on AEDs for less than 10 years had decreased bone mineral density (62%). Duration of treatment did not correlate with bone loss (chi square = 0.32, p < 1). Conclusions: There was no statistically significant difference in bone mineral density between the African-American and Caucasian patient groups with chronic epilepsy. The most likely reason for this is that decrease in bone mineral density in patients with chronic epilepsy is multifactorial. To investigate if ethnicity is a protective factor against bone loss secondary to chronic AED use, a prospective study needs to be undertaken. 1 John R. Pollard, 1 Susan T. Herman, 1 Brian Litt, 1 Ruth S. Krieger, and 1 Jacqueline A. French ( 1 Department of Neurology, Division of Epilepsy, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Clinical trials are not designed to detect rare adverse events or adverse events with a long induction time. In contrast, a rigorous prospective post-marketing study that catalogues data from clinical practice can detect these types of adverse events while avoiding the biases that are sometimes found in retrospective trials. This type of survey was initiated to detect rare or late adverse events caused by the use of pregabalin. Methods: Epilepsy patients started on pregabalin were enrolled prospectively as our center's contribution to the multicenter Post-marketing Antiepileptic Drug Survey. 40 patients were enrolled at our center so far. Results: 23 patients with partial seizures have three month follow up. The average age was 43.6 years. The mean duration of epilepsy was 25 years, and the mean number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs was 2.7. The initially prescribed titration dose was a median 300mg and at 3 months the median dose was unchanged. 78% reported at least one adverse event. The common adverse events were: weight gain, ataxia or dyscoordination, fatigue, dizziness, headache, myoclonus and edema. One patient reported symptoms consistent with subacute onset of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The median weight gain was 6 lbs, and the mean was 4.6 lbs. 56% of patients were found to have had some weight gain, and those that did gained an average of 8.5 lbs. 22% lost an average of 4.6 pounds. The discontinuation rate was 17.4%. 52.2% of patients reported a decrease in seizure frequency. Conclusions: These results are similar to those described in one of the pivotal clinical trials assessing the efficacy of pregabalin[1]. The population of the current study differed from the clinical trial in 2 ways: the patients were older in age by 4 years and the number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs used at initiation was 2.7 versus the 1.7 in the randomized controlled trial. Interestingly, the rate of adverse events was close at similar dosages (78% vs. 84%). The most common adverse events were detected, and the weight gain data are very close to that reported for the highest dose in the clinical trial (4.6 vs. 5.0 lbs). In addition, the discontinuation rate was similar (17.4% vs. 14%). It is very encouraging that these early data so closely parallel that of a published prospective clinical trial. This suggests that the study design is sound and that it will be a sensitive tool for detecting adverse drug events such as those that are rare or that manifest later in treatment. Further follow-up for the full cohort will be presented at the meeting. [1] French JA, Kugler AR, Robbins JL, Knapp LE, Garofalo EA.

Brundage, and 1 Angela K. Birnbaum ( 1 Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; 2 VA Medical Center, Miami, FL ; 3 VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY ; and 4 VA Medical Center, Perry Point, MD ) Rationale: Little information of LTG pharmacokinetics is available in elderly patients. The aims of this study were to 1) estimate the oral clearance (CL/F) of LTG and 2) identify and quantify covariate effects that significantly affect CL/F. Methods: Data from VA Cooperative Study 428, a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, monotherapy comparison study of carbamazepine (CBZ), gabapentin (GBP), and lamotrigine (LTG), were used for the analysis (n = 593). Patients 60 years and older with newly diagnosed seizures were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. Data from the LTG arm were used in this study. Thirty six patients on PHT at enrollment were gradually withdrawn during the 6-week titration of LTG. Clinical evaluations including blood samples were obtained at enrollment, biweekly to week 8, monthly to week 28, and bimonthly to the end of the study(week 52). Analyses were performed using NONMEM. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was used. The absorption rate constant (Ka) could not be estimated and were fixed to the literature values of 3.5 hr?1. Inter-individual variability was modeled using an exponential error model. The residual unexplained variability was modeled using a combined additive and proportional error model. Covariate selection was done by forward selection (p < 0.01; ?2) and backward elimination (p < 0.001; ?2) using the likelihood ratio test as the model selection criterion. Results: The data consisted of 875 observations from 148 patients. It was found that weight, BUN/creatinine ratio, and phenytoin (PHT) use were significant covariates for clearance in the final model. Race was inititially significant but found to be correlated to BUN/creatinine ratio. The final regression model was determined to be: CL/F =[(0.0332 ? BUN/creatinine ratio) + (0.0268 ? weight)]? 1.59(if using phenytoin) Therefore, CL/F was estimated to be 2.64 L/hr, for patients weighing 80 kg, and a BUN/creatinine ratio 15:1. CL/F increased 59% in patients using PHT. Interindividual variability for CL/F of LTG was 34.2%. Percent CV and standard deviation for residual unexplained variability were 19.8% and 0.31 mcg/ml respectively. Conclusions: In our study, weight, BUN/creatinine ratio, and PHT use were significantly predictive of clearance. The effect of BUN/creatinine ratio on CL/F of LTG may be due to a surrogate effect of race. PHT, a known enzyme inducer, increases CL/F of LTG in elderly patients more than 50%. The results from this study may be useful for individualizing dose regimens in this population based on patient-specific covariates.

(Supported by Johnson  2 Department of Neurology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ; and 3 MINCEP Epilepsy Care, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Lamotrigine (LTG) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug. We are studying LTG pharmacokinetics (PK) in young and elderly patients with an intravenous, stable-labeled LTG formulation. This is a preliminary report on the safety and tolerability of the formulation. Methods: Adult patients (>18 years) without significant cardiac problems or interacting co-medications were enrolled. Patients on steady-state maintenance LTG therapy were given a single 50 mg replacement dose of the [13C2,15N]-LTG (SL-LTG) formulation as part of their daily regimen. The remainder of their daily dose was given orally. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data were collected prior to infusion, every 2 minutes during infusion, and every 15 minutes for the first hour following the completion of the infusion. An EKG was taken before and during the infusion. The mean and standard deviation of HR and BP at baseline, end of infusion, and 30 minutes post-infusion were determined. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The study nurse monitored the infusion site for inflammation during the infusion and at the time that the indwelling catheter was removed. Patients were asked during the infusion if they were experiencing discomfort at the infusion site or any other symptoms. Results: Five younger women (age 25?48 years) have completed the study. LTG daily doses ranged from 200?800 mg/day. There were no significant changes from baseline in EKG in any of the subjects studied. Table 1 presents the changes in vital signs in subjects as compared to their baseline, pre-infusion time point. The minimum and maximum observed BP or HR did not occur at the same time in each individual. No subject reported discomfort at the injection site or any adverse events. There was no evidence of inflammation at the site of infusion. Conclusions: Our preliminary data indicate that this intravenous LTG formulation is safe and well tolerated when administered to relatively healthy adult patients.

Rosenfeld, 1 Susan M. Lippmann, 1 Patty Schaefer, and 1 Diane Vogler ( 1 Neurology, The Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center for Children and Adults, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: The past 15 years have seen the release of several new antiepileptic medications. The last to be released was pregabalin in September 2005. We reviewed the patients that had been started on pregabalin at The Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center For Children and Adults, St Louis, Mo from September 2005-May 2006. The patients were evaluated for improvement in sz frequency, as well as for side effects. Methods: All patients that were started on pregabalin were included in the analysis. Efficacy and side effect data were recorded as of patients' last clinic/phone contact. Efficacy was evaluated, particularly as to greater than 50% reduction in sz frequency. Patients could be taking any number of other antiepileptic drugs and/or have a vagus nerve stimulator in place. Results: 50 patients were enrolled consecutively in this study. 4 patients withdrew due to side effects ? 1 due to dizziness, 1 due to fatigue, 1 due to hallucinations (patient with previous history of such), and 1 due to reported increased urinary frequency. 2 patients' data were incomplete. 44 patients remained on pregabalin. 23/44 (52%) had greater than 50% reduction in seizures. 7/44 (16%) were seizure free. Mean dosage of pregabalin was 342 mg/day (range 100mg to 700 mg/day). Patients were taking pregabalin on an average of 5.4 months (ranging from 2 to 9 months). Patients were on 2.2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (ranging from 0 to 4 antiepileptic drugs). 8/48 patients (16.7%) reported dizziness as their most common side effect. This was often transient in the first few days of usage of pregabalin. 6/48 patients (12.5%) reported fatigue. 5/48 patients (10.4%) reported weight gain. Conclusions: Pregabalin appears to be an effective antiepileptic drug in adjuntive therapy. It also appears to be well tolerated. Our findings were fairly consistent with the manufacturer's labeling for the medication. (Supported by the Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center For Children And Adults, P.C.) 1 Antonio Russi, and 1 Thais Tarancon ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Centro Medico Teknon, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain ) Rationale: To compare the safety and tolerability of Levetiracetam (LEV) and Pregabalin (PGB) using one of two titration schedules (fast and slow) as add-on treatment in patients with refractory partial epilepsy on polytherapy while receiving 3 concurrent marketed AEDs. Methods: A total of 128 patients with refractory partial epilepsy receiving a stable regimen of two or three AEDs were randomized to LEV fast rate, LEV slow rate, PGB fast rate and PGB slow rata dosage adjustment (32 patients ? 4 groups). LEV fast rate group was given LEV at a starting dosage of 1000 mg b.i.d with weekly increments of 500 mg. LEV slow rate group was given LEV at a starting dosage of 500 mg b.i.d with weekly increments of 250 mg. PGB fast rate group was given PGB at starting dosage of 300 mg b.i.d with weekly increments of 150 mg. PGB slow rate group was given PGB at starting dosage of 150 mg b.i.d with weekly increments of 75 mg. Primary parameters were rate of withdrawals and rate of continuation to 3000 mg b.i.d LEV and 600 mg b.i.d PGB maximum dosage while reducing previous polytherapeutic dosage. Results: The incidence of adverse events was similar among LEV study groups (fast and slow rate dosage). With fast titration 2 out 32 (6.25%) and with slow titration 1 out 32 (3,12%) reported serious adverse events with discontinuation. In LEV groups 18 out 32 (56.25%) with fast titration and 20 out 32 (62.50%) with slow titration reached maximum LEV dosage (3000 mg b.i.d). These differences were not significant. Twelve patients reported side effects while taking PGB fast titration (37.5%) and only one (3.12%) with slow titration (p < 0.01). In these PGB groups 6 out 32 (18.75%) with fast titration and 20 out 32 (62.5%) with slow titration reached maximum PGB dosage (600 mg b.i.d) while reducing previous polytherapeutic dosage (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Levetiracetam appears to be well tolerated with fast and slow dosage regimen. Pregabalin should be taken with a starting dose of 150 mg b.i.d with weekly increments of 75 mg dosage adjustment as adjunctive treatment in patients with refractory partial epilepsy on excessive polytherapy. 1 Barbara Schauble, 1 Joern-Roland Wettach, and 2 Andreas Schreiner ( 1 Medical  and 2 Medical  mean age 42 year (±SD 19)) were identified. Median duration of epilepsy was 9 years (range, 0?60 years). 77% had seizures during the 12 weeks retrospective baseline. Most frequent seizure types at baseline were generalized tonic-clonic (52%), complex partial (23%), and simple partial (12%). Main reasons provided for transitioning from VPA to TPM were insufficient efficacy (61%) and/or side effects (81%). Side effects listed as reason for transitioning (≥10%) were weight gain (37%), tremor (29%), fatigue (21%), hair loss (12%) cognitive disorder, hepatic function abnormalities or nausea (10% each). At endpoint, the median TPM dose was 125 mg/day. Mean seizure frequency decreased significantly from 32 (±SD 248) seizures per month during the retrospective baseline to 3 (±SD 16) seizures/month during the maintenance period (p < 0.001). The responder rate (≥ 50% seizure reduction) during the maintenance period was 75%, and 51% patients remained seizure-free during this period. 16% of patients discontinued TPM, 8% due to an adverse event (AE), and 3% due to insufficient efficacy. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were reported in 14% of patients. TEAE occurring ≥ 3% were paraesthesia (4%) and weight decrease (5%). 70% of patients were on TPM monotherapy at the end of the observation and 77% continued on TPM therapy. Conclusions: After transition from VPA, topiramate was associated with a substantial reduction in seizure frequency, including a high seizure-free rate, and was well tolerated.

This study examined if self-report rating scales of mood could predict participants' subjective drug preference in a study of healthy volunteers taking lamotrigine (LTG) or topiramate (TPM). Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-period crossover study in healthy adults. A total of 37 (mean age = 38 years) completed preference data. There was no difference in age or IQ between groups (p > .05). Subjects were randomized to receive either LTG or TPM for 12 weeks (7 weeks of dose escalation followed by 4 weeks of maintenance therapy, and then a 1 week taper). Maintenance dose was 300 mg/day for both AEDs. Subjects then received the alternate therapy with the same dosing format. Evaluations were conducted at Screening, end of the First and Second Maintenance Phases, and the Post-treatment Phase. Side effects were recorded at each evaluation. Measures included mood assessment (QOLIE-89, SEALS, and POMS), and cognitive tests of attention, memory, language, and executive functioning. Drug preference was assessed at the end of the study. Significantly more participants (26/37, 70%) preferred LTG (LTG-P). Six (16%) preferred TPM (TPM-P) and 5 (14%) had no preference (No-P). Logistic regression was completed with baseline self-report mood and objective cognitive measures to predict subjective drug preference of LTG versus TPM. Results: An algorithm with QOLIE Attention/Concentration and the SEALS Tiredness, and Dysphoria scales significnatly differed from zero, ?2(3, N = 37) = 15.05, p < .01. Participants were more likely to prefer LTG when baseline attention complaints were less, while those with more complaints of dysphoria and tiredness on the SEALS were 2.5 times more likely to prefer TPM. Using the algorithm, 87% of participants were correctly classified. Conclusions: Fewer attention/concentration problems and less complaints of dysphoria and tiredness was associated with a preference for LTG while the opposite was true in predicting a participants stated preference for TPM. Further studies are needed to more fully delineate factors affecting patient perceptions of medication side effects and how these variables affect attitudes of medication preference and the factors affecting compliance and quality of life. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 Andreas Schreiner, 2 Joern-Roland Wettach, and 2 Schauble Barbara ( 1 Medical  and 2 Medical  mean age 47,1 yrs (SD ± 17,9)) were selected. Median duration of epilepsy was 9,5 years (range, 0?59 years). 84,3% had seizures during the 12 weeks retrospective baseline. Most frequent seizure types at baseline were generalized tonic-clonic (52%), complex partial (26%), and simple partial (16%). Main reasons provided for transitioning from CBZ/OXC onto topiramate were insufficient efficacy (75%) and/or side effects (80%). Side effects listed as reason for transitioning (>10%) were fatigue (55%), dizziness (29%), headache (20%), weight increase (19%) or abnormal hepatic function (13%). At endpoint, the median TPM dose was 100 mg/day. Mean seizure frequency decreased from 6/month (±SD 20,8) at baseline to 1,4 (±SD 5,1)/month during the full observation period. The responder rate (≥ 50% seizure reduction) during the last 3 months of observation was 91%, and 62% of patients remained seizure-free during this period. 19% of patients discontinued TPM, in 12% due to an adverse event (AE), and 3% due to insufficient efficacy. The only treatment-emergent adverse events reported in > 5% were paraesthesia (9%) and weight decrease (8%). Conclusions: After transition from CBZ or OXC, topiramate was associated with a substantial reduction in seizure frequency, including a high seizure-free rate, and was well tolerated. (Supported by Janssen-Cilag Germany.) 1 John M. Seeley, 1 Amir Arain, 1 Martin Gallagher, and 1 Bassel Abou-Khalil ( 1 Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: More than 30% of patients with partial epilepsy are resistant to standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Those who are not candidates for epilepsy surgery would benefit from add-on trials of newer AEDs. Pregabalin (PGB) is a new AED with 40?50% responder rate and only 15% drop out rate in add-on clinical trials. Efficacy and tolerability in clinical practice after marketing can be different. We analyzed efficacy and tolerability of add-on PGB in all patients started on PGB between September 2005 and February 2006. Methods: The patient records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients who were started on PGB between September 2005 and February 2006 in Dr. Bassel Abou-Khalil's epilepsy clinic. The records were analyzed to investigate PGB's efficacy, safety, and tolerability in relation to patient demographics, seizure, and epilepsy characteristics, starting dose, titration rate, target dose, and concomitant treatment. In addition, other factors such as age, response to previous treatment, duration of treatment, and adverse experiences were recorded. Outcome was measured in one of the following five categories; seizure free, marked improvement (>90% reduction in seizure frequency), moderate improvement (50?90% reduction in seizure frequency), no significant change (less than 50% reduction in seizure frequency), or worsened seizure frequency. Results: There were 55 patients who were started on PGB between September 2005 and February 2006. The age ranged from 17 to 70 with an average age of 40. 70% of the patients were still taking PGB at the time of last follow up with an average duration of treatment of 25 weeks. 30% of the patients started on PGB were no longer taking it. 25% of the patients who discontinued the medication, did so for ineffectiveness only while the other 75% stopped the medication for either ineffectiveness and adverse effects or adverse effects alone. The average length of treatment for those who discontinued PGB was 11 weeks. The most common adverse effect causing discontinuation was drowsiness (42%), emotional lability and irritability (33%). 52% of the patients complained of an adverse effect. The most common adverse effect overall for the patients was drowsiness (20%) and weight gain (13%). The average number of AEDs when starting PGB was 2.1. The patients had failed an average of 7 AEDs in the past. Seven of the patients had not had follow up as of yet. Of the remaining 48 patients, the responder rate was 49% with 8% of those becoming seizure free. Conclusions: In patients with refractory partial seizures, adjunctive therapy with PGB is effective and well tolerated. The most common adverse effects were drowsiness and weight gain. The most common adverse effect causing discontinuation of therapy was drowsiness and irritability and this was not related to starting dose or titration rate. 1 Renato Segura, 4 Ruthie Nemire, 2 Marinelli Vega, 1,2 Dalia Lorenzo, 3 Barry Gidal, 5 Rory Remmel, and 1,2 R. Eugene Ramsay ( 1 Neurology, Miami VA Medical Center, Miami, FL ; 2 Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL ; 3 Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ; 4 Pharmacy Services, Nova University, Ft. Lauderdale, FL ; and 5 Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Enzyme induction is a process by which either the quanity or activity of a cytochrome (CYP) enzyume is increased above its baseline. CYP induction results from an increase in gene transcription triggered by selected substances and drugs resulting in an increase in drug clearance and lower plasma concentrations. Once an enzyme inducer is started, it generally takes 2?4 weeks to reach the higher drug clearance although the time course of induction has not been well characterized. When an inducing drug is stopped, the effect is lost and drug clearance returns to baseline. This process is known as de-induction and the time course has been assumed to be the same as induction. However, there have been no studies which have looked at the time course and the effect of dose of the inducer on de-induction. The purpose of this project is to determine the time course and the dose at which the induction effect is lost. Methods: The antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which are potent CYP 3A4/5 and uridine-diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT) inducers include carbamazepine and phenytoin. LTG is a substrate for primarily for UGT. Patients selected for the study were on stable doses of one of the enzyme inducing AEDs (CBZ or PHT) and were also taking LTG. Patients were included who were to have the inducer discontinued and maintained on LTG monotherapy. Two trough plasma levels for the inducer and LTG were drawn before any changes in dose were made. Unit dose reduction was done biweekly (PHT 100 mg, CBZ 200 mg) and plasma samples were obtained biweekly during the taper. Plasma samples were collected three times a week for three weeks after the inducer was stopped and then weekly for three more weeks. Plasma concentrations were assayed using HPLC. Results: Samples from 17 adult patients have been obtained. Mean LTG clearance (Cl) before dosage reduction of the EI-AEDs was 131 L. A linear reduction in LTG Cl was seen reaching 84.6 L the day the EI-AED was stopped. Further reduction in Cl occurred over the next three weeks reaching a mean of 48 L and plateaued at this level for the remainder of the study. Cl and change in Cl was similar across patients with the standard deviation ranging from 7.2 to 18.5 across the sampling times. Conclusions: 1. Approximately half of the de-induction occurs during the tapering of an EI-AEDs. The remaining induction effect is lost over the 3 weeks after the EI-AED is discontinued. Thus even a low dose of an EI-AED has a significant effect on the activity level of the glucuronidation pathway. The overall induction effect is a 2.5 fold increase in LTG clearance by EI-AEDs. 1 Archana Shrestha, 1 Lauren Frey, 1 Edward Maa, 1 Laura Strom, and 1 Mark Spitz ( 1 Neurology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, CO ) Rationale: Side effects are one of the leading limiting factors in the use of anticonvulsant medications. A rash is a known side effect of lamotrigine. However, there is not much information available regarding the relationship between lamotrigine and late onset rash. Is the rash likely to be due to lamotrigine and does it necessitate discontinuation of the medication especially if the medication is effective? Methods: This is a prospective and retrospective case series study evaluating the patients in the Epilepsy Clinic. Pertinent clinical information was collected through a chart review. Patients with onset of rash and on lamotrigine therapy were identified. Late onset rash was defined as rash occurring greater than six months after the initiation of lamotrigine therapy. Patients were evaluated by a Dermatologist or a Primary Care Physician to determine the cause of the rash. Results: There were seven patients identified. The time to onset of rash from initiation of lamotrigine therapy ranged from 9 to 71 months (mean 28.6 months, median 18 months). Four out of the seven patients were on lamotrigine monotherapy with the rest being on polytherapy in combination with different anticonvulsant medications with none however including valproic acid. Two had a diffuse rash with the rest being localized. In three of the patients including the two with the diffuse rash lamotrigine was stopped without resolution of the rash. With the discontinuation of lamotrigine, the majority of these patients experienced an increase in their seizure frequency requiring the reinitiation of lamotrigine therapy once it was determined that the rash was due to another cause. In all the patients that the lamotrigine was continued there was no worsening of the rash or any other medical complications. In all of the cases the cause of the rash was determined to be something other than a lamotrigine induced rash with the most common causes being eczema and cosmetic reaction. Conclusions: Late onset rash in patients taking lamotrigine is not an uncommon occurrence. However, in our case series none of the rashes were determined to be due to lamotrigine. If the rash is severe it is prudent to stop the lamotrigine, but patients should be evaluated to accurately determine the cause of the rash especially if the medication is effective in controlling their seizures. Furthermore, if the rash is limited and the patients are doing well on this medication consideration should be given to continuing the lamotrigine during the evaluation process. 1 Misty D. Smith-Yockman, 1 Erin M. Grussendorf, 3 Manoj K. Patel, 2 Indrani Choudhury-Mukherjee, 2 Milton L. Brown, and 1 H. Steve White ( 1 Anticonvulsant Drug Development (ADD) Program, Department of Pharmacology  2 Department of Neuroscience, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ; and 3 Department of Anesthesiology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: T-type calcium channels contribute to neuronal excitability (Chemin et al., J. Physiol. 540: 1, 2002), the regulation of oscillatory firing of thalamic neurons (Perez-Reyes, Physiol. Rev. 83: 1, 2003), and generation of absence seizures (Huguenard, Epil. Curr. 2: 2, 2002). In addition, T-type channel blockers, such as ethosuximide, display antinociceptive effects (Barton et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 521: 1?3, 2005). These channels may serve as unique targets for the treatment of epilepsy or neuropathic pain. In the present investigation, the novel T-type calcium channel blocker, ICM-1?40N (3, 3, 3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-propionamide; Choudhury-Mukherjee et al., J. Med. Chem. 46: 12, 2003) was evaluated for its ability to block therapy-resistant psychomotor seizures in the 6 Hz model and to limit formalin-induced inflammatory pain in the formalin test. At 32 and 44 mA, the 6 Hz model displays resistance to phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and topiramate and thus can be used to differentiate novel AEDs (Barton et al., Epil. Res. 47: 3, 2001). Methods: Varying doses of ICM-1?40N were administered i.p. to male CF-1 mice. At the time of test (30 min), mice were evaluated for rotorod (6 rpm) toxicity before corneal stimulation (6 Hz, 3 s duration, 32 or 44 mA). Mice not displaying minimal clonic seizures and stereotyped automatistic behaviors were considered protected. Antinociceptive effects were evaluated in the formalin test. Formalin (0.5%) or 0.5% methylcellulose was injected s.c. under the plantar surface of the right hind paw and the time spent licking was compared between experimental and control groups. The total area under the curve (AUC) and percent of control AUC were calculated. Significance was defined as p < 0.05 when compared by one-way ANOVA. Results: ICM-1?40N was effective at both 32 and 44 mA [ED50's and (95% CI's): 18.5 (8.4 ? 27.8) mg/kg and 45.1 (37.6 ? 54.7) mg/kg, respectively]. Based on an observed TD50 of 59.4 (40 ? 136) mg/kg, the protective index was 3.2 and 1.3 for 32 and 44 mA, respectively. At 70 mg/kg, ICM-1?40N displayed significant activity against the acute (46.1 ± 17.2% control) and inflammatory (43.8 ± 10.2% control) phases of formalin-induced pain. Conclusions: The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that the T-type calcium channel blocker ICM-1?40N possesses anticonvulsant activity in a model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy and antinociceptive activity in a mouse model of tonic pain. These findings support the further development of this novel therapeutic.

Methods: Since pregabalin (PGB) became available in 2005, all patients prescribed PGB as part of their anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimen by one epileptologist at our center were included in data collection. Patients received standard care at our center, including education, therapy rationale/expectations, instructions, side effects, and follow-up care. PGB and concurrent AED dose titration and adjustments were individualized based on side effects and seizure frequency. As patients were prescribed PGB, data including seizure type and frequency, current and past exposure to AED's, and PGB dosing were recorded. The charts of all patients prescribed PGB therapy were retrospectively reviewed in Feb 2006 and in May 2006 by our center's clinical pharmacist for PGB efficacy, side effects, and reason for discontinuation if applicable. Results: Since Sep 2005, 42 patients have been prescribed PGB as part of their AED regimen. By May 2006, 24/42 (57%) remained on PGB and was discontinued in 18/42 (43%). All patients were prescribed PGB for seizures; 38/42 (90%) for localization-related and 4/42 (10%) for generalized seizures. At the time PGB was added, 12/42 (29%) were taking > /= 1 AED ± Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) therapy and 30/42 (71%) were taking > /= 2 AED's ± VNS. Previous AED therapy included 4/42 (10%) on < /= 1 AED, 8/42 (19%) on 2?4 AED's, 28/42 (66%) on 5?10 AED's, and 2/42 (5%) on > 10 AED's. The 24 patients continuing PGB as part of their AED regimen as of May 2006 had been taking PGB for a range of 3?8 months. Reported side effects include weight gain in 4/24 (17%), ataxia in 2/24 (8%), and no side effects in 18/24 (75%). Seizure frequency decreased in 6/24 (25%), increased in 4/24 (17%), and did not change in 14/24 (58%). The 18 patients that discontinued PGB by May 2006 had been taking PGB for a range of 3 days-6 months. Side effects requiring PGB discontinuation include seizure increase in 7/18 (38%); fatigue in 5/18 (27%); ataxia in 2/18 (11%); and headache, weight gain, behavior change, and unfocused thoughts in 1/18 (6%) of each. Overall, seizure frequency decreased in 1/18 (6%), increased in 9/18 (50%), and did not change in 8/18 (44%). Conclusions: These results characterize our center's experience with PGB from Sep 2005-May 2006. Overall, our center has experienced limited success using PGB as part of the AED regimen to treat seizures in adult patients with refractory epilepsy. In these patients, a regimen containing PGB may be considered, but patients must be monitored for side effects and effect on seizure frequency. In our experience, PGB has been discontinued in a substantial number of patients for reasons including intolerable side effects and lack of efficacy. 1 K. Spiegel, 2 F. Baldinetti, 2 S. Huang, and 2 B. Emir ( 1 CNS, Pfizer Global R and 2 CNS, Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY ) Rationale: Pregabalin is approved in the US, EU, and elsewhere as adjunct therapy?at dosages of 150 to 600 mg/d1?4?for adult patients with partial-onset seizures. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin 300 mg/d as treatment of partial seizures by combining data from the 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of pregabalin for this indication that included 300- mg/d fixed-dosage arms. Methods: The 2 RCTs shared a similar parallel-group design, with add-on treatment administered over 11 weeks. A total of 242 patients received pregabalin 300 mg/d, and 240 received placebo (PBO). All participating patients were ≥12 years of age and refractory to treatment, ie, they had a history of failing two or more AEDs, and their seizures were inadequately controlled despite receiving 1 to 3 marketed AEDs concurrently. The primary efficacy measure was reduction in seizure frequency compared with baseline. Treatment efficacy was also evaluated by measuring the responder rate, ie, patients who experienced seizure reductions ≥50% during treatment versus baseline. Results: The pregabalin 300 mg/d treatment group demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency relative to the PBO group: the treatment difference between pregabalin and placebo in mean seizure reduction was ?34.8 (p < .0001). Overall, 36% of patients receiving 300 mg/d pregabalin were responders compared with 20% of patients receiving PBO (p < .05). Adverse events (AEs) associated with 300 mg/d pregabalin treatment were typically mild to moderate in intensity and tended to resolve with treatment. AEs, such as dizziness (14% of patients receiving 300 mg/d pregabalin and 4.6% of patients receiving PBO), somnolence (7.4% and 5%), and weight gain (3.7% and 0%), were evaluated. Conclusions: Pregabalin 300 mg/d was efficacious and generally well-tolerated as add-on therapy for partial seizures. At this 300 mg/d dosage, 36% of patients were responders (≥50% reduction in seizures) to pregabalin treatment. However, as previously reported (including a responder rate up to 51%1), some patients may require, and tolerate well, increased dosages of up to 600 mg/d. References: 1French JA, et al.

Lane ( 1 Neurology, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: Oxcarbazepine has been approved for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in adults and children ages 2 ? 16 with epilepsy. In our practive we used oxcarbazepine in an adult population both as initial monotherapy and as conversion to monotherapy in patients with varying seizure types. We also measured oxcarbazepine levels in the form of the monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) thought to be the pharmacologically active moiety of oxcarbazepine. This was done to assess whether or not these levels were clinically relevant. Methods: We have retrospectively reviewed records of 25 patients in which oxcarbazepine was used as monotherapy. Seizure types treated included: simple and complex partial seizures with or without secondarily generalization and generalized seizures. Results: We were able to maintain monotherapy treatment with oxcarbazepine in almost all patients because of the degree of seizure control as well as tolerability. MHD levels varied at given doses between individuals, so these must be titrated on a case to case basis. There was also a wide range of levels which achieved seizure control. Conclusions: Oxcarbazepine proved effective and well tolerated as monotherapy treatment in adults with various seizure types.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epilepsy patients database of two epilepsy Units (Hospital Josep Trueta and Hospital La Fe) was performed. In both centers, an epilepsy patients database is routinely filled during daily clinical practice. All the patients in whom levetiracetam was used in monotherapy up to December 2005, and received at least one dose of the drug in monotherapy were included. Monotherapy was achieved from onset, if levetiracetam was estimated to be the best option or after withdrawal of other concomitant antiepileptic drugs if an optimal seizure control was reached with levetiracetam. It was administered twice per day, with a schedule depending of the age and the renal function. The following data were analysed: demographic characteristics, follow-up, epilepsy type, previous seizure frequency, maintenance dose, efficacy and side effects. Results: Sixty-two patients with a mean age of 53.67 years (range19?94) were included. The patients were followed a mean of 12.4 months (range 4?38). Epilepsy type was mainly partial (83.8%) and symptomatic (54.8%). The mean previous number of seizures was 8.6 and the mean maintenance dose was 1314.51 mg (250?2000). Fifty-eight patients (93%) were considered responders (more than a 50% reduction of seizures) with 70.9% of them free of seizures. Side effects were observed in 20 patients with one death considered not related to drug use. There were 9 (14.5%) withdrawals (5 because of side effects, 1 death and 3 non-responders). Conclusions: Levetiracetam was used in monotherapy in a population relatively old. It proved to be efficient in 93% of the patients. Side effect were severe enough to discontinue levetiracetam in 8% of the patients. 1 Bob Warnock, 1 Gilda P. Womble, and 1 John A. Messenheimer ( 1 Neurosciences Medicine Development Center, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (LTG). In addition, the effect of the oral contraceptives on LTG clearance diminished during the ?pill free? week, resulting in a transient approximate two-fold increase in LTG plasma concentrations. Based on these results, data from two large open-label studies were examined to characterize the safety of LTG at higher concentrations beyond that associated with the current recommended maximum of 500 mg/day. Methods: Study US17 and study US26 were open-label treatment protocols.In both trials, adjustment of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was permitted, including conversion to monotherapy with LTG and data were obtained every 6 months for the duration of the subject's participation in the study, including a single LTG concentration. Demographics, adverse events (AEs) and exposure were summarized by study and by plasma concentration (<10 mg/mL, > 10 mg/mL), which is the equivalent of 600 mg of lamotrigine as monotherapy. Only subjects with a plasma sample were analyzed for safety. Only AEs that were reported during the period that a patient was exposed to the dose recorded at the time of the PK sample were included in the safety analysis in order to examine the dose-response relationship. Results: A total of 1602 subjects participated in the 2 trials, with 624 included in the safety analysis. Demographic characteristics were similar between studies. There were 492 patients with LTG concentrations < 10 ?g/mL (mean = 5.4 ?g/mL, average exposure 15.4 months) and 132 patients ≥ 10 ?g/mL (mean = 14.7 ?g/mL, average exposure 18.8 months). Adverse events in US 17 and US 26 combined were reported slightly more frequently among the patients with LTG concentrations ≥ 10 ?g/mL (34%) than in those < 10 ?g/mL (26%). AEs reported at a rate ≥ 5% and more frequently among those with concentrations ≥10 ?g/mL are shown below: The term ?Any Rash? (includes rash or urticaria) was slightly more frequent (5/132, 4%) at ≥10 ?g/mL than < 10 ?g/mL (8/492, 2%). There were no cases of serious rash in either group. The rate of serious adverse events was comparable between groups. CNS adverse events were slightly more frequent at concentrations > 10 ?g/ml. Conclusions: At mean concentrations of LTG of 14.7 approximating a LTG monotherapy dose of 900 mg qd non-serious CNS-related adverse events were slightly more frequent in comparison with a mean concentration of LTG of 5.4?g/ml approximating a LTG dose of 600 mg qd. Doses increases of LTG up to 900 mg qd as monotherapy are well-tolerated. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development.)

Nuova Hospital, Firenze, Firenze, Italy ; and 2 Osservatorio del Farmaco, Azienda Ospedaliera Careggi, Firenze, Firenze, Italy ) Rationale: To analyse dose dependent CNS adverse effects (CNS-AE) of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) trough an evaluation of key double-blind studies. Methods: we selected all placebo-controlled clinical studies with new AEDs. From each study we extracted the number of patients who complained of CNS-AEs when treated with the active drug (divided for different dose levels) or placebo. For each CNS-AE we calculated the percentage of CNS-AE complaining patients (under treatment or placebo) only from those studies in which the frequency of that CNS-AE was reported. Than we calculated the complaint rate of each CNS-AE (percent of CNS-AE patients under active treatment minus the percent of CNS-AE from patients receiving placebo) (Cramer et al., Epilepsia 1999; 40:590?600). Finally, a summary complaint score (SCS) was calculated for different class of CNS-AEs. Results: SCS for 4 class of CNS-AEs: somnolence, tremor, vestibulocerebellar (ataxia, dizziness, diplopia, blurred vision and gait incoordination) and cognitive are reported in the order. Gabapentin: 9.6%, 2.3%, 21%, 0%; Lamotrigine: 0%, 0%, 69%, 0%; Levetiracetam: 7%, 0%, 7%, 0%; Pregabalin: 11.6%, 4%, 41%, 9%; Oxcarbazepine: 14.8%, 4,6%, 76%, 0%; Tiagabine: 0%, 26%, 17%, 5%; Topiramate: 30.3%, 0%, 94%, 67.8%; Zonisamide: 6.3%, 0%, 9%, 0%. From the inspection of data, a relation between dose level and the above reported CNS-AEs was observed in some cases which will be reported. Conclusions: This analysis gives a clear profile of CNS tolerability of various new AEDSs. Overall, levetiracetam had the best profile.

Perdomo, and 4 Santiago Arroyo ( 1 Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; 2 Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; 3 University Hospital Robert Debré, Paris, France ; and 4 Eisai Global Clinical Development, Ridgefield Park, NJ ) Rationale: To evaluate the short- and long-term safety of rufinamide in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Methods: Safety data were derived from all of the short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and long-term, open-label studies of adjunctive rufinamide therapy in pediatric patients with inadequately controlled seizures. Databases from the different trials were integrated into a single database including 212 rufinamide-treated patients and 197 placebo-treated patients for short-term double-blind trials and 391 patients for long-term trials. All patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug were included in the analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and were presented by preferred term. Clinical laboratory tests, serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to study discontinuation were also evaluated. Results: In short-term, double-blind trials, the median age was 11 years and the median weight was 35 kg; median duration of exposure was 3.0 months and median daily dose of rufinamide was 41.96 mg/kg per day. The most commonly reported Aes for rufinamide versus placebo patients included somnolence (17.0% vs 8.1%), vomiting (16.5% vs 7.1%), headache (16.0% vs 8.1%), and pyrexia (11.3% vs 10.7%). Most Aes were mild to moderate in severity. A higher percentage of patients in the rufinamide group (7.1%) compared to the placebo group (2.0%) discontinued treatment due to Aes. Serious adverse events were reported in 7.5% of rufinamide-treated patients and 5.6% of placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse events led to study discontinuation of 3.3% of rufinamide-treated patients and 1.0% of placebo-treated patients. In long-term therapy (n = 391), the median daily dose of rufinamide administered was 41.67 mg/kg per day and the median duration of rufinamide exposure was 14.5 months; 54% of patients were given the drug for ≥12 months. The most commonly reported AEs during long-term therapy were vomiting (26.3%), headache (22.3%), pyrexia (18.7%), somnolence (18.7%), and upper respiratory tract infection (17.9%); 86 patients (22.0%) experienced ≥1 severe AE. Adverse events led to the study discontinuation of 12.5% of patients; no single AE led to study discontinuation of > 2.0% of patients. Serious adverse events were reported in 15.6% of patients; 4.9% of patients discontinued treatment due to SAEs. Conclusions: Short- and long-term rufinamide therapy were generally well tolerated in pediatric patients with epilepsy. 1 Daniel Becker, 1 Anup Patel, 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil, and 1 Jesus E. Pina-Garza ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a devastating progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system presumably caused by a persistent measles virus. Patients commonly present with myoclonia or encephalopathy. There are currently no known curative therapeutic options or effective symptomatic therapy. We present a patient whose encephalopathy and myoclonus responded dramatically to levetiracetam. Methods: A 12 year old boy presented with acute encephalopathy and myoclonus developing over one month. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed high voltage generalized periodic discharges associated with myoclonic jerks, recurring at intervals of 6?7 seconds. The suspected diagnosis of SSPE was confirmed with very elevated CSF measles antibodies. Results: Treatment with levetiracetam dramatically improved both the myoclonus and encephalopathy within a few days. The EEG pattern showed improvement as well. Conclusions: Levetiracetam was effective in treating both myoclonus and encephalopathy in one patient with SSPE. We speculate that the electrical abnormality demonstrated in the characteristic EEG pattern contributes significantly to the encephalopathy seen in SSPE patients. Levetiracetam appears to improve the abnormal cortical electrical activity and is a promising symptomatic therapy in SSPE. 1 Michaela V. Bonfert, 1 Sybille Armbruster, 1 Bastian Baumgartner, and 1 Florian Heinen ( 1 Department of Pediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, Childrens Hospital of the University of Munich, Munich, Germany ) Rationale: To conduct a prospective, open-label pilot trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy in a cohort of 10 children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) in paying special attention to effects on cognitive function. Methods: Newly diagnosed patients with BECTS and patients with BECTS nonresponding to first-line monotherapy with Sulthiame (STM) were recruited from our clinics outpatients department. Inclusion criteria were proven diagnosis of BECTS, two ore more seizures in the last six months, age between 3 to 12 years and informed consent by parents. Patients with progressive neurological or systemic disease, other forms of epilepsy and moot compliance of caregivers were excluded from the trial. LEV was titrated up to 20 mg/kg. Efficacy was assessed by analysing changes in seizure frequency and alteration of electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities over a 6 months period. Therefore recordings of EEG during wakefulness and sleep were conducted before start of LEV treatment, after 1, 3 and 6 months. Neuropsychological testing of patients took place before start of LEV treatment and is to be repeated after 6 months of treatment. Tolerability was assessed by evaluation of LEV-associated adverse events (AE). Approval by the local ethics committee was obtained. Results: To date 10 patients have been recruited, aged 3 to 12 years. 6/10 patients received LEV as first-line monotherapy. 4/10 patients were switched to LEV monotherapy from first-line monotherapy with STM due to inefficacy (3/4) and hyperventilation (1/4) respectively. At this time all of the LEV treated patients are seizure-free (8/10 have completed the 6 months period, 2/10 patients are still ongoing). EEG abnormalities showed remarkable reduction in all of the patients. Neuropsychological assessment in 9/10 patients before start of treatment revealed average performance in 7/9 and below average performance in 2/9 patients. In those 8 patients who have by now reached the endpoint of the trial no changes in neuopsychological parameters were seen. AEs were reported in 2/10 patients. 1 patient complaint of agitation within the first week of the LEV treatment, 1 patient developed hyporexia associated to mild weight loss within day 60 to 120 of treatment which resolved spontaneously. Conclusions: These preliminary data show that LEV seems to be an effective and well-tolerated option in the treatment of children with BECTS. Concerning effects on cognitive function preliminary data are promising. Based on these encouraging results a controlled, randomized, double-blind multicentre trial to evaluate the application of LEV in a representative cohort of 120 children with BECTS has started in Germany spring 2006 (HEAD-Study). (Supported by UCB Pharmaceuticals.) 1 Patricia L. Bruno, 1 David A. Lyczkowski, 1 Allison E. Sedgewick, and 1 Elizabeth A. Thiele ( 1 Pediatric Epilepsy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Felbamate (FBM) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in July 1993. From January to October 1994, 33 cases of aplastic anemia and 18 cases of hepatic failure were reported among users of FBM. Despite the risk of idiosyncratic adverse events, FBM appeared to be an effective antiepileptic agent in initial studies. There are limited post-marketing data available regarding the efficacy, safety and tolerability of FBM in pediatric epilepsy. Methods: We conducted a chart review of patients followed from January 2002 through May 2006 in the Pediatric Epilepsy Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. For each patient treated with FBM, we assessed demographics, seizure type and etiology, current and previous treatments, reported side effects of FBM, complete blood count (CBC) and liver function test (LFT) values, and efficacy of FBM treatment based on parental reports of percent seizure reduction. ?2 and paired-sample T-tests were performed with SPSS v. 11.5. Results: Forty-three (male/female 26/17) had been treated with FBM. Of the 43, 16 had partial onset seizures, nine had generalized seizures, and 18 had mixed seizure disorders. For 26 of the 43 patients, detailed data were available and this population was further evaluated. All of the 26 patients were treated with FBM in combination with other antiepileptic drugs or adjunctive therapy options. Of the 26 patients, 11 patients experienced 50 to 90% reduction in seizures, and four experienced a greater than 90% seizure reduction. Seven patients experienced less than 50% reduction, and four had no change in their seizure frequency. CBC and LFT values at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months showed no significant alterations from baseline (n = 14 at 2 weeks, n = 16 at 1 month, and n = 22 at 3 months) with the exception of the WBC count, which decreased from baseline (7.33 ± 3.27 k/?L) to 1 month (6.22 ± 2.54 k/?L; 2-tailed P = 0.009). Since this change in WBC was not accompanied by any other significant trends, and since WBC values at 2 weeks and at 3 months were not significantly altered from baseline, the etiology of the WBC decrease is unclear. Two patients reported nausea and vomiting while on FBM. One patient died at 29 months of age while on FBM from respiratory and renal failure. Autopsy results suggested the patient died from a multisystemic disorder, not from an idiosyncratic reaction to FBM. Conclusions: Felbamate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of partial-onset seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In our limited retrospective study, FBM appears to be well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of refractory pediatric epilepsy. Although there were not significant side effects in our population, pediatric patients started on FBM should be closely monitored. Additional studies are needed to better define the role of FBM in pediatric epilepsy, both with regard to efficacy as well as tolerability. 1 Michael G. Chez, and 1 Pavan Khanna ( 1 Neurology, Rosalind Franklin University/the Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Felbamate is a recent anti-convulsant medication that has been relegated to second-line therapy due to fear of side effects such as bone marrow or liver failure. These side effects are rare, uncommon, and almost unheard of in children under 13 years of age. Despite this fact, many children who could benefit from this medication have not been given a trial because of the fear of dangerous side effects. We conducted a retrospective review to analyze how effective felbamate was in a refractive epileptic population, and noted whether there were any abnormal blood or liver tests during treatment. Methods: A retrospective chart review of seizure patients treated with felbamate from 1994?2006 was performed. The average duration of therapy, prior failed treatments, laboratory values, and seizure type were reviewed. Average felbamate dose per day was calculated and average therapeutic serum levels were recorded. Patients were evaluated for seizure improvement as becoming seizure free, improvement of greater than 50%, improvement of less than 50%, and worsening of seizures. Reasons for stopping therapy were also recorded along with any perceived side effects. Results: There were 28 patients (18 male, 10 female); average age 7.54 years (range 1.33?17.25 years). Average prior failed treatments was 3.6 drugs (range 1?6) or therapies (3 ACTH or 3 prednisone;6 ketogenic diet; 1 vagal nerve stimulator). The average duration of therapy was 23.6 months (range 2?93 months). Average maximum daily dosage was 1157 mg/day, which was 50.1 mg/kg/day (avg. weight 23.1Kg). The average trough serum level for our population was 55 mg/dl (range 9?140 mg/dl). Seizure types seen in patients were: myoclonic/drop seizures 12; atypical absence seizures 2, Landau-Kleffner 1; secondary generalized or mixed seizures 13. There were 7 patients that met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Outcome for seizure control showed seizure freedom for 5 patients; greater than 50% improvement in 14; less than 50% improvement in 3; and worsened seizures in drop attacks or startles in 4. One patient stopped the medication despite better seizure control because of irritability. Before 1997, four patients stopped treatment from fear of side effects despite good seizure control. Two patients stopped for anorexia, but none stopped for insomnia which was treated by moving doses earlier in the day or lowering the dosage. There were no significant changes in weight, hematology, or liver profiles in any patient during treatment. Conclusions: This retrospective review of felbamate add-on therapy shows 22/28 pediatric patients with refractive seizures having improved seizure frequency. Only 4/28 patients worsened. The main reason for stopping therapy was the fear of side effects more than actual clinical side effects. This suggests that for intractable seizure patients, especially with mixed or myoclonic seizure types, felbamate should be a rational treatment choice despite known risks of toxicity. 1 Curtis S. Claassen, 1,2 Lorie D. Hamiwka, 1 Marlene A. Blackman, and 1,2 Elaine C. Wirrell ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 2 Pediatrics and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of home use of buccal lorazepam for break-through seizures in children. Methods: Children prescribed lorazepam by the Neurology Service at the Alberta Children's Hospital in 2005 were identified retrospectively. Charts were reviewed to determine seizure type(s), frequency, syndrome, prior and current AED use, prior status epilepticus, age at onset, gender, cognitive status and age at prescription of lorazepam. Families were contacted in May 2006 and queried regarding number of lorazepam doses used, effectiveness and adverse effects. Results: Twenty one patients were identified (8M, 13F, mean age 7.1 yrs, range 0.5?15.9) who were prescribed lorazepam. Fourteen (67%) had a history of status epilepticus. Nineteen (90%) had symptomatic partial epilepsy, while 1 patient each had idiopathic generalized epilepsy and febrile status epilepticus. Thirteen patients (62%) received a test dose and the remainder had previous exposure to a therapeutic dose of benzodiazepine either in the ER or given by EMS. At follow-up, 11 (52%) had used lorazepam (median # doses 2, 25th-75th%ile 1?9). Therapeutic effectiveness was 100% in 5 (45%), 80% in 2 (18%), 50% in 2 (18%) and 0% in 2 (18%). Of the 9 patients reporting some success with lorazepam, median time to seizure cessation was 4 minutes (25th-75th%ile 2?9 mins). No child experienced a significant adverse effect. Five had transient, minor irritability and 3 had mild sedation. No child had respiratory problems related to lorazepam, although one child with profound ictal apnea failed to respond to lorazepam and continued to be apneic. Patient age, seizure syndrome, cognitive status or number of prior AEDs were not predictive of response. However, children on prophylactic benzodiazepines tended to have a lower response rate than those not taking these agents (1/3 vs 6/8, p = 0.28). Conclusions: Buccal lorazepam appears to be a safe, efficacious and cost-effective therapy for home-use in children with break-through seizures. Children on prophylactic benzodiazepines may have a lower response rate, however larger subject numbers are needed to confirm this finding. 1 Joan A. Conry, 2 Juliann Paolicchi, 3 Julie C. Stolle, 3 Ashira Johnson, and 3 Stephen D. Collins ( 1 Department of Neurology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ; 2 Columbus Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH ; and 3 Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL ) Rationale: Clobazam (CLB) has been approved for the treatment of anxiety and/or the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy in over 100 other countries. Anticonvulsant effects of CLB was first reported on by Gastaut in 1978. CLB is the only 1,5 benzodiazepine used in the treatment of epilepsy and was developed to decrease the side effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines while maintaining efficacy. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of CLB as adjunctive therapy in subjects with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). Methods: Subjects from 2?30 years of age with LGS were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, dose-range finding study. The study consists of a 4-week baseline, a 3-week titration and a 4-week maintenance period. Subjects not continuing into the long term open-label study have up to a 3-week taper period. Subjects must be on stable doses of 1?3 AEDs which may include ketogenic diet and VNS. Subjects with ≤2 drop seizures per week are randomized to low dose (target 0.25 mg/kg/day) or high dose (target 1.0 mg/kg/day) with maximum doses of 10 or 40 mg/day, respectively. The primary efficacy variable is a reduction in drop seizures. Safety of CLB is evaluated by lab assessments, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical and neurological exams and adverse event (AE) assessments. Results: Of the 76 subjects enrolled to date, 49 (64%) have been randomized and have received study drug. Of the randomized subjects, demographic data is available in 51%: 72% male, 28% female; 28% < 5 years of age, 48% 5?10 years of age and 24% > 10 year of age. AEs resulted in 5 premature discontinuations due to drowsiness, hypothermia, increase in seizures, increased behavioral problems and chorea. AEs were reported by 32% of the subjects with the majority mild in severity (66%); 24% were considered not related, 21% unlikely, 24% possibly and 28% probably related to study drug by the investigator; relationship for 1 event was not reported (ear infection). No AEs were considered definitely related. The most frequently reported AEs by ≤2 subjects were constipation (2), ear infection (2), sedation (2), somnolence (2) and increased seizures (3). There were no reports of drooling. One subject reported irritability and 1 reported dysphoria, both mild in severity and considered possibly related. A total of 6 serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported. Of the SAEs, 4 were treatment-emergent; 3 (constipation, viral infection and sleep apnea syndrome) were considered not related and 1 (respiratory distress) was considered unlikely related. Conclusions: Of the 49 subjects randomized to date, no SAEs have been attributed to clobazam. Clobazam is a promising agent for the treatment of LGS.

Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Pregabalin is a newly available antiepileptic drug (AED) that has been licensed in the U.S. as add-on therapy in adult patients with partial onset seizures. Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in individuals less than 18 years of age are limited. This chart review explores the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. Pregabalin is a α2-δ ligand that has anxiolytic, analgesic and anticonvulsant properties. Methods: This retrospective chart review study includes pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy treated with pregabalin. Safey and tolerability were assessed via patient and/or caregiver report of adverse events. Pregabalin's efficacy was evaluated via subjective patient and/or caregiver reports. In most cases, efficacy, safety and tolerability were assessed within 8 weeks after the initation of pregabalin therapy. Results: Seventeen patients are included in the cohort. The patients range in age from 3 to 19 years, including 8 females and 9 males. Thirteen of 17 patients are diagnosed with localization related epilepsy; 3 of 17 patients are diagnosed with generalized epilepsy and 1 patient is diagnosed with mixed generalized and localization related epilepsy. Doses were initiated between 0.4 to 4 mg/kg/day and titrated up to maintenance doses ranging from 1.4 mg/kg/day to 8.7 mg/kg/day. Patients were treated with pregabalin for a period of 7 days to over 8 months. Three patients reported a side effect of somnolence. Other reported side effects include visual disturbance such as, ?unable to focus,? moodiness and worsening balance. Of note, one adolescent patient intentionally overdosed on pregabalin and was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for 2 days. Pregabalin was discontinued in 3 patients due to an increase in seizure frequency. Conclusions: Seven out of 17 patients treated with pregabalin reported increased seizure frequency and/or intensity, and 1 out of 17 patients reported no improvement. However, one patient's caregiver reported an improvement in seizure control since starting pregabalin therapy. All 17 patients in the cohort received treatment from one or more AEDs. Four of the 7 patients with reported increased seizure frequency and/or intensity have localization related epilepsy, whereas 2 of the 7 patients have generalized epilepsy. Reports of increased seizure frequency and/or intensity appears unrelated to daily dose per kilogram. Further studies are necessary to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin therapy in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. 1 Roy D. Elterman, 2 W. Donald Shields, and 3 Stephen Collins ( 1 Clinical Professor of Neurology, UT Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX ; 2 David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 3 Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Deerfield, IL ) Rationale: The Vigabatrin Infantile Spasms Study Group previously demonstrated that vigabatrin produces seizure cessation in patients with infantile spasms, particularly those with spasms secondary to tuberous sclerosis (Neurology 2001;57:1416?1421). This a priori analysis evaluates the efficacy of vigabatrin by etiology of infantile spasms. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, single-blind study of 14 days with a 3-year, open-label, flexible dosing follow-up in patients with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients ≤2 years of age and who were naïve to treatment with either adrenocorticotropic hormone, prednisone, or valproate were randomized to receive either high-dose (100?148 mg/kg/day) or low-dose (18?36 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin for 14 days. Doses were administered orally (tablets) on a BID regimen. Subgroup analysis of efficacy data was conducted by etiology. Specifically, outcomes of patients by etiology who were spasm free for 7 consecutive days and remained spasm free for the duration of the study based on caregiver assessment were evaluated. Results: Evaluable patients by etiology included 38 tuberous sclerosis (17.2%), 57 cryptogenic (25.8%), and 126 symptomatic-other (57.0%). Response increased dramatically for all etiologies after approximately 2 weeks of vigabatrin therapy and continued to increase with treatment. Of interest were response rates for spasm cessation for 7 consecutive days and remaining spasm free during of the study period (up to 3 years): 73.7% for tuberous sclerosis, 71.9% for cryptogenic, and 49.6% for symptomatic-other. The median time to spasm free status (and remaining spasm free during study period) by etiology was 3 weeks for tuberous sclerosis, 9 weeks for cryptogenic, and 14 weeks for symptomatic-other. Approximate percentage of subjects who became spasm free and remained spasm free by 12 weeks was 32%, 58% and 72%, respectively. The safety profile of vigabatrin by etiology disclosed no differences between groups. Conclusions: Vigabatrin was effective in rapidly producing freedom of spasms for symptomatic, cryptogenic and tuberous sclerosis-induced infantile spasms. The median onset of spasm freedom for all patients in the study ranged from 3 to 14 weeks, and occurred as early as 3 weeks for patients with tuberous sclerosis. While a significant separation of effect between the etiology categories was seen, with tuberous sclerosis responding slightly faster, all groups exhibited a high and sustained response rate to vigabatrin treatment. Previous studies have suggested efficacy of vigabatrin in tuberous sclerosis-induced infantile spasms. This large study also suggests efficacy in cryptogenic and symptomatic-other infantile spasms. These data suggest that vigabatrin may be considered as a first-line treatment for all etiologies of infantile spasms.

The risk is less well known in children. There are no previous reports on visual fields in children who received vigabatrin in infancy. Methods: Vigabatrin has been used as the first drug for infantile spasms in our unit since 1994. We have aimed to investigate visual fields in all VGB-treated children whose age and developmental level allow sufficient cooperation. Eleven such children born in 1993?1999 were available for study. All had infantile spasms during the first year of life, nine with idiopathic and two with symptomatic etiology. Spasms started at a median age of 5.2 (range, 2.9?11.9) months, and lasted for a median of 22 (range, 1?88) days. Ten children have remained seizure-free and one relapsed with focal seizures. Neuropsychological testing at age 5?6 years showed normal cognitive performance in eight children and mild cognitive dysfunction in three. Visual fields were tested by experienced nurses, using the kinetic Goldman perimeter with standard objects V/4e and I/3e in ten children, and IV and 4 in one. Normal result was defined as the fields extending ≥70 degrees in the temporal meridian. Results: Vigabatrin was started at median age 5.5 (range 3.2?12.5) months and lasted for a median of 23.7 (12.6?29.8) months. The median cumulative dose was 733 (range, 284?995) g. Vigabatrin was the only treatment in six children while five also received ACTH. The results of the first Goldman perimetry performed at a median age of 7.2 (range, 6.0?10.6) years were normal in seven children. Three children showed mildly abnormal or uncertain findings in the first testing but had normal results at the second perimetry at 8.7?10.8 years. Temporal fields of one child who was tested only once at 6.6 years extended to 65 degrees. Conclusions: The risk of visual field constriction after vigabatrin treatment may not be as high in infancy as in adulthood. 1,2 Earl Giller, 1 Julia Tsai, 1 Kenneth Shaw, 3 Vincent Pieribone, 4 Christine Soufflet, and 4 Olivier Dulac ( 1 Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Branford, CT ; 2 Psychiatry ; 3 Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 4 Hôpital St. Vincent de Paul, Paris, France ) Rationale: The neurosteroid ganaxolone (GNX) is an allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor complex distinct from the benzodiazepine site. GNX has protective activity in diverse animal seizure models. Previous clinical studies have indicated that oral GNX is safe and well-tolerated. This study evaluated GNX as add-on therapy in hospitalized children continuing to have seizures despite treatment with available marketed antiepileptic drugs. Methods: Fifteen children (9 male, 6 female), ages 5 to 15 years, enrolled in an open-label flexible dose-escalation study of GNX for the treatment of partial or generalized seizures refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs. Dosing of GNX ß-cyclodextrin suspension ranged from a starting dose of 1 mg/kg BID to a maximum maintenance dose of 12 mg/kg TID. Dose titration was conducted during a 16-day inpatient hospitalization followed by a 2-month maintenance period, after which patients continued treatment, or withdrew treatment over 2 weeks. Results: Thirteen of the 15 subjects were evaluated at Maintenance Week 4 (MW 4). Two patients were withdrawn prior to evaluation, one due to non-compliance and one to adverse events. The responses of the 13 patients were substantial (≥ 50% seizure reduction) in 4 (one becoming seizure free), moderate (25?49% reduction) in 3 and insufficient (<25% reduction) in 6 patients. Of the 8 patients evaluated at Maintenance Week 8 (MW 8), the responses were substantial in 4 (one of whom was a nonresponder at MW 4), moderate in 2 and insufficient in 2 patients. Three of the 4 eligible patients continued GNX in extension treatment. A total of 17 adverse events (AEs) were reported during the escalation and maintenance phases, 16 attributable to the central nervous system and 1 to the digestive system. Somnolence was the most frequently reported AE. Severity of AEs was either mild or moderate. One patient with a history of abnormal behavior including frequent episodes of agitation experienced a serious adverse event (agitation, hostility, and hallucination requiring extended hospitalization) after a 3 mg/kg TID dose of GNX. These events were considered moderate in severity and possibly related to GNX. The patient was withdrawn from the study, and the events resolved after 11 days. Conclusions: GNX was well-tolerated. A portion of the subjects in this drug-refractory population seemed to respond to GNX (5 of 15 demonstrated at least a 25% decrease in seizure frequency at both time points, and 6 demonstrated at least a 25% decrease in seizure frequency at MW 8). Additional controlled studies are required to confirm the efficacy of GNX for the treatment of children with drug refractory partial or generalized seizures.

Dlugos ( 1 School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Division of Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, PA ) Rationale: To identify situations where equipoise (uncertainty) exists regarding initiation of AED therapy after two unprovoked seizures in children. This has implications for design of future placebo-controlled trials for anti-epileptic drug (AED) monotherapy in children. Methods: A survey with ten case scenarios of new-onset epilepsy in children was developed. Features varying across scenarios included: age, seizure semiology, seizure duration, post-ictal state, time between seizures, time since last seizure, EEG and MRI results, and patient comorbidities. The survey was administered to Pediatric health care providers (HCPs). Survey participants were asked two questions about each case: 1) ?Initiation of a daily AED is indicated?? answered using a 5 point Likert scale; and 2) ?I would consider referring this patient for a clinical trial comparing a standard AED with placebo?? answered as yes/no. Results: To date, 151 HCPs completed the survey. Among the 38 HCPs who identified themselves as Pediatric Neurology or Developmental Pediatrics, 13% to 71% responded they disagreed or were uncertain regarding the need to begin an AED. Among the 113 responders who identified themselves as General Pediatrics, Subspecialty Pediatrics or Adult Neurology, 15% to 74% responded they disagreed or were uncertain regarding the need to begin an AED. Features correlating most strongly with desire to initiate an AED (up to 85% of all participants) included abnormal MRI or EEG results, convulsions, and older age. Seizure duration, post-ictal state, time interval between seizures, time interval since the last seizure, and patient comorbidities did not correlate with desire to start an AED. With regard to referral for a placebo-controlled trial, 35?78% of Peds Neuro/Dev Peds respondents were willing to refer, compared to 34?59% of other respondents. Conclusions: Given certain clinical features, equipoise exists regarding the initiation of AED therapy after two unprovoked seizures in children. Placebo-controlled trials are ethical and possible in children with new-onset epilepsy if inclusion criteria based on equipoise are carefully crafted.

Of the 3.5 million people who develop epilepsy annually, 40% are younger than 15 years and more than 80% live in developing countries. The choice of anti-epileptic drug (AED) is determined by diagnosis, but also the potential effectiveness and tolerability for an individual child. In the absence of head-to-head trials directly comparing AEDs in children with partial epilepsy, a scientific review is performed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of newer AEDs from available data. Levetiracetam is here compared to newer AEDs. Methods: Randomized placebo-controlled trials of add-on therapy with levetiracetam, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate and oxcarbazepine in children with partial epilepsy were identified in the Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006 and Medline (1996 to May 2006). The outcomes considered were the 50% responder rate (efficacy measure) and withdrawal rate (tolerability measure) of levetiracetam and these newer AEDs versus placebo. A fixed-effects analysis was used to estimate Mantel-Haenszel's odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes. Safety evaluation between these AEDs was assessed using Summary Complaint Scores (placebo events subtracted from AED events) on adverse events with an incidence of at least 10%. Results: One placebo-controlled trial was found for each AED. Levetiracetam (OR: 3.30 [95% CI: 1.75; 6.24]) and lamotrigine (OR: 3.82 [95% CI: 1.96; 7.45]) were more effective than gabapentin (OR: 1.36 [95% CI:0.71; 2.58]) and had similar withdrawal rates. Levetiracetam (OR: 0.44 [95% CI:0.17;1.15]) had a lower withdrawal rate than oxcarbazepine (OR: 2.15 [95% CI: 1.00; 4.60]); the efficacy of these drugs was comparable (OR: 2.39 [95% CI: 1.00; 4.60] for oxcarbazepine). Gabapentin (score of 15) and levetiracetam (38) showed a more favorable summary complaint score as compared with lamotrigine (69), topiramate (83) and oxcarbazepine (154). Conclusions: This analysis suggest that add-on therapy with levetiracetam has a favorable responder and withdrawal rates, and Summary Complaint Scores relative to several AEDs in children with partial epilepsy at doses used in clinical trials. Comparative clinical trials and long-term studies of these agents are needed to confirm these findings and assist physicians in making the right treatment choice. (Supported by UCB S.A.) 1 Katherine D. Holland, and 1 Tracy A. Glauser ( 1 Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Sparse information exists about the overall effectiveness and dose response curve characteristics for initial antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy in children with partial onset seizures. The purpose of this work is to characterize the effectiveness and dose response curve characteristics of carbamazepine (CBZ) initial monotherapy in a cohort of consecutive children with partial onset epilepsy. Methods: A cohort of 100 consecutive children (1?18 years of age) with newly diagnosed partial onset epilepsy treated with CBZ as initial monotherapy was identified from the New Onset Seizure Clinic at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Information from the history, physical examination, MRI, and EEG were used to classify the patient's epilepsy and etiology. Seizure control, adherence, and adverse events were recorded at each visit. CBZ responsiveness was defined as seizure freedom for at least 12-months on a stable dose of CBZ monotherapy or breakthrough seizures only with missed doses in patients with evidence of compliance from random levels. Non-responsiveness was defined as the addition or substitution of a second AED because of continued seizures and/or intolerable adverse events. Results: Of the 100 patients studied, 55 became seizure free on CBZ monotherapy, 10 did not tolerate CBZ within the first 3 months of therapy either due to hypersensitivity or intolerable side effects and 35 continued to have seizures. The mean dose in seizure-free children was 11.1 mg/kg/day (standard deviation 3.4 mg/kg/d). The majority of these children responded at the initial dose. Following achievement of the initial target dose 36% of all patients stopped having seizures. There was a weak but statistically significant correlation between age at time of treatment and dose used to control seizures. In children under 12 years age (n = 44) the average daily dose in seizure-free children was 11.8 ± 3.4 mg/kg/d. In those 12 years of age and over (n = 11) the average dose was 9.0 ± 3.4 mg/kg/d in seizure-free children (p < 0.05). The data followed a normal distribution and from this it was determined that over 95% of children < 12 years will respond by 17.5 mg/kg/d and 95% children 12 and over will respond by 15 mg/kg/d. Conclusions: Slightly over half (55%) of children with newly diagnosed partial onset epilepsy become seizure free with initial CBZ monotherapy. A considerable percentage (over one-third of these) became seizure free as soon as they began taking CBZ. The CBZ dose response curve reaches its upper plateau at doses lower than expected. Children under 12 years of age who continue to have seizures at CBZ doses above 17.5 mg/kg/d and those ≥12 years who continue to have seizures at 15 mg/kg/d are very unlikely to respond to CBZ. Other treatments should be considered when seizures continue at CBZ doses above this even if the child is not experiencing intolerable dose related side-effects.

Holmes ( 1 Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ; and 2 INMED, INSERM-U29, Marseille, France ) Rationale: The anaesthetic agent isoflurane exerts its anticonvulsant effect on the central nervous system by suppressing excitation and enhancing inhibition. Most studies devoted to investigation of the mechanism of isoflurane action have been performed on culture and slice preparations from adult animals. However the mechanism of the anticonvulsant action of isoflurane on the immature brain is unclear. The influence of isoflurane on GABAergic system and neuronal network activity was studied in hippocampal slices from immature rat brain. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rat pups (postnatal days 8?12) were used throughout the study. Effects of isoflurane (2.5%) were recorded using extracellular and whole-cell patch technique. All intracellular recordings were performed at 0mV (reversal potential for excitatory synaptic transmission). Results: We studied the effect of isoflurane on multi-unit activity (MUA), giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) and tonic GABA currents recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cell layer while extracellular K+ ([K+]o) was changed in the range of 3.5?6mM. Application of isoflurane on hippocampal slices in normal [K+]o (3.5mM) solution significantly decreases amplitude and increase the inter-event interval of MUA. In whole-cell recordings isoflurane significantly increased the tonic GABA conductance; prolong decay and decrease the frequency of sIPSC. Increasing [K+]o to 6 mM led to increasing of frequency of GDPs. Adding of isoflurane to high [K+]o solution had a biphasic effect on GDPs. At first the frequency GDPs were two-fold increased followed by decreasing in amplitude (59.4 ± 1.1%), increasing in duration (62.8 ± 3.3%) and frequency (43.2 ± 3.4%) of GDPs. There were not significant differences between the effect of isoflurane on MUA, sIPSCs and tonic GABA currents in two studied conditions (normal and high [K+]o solution). Gabazine added to extracellular solution in concentration, which selectively blocks synaptic GABAA receptor (1?M), increased MUA frequency, blocked sIPSCs, GDPs and had no apparent effect on tonic GABA conductance. In 6mM [K+]o solution application gabazine evoked interictal discharges. After application of isoflurane, the frequency of gabazine-induced interictal events decreased from 0.30 Hz to 0.25 Hz. Outward, bicuculline sensitive currents appeared in the presence of isoflurane simultaneously with interictal discharges. Anticonvulsive effect of isoflurane was completely abolished by adding 15 ?M bicuculline into extracellular solution. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that isoflurane has multiple effects in the immature brain. Even though GABA is depolarizing in the immature brain, this volatile anaesthetic decreases the synchronization of neuronal activity, mainly through enhancing the GABAergic inhibition. (Supported by the Epilepsy Foundation.) 1,2 Jinsook Kim, 1,2,3 Alexei Kondratyev, and 1,2 Karen Gale ( 1 Interdisciplinary Program In Neuroscience, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ; 2 Department of Pharmacology ; and 3 Department of Pediatrics ) Rationale: Several AEDs induce pronounced apoptotic neuronal death in specific brain regions in the neonatal rat (Bittigau et al., PNAS,2002). Moreover, AEDs in doses subthreshold for causing cell death in the neonatal brain, can cause substantial cell death when given in combination with other AEDs. Although newer AEDs such as topiramate (TPM) and levetiracetam (LEV) cause little or no cell death in neonatal rats when given alone, neither has been examined for effects on cell death when combined with other AEDs. This is of particular concern because these drugs are frequently used in polytherapy. Therefore, we examined the neurotoxicity of TPM and LEV alone and in combination with phenytoin (PHT) in rat pups. We also examined the effect of carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug often used during pregnancy and childhood. Methods: TPM (20, 40, 80 mg/kg), LEV (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg) or CBZ (25, 50, 100 mg/kg), was given to Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 7, 24h prior to sacrifice. The following doses were also tested in combination with 50 mg/kg PHT: TPM (20, 40, 80 mg/kg); LEV (500 mg/kg); CBZ (25, 50 mg/kg). In addition, LEV (250, 500 mg/kg) was tested in combination with CBZ (50 mg/kg). Cell death was evaluated by TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade B staining in 20micron coronal brain sections throughout the forebrain and midbrain. Results: Although TPM (20?80 mg/kg) alone did not induce cell death, it significantly enhanced cell death induced by PHT, even at the lowest dose. CBZ alone did not cause cell death up to 50 mg/kg, but when combined with PHT, 50 mg/kg (but not 25 mg/kg) CBZ significantly enhanced PHT-induced cell death. Cell death was most marked in thalamus and striatum. LEV (250?1000 mg/kg) alone did not induce cell death, and doses up to 500 mg/kg were without effect on PHT-induced cell death. No detectable cell death resulted from the combination of LEV (250 mg/kg) with CBZ (50 mg/kg). Conclusions: In comparison to most traditional AEDs, CBZ, TPM and LEV are relatively devoid of a pro-apoptotic action in the developing brain, when administered in a dose range equivalent to, or higher than, the therapeutic range for seizure control. However, our data indicate that they exhibit distinct profiles of interaction with PHT. Whereas both TPM and CBZ significantly exacerbated PHT-induced cell death, LEV was devoid of this effect. Our data underscore the importance of evaluating the safety of AEDs given in combinations and not merely extrapolating from the effects of exposure to single drugs. Our data suggest that the combination of CBZ and LEV minimizes neurotoxicity in the developing brain and may therefore hold promise as a potential treatment of choice for AED therapy in pregnancy, preterm infants and neonates.

Methods: A total of 46 epileptic patients (22 boys and 24 girls) with topiramate were evaluated in this study at the Department of Pediatrics, Chonbuk National University Hospital. We have measured sweating functions using a noninvasive sweating test (Neurocheck?) before and 3 months later after topiramate initiation. We also made a direct survey for the hypohidrosis and hypohidrosis-related symptoms during topiramate treatment. Results: The mean age was 7.8 ± 3.2. The mean dosage of topiramate was 4.5 ± 0.8 mg/kg/day. Among the 46 epileptic patients, 17 patients (37.0%) experienced hypohidrosis and hypohidrosis-related symptoms on survey: 12 (26.1%) have facial flushing, 4 (8.7%) heat intolerance, 1 (2.2%) lethargy, but no one have anhidrosis. Among the 17 patients, 13 patients showed delayed sweat test after medication. Sixteen out of 46 patients (34.8%) showed delayed sweat function test by Neurocheck? after medication. Thirteen out of these 16 patients had hypohydrosis-related symptoms. The overall measures of agreement between Neurocheck? and the survey was 76.5%. Conclusions: The main result indicates that Neurocheck? could be a useful test to detect and predict the topiramate induced hypohidrosis in pediatric epileptic patients. We recommend that patients who show the delayed, particularly delayed over 3 minutes, in Neurocheck? test after topiramate initiation should be aware the hypohidrosis and hypohidrosis-related symptoms. 1 Irina Katz, 2,3 Jinsook Kim, 2,3 Karen Gale, and 1,2,3 Alexei Kondratyev ( 1 Pediatrics, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ; 2 Interdisciplinary Program In Neuroscience, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ; and 3 Pharmacology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC ) Rationale: Several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) induce pronounced apoptotic neuronal death in specific brain regions during the first two postnatal weeks in rat (Bittigau et al., PNAS, 99:15089, 2002). The corresponding period in humans extends from late gestation through early infancy. Since excessive neuronal loss in late prenatal or early postnatal development may contribute to long-term adverse effects, it is important to identify treatment regimens that are devoid of this deleterious action. Here we examined the effects of lamotrigine (LTG, 10?100 mg/kg) on cell death in several brain regions of neonatal rats. We also examined the effects of LTG given in combination with either phenytoin or MK801. Methods: LTG (10, 20, 30, 50, 100 mg/kg) was administered to Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 7 (PD7), 24hr prior to sacrifice. The following drug combinations were also tested: LTG 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg + phenytoin (50 mg/kg) and LTG (20 mg/kg) + MK801 (0.5 mg/kg). Phenytoin (50 mg/kg) and MK801 (0.5 mg/kg) given alone were also evaluated. Cell death was evaluated in 20 ?m coronal brain sections by TUNEL assay in several brain areas, including striatum, thalamus, multiple cortical regions and the hippocampus. Results: LTG alone administered at doses of 10?30 mg/kg did not induce significant cell death. At a dose of 50 mg/kg, 50% of the animals showed increased cell death in thalamus. Administration of 100 mg/kg resulted in significant increase in cell death in all brain areas examined except frontal cortex. Combined application of LTG (20 mg/kg) with MK-801 resulted in an enhancement of the MK-801-induced cell death effect in multiple regions. A similar enhancement of phenytoin-induced cell death was observed in the presence of 30 mg/kg LTG. In contrast, the lower dose of LTG (20 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the phenytoin-induced cell death. The lowest dose of LTG (10 mg/kg) was without effect. Conclusions: Our results indicate that therapeutic doses of LTG alone do not induce cell death in the neonatal rat brain in marked contrast to traditional AEDs such as phenytoin, valproate and phenobarbital. However, when given in combination with other pro-apoptotic agents LTG may potentiate cell death, depending upon the dose and the specific drug combination. This is similar to the profile we have observed with topiramate in other studies. However, a unique feature of LTG is its ability, in low doses, to attenuate the cell death induced by phenytoin. It will now be of interest to determine whether this protective action of LTG in the neonatal brain can also be seen when LTG is combined with other traditional AEDs.

Benito Juarez, Mexico ; and 6 UCB S.A., Braine l?Alleud, Belgium ) Rationale: Levetiracetam has demonstrated efficacy in children but the pharmacokinetics in children are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its major metabolite ucb L057 in children with partial-onset seizures and determine whether it is affected by adjunctive carbamazepine or valproate. A secondary objective was to correlate levetiracetam concentrations in plasma and saliva and assess its safety and clinical response. Methods: Design was an open-label, multicenter study. 21 children (4 to 12 years old) with epilepsy taking carbamazepine (13) or valproate (8) received adjunctive levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was initiated at 20 mg/kg/day and titrated at 2-week intervals to 40 and then 60 mg/kg/day. Twelve-hour pharmacokinetics were determined at the end of each 2-week period. Efficacy was estimated from the partial seizure frequency per week and Global Evaluation Scale. Results: Levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed following oral dosing, with median tmax of 0.5 hour and t1/2 of 4.9 hours. Dose proportional increases were observed for Cmax and AUC(0?12) over the dose range. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and ucb L057 were not markedly different with concomitant carbamazepine or valproate; clearance was 7?13% faster and AUC was decreased by 15?24% in those on carbamazepine compared to valproate. Levetiracetam did not affect trough carbamazepine or valproate. Concentration in saliva and plasma were strongly correlated. Seizure frequency declined by 50% or more in 43% of subjects in the intent-to-treat population (n = 21) and in 56% of those with seizures at baseline (n = 16). Marked or moderate improvement occurred in 80% and 75% of patients based on Global Evaluation Scale ratings by investigators and parents/guardians, respectively. Levetiracetam was well tolerated. Conclusions: Levetiracetam exhibits simple pharmacokinetics in children, with rapid absorption and dose-proportional kinetics. Small but not clinically relevant differences were observed between subjects receiving carbamazepine and valproate, suggesting significant dose adjustment is usually not necessary. This substantiates prior assessments that levetiracetam clearance is higher in children than adults, necessitating a higher dose in children on a mg/kg basis, and suggests it is useful add-on therapy for children with refractory partial-onset seizures regardless of baseline therapy.

Wolf ( 1 Neurology, Beth Israel, New York, NY ) Rationale: Parents and caregivers of children with infantile spasms and Landau-Kleffner syndrome are often concerned re: possible side effects of and use of intramuscular injections for administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Methods: A retrospective chart review was used to identify children who were treated with intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone. Caregivers were contacted and completed a questionnaire regarding their concerns before and after treatment. Anaysis was done to determine whether or not their fears were warranted; whether or not they would recommend treatment to others and what information they felt would be most helpful for families undertaking the decision-making process. Results: A total of ten families responded. They overwhelmingly felt that they were happy that they proceeded with treatment despite their initial fears; their biggest concerns before treatment were fear of injecting medciation, side effect they feared most was blood dyscrasias, most troublesome side effects were weight gain, insomnia and irritability. Recommendations were: need for easy access to medical personnel and written and video information regarding the medicaiton. Conclusions: The use of adrenocorticotropic hormone poses challenges when providers are attempting to convince families to use this treatment option. Families felt, in retrospect, that treatment was not as overwhelming as they anticipated and asked for instructional materials and abiity to easily contact providers and other families who could serve as resources. 1 Franklin R. Montero-Contreras ( 1 Unit of Pediatric Neurology; Child Unit of Epilepsy, Centro Medico Universidad Central del Este, Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, Dominican Republic ) Rationale: To determine the efficacy of Leviteracetam (LEV) in the control of clinical convulsive crisis in the epilepsies or epileptics syndromes in children. Although Levetiracetam has been only approved for adults, it has showed to be effect in children. Methods: Between September 2002 and January 2005, twenty-four chil-dren of our unit were treated with Levetiracetam (40?50 Mg/Kg/day). Our retrospective-analytic study was carried out in fifteen patients (age: 12 months ? 13 years). All patients had their crisis diary checked before and after the addition of Levetiracetam. The follow up was from 8 to 26 months (average 15 months). The patients were classified in three groups, according to the 1989 ILAE classification. The reduction of crisis was rated in percentage (%). Results: We had seven idiopathic syndromes, three symptomatic syndromes and five cryptogenic syndromes. We had eight patients with partial epilepsies and seven patients with generalized epilepsies. All groups showed significant reduction of epileptic crisis (70% in more than 65% of patients). We observed no severe significants adverses reactions. In all patients the levetiracetam was add to polytherapy. Conclusions: The fact of making a correct diagnosis of the epileptics syndromes goes in favor of taking a better therapy choice. The reduction of frequency of crisis was significant. It was shown that Levetiracetam has a wide range of action. 1 Seth L. Ness, 1 Jeffrey S. Nye, 1 Caryn L. Kurland, 2 Sylvia Stubler, 2 Edward Maseda, 1 Steven Wang, 1 Bindu Murthy, and 1 Lisa Ford ( 1 Johnson  and 2 Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Inc., Titusville, NJ ) Rationale: Topiramate (TPM) has been evaluated in several double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of epilepsy in children as young as 2 years of age; studies in infants are currently underway. The dosages of TPM as adjunctive therapy that are currently being evaluated in infants were based, in part, on findings from a survey of neurologists and epileptologists with personal experience in using TPM in infants. Methods: A random sample of neurologists and epileptologists participated in an online survey of TPM dosing practices in infants. A total of 101 physicians met eligibility requirements and completed the survey. The majority (69%) had treated at least 50 infants with epilepsy (mean, 198) during the last 3 years. The majority (94%) also had experience in using TPM in infants; about 1 in 5 (19%) of all infants had been treated with TPM. The survey consisted of 19 questions concerning initial dose when starting infants on TPM; weekly rate of TPM dose increase; maximum TPM dose for infants; typical TPM maintenance dose; and use of blood levels for adjusting TPM therapy. Results: Physicians in this survey generally agreed on ≤3.0 mg/kg/day TPM as a starting dose for infants and on ≤3.0 mg/kg/day as a titration increment. However, maintenance doses, maximum doses, and target blood levels varied widely. Although most physicians (88%) used maintenance doses of ≤15 mg/kg/day, 3% used maintenance doses of 25?50 mg/kg/day; 9% used maximum doses of 40?60 mg/kg/day. Conclusions: Further studies are underway to define weight-based TPM dosages for infants, which may vary according to age/development. These systematic evaluations of pharmacokinetics and efficacy across a wide range of TPM dosages in infants with epilepsy will close a critical gap in information available to clinicians using TPM to treat epilepsy in children.

Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the risks and benefits of valproate/divalproate and lamotrigine co-administration in a pediatric population with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Seventy-six patients received an association of valproate and lamotrigine according to Gubermann?s criteria (1993). Results were established in accordance with seizure control, adverse effects and tolerability. Treatment was considered effective when seizure reduction > 50% was obtained. Results: Association of valproate and lamotrigine was considered effective in 69 (90.8%) of all patients. Total seizure control (seizure-free) was obtained in 45 (59.2%) patients. Although seizure control was considered unsatisfactory (<50%) in the remaining patients, drop-attacks and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures were reduced in nine (11.8%) patients, maintained on treatment. Tremor occurred in six (7.9%) patients; urinary incontinence and ataxia in one (1.3%). Skin rash occurred as an early manifestation in six (7.9%) patients, of which all had a previous history of hypersensitivity to anti-epileptic drugs. Reasons for treatment fall-out were unsatisfactory seizure control in five (6.6%) and adverse effects in three (3.9%). Conclusions: In this series, seizure control was observed in most children with refractory epilepsy, some of which had a previous history of unsatisfactory response either to lamotrigine or to valproato, both in monotherapy or polytherapy. Adverse effects were infrequent, but skin rash was observed more frequently than in other series in which valproate or lamotrigine were used separately. However, this risk may be minimized by slow introduction and increase of the dosage of lamotrigine and by exclusion of patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity.

Phillips ( 1 Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: Phenobarbital is widely used for the treatment of neonatal seizures, but is effective in only about one-third to one-half of neonates with seizures. Second line treatments such as phenytoin or benzodiazepines have also been of limited effectiveness. In addition, in animal studies, all of these drugs increase neuronal death. Levetiracetam (LEV) potentially represents an alternative option because of its novel mechanism of action and favorable pharmacological profile. However, little is know about the effects of LEV in neonates with seizures. The purpose of this work is to characterize the safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in neonates with seizures. Methods: The effectiveness of LEV was studied retrospectively in a group of neonates with EEG confirmed seizures. Patients were identified from a database of EEGs done in the neonatal intensive care unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and associated hospitals over the past 18 months. Neonates were included if they had electrographic seizures (with or without clinical correlate) on an initial EEG and in whom LEV was used within the first 52 weeks post-conceptual age. Gestational age, post-conceptual age at seizure onset and at time of initiation of LEV, seizure frequency as determined from serial EEGs and clinical course, etiology of seizures, concomitant antiepileptic therapies, dose of LEV, and side effects associated with LEV therapy were recorded. Results: Five neonates met the entry criteria. The average gestational age was 34 weeks (SD 7.1) with the average post-conceptual age at seizure onset being 39.2 weeks. The etiologies included malformations of cortical development (2), prematurity with intracranial hemorrhage (2) and unknown (1). The median seizure frequency at the time of the initial EEG was 24 per day (range 1?48). All infants were initially treated with and maintained on Phenobarbital. Following initiation of phenobarbital therapy, the median seizure frequency was 7.5 per day (range 1?48). Levetiracetam therapy was initiated at an average postconceptual age of 41.2 weeks (SD 5.3). Doses of LEV were titrated to effect and ranged from 24 to 72 mg/kg/d. No treatment-related side effects were seen even at the highest LEV dose. During LEV therapy, the median seizure frequency was 1 seizure per day (range 0.3?24). One neonate became seizure free and another had over a 75% reduction in seizure frequency; two infants had a 50?75% reduction in seizure frequency and there was no response to LEV in the remaining infant. In addition to infants that met entry criteria, another 4 infants were treated with LEV within the first 6 months of life. In these infants, levetiracetam doses ranged from 25?86 mg/kg/d. No treatment related side effects were reported. Conclusions: Levetiracetam was well tolerated in neonates, even at high doses. Seizure frequency was reduced in all but one neonate and one infant became seizure-free. Levetiracetam should be considered in the treatment of neonatal seizures.

Kolodgie, 1 Andrew Renuart, 1 Michael Sigman, and 2 Jay Salpekar ( 1 Neurology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ; and 2 Psychiatry, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ) Rationale: The use of extended release formulation antiepileptic medications has the advantage of once daily dosing, but requires the ability to swallow the tablet without chewing. In pediatric patients with moderate mental retardation, the ability to swallow tablets potentially limits the use of extended release formulations. This study was designed to evaluate the ability of caregivers to teach pediatric patients with moderate mental retardation to swallow Depakote ER tablets. Methods: Pediatric patients taking stable dose Depakote Sprinkles tablets with moderate mental retardation were recruited to participate in a clinical trial which involved transition to Depakote Extended Release (Depakote ER) tablets. A structured protocol to teach patients to swallow tablets was implemented for 4 weeks. Depakote ER tablets were then introduced. The ability to swallow tablets consistently without chewing was the primary outcome measure. Trough serum valproic acid levels were measured prior to transition, and 2?4 weeks post trasition. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and adaptive behavior rating scales were completed initially and at the completion of the 8 week trial. Results: Ten subjects (6 male) with moderate mental retardation (IQ between 40?60) age 11.1 years (mean 7?17 years) were recuited. Two were nonverbal, one was autistic, and one had a tracheostomy. Nine of 10 successfully learned to consistently swallow the tablets in 4 weeks; the last learned in several months. The valproic acid level was stable and remained therapeutic in 5 patients. Three patients had a decrease in valproic acid level 2 weeks after transition, and 2 of those 3 had an increase in seizure frequency. In 2 patients the valproic acid levels were not measured due to a protocol violation. None of the patients had significant choking, gagging or refusal to swallow tablets. Conclusions: Patients with moderate mental retardation can learn to swallow Depakote ER tablets without chewing, allowing the transition from twice daily dosing of Depakote Sprinkles to once daily dosing of Depakote ER tablets. In this population, the convenience of once daily dosing for a chronic daily medication lessens the caregiver burden of medication administration and potentially improves compliance. Monitoring the valproic acid level prior to transition and 2?4 weeks later will ensure adequacy of trough valproic acid level. Developmental delay with moderate mental retardation and/or inability to speak should not preclude the use of extended release formulation of medications. A structured program to teach how to swallow tablets, and careful safety monitoring of patients, can result in successful use of once daily medication dosing.

Hermann ( 1 Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Children and adults with epilepsy experience poor bone mineralization. This mineralization deficit appears to increase with longer duration of epilepsy and/or its treatment. The effect of antiepileptic drug (AED) initial monotherapy compared to polytherapy on bone mineralization has not been examined previously. We determined BMD in children treated with monotherapy (only ever exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ), valpraote (VPA) or lamotrigine (LTG) compared with AED polytherapy and to healthy controls. Methods: Age-normalized z-score total body BMD (Lunar?) was compared in patients 6?18 years treated for epilepsy with initial monotherapy with VPA, CBZ or LTG were compared with those patients receiving polytherapy and healthy controls. General exclusion criteria for patients included being non-ambulatory, treated for co-morbid disease or consuming known bone-adverse medications. Exclusions from the monotherapy group included exposure to an AED other than initial and ongoing monotherapy with either VPA, CBZ or LTG. Activity and calcium intake were examined. Statistical analysis included ANOVA and student t-test. Results: 33 patients (13 ± 3y; 13f, 20m) treated with monotherapy (CBZ = 13, VPA = 15, LTG = 4) were compared to 40 patients (11.7 ± 3.5y; 27f, 13m) recieving AED polytherapy and 36 healthy controls (13 ± 2y.6yr; 22f, 14m). Age, height and weight were not statistically different between groups. Duration of epilepsy for the monotherapy group was 5.2y (CI = 4, 6.4)compared to 6.3y (CI = 5,7.7). Age mean z-scores for total BMD was (0.5 ± .17) for patients recieving monotherapy and was similar to controls (0.5 ± .15). However, patients receiving AED polytherapy had lower BMD (-0.04 ± .15) than for patients recieving AED monotherapy or for controls, p < 0.02. Conclusions: AED Polytherapy was associated with significant reduction in BMD compared to patients recieving AED monotherapy. This reduction was far greater than the non-statistical trend towards the slightly longer treatment duration of polytherapy patients compared to monotherapy patients. Furthermore, while patients recieving AED monotherapy had similar BMD compared to controls, patients recieving AED polytherapy experienced a significant osteopenia when compared to controls. With larger number of patients the specific effect of inidvidual AED on bone health should become apparent.

Solomon ( 1 Child Neurology, New York Presbyterian Hospital ? Cornell, New York, NY ) Rationale: Seizures are indicative of underlying neurologic dysfunction in neonates. Repeated seizures may be deleterious to the brain even without disturbances of ventilation or perfusion. Seizures are refractory to first line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), phenobarbital (PB)and phenytoin (PHT) in 20?50% of children. In neonates AEDs can be even less effective in controlling seizures. Rapid control of status epilepticus with midazolam has been demonstrated in 2 previous studies with complete clinical and electrographic response in neonates who did not respond to PB and PHT. Methods: We report our experience with 3 neonates with status epilepticus secondary to HIE, Group B Streptococcal (GBS) meningitis and Ohtahara syndrome. The age at presentation was 1 day for the neonates with HIE and Ohtahara syndrome. The neonate with GBS meningitis presented at 23 days. Midazolam was initiated on day 2 of seizures for the neonates with HIE and meningitis. The neonate with Ohtahara syndrome initially was started on pentobarbital drip day 2 of seizures; midazolam was initiated day 4 as there was lack of response to PB, PHT and pentobarbital. Results: Seizures in all 3 neonates did not respond to PB (levels of 50?60 mcg/ml) and PHT (18?22 mcg/ml). The neonate with Ohtahara syndrome did not respond to pentobarbital in addition. Seizures in all responded to midazolam infusion. The neonate with meningitis developed hypotension which responded to inotropic support. There were no significant cardio-vascular side effects in any of the neonates. The neonate with Ohtahara syndrome who had received pentobarbital developed Necrotizing Enterocolitis prior to initiation of midazolam. Midazolam loading dose was used in the neonate with Ohtahara syndrome. Clinical and electrographic seizure control was acheived within a range of 6?72 hours after initiation of midazolam. The maximum dose of midazolam dose used was 0.2 mg/kg/hr. Conclusions: Midazolam was effective in the management of 3 neonates with refractory seizures that did not respond to PB, PHT and pentobarbital. Midazolam may be considered a safe and effective AED in refractory neonatal seizures of diverse etiologies. Midazolam may help acheive relatively rapid clinical and electrographic seizure control. This may be an important factor in decreasing the severity of neurodevelopmental sequelae. 1,2 Pasquale Striano, 2 Maria Margherita Mancardi, 1 Antonietta Coppola, 2 Maria Giuseppina Baglietto, 1 Salvatore Striano, 2 Federico Zara, 2 Roberto Gaggero, and Collaborative Group of Italian League Against Epil ( 1 Department of Neurological Sciences, Federico II University, Napoli, Italy ; and 2 Muscular and Neurodegenerative Disease Unit and Child Neuropsychiatry, Institute G. Gaslini, Genova ) Rationale: Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) or Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic encephalopathy with onset in the first year of life, more often with febrile hemiclonic or generalized status epilepticus, and secondary developmental delay. Although valproate, topiramate and stiripentol may give some benefit, drug treatment of SMEI is usually disappointing. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) with a mechanism of action distinct from that of other AEDs and broad spectrum of activity including antimyoclonic activity. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of LEV in patients with diagnosis of SMEI. Methods: 10 children (mean age 8.4 years; range 4?16 years) with clinical diagnosis of SMEI were enrolled in a multicentric, prospective, open-label study. 5 out of 10 patients showed SCN1A mutation. A mean of 2 (range: 1?5) AEDs were tried before LEV trial. LEV was given in add-on up to the dose of about 50?60 mg/kg/day. Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of seizures compared with baseline. Results: After a mean period of 8.5 months of treatment (range 6?12 months), 7 patients had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. None of the patient was seizure-free. LEV was generally well-tolerated. Mild adverse events (i.e., sedation, irritability) occurred in three patients. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that LEV may be a well-tolerated drug that may give some benefit in SMEI. Randomized placebo-controlled studies should be considered to evaluate further this promising therapy. 1 Julia Tsai, 1,2 Earl Giller, 1 Kenneth Shaw, 3 Vincent Pieribone, 4 Christine Soufflet, and 4 Olivier Dulac ( 1 Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Branford, CT ; 2 Psychiatry ; 3 Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 4 Hôpital St. Vincent de Paul, Paris, France ) Rationale: Ganaxolone (GNX), a neurosteroid, has been evaluated for the treatment of epilepsy in several Phase II clinical trials, including an inpatient trial in children with treatment-refractory seizures (see companion abstract). The present study evaluated GNX in children with treatment-refractory seizures in an outpatient setting. Methods: Forty-five children (25 male, 20 female), ages 2 to 15 years, with seizures refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs enrolled in an open-label, flexible dose-escalation study of GNX. Thirty-five had epileptic spasms with a historical diagnosis of infantile spasms (IS). After a pre-dosing observation period (OP), ganaxolone was titrated over a 9-week period at doses from 1 mg/kg BID to 12 mg/kg TID, followed by an 8-week maintenance period. Results: Twenty-seven (60%) of 45 patients completed the study. For all seizure types, twelve (27%) patients were responders (≥50% seizure reduction). Of the 35 with spasms, 1 patient experienced remission and 10 others were responders. Of 9 with absence seizures, 2 experienced remission and 1 other was a responder. Of 6 with partial seizures, 1 experienced remission and 2 others were responders. Of 12 with tonic seizures, 3 were responders. Neither of the patients with myoclonic seizures completed treatment. Central nervous system adverse events (CNS AEs) occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects were agitation (38%), adverse change in seizures (36%) and somnolence (24%). Subjects experienced respiratory/ear infections: pharyngitis (36%), otitis media (16%) and bronchitis (11%). Non-serious AEs leading to discontinuation were adverse change in seizures (6), agitation (4), increase in seizures and agitation (1), nausea (1), and somnolence (1). One withdrew due to insufficient clinical response. A total of 7 patients reported 9 serious AEs (7 possibly related and 2 unrelated). The majority (6/9) occurring in 5 patients were a change in seizure frequency and/or nature, including 1 who experienced 2 episodes of status epilepticus. Of the 5, 2 discontinued GNX. There was 1 event each of severe otitis, increased seizure frequency plus somnolence, and GNX accidental overdose. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of these drug-refractory children showed improvement with GNX (overall responder rate 27%; 31% in patients with a historical diagnosis of IS). Controlled trials are necessary to determine whether the worsening seen in some patients is a treatment-related effect or represents the natural disease course. Many subjects exhibited respiratory and ear infections, which is expected in a pediatric population. Transitory CNS AEs were common, but did not result in discontinuation in the majority of subjects. The results support controlled trials with GNX. (Supported by Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) 1 Gerard Piñol, 1 Divya S. Khurana, 1 Agustin Legido, 1 Sanjeev V. Kothare, 1 Harold Marks, 1 H. Huntley Hardison, 1 Joseph J. Melvin, and 1 Ignacio Valencia ( 1 Section of Child Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV) is a new antiepileptic drug (AED) approved as adjunctive therapy in children older than 4 years with partial or secondary generalized epilepsy. Myoclonic seizures are often difficult to control requiring several AEDs. Studies in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have shown good response of myoclonic seizures to LEV. The use of LEV in myoclonic seizures due to symptomatic generalized epilepsy in children is scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of LEV in the treatment of this type of seizures in children. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children with myoclonic seizures due to symptomatic generalized epilepsy, who were treated with LEV at our institution between 2003?2005. Reduction of myoclonic seizures was assessed. Results: Twelve patients (9M, 3F), mean age 7.2 years (range: 2?12) were identified. Two of them had myoclonic seizures only, while ten had additional types of seizures including tonic, tonic-clonic, complex partial, and drop attacks. Eleven patients had developmental delay, mental retardation or learning disability. Mean LEV dose was 39 mg/kg/day (range: 21?69 mg/kg/day), mean number of previous AEDs 2.6 (range 0?7), and mean number of concomitant AEDs 1.63 (range 0?3). One patient was on monotherapy. Mean follow up was 12 months. Myoclonic seizure reduction was as follows: 100% in 1, 75?99% in 2, 50?74% in 2, 25?49% in 3, and < 25% in 3. Overall, forty two percent of patients had 50% reduction in myoclonic seizures. Side effects included transient drowsiness in 2, and behavioral problems requiring discontinuing LEV within a month of therapy in 1. Conclusions: LEV proved to be effective and safe in our group of children with myoclonic seizures due to symptomatic generalized epilepsy. Further studies are necessary to assess the use of LEV monotherapy or polytherapy in myoclonic seizures in children. 1 Beverly S. Wical, 2 Frank J. Ritter, and 1 Shani K. Norberg ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare, St. Paul, MN ; and 2 Pediatric Neurology, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Neonatal seizures continue to lack therapies with proven efficacy and safety. Up to 50% of neonatal seizures are not controlled despite treatment with phenobarbital (PB) or fosphenytoin (fPHT). Concerns about toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in this special population persist. Term infants who fail standard therapy require additional treatment. Levetiractam (LEV) is considered a safe medication, with no significant drug interactions and no known neurotoxicity. We present our experience with LEV in 19 full term newborns. Methods: Retrospective chart analysis was performed: we identified 19 term infants who received LEV in the first 28 days of life. Charts were reviewed for demographics, birth weight, gestational age, age of seizure onset, and day of life LEV started. We reviewed other treatments, etiology of seizures, EEG and MRI results. Initial LEV and maintenance doses were recorded. Adverse events and side effects were reviewed. Number of infants continuing on LEV, and number seizure free were identified. Results: Nineteen infants with gestational ages 38 to 42 weeks receieved LEV for clinical seizures. LEV was administered by oral or nasogastric route. Seven infants were female, 12 male. Etiology for seizures included: cerebral infarction (6), unknown (4), hypoxia (2), congenital brain anomaly (2), extra-axial hemmorhage (2), mitochondrial disorder (1), bacterial meningitis (1), and prolonged hypoglycemia (1). All had EEG studies and MRI. Prior to starting LEV, 14 infants were treated with PB (level =/ > 30), fPHT (level =/ > 18), or both. One infant received a lower dose of PB; 4 received LEV as initial treatment. Doses of LEV given in the first 24 hr of treatment were 4 mg/kg to 42 mg/kg (mean 16 mg/kg). Maintenence doses ranged from 25 mg/kg/d to 90 mg/kg/d (mean 32 mg/kg/d). No infant had any significant adverse event related to LEV initiation or continued treatment. Transient initial sedation was noted in 3 infants. Prior to reaching optimal dosing, 2 infants discontinued LEV due to side effects. One was irritable, the other was sedated. Three infants stopped LEV due to lack of efficacy; all 3 failed multiple other medications. Fourteen of 19 infants continued LEV therapy beyond the neonatal period. Eleven became seizure free on LEV. Eight discontinued AEDs; 7 have been followed for 34 ? 57 mo (mean 32 mo) and remain seizure free. Six infants continue on LEV with excellent seizure control; duration of follow up is 9 to 45 mo (mean 18 mo). Conclusions: No significant adverse events were identified in this retrospective study of 19 term infants who received LEV. The majority (14/19) had difficult to treat seizures. It was well tolerated by 17/19 (90%) of infants. Fourteen of 19 (73%) received benefit from LEV therapy; 11/19 (58%) became seizure free. Our study suggests LEV is a promising therapy for neonatal seizures. Larger studies of safety and efficacy are needed. 1 Jorge G. Burneo, 1 Shareefa Abdool, and 1 Richard S. McLachlan ( 1 Epilepsy Programme, University of Western Ontario?LHSC, London, ON, Canada ) Rationale: The choice of drugs for the management of newly diagnosed epilepsy is based in evidence, that takes into account efficacy and safety. Comparisons between medications for specific syndromes or age-groups have not been carried out. We conducted a survey on the management of epilepsy among Canadian epileptologists. Methods: We mailed a questionnaire on the treatment of different epilepsy syndromes, to all epileptologists in Canada. Adult and pediatric epileptologists were identified from the Canadian League Against Epilepsy and the Canadian Congress of Neurological Sciences membership lists. Patient-scenarios were grouped into 13 categories according to epilepsy syndrome (absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, undetermined idiopathic generalized epilepsy, symptomatic or cryptogenic focal epilepsy, and unclassified epilepsy), and to patient's gender and age group. Physicians were asked to rate treatment options based on a 5-point scale (?1?= most appropriate to ?5?= harmful). The responses were anonymously collected. Results: Forty-one out of 64 Canadian epileptologists returned the survey. The results suggest a consensus among Canadian epileptologists: Valproate is the drug of choice for generalized epilepsies in the adult (p < 0.05) and elderly population, while lamotrigine is the choice in women of childbearing age (p < 0.05). For the treatment of the focal epilepsies, carbamazepine is the choice (p < 0.05) for all ages and groups. In undetermined epilepsy, carbamazepine and valproate are the choice for adults; carbamazepine, clobazam, and lamotrigine for the elderly; and lamotrigine and carbamazepine for women of childbearing age. Conclusions: The choices of antiepileptic drugs among Canadian epileptologists is similar, with some minor exceptions, with the choices of their American and French counterparts. 1 E. Andermann, 1 F. Andermann, 2 P. Meyvisch, and 2 F. Tonner ( 1 Montreal Neurological Hospital and Institute, McGill University, Quebec, Canada ; and 2 Pharma Sector, UCB SA, Braine-l?Alleud, Belgium ) Rationale: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (LEV) add-on therapy in patients with refractory idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) experiencing myoclonic seizures (MCS) or primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS). Methods: 2 multicentre, placebo (PBO)-controlled, double-blind studies were conducted in IGE patients with MCS (Study N166) or PGTCS (Study N01057). N166 recruited patients, age 12?65 years, experiencing ≥8 days with ≥1 MCS during 8 weeks baseline, and receiving 1 standard antiepileptic drug (AED). N01057 recruited patients, age 4?65 years, experiencing ≥3 PGTCS during 8 weeks baseline, and receiving 1?2 AEDs. LEV was uptitrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day (60 mg/kg/day for paediatric patients), and evaluated over 12 (N166) or 20 (N01057) weeks. Efficacy was assessed over the entire treatment period [titration+evaluation]), as responder rate (≥50% reduction in seizure days/week [MCS] or seizures/week [PGTCS]), and as seizure freedom rate defined as percentage of seizure-free study completers in the intention-to-treat population over the evaluation period. Tolerability was assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs). Results: N166 randomised 122 patients (Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy [JME] n = 113, Juvenile Absence Epilepsy [JAE] n = 9); 60 LEV and 60 PBO patients provided evaluable data. N01057 randomised 164 patients (JME n = 54, Epilepsy with Grand Mal Seizures on Awakening n = 49, JAE n = 19, Childhood Absence Epilepsy n = 7, other IGE n = 28, unknown syndromes n = 7; 79 LEV and 84 PBO patients provided evaluable data. In N166, responder rates (LEV vs PBO) were 58.3%vs 23.3% (p < 0.001) for MCS and 56.7%vs 21.7% (p < 0.001) for all seizures; seizure freedom rates were 16.7%vs 3.3% (p = 0.029) for MCS and 13.3%vs 0% (p = 0.006) for all seizures. In N01057, responder rates (LEV vs PBO) were 72.2%vs 45.2% (p < = 0.001) for PGTCS, and 59.5%vs 29.8% for all seizure types (p < 0.001); seizure freedom rates were 24.1%vs 7.1% (p = 0.004) for PGTCS and 15.2%vs 6.0% (p = 0.072) for all seizures. In N166, 75.0% LEV vs 66.7% PBO patients reported ≥1 AE during treatment period; 2 LEV and 1 PBO patient withdrew due to AEs. In N01057, 72.2% LEV vs 67.9% PBO patients reported ≥1 AE during treatment period; 1 LEV and 4 PBO patients withdrew due to AEs. Conclusions: These studies provide further evidence that LEV is effective and well tolerated in patients with refractory IGE, significantly reducing the frequency of both MCS and PGTCS and substantially increasing the seizure freedom rates in patients with each of these seizure types.

Hirsch ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Rash is a well known side effect of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Some patients develop rash from multiple AEDs. Very few studies have attempted to determine the frequency of cross-sensitivity of rashes among all AEDs.

Methods: As part of the Columbia AED Database, we reviewed the incidence of AED-related rash for 1875 patients with epilepsy ≥12 years old, including a history of AED rash at any age. We compared the rate of rash when these patients were taking any of the 15 most commonly used AEDs at our center: carbamazepine (CBZ), clobazam (CLB), felbamate (FBM), gabapentin (GBP), levetiracetam (LEV), lamotrigine (LTG), oxcarbazepine (OXC), phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), primidone (PRM), tiagabine (TGB), topiramate (TPM), vigabatrin (VGB), valproic acid (VPA)  2) any other AED;  2.8% (72/1875) of patients had a rash from ≥2 AEDs. Rates of rash  and 2 Neuroscience, Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL ) Rationale: Drug intoxication after inadvertent substitution of an immediate-release drug with an extended-release formulation has been documented (Am J Health-Syst Pharm 2001;58:402?5). Similarly, it has been speculated that clinical consequences could occur from a lack of recogntion of the differential biopharmaceutic characteristics of the divalproex sodium extended-release formulation (ER) versus the conventional delayed-release, enteric-coated formulation (EC) (Ann Pharmacotherapy 2006; 40:619?25). ER is approved for once daily administration, whereas EC is approved for multiple-daily dosing. We analyzed prospectively collected cases of adverse effects and breakthrough sizures in patients with epilepsy resulting from the unintentional substitution of EC for multiple-daily dosing due to medication dispensing errors. Methods: EC vs. ER dispensing errors were tabulated in epilepsy clinics between July 2001 and May 2006. Patients and caregivers were interviewed to determine pharmacy location, circumstances of error, and any seizures or adverse effects that followed the errors. Results: Substitution of clinican prescribed once-daily ER with EC occurred in six cases, due to lack of availability of ER at the local pharmacy at the time of prescription submission, and in five cases due to mistakes on refills of a previous correctly filled prescription. Two experienced increased tremor of mild but noticeable severity. Three patients had breakthrough seizures. Side effects and seizures abated after discovery of the errors and the correct ER dosing regimens were resumed. One patient was given both ER and EC in one refill, being told by the pharmacy that the two formulations only differed in color. Three other cases documented incorrectly the formulation dispensed, which created confusion for the prescriber, but did not result in problems for the patient. Conclusions: Availability of divalproex-ER and EC in identical dose strengths has created some confusion among healthcare providers and pharmacies, resulting in patient complications. Prescriptions for EC vs ER require vigilance by all, including the patients receiving the prescriptions. Inadvertent substitution of EC for ER has been documented to have deleterious clinical impact. Additional education of pharmacists may be needed to minimize dispensing errors of this type. (Supported by Abbott Laboratories.) 1 Michael J. Boyd, 1 Robert T. Standring, 1 Patrick L. Alore, 1 Terrence Metz, 2 Michael J. Schneck, and 2 Micheal P. Macken ( 1 Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL ; and 2 Neurology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL ) Rationale: Levetiracetam, although currently approved only as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of epilepsy, may be efficacious as a monotherapy across a broad range of seizure disorders. Methods: We retrospectively identified eighty-five patients (ages 8 months-98 years; mean 39 years; 51 male, 34 female) with various seizure disorders having been treated with levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy. While the criteria for inclusion consisted of any length of mono- treatment (mean 7.2 months), changes in seizure frequency and seizure freedom were evaluated in three month intervals up to one year. Patients began LEV as either first line therapy (n = 38) or were converted to LEV from other AEDs (n = 47). Medical records were reviewed for seizure type (primary generalized vs. partial), etiology (categorized as tumor (n = 19), trauma (n = 5), stroke (n = 11), idiopathic epilepsy (n = 33) and other (n = 17)), previous number of AEDs, and changes in seizure control or subsequent seizure freedom. Data was evaluated in relation to efficacy across gender, age, seizure etiology, and first-line vs. conversion therapy. Results: Of the patients immediately available for follow-up, thirty-nine remained on LEV for at least 6 months; twenty-five (64%) became seizure free. Of those continuing to experience refractory seizures, eight (57%) exhibited marked improvement in seizure control, five patients showed no change and one patient demonstrated worse seizure control. Expanding the patient population to at least 3 months on LEV (n = 57), thirty-eight (67%) were seizure free, and of the breakthrough patients, nine patients (47%) experienced improvement in seizure control while eleven showed no change or reduced control. The pediatric population (<18 years) was found to consist of twenty-six patients (ages 8 months-16 years; mean 6.1 years), of which fifteen were available for follow-up after 6 months on LEV. Eight patients (53%%) became seizure free while two showed >50% reduction in seizures and five (33%) showed no change in control. In comparison across age, this was less than the 63% seizure freedom noted in the age range of 18?65, and 88% in age 65 and older. In a 6 month evaluation across sexes, 87% of males achieved seizure freedom or marked improvement in control, compared to 81% females. We also observed dosing patterns (range: 20mg BID-1500mg BID, mode: 500mg BID) having direct proportionality to seizure frequency and severity, as well as age. It was noted that although a loading dose of 750mg is recommended, in only seven instances was a higher initial dose used when prescribed below the recommended loading level. Conclusions: Our results indicate that Levetiracetam as a monotherapy can provide an effective and tolerable treatment for a range of seizure disorders. A prospective, double blind study is necessary to confirm our finding.

However, the frequency with which patients are susceptible to drug-drug interactions in clinical practice is not known. This study compared the frequency of potential clinically relevant drug interactions for newer and older AEDs. Methods: In this retrospective, observational study, administrative claims obtained from a state Medicaid program were screened to identify records meeting the following criteria: 1) an AED prescription claim during the enrollment period (September 1, 2003 ? September 30, 2004), defined as the index prescription, for either a newer or older agent; 2) an International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code for epilepsy; 3) continuous enrollment 12 months after the index prescription. The potential for drug-drug interactions was quantified by the percentage of episodes, regardless of their duration, in which AED exposure coincided with exposure to another non-AED known to have a clinically relevant interaction with the AED. [1] [1] Perucca E. Clinically relevant drug interactions with antiepileptic drugs. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2005;61(3):246?255. Results: A total of 756 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average patient age was 34 (SD ± 22) years; 53% (n = 400) were female. In this patient population, there were 1,444 exposures to AEDs; 34.9% (n = 504) were exposures to new AEDs, and 65.1% (n = 940) were exposures to old AEDs. Of the new AED exposures, 2.6% (n = 13) coincided with another medication known to have a clinically relevant drug interaction as compared with 55.8% (n = 525) of old AED exposures. [1] Perucca E. Clinically relevant drug interactions with antiepileptic drugs. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2005;61(3):246?255. Conclusions: This study is the first to document the extent of co-exposure of AEDs with other drugs known to cause drug interaction. Older AEDs are associated with a greater likelihood of a potential clinically relevant drug interaction than a newer AED in this state Medicaid population. Future research documenting the clinical outcomes of these interactions and analysis adjusting for exposure time of each AED is warranted.

Collins ( 1 International Center for Epilepsy, University of Miami, Miami, FL ; 2 Department of Ophthalmology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ; and 3 Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL ) Rationale: Multiple reports have estimated the incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and functional outcomes associated with the vigabatrin-induced visual field defect (VFD). These studies have yielded a range of prevalence estimates. A recent large study of adults and children with complex partial seizures now helps better define incidence and prevalence and a better understanding of the functional impact of retinal injury. Methods: An open-label, multicenter, longitudinal study with blinded perimetric evaluations. Patients were stratified by age and by exposure to vigabatrin (Group 1: currently treated with vigabatrin at study inclusion; Group 2: previously treated with vigabatrin; Group 3: never treated with vigabatrin, but could initiate vigabatrin if visual fields were normal at baseline. Primary outcome was prevalence of bilateral concentric peripheral constriction (BCPC) via perimetry assessment (at least one static and one kinetic). Prevalence was defined as occurrence of BCPC at study inclusion and on first conclusive perimetry examination. Incidence of BCPC was defined as occurrence of BCPC after first dose of vigabatrin and observed on or after study enrollment. Results: At time of submission, a closed database was available on 432 of 563 patients enrolled. Study completion summer of 2006. Patients in Group 1 (48 children; 150 adults) had received vigabatrin for an average of 4 years. Group 2 patients (55 children; 158 adults) received vigabatrin for an average of 1.8 years (children) and 2.5 years (adults) prior to vigabatrin discontinuation. Prevalence rates of BCPC ranged from 6% to 10% in children and from 20% and 30% in adults. Incidence of BCPC was 31% and 44% of children and adults in Group 1, respectively, and 10% and 26% in Group 2. No patients in Group 3 developed BCPC, however only 7 patients received vigabatrin in this group. One subject in Group 3 had definitive findings of BCPC prior to vigabatrin administration. The earliest finding of a VGB-VFD was at 11 months. In general, onset was after 2 years of exposure, with the mean times in this study from first vigabatrin dose to BCPC amongst the six cohorts was from 5 to 7 years (at least one BCPC) and 5.5 to 8.5 years (confirmed BCPC). Blinded scoring of fields in subjects with BCPC showed lateral vision averaged 65 degrees and there was little change on average over approximately 2 years from first to last field examination. Conclusions: The VFD associated with vigabatrin therapy for CPS requires many months to years of treatment to appear, is not progressive, is usually asymptomatic, and can be effectively monitored. Because the onset of efficacy in clinical studies is usually within 12 weeks of initiation, and the earliest onset of the VFD was at 11 months, clinicians have the opportunity to assess efficacy before any substantial risk of field defect exists.

Paradis ( 1 Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ; 2 Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA ; and 3 Groupe D?Analyse, Ltée, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Compulsory generic substitution may lead to adverse effects in epilepsy patients because of the consequences linked with a single seizure recurrence. This concern is magnified by the widespread use of narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs for epilepsy. The objectives of the study are (1) quantify the switch-back rates from generic to brand-name AEDs compared to other drugs, and (2) assess the clinical impact of switching from branded Lamictal? (BL) to generic lamotrigine (GL). Methods: We used a public payer database from Ontario, Canada, comprising pharmacy claims from 01/2002 to 03/2006. The Ontario Drug Benefit formulary adopted compulsory conversion to GL in 01/2003, and a steep hurdle was imposed that prevented patients from switching back to BL without documented medical necessity from their doctor. We first calculated the switch-back rates from generic to brand AEDs (Lamictal?, Frisium?, Depakene?) using a Kaplan-Meier approach, compared to other chronically used drugs (Zocor?, Prozac?). Secondly, two cohorts of lamotrigine patients were compared with respect to their clinical outcomes: (1) those switching back to BL after being converted to GL (switch-back group), and (2) those staying on GL after generic entry (generic group). A stratified analysis was conducted on BL patients receiving monotherapy vs polytherapy of AED. The clinical endpoints were proxy for seizure control and tolerability, and included dosages of BL, of GL and number of concomitant AEDs and non-AED use before and after generic entry. Results: 1452 BL patients (437 monotherapy, 1015 polytherapy) were converted to GL, of which 12.9% switched back to BL (11.7% monotherapy, 13.4% polytherapy). Switch-back rates of other AEDs were about 20% for Frisium? and Depakene?, both of which were significantly higher than Zocor? (1.5%) or Prozac? (2.9%). In the switch-back group, the average BL daily dose increased from 229.5 mg at baseline to 279.9 mg GL (p = 0.039) after the generic entry. In the generic group, a similar dose increase was observed from baseline to generic periods (BL 242.8 mg/day versus GL 266.1 mg/day, p < 0.0001). The average number of drug entities dispensed increased for non-AED co-dispensings after generic entry compared to baseline (switch-back group: +12.2%, p = 0.004; generic group: +7.4%, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Switch-back rates were considerably and significantly higher for Lamictal? and other AEDs than for other chronic disease drugs. Higher generic doses and utilization of other drugs were also found. The extent of switchback differences compared with non AEDs raises concerns. This may be due to loss of seizure control or refusal of epilepsy patients to substitute, despite high cost penalties. Studies to investigate the clinical reasons or resistance to generic switching are required. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline, RTP, NC, USA.) 1 Charles M. Epstein, 1 Lhys Girard-Siqueira, and 1 Joshua A. Ehrenberg ( 1 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Several commonly-used anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam (LEV), are known to have a half-life in the human bloodstream which is shorter than their typical dosing interval. Their sustained efficacy without intermittent toxicity is not fully understood. Pharmacodynamic changes in the brain are generally suspected to persist longer than blood levels, but the time course of neurological effects has never been measured comprehensively in humans. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to compare LEV blood levels, pharmacodynamic effects, and subjective estimates of toxicity. Methods: Subjects were normal, medication-free volunteers aged 19?52 who had no history of any renal or CNS disorder, including epileptic seizures in themselves or first-degree relatives. Following an oral load of LEV 3 gm, blood levels and sequential TMS measures were taken over 48 hours. Subjects used a two-dimensional visual-analog scale to estimate the time course of any side effects they observed. Measures of motor threshold (MT) and recruitment at 150% MT were made from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle while stimulating at a fixed point over the left motor cortex. Results: LEV blood levels peaked between 1 and 2 hours after oral administration. MT was maximally elevated beyond 3 hours, and recruitment maximally reduced beyond 5 hours. Changes in recruitment appeared to persist past 24 hours. Subjective toxicity was greatest within an hour of LEV administration, close to the time of peak blood levels. Despite the time lag between toxicity and TMS changes, toxicity estimates correlated significantly with the maximum increase in MT (p < .05, Spearman). Conclusions: There appears to be a substantial time lag between LEV blood levels and TMS measures of neuronal effects, and a similar temporal dissociation between subjective toxicity and maximum neurophysiological change. The time course of TMS changes may help to explain sustained clinical efficacy despite a short peripheral half-life. [figure 1] (Supported by UCB Pharma.) 1 Sara Eyal, 2 John G.

Additionally, we determined the effect of multi-day VPA administration on the anticonvulsant activity of the P-gp substrate phenytoin (PHT) and on its serum and brain concentrations. Methods: Mdr1a, mdr1b and mdr2 were determined by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction in rats treated for 2 or 7days with 1mmol/kg VPA, valpromide (VPD) or vehicle. The in vitro effect of VPA on P-gp was analyzed by flow cytometry. PHT anticonvulsant activity was determined in the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test; results were compared to those obtained in a non-induced, vehicle-treated control group. PHT concentrations were assessed by high-performance-liquid-chromatography. Results: Treatment of rats for 2 or 7 days with VPA increased liver expression of mdr1a (2.2- and 4.1-fold, respectively), and mdr2 (2.8- and 3.5-fold, respectively), but not mdr1b. VPA did not significantly alter the expression of either mdr isoform in rat hippocampus or cortex. Similarly, administration of VPD to rats did not increase P-gp mRNA expression in rat liver or brain. The effect of a series of VPA derivatives on P-gp expression in SW620, KG1a and MDCK cells correlated with their potency as HDAC inhibitors. Treatment with either VPA or VPD did not alter PHT serum or brain concentrations or compromise its anticonvulsant efficacy against tonic-extension seizures in the MES Test. Conclusions: VPA induces the expression of P-gp mRNA in rat livers. However, P-gp induction by VPA is not sufficient, under the treatment conditions employed, to alter the plasma or brain concentrations and anticonvulsant activity of the P-gp substrate PHT. Based on the results obtained in the present study, it is not likely that chronic treatment with VPA or VPD will modify the anticonvulsant efficacy of PHT by increasing PgP expression.

Bialer and NINDS Contract NO1-NS-4?2359 (HS White).) 1 Agnes Kowalska, 1 Barbara Fuentes, and 1 Mary Andriola ( 1 Neurology, University Hospital at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY ) Rationale: There are approximately over 1 million women of childbearing age in America with epilepsy. More sophisticated diagnostic techniques, effective medications, and improved training of neurologists in epilepsy care have given patients with epilepsy better opportunity for full life and improved seizure control than ever before. There used to be misperception that women with epilepsy should not marry or at least not have children. Most women with epilepsy can and actually do have healthy, normal children. Methods: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 10 pregnant females, with history of epilepsy, who were continued on their antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Results: 2 patients were on Trileptal, 3 were on Phenobarbital, 3 were on Topomax, 1 patient was on combination of Lamictal and Tegretol, and 1 patient on combination of Trileptal and Topomax. Three out of ten females had an increase in their AED dosages, in the second trimester, secondary to increase in seizure frequency. One patient had a decrease in the dosage of her AED, and 6 patients had no change in their medication dosages. 5 out of 10 had no reported seizures during the nine months of their pregnancy. All patients had full term, normal vaginal deliveries. 1 out of 10 infants were discharged from the hospital within 48 hours without any complications. 1 infant was admitted to NICU secondary to chorioamnionitis. Conclusions: This limited review showed that there were no physical abnormalities in infants of mothers with epilepsy, on combination or single Antiepileptic Drugs. 1 Karen L. Gilbert, 1 Jenna L. Hott, 1 Barbara C. Jobst, 1 David W. Roberts, and 1 Vijay M. Thadani ( 1 Section of Neurology- Epilepsy Program, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: The precise mechanism of action of levetiracetam (LEV) is unknown; however the mechanism of action distinguishes LEV from most other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Anecdotal information suggests that LEV may be an especially useful adjunctive therapy in patients with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). This study examines the synergistic effects between LEV and VNS, by comparing seizure outcomes in patients with VNS on LEV against groups of patients with VNS on other medications. Methods: This was a retrospective review of outcome after VNS implantation using Engel's classification of seizure outcome following surgery. 132 patients were followed for at least one year following VNS implantation and data pertaining to age, gender, seizure type, AED use and seizure outcome were maintained in a database. Patients had VNS implanted for at least one year. Outcomes of 127 patients, both pediatric and adult patients with partial or generalized seizures were included. The following groups were assessed: patients on LEV and other drugs with VNS; patients on lamotrigine (LTG) and other drugs with VNS; patients on LEV and LTG with VNS; all other patients on other combinations of AEDs with VNS. Results: Out of 127 patients, 17 patients were on LEV and other drugs, 42 patients on LTG and other drugs, 11 patients on a combination of LEV and LTG, and 57 patients were on other combinations of AEDs. Outcomes in terms of Engel's classification were assessed. No group had a statistically significant better outcome (patients in Engel Class I, II, and III, vs. class IV) as compared to the other groups (p = 0.86). When patients on LEV were compared to all other groups (Engel Class I, II and III vs. class IV) there was no significant difference (p = 0.30). When LEV was added on after VNS implantation, it was no more beneficial than the addition of other drugs (p = 0.10). Conclusions: No statistically significant differences in seizure control were found when we compared LEV with other drugs in combination with VNS. Outcomes were about the same for all drug and VNS combinations. Further analysis using other outcome measures will be necessary to demonstrate difference between drugs. The possibility of a Type II error secondary to small numbers of patients in each group is recognized. 1 Varun Goel, 1 James C. Cloyd, 2 Edward E. Patterson, 1 James E. Fisher, 2 Aaron W. Dunn, and 1 Ilo E. Leppik ( 1 Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; and 2 Veterinary Clinical Sciences, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug used for treatment of partial seizures in humans. LEV is available as oral tablets and syrup and an intravenous (IV) formulation (100 mg/mL) is under review at the FDA. The purpose of this pilot study was to obtain data regarding the pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of intramuscular (IM) LEV in dogs to lay the foundation for human studies. Methods: The experiments were done on 6 Hound dogs weighing approximately 22 kg. All dogs received 500 mg (5 mL of IV formulation of LEV) intramuscularly. Three dogs received 500 mg of IV LEV and 3 dogs received 250mg of IV LEV after which the IV catheter was withdrawn and an additional 250 mg was instilled around the vein as an approximation of extravasation. This procedure was done to evaluate the change in pharmacokinetics due to extravasation during IV dosing. A wash out period was allowed between intramuscular and intravenous dosing. Samples were collected starting at 15 min through 24 h at predetermined time intervals. Plasma LEV was detected by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis. Results: LEV was completely absorbed after intramuscular administration with a bioavailability of 100%. The median time to achieve maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after IM dosing was 30 min, and the observed Cmax was 6.13 ± 0.51 ?g/mL. After IV injection, LEV showed evidence of mono-exponential elimination with a half-life of 174 ± 19 min, a volume of distribution of 2.7 L/kg and a clearance of 258 ± 41 mL/min. Extravasation did not alter LEV pharmacokinetics following IV administration. Conclusions: LEV demonstrated rapid absorption and complete bioavailability in dogs after intramuscular administration. Extravastation around the IV site did not appear to alter LEV pharmacokinetics. These characteristics, in combination with evidence of safety and tolerability, suggest that LEV should be evaluated for Intramuscular administration in humans. (Supported by UCB Pharma.) 1 Marcia L. Buck, 2 Matthew J. Gurka, and 3 Howard P. Goodkin ( 1 Pharmacy and Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; and 3 Neurology and Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: With the current trend toward accelerated approval of drugs in the US, postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions has become an essential tool in establishing the safety profile of new drugs. Between 1993 to 2000, eight new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While premarketing clinical trials suggested a relatively mild adverse effect profile for most of these new drugs, limited information was available at the time of their approval to accurately define their risks. To examine the significance of postmarketing adverse reaction reporting for the new AEDs, we reviewed safety labeling modifications made since their release. Methods: Safety labeling modifications made for the new AEDs from 1993 through December 2005 were identified using prescribing information and a search of the FDA MedWatch database. Results: All the drugs underwent safety labeling changes during this period. In total, there were 38 safety labeling modifications with the median time to the first change being 2 years after introduction (range: 13 months to 12 years). The most common modification in safety labeling (n = 14) involved the adverse reaction section of the prescribing information. Three of the 38 changes involved the addition of a black box warning (2 for felbamate and 1 for lamotrigine). All occurred within 3 years after the introduction to the market place. The remaining labeling modifications consisted of changes in the warnings (n = 10), precautions (n = 10), and clinical pharmacology (n = 1) sections. Although the majority of labeling modifications came within the first 6 years after approval, mean cumulative function (MCF) analysis revealed no identifiable point at which additional changes were unlikely to be made. Conclusions: Over the past 13 years, a significant number of modifications have been made in the safety labeling of the new AEDs, ranging from black box warnings to the addition of new data in the adverse reactions tables. Recurrent data analysis failed to reveal a point at which additional safety information appeared unlikely, suggesting that the adverse effect profiles of the new AEDs may not yet be complete. (Supported by NIH.) 1,2 Keiko Hara, and 1 Minoru Hara ( 1 Neuropsychiatry, Hara Clinic, Yokohama, Japan ; and 2 Neuropsychiatry, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Musashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan ) Rationale: It is still controversial how to reduce or discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without a risk of relapses in patients who have no seizure for years. We present the long-term prognosis of epilepsy patients who have had relapses while dose reduction of AEDs and evaluate their subsequent long-term outcome. Methods: 18 patients (10 males, 8 females) who had relapse while they had AED dose reduction were collected. We followed them for 12 ? 27 years (mean; 18 years) after relapses. Their age ranged between 26 and 59-year-old (mean; 47-year-old), seizure onsets ranged between 10 months and 20 years. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy was diagnosed in 5 patients, symptomatic generalized epilepsy in 1 patient, and localization-related epilepsy in 12 patients. No patient had surgical treatment. Their seizure free period ranged between 21 months and 9 years prior to dose reduction (mean; 5.1 years). We compared the number and dose of AEDs before dose reduction and at present, also examined the clinical course during the follow-up period. Results: The duration between change in AEDs dose and the relapse was < /= 2 month in 7 patients, 3 ? 12 months in 4 patients, 13 ? 24 months in 5 patients, and 48 months < in 2 patients. The last two patients relapsed after they delivered, and they had fatigues, sleep deprivations, and change in life styles. On follow up, patients were taking 1?3 types of AEDs (mean 1.33) compare to 1?4 types of AEDs (mean 2.16) prior to dose reduction. 13 (72.2%) of 18 patients were still reduced AEDs compared to what they had taken prior to dose reduction. Three patients had same AEDs. Two patients were taking greater doses of AEDs. In all patients, AEDs were increased after relapses. After that, 10 (56%) of 18 patients had no subsequent seizures. 5 (28%) of 18 patients had1?3 seizures after relapses, but were seizure free for more than 9 years since then. Of the last three patients, two patients had yearly partial seizures. They reduced their medication from 2?3 kinds of AEDs to one AED, and we did not further change AED because of their requests. The remaining one patient had two seizures in 16 years due to non-compliance. Conclusions: The results suggest the AEDs necessary to prevent relapses can alter during long-term follow up in some patients. Lower dose of AEDs become adequate to control seizures compared to the earlier regimen. Thus, AEDs dose reduction should be considered for patients who have no seizure for years. However, the final decision should be decided based on the their clinical and social-cultural profile. Our data also suggest that reduction of AEDs has a potential of relapses for the patients with no seizure for long period, however the seizure outcomes and dosage of AEDs were still favorable for long term follow-up, dose reduction did not make their prognosis worse. Further investigations in a larger population and using EEG could be valuable for clinical practice. 1 Dmytro Isaev, 1 Olena Isaeva, 2 Rustem Khazipov, and 1 Gregory L. Holmes ( 1 Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ; and 2 INMED, INSERM-U29, Marseille, France ) Rationale: Neuronal surface charge is a key factor determining neuronal excitability. Reduction of the negative surface charge by increasing the level of divalent cations or proton strongly shifts the activation thresholds towards more positive values. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating neuronal surface charge and associated excitability remain largely unknown. Here we studied effect of desialylation on high K/low Mg model of epilepsy. Methods: Patch-clamp recordings of voltage-gated sodium currents were made from hippocampal slices at P3?4 rats (n = 7). Extracellular recordings of the effect of neuraminidase (NA) treatment on the probability of evoking seizures were made from CA3 pyramidal cell layer in slices from P8?21 rats using metal electrodes of 50 ?m diameter. For in vivo experiments the application cannula with recording electrode was positioned into the CA3 pyramidal cell. 30?l of NA-contained ACSF or NA blocker-contained ASCF were applied to the CA3 rat hippocampus, and the animal remained under anesthesia for 2 hours. Application of 10mM [K+]o/low [Mg2+]o (high K) ACSF was made by repetitive injection of 5 ?l-volumes. Results: After two hours of slice incubation with NA peak of current-voltage relationship of INa recorded from CA3 neurons shifted toward positive potential (?9mV). Application of high K+ ACSF induced bursting discharges and then recurrent tonic-like activity in 87% and 38% and clonic-like activity in 100% and 77% of control and NA-treated slices, respectively. Subsequently, we tested the effect of NA on the probability of evoking seizures in vivo in rats (postnatal days 8?21). 30 ?l NA was applied in to the CA3 region of rat hippocampus. After two hours of incubation with NA, repetitive injection of the high K+ ACSF into hippocampal CA3 pyramidal layer were applied. In the control group, high K+ inevitably induced ictal-like discharges in all animals tested (n = 10); only two of eight rats treated with NA displayed ictal-like activity. Seizures in NA-treated rats were significantly shorter than in the control group. After incubation with a NA blocker in vivo, high K+ ACSF was applied to the same region of the hippocampus. In contrast with a control group of rats where seizures were triggered on the 4th-6th application, seizures in NA blocker treated rats appeared on the 1st-30 ml rd application, and were significantly longer. Conclusions: Our results suggest that NA-mediated control of the level of sialic acids at the neuronal surface serves as a physiological mechanism to control the surface charge and neuronal and network excitability.

Past attempts at preventing epilepsy by treatment with older antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been unsuccessful. Levetiracetam is a new generation AED with a favorable side-effect and pharmacokinetic profile that has potent anti-epileptogenic effects in animal models of epilepsy. It may thus be useful in preventing the development of epilepsy following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there has been no experience in administering levetiracetam rapidly to individuals with acute TBI. In this pilot study, we are evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and feasibility of acute and chronic administration of levetiracetam to individuals with head injury with a high risk for developing post-traumatic epilepsy. Here, we report preliminary findings of tolerability. Methods: Male and female subjects aged 6 years and older are enrolled in a fixed dose, open label study with a sample size goal of 60. All have head injury with a high risk for developing post-traumatic epilepsy (injury with intracranial hemorrhage, penetrating wound injury, depressed skull fracture or early post-traumatic seizure). Subjects receive levetiracetam 55 mg/kg/day by mouth or via orogastric tube if unable to swallow. Treatment starts within 8 hours of head injury at full dose and continues for 30 days, with one additional month of post-treatment follow up. In addition, individuals receive phenytoin for one week following head injury as standard clinical care. Results: 30 subjects (24 adult, 6 children) have been enrolled to-date. 18/30 (60%) subjects (14/24 adult, 4/6 pediatric) have completed the 30 day treatment phase of the study. 3 subjects (1 adult, 2 pediatric) are currently in active treatment follow up. 3 subjects (all adults) have died, all of medication unrelated causes. There have been no medication-related serious adverse events. 6 subjects (all adults) have discontinued treatment early: 2 because of medication- related toxicity (somnolence, n = 1; and combined fatigue, somnolence, irritability, emotional lability, headaches, n = 1) and 4 for medication-unrelated reasons. Thus, excluding death and subjects still in active follow up, 18/24 (75%) subjects completed treatment as expected. Only 2/24 (8%) of subjects discontinued medication because of poor tolerability. An update of this data and of interim compliance and adverse event data will be presented. Conclusions: Acute and chronic treatment with high dose (55 mg/kg/day) levetiracetam has been well tolerated in 18 subjects with acute head injury with high risk for developing post-traumatic epilepsy.

Steinhoff, 3 Martha Feucht, 4 Margarethe Pfäfflin, and 4 Theodor May ( 1 Medical Director, Swiss Epilepsy Center, Zürich, Switzerland ; 2 Klinik Für Erwachsene, Epilepsiezentrum Kork, Germany ; 3 Klinik Für Neuropychiatrie Des Kindes-Und Jugendalters, Universitätsklinikum, Wien, Austria ; and 4 Biochemisches Labor, Gesellschaft Für Epilepsieforschung E.V., Bielefeld, Germany ) Rationale: The economic benefit of generic drugs in several health problems has to be questioned in chronic diseases with the need for a stable medication. In people with successfully treated epilepsy even a single seizure recurrence may have devastating consequences. We addressed the experience of physicians in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with generic preparations of antiepileptic drugs (G-AEDs). Methods: Two internet-based questionnaire studies among members of the German, Austrian, and Swiss sections of the ILAE as well as members of the German Society for Neurology were performed. In the first study about 2.800 E-mails were sent together with an accompanying letter on December 1, 2005. Some of the 14 questions had already been used for a corresponding survey in the US (Wilner AN. Therapeutic equivalency of generic antiepileptic drugs: results of a survey. Epilepsy Behav 2004;5:995?998). We offered a link to a specially designed website for an easy online response. In the second study another web-based questionnaire asking for more details will be sent especially to those responders of the first study who had reported problems with G-AEDs in June 2006. Results: We received 602 responses to the first questionnaire. About 80% of the physicians had experiences with G-AEDs. About half of them reported problems such as ? in decreasing order ? additional telephone contacts or visits, hospital admissions, calls for emergency doctors or visits of emergency rooms, disturbances of the physician-patient relationship, sick certificates, or injuries. In about half of the physicians these experiences had led to changes in their prescription behavior, especially restrictions for substitution. In addition, increased patient counseling and blood level determinations of AEDs were mentioned. The current criteria for approval of G-AEDs were considered as inappropriate by about 50%, and 90% considered it unacceptable that pharmacists have the possibility of substitution without consultation. The results of the second questionnaire will be available at the end of July. Conclusions: In line with the results of earlier reports from the US, Canada or other countries our studies underline the potential problems with the use of G-AEDs and justify recommendations to avoid switching different preparations (form branded preparations to generics as well as between generics or from generics to branded preparations) in successfully treated patients. 1 Robert F. Kwarta Jr., 2 Joseph F. Hulihan, 1 Juergen Schmider, and 1 Jeffrey S. Nye ( 1 Pharmaceutical Research  and 2 Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, Raritan, NJ ) Rationale: The estimated risk of major structural malformations in infants born to women with epilepsy ranges from 2?25% but is generally reported as twice that of the general population (6?10% vs 2?5%). In utero exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) has been implicated as a factor in this increased risk. Independent pregnancy registries are collecting data on exposure to AEDs, including topiramate (TPM). We report on congenital abnormalities/malformations in newborns exposed in utero to TPM for pregnancies that were prospectively reported to J and 2 School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Epilepsy is common in the elderly, and previous studies have shown that upon admission 7.7% are receiving an antiepileptic drug (AED) and 3.3% have an AED added after admission1. This study was done to evaluate the patterns of AED use over a 3-year period in a large nursing home organization. Methods: Computerized records containing physician's daily medication dosing orders and diagnoses were available for a total of 113,047 unique admissions age 65+ years to Beverly Nursing Homes across the USA January 2000 through December 2002. AED information through the 3rd day of admission was analyzed to avoid errors of omission during the first 48 hours. Results: Overall, 6,200 persons (5.48% of all admissions) had an epilepsy/seizure (EPI/SZ) code. There were 73,853 female admissions of which 3,666 (4.96%) had an EPI/SZ code. There were fewer males admitted (39,193) but 6.47% had an EPI/SZ code (p < 0.0001). A racial disparity was also noted with Blacks, Hispanics and American Indian/Native Alaskans having a higher prevalence of EPI/SZ code than whites and Asians (p < 0.001). 28.5% with an EPI/SZ code were not receiving an AED. The ?old-old? with an EPI/SZ code (85 years+) had lower AED use than the ?young old? (65?74) (p < 0.005). Among those with an EPI/SZ code and some AED, use of phenytoin was 66.7%, valproate was 15.3%, Phenobarbital was 9.5%, carbamazepine was 9.7%, gabapentin was 10.3%, and all other new was 4.6% (total > 100% due to polytherapy). Conclusions: The prevalence of AED use at time of admission to a nursing home is much greater than the 1.5% prevalence in community dwelling elderly, suggesting that a marked increase in the incidence of epilepsy occurs prior to admission. There are significant gender and race differences, with males, Blacks, Hispanics and American Indian/Native Alaskan having higher rates of epilepsy. Phenytoin remains by far the most commonly prescribed AED in this population. However, how the assignment of a EPI/SZ code is made cannot be discerned from this database and the high rate of untreated is problematic. Studies conducted in nursing homes are needed to ascertain the appropriateness of the EPI/SZ coding. (Supported by NIH-NINDS P50 NS16308 1Garrard J, etal. Antiepileptic drug use in nursing home admissions. Annals of Neurology 2003:54:75?85.) 1 Ken G. Makus, and 1 John McCormick ( 1 Neurology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; and McKesson Phase 4 Solutions, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Switching patients from older branded antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to generic versions can increase the risk of breakthrough seizures and side-effects.1 Less is known about the consequences of substituting newer AEDs for generic compounds.1 Given the unique challenges in epilepsy treatment and the common concomitant use of narrow therapeutic index epilepsy medications generic substitution for brand-name AEDs may sacrifice efficacy, tolerability, and safety.2 Though generic drugs are considered bioequivalent to brand names, clinically relevant differences in drug absorption and availability can occur and produce loss of seizure control or toxicity.2 In the current investigation, outcomes associated with substituting one of the first newer AED to become generically available in Canada were assessed for signals warranting further investigation. Methods: The impact of generic lamotrigine in epilepsy patients was assessed using reports of lamotrigine-linked adverse reactions filed to Health Canada's Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program (CADRMP), a survey of pharmacists, and a physician chart audit. It was hypothesized that utilization of generic lamotrigine may be associated with a change in lamotrigine-associated adverse reactions. To test this, lamotrigine-related adverse reactions reported to the CADRMP over identical periods before (baseline period) and after (study period) generic lamotrigine became available were compared. Results: Reports of lamotrigine-associated adverse reactions to CADRMP rose from 30 during the baseline period to 56 in the study period. Over the latter period 29 of the 56 reports (52%) were linked to generic lamotrigine (versus 23% over the baseline period), 14 of which involved lack of seizure control. Loss of seizure control was the primary reason patients were switched back to Lamictal? in the pharmacists' survey (11/14 patients) and the physicians chart audit (8/9 patients). Seizure control was regained for the majority of patients following a return to branded lamotrigine. Conclusions: These initial reports of loss of seizure control in some patients following brand-to-generic Lamotrigine switching, build upon existing similar experiences with older AEDs. The results of this study suggest that (i) seizure control can be compromised when switching from Lamictal? to generic lamotrigine, and (ii) lamotrigine-associated adverse reactions increased after generic lamotrigine was prescribed. These data stress the vital role physicians play in educating their patients as to the potential risks and benefits of AED generic substitution. Reference 1.?Crawford P, Hall WW, Chappell B, et al.

(Supported by a grant from GlaxoSmithKline Inc.) 1 Cordula Mauerer, 1 Jan Ricken, 1 Angelika Huettenbrenner, and 1 Soheyl Noachtar ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany ) Rationale: This prospective study compared the effects of the new antiepileptic drug (AED) pregabalin (PRE) with the established AED carbamazepine (CBZ) on eye movement and posture control in twelve healthy volunteers who received single doses of 75 mg PRE and 400 mg slow release CBZ in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial. Methods: The drug effects on electrooculography and postural sway were evaluated for averaged plasma levels, for individual highest to lowest plasma levels and for individual highest to lowest effect. Results: CBZ and PRE both affected eye movements significantly. The strongest impact was seen on saccadic eye movements, with CBZ slowing the peak horizontal saccade by a maximum of 35.6% (PRE 28.5%). The peak vertical saccade was slowed by CBZ (17.6%) and PRE (27.3%). There was no statistically significant difference of the maximum effect between the two substances. CBZ and PRE both also affected body sway. Significant impairment was mostly seen in difficult conditions (reclined head, eyes closed on foam plate showed a 24% increase in body sway for CBZ, 24.7% increase for PRE). Only in selected conditions could a statistically significant difference be seen between the two AEDs. Conclusions: In summary, PRE and CBZ impair eye movement and posture control ? as measured by objective electrophysiological methods ? similarly. 1 Vladimir Nekrassov, and 1 Maria Sitges ( 1 Basic and Applied Research Division, National Rehabilitation Institute, SSA, Mexico; and Department of Cellular Biology and Physiology, Biomedical Research Institute, UNAM, Mexico ) Rationale: Several studies carried out in epileptic patients treated with common AEDs suggest that the drugs could cause BAEPs alterations. Although, only in a couple of case report studies hearing deficits have been directly linked to the antiepileptic medication. BAEPs are far field-evoked potentials that consist of several waves that occur within 10 ms post-stimulus. Determination of BAEPs threshold is an objective measure of the hearing sensitivity. In the guinea pig, changes in the amplitude or the latency of P1, the first wave of BAEPs, reflects cochlear nerve alterations, whereas changes in the parameters of P3 and P4, express alterations in the activity of the medial and the lateral superior olivary nuclei of the brainstem, respectively. Previously we have shown that the BAEPs alterations and the hearing decline induced by amikacin and by the convulsing agents, pentylenetetrazole and 4-aminopyridine in the guinea pig in vivo are prevented by VPC (ethyl apovincamine-22-oate), a nootropic drug with anticonvulsant capabilities. Since the few studies directed to investigate the effects of CBZ, PHT and VPA on BAEP parameters in animals, have only tested their acute effects at extremely high doses, their chronic effects at relevant doses on BAEP parameters and threshold were investigated here in the guinea pig in vivo, and compared with the effects of VPC in parallel. Methods: The latency and amplitude of each BAEP wave elicited by a stimulus of high intensity (100 dB) and the auditory thresholds at two tone frequencies (8 and 4 kHz) before the start of treatment (control recordings), 2 hours after the start of treatment (i.e. first injection of 20 mg/kg CBZ, 6 mg/kg PHT, 30 mg/kg VPA or 2 mg/kg VPC), and 28 days after a daily injection of the above drugs at the indicated doses, were measured following the methods described previously (Epilepsy Res. 2004; 60: 63?71; Clin. Neurophysiol. 2004; 115: 2711?17). Results: P1 and P2 parameters are unchanged by the drugs tested either after the start of treatment or following 28 days of injection. Also, P3 and P4 are unchanged after the start of treatment. However, marked changes are observed after the long term (28 days) treatments; CBZ and PHT increase and VPC reduces P3 and P4 latencies, PHT reduces P3 amplitude, and CBZ and PHT reduce P4 amplitude. Following the 28 days of CBZ, PHT or VPA injection the BAEP thresholds increase, whereas they decrease following the 28 days of VPC injection. Conclusions: The long term treatment with the most commonly used AEDs at therapeutic relevant doses could reduce the hearing sensitivity through physiological changes in specific nuclei of the superior olivary complex. The long term treatment with VPC, in contrast, ameliorates audition.

Bhachawat ( 1 Department of Neurology, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY ) Rationale: Levetiracetam is an anti-convulsant approved in 1999 for use as an adjunctive therapy for patients with partial onset seizures in adults. There is significant use of it in patients with generalized epilepsy. The objective of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy to normalize an EEG in patients who have had a significant decrease in seizure frequency. Methods: A list of patients, who have been on levetiracetam, was generated from past dictations, yielding 105 patients. The dictations of these patients were reviewed to determine the patients diagnosed with primary generalized epilepsy. There were twenty seven patients (n = 27) with ages in the range of 3 years to 55 years that met the criteria. An extensive chart review was conducted to determine whether patient had clinical seizure control and the effect of levetiracetam on the patients EEG. The seizure resolution was tabulated and charted to compare with normalizing of EEG. Results: Of the 27 patients, 11 had resolution (41%) in clinical seizures, 8 had significant reduction (30%) in seizure frequency, 6 patients who failed (22%), and 2 patients were not able to tolerate (7%) the medicine. Of the 11 patients who had resultion, 7 had normalization (64%) of EEG and 2 had an unchanged (18%) EEG. There were 2 other patients with a pending EEG. Conclusions: Levetiracetam is effective as an adjunct therapy in patients with intractable primary generalized epilepsy. It not only improves seizures control, but in those patients with resolution of clinical seizures, there is normalization of EEG in a significant number of patients.?[figure 1] 1 Jacqueline French, 2 Grossman Patricia, 3 Barry Gidal, 4 Gwenael Le Teuff, and 5 Celine Bugli ( 1 School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Global Outcomes Research, UCB, Atlanta, GA ; 3 School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ; 4 Keyrus Biopharma, Levallois-Perret, France ; and 5 LACO, Diegem, Belgium ) Rationale: Over 2 million serious adverse drug reactions occur annually leading to 100,000 deaths in the United States. The objective of this study was to present the results of the investigation conducted in epileptic patients initiating either an enzyme-inducing AED (EIAED) or a non enzyme-inducing AED (NEIAED) and their risk of exposure to medications that may incur a potentially adverse PK interaction within a chronologically diverse group of epileptic patients. Specifically, this analysis sought to determine in a group of patients receiving only AED treatment, the risk that a concomitant, potentially interacting drug will be added to a patient medication regimen. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in epilepsy patients using a US claims Database (1/2001?12/2004). Patients were sub-grouped: EIAEDs (n = 9296) or NEIAEDs (n = 6573). A non-AED concomitant medication is defined as a concomitant medication if there exists an overlap with AED treatment of at least 5 days for antibiotics and antifungals and at least 30 days for other classes of drugs. Risk of first addition of a comedication was assessed using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted to clinical and demographic characteristics including gender, state of the patient during the 6 months prior to AED initiation (based on Charlson comorbidity index, a measure of seriousness of comorbid diseases, Charlson et al., 1987), the type of AED treatment and the age group. Origin time is the date of the first prescription of AED. Results: 2873 patients are censored (18%).The mean time under AED is 395 days (SD = 371). The mean time to addition of first concomitant medication or to end of the follow-up for censored patient is 67 days (SD = 156). The hazard ratios for the time to first concomitant medication addition are presented in Table 1. Multivariable hazard ratio (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of first addition of concomitant medication Covariates HR [95% CI] Male (vs female) ??0.8 [0.772;0.828] 18?34 (vs 0?17) 1.112 [1.059;1.169] 35?54 (vs 0?17) 1.379 [1.317;1.443] 55?64 (vs 0?17) 1.636 [1.532;1.746] 65+ (vs 0?17) 1.749 [1.574;1.944] mild state (vs good) 1.434 [1.361;1.512] severe (vs good) 1.536 [1.450;1.629] NEIAED (vs EIAED) 1.126 [1.086;1.167] All p-values are < 0.001. Conclusions: The risk that a concomitant medication will be added at some time after AED is initiated is significantly higher for females, increases with age and the severity of the state of the patient. This implies that patients with certain characteristics should have their antiepileptic drugs selected to avoid the potential of future drug interactions. This might include avoiding enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs. (Supported by UCB INC.) 1 Edward E. Patterson, 2 Ilo E. Leppik, 3 Timothy D. O?Brien, 4 Varun Goel, and 2 James C.

However, an IM formulation was not considered during development. The purpose of this pilot study was to obtain data regarding the safety and tolerability of the IV formulation administered intramuscularly to dogs. Methods: Animal experimentation approval was obtained and six dogs weighing approximately 20 kg were purchased. The same IV solution, intended for clinical use, was obtained from UCB Pharma. It contains 100 mg/ml LEV in an aqueous solution with a neutral pH. A standard animal discomfort rating scale was used. Dogs were injected with 5ml (500 mg) of LEV in one longissimus muscle, and 5 ml of saline in the contralateral muscle. Two dogs received IM LEV and control saline on Monday, two on Wednesday and two on Friday. This provided up to five days for reaction to develop. All were sacrificed on Saturday and 4 blocks of tissue of approximately 2 cm3 were removed for standard histopathology. A standard four-point inflammation scale (0 = no inflammation, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 4 = marked) was used as well as examination for tissue damage. Results: Tolerability: Three of the six dogs injected with LEV had slight head turning or a slight squirm; only one had slight vocalization, and 3 had no reaction. Three saline of six controls had slight head turning. Safety: The mean inflammation score for LEV was 0.28, and 0.62 for saline. One of the saline injected dogs had a score of 3 (moderate). Four dogs in each group had no inflammation. Conclusions: The IV preparation of LEV is well tolerated and safe when given as an IM injection to dogs. This suggests that the formulation may be useful in humans, but studies of safety and tolerability will need to be done. (Supported by UCB Pharma.) 1 Patricia E. Penovich, 1 Deanna L. Dickens, 1 Jason S. Doescher, 1 Michael D. Frost, 1 El-Hadi Mouderres, and 1 Frank J. Ritter ( 1 Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Conventional use of AEDs in the treatment of epilepsy has utilized serum levels as an indicator of appropriate daily dosage. Pregabalin (PGB), a GABA analog which binds at the α2δ subunit of voltage gated calcium receptors, has a dose response correlation for seizure reduction in phase three human studies at the two doses studied. No serum level to dose correlation has been reported. We have evaluated the effect of daily and weight-based doses on serum levels in clinical use. Methods: Patients received PGB as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. Doses were empirically chosen and increased for efficacy or until side effects were experienced. Serum levels were obtained at trough if possible. Serum determinations were sent to MedTox Laboratories (St Paul, MN) for determination by HPLC. Serum levels, age, weight, daily dose, mg/kg/day dose, creatinine, efficacy and reported adverse events were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Results: Thirty-two patients ages 4?78 (mean 33.6 ± 17.6, median 31) received PGB for two days to over seven years. Weights were 27.5 ? 188.5 kg (mean 68.3 ± 30.1, median 67). Total daily doses were 25 ? 1050 mg (mean 349 ± 212, median 300) resulting in 0.35?10.9 mg/kg/day (mean 5.1 ± 3.1, median 4.7). Serum levels were 0.99 ? 13.4 ?g/ml (mean 4.2 ± 3.1, median 4.0). There was a significant correlation p < .01 for the relationship of mg/kg/day to serum concentration. AEs reported in 11 (33%) were tiredness, weight gain, and temporary leg swelling at levels of 1?7 ?g/ml. Improved seizure control was reported in 56%; 1 was worse. Efficacy was seen in 7/18 at 2 ?g/ml or less and in 11/18 at 4?10 ?g/ml. Seven patients had 2 or more levels at different doses and showed linear increase in serum level. Conclusions: PGB is easily utilized as adjunctive therapy in clinical practice. Doses are well tolerated up to 1050 mg/day without serious AEs. Serum levels correlate linearly with increased dosing. 1 Ronald C.

Since there is a significant risk of seizures for the mother during pregnancy, it may be necessary for the mother to continue taking AEDs throughout her pregnancy. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review to identify all published registries and cohort studies of ≥ 1000 births from pregnant epileptic women that reported an incidence of a major congenital malformation. Results: The review included 6 studies (k) that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 16,095 births to epileptic mothers. Three studies reported the incidence of births with CM, three studies reported the incidence of CM as total events, and 4 studies reported the incidence of specific major congenital malformations. The incidence of births with CM was 5.2% (k = 3), and the incidence of CM (as events) was 4.5% (k = 3). The incidence of spina bifida was 0.2% (k = 3), cardiovascular CMs was 0.9% (k = 2), cleft lip or palate was 0.3% (k = 2), urinary malformations was 0.5% (k = 3), and club foot was 0.7% (k = 1). There were three studies that separately reported monotherapy, polytherapy, and/or non-treated epileptic pregnancies. The incidence of births with CM in women treated with only 1 AED was 6.2% (k = 2), for polytherapy it was 10.2% (k = 2), and for no AED treatment it was 2.8% (k = 1). The incidence of CM events was 3.9% (k = 2) for monotherapy, 6.3% (k = 2) for polytherapy, and 3.2% (k = 2) for no AED treatment. Conclusions: The results of this systematic literature review suggest that the incidence of congenital malformations in the offspring of epileptic mothers is approximately 4% to 5%. The risk of congenital malformations increases from no AED treatment (approximately 3%) to treatment with a single AED (from 4% to 6%), and is highest when the mothers are treated with multiple AEDs (6% to 10%).

Ricken, 1 Peter Axtner, 1 Katharina Schüler, and 1 Soheyl Noachtar ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany ) Rationale: This prospective study compared the effects of the new antiepileptic drugs (AED) oxcarbazepine (OXC) and gabapentin (GBP) on eye movements and posture control in twelve healthy volunteers who received single doses of 900 mg GBP and 600 mg OXC in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial. Methods: The drug effects on electrooculography and postural sway were evaluated for averaged plasma levels, for individual highest to lowest plasma levels and for individual highest to lowest effect. Results: OXC and GBP both affected eye movements significantly. The strongest impact was seen on vertical eye movements, with GBP slowing the peak vertical saccade by a maximum of 20.4% and OXC by 29.7%. There was no significant difference of the maximum effect between the two substances. GBP affected body sway significantly in most conditions. The maximum impairment was seen in the difficult conditions (reclined head, eyes closed on foam plated showed 25.0% increase in body sway, tandem stance with closed eyes 67.0%). OXC increased body sway in only very few conditions (reclined head, eyes closed on foam plate showed a 6.0% increase, tandem stance with closed eyes 9.4%), and showed significantly less impairment as compared to GBP (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Although OXC and GBP both may cause dizziness, the effects on eye movements and body sway were different. OXC seems to have less CNS side effects as measured by postural control and similar effects as measured by electrooculography at comparable doses. (Supported by Novartis.) 1 Miranda K. Roth, and 2 Nicholas P. Poolos ( 1 Phyisol  and 2 Neurol and Physiol  Ih; HCN) have been hypothesized to play a role in epileptogenesis due to recent evidence that they are downregulated by seizures, are upregulated by several antiepileptic drugs, and produce epilepsy when genetically deleted in an animal model. Little is known about possible intracellular modulators of h-channel function apart from the well-described role of cAMP. Previously we found that inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downregulated Ih by causing a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation. We sought to characterize the role of p38 MAPK in the actions of a known upregulator of Ih, the anti-epileptic drug (AED) lamotrigine (LTG). Methods: We tested the effects of p38 MAPK activation using cell-attached and whole-cell recordings of Ih in pyramidal-like principal (PLP) neurons in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus in rat brain slices. PLPs contain a high somatic density of Ih with biophysical properties similar to Ih in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites. Drugs were applied through the pipette and for at least 45 min via bath application before recording. Results: Application of an activator of p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK), anisomycin (20 ?M), produced an ?11 mV depolarizing shift in Ih voltage-dependent activation (V1/2 in control =?89 ± 2.4 mV [mean ± SEM], n = 11; V1/2 in anisomycin =?78 ± 2.0 mV, n = 7, p < .001) while a specific inhibitor of JNK, SP600125 (10 ?M), caused no change in voltage-dependent activation (V1/2=?87 ± 3.6 mV, n = 4, p > .05). Thus, the effect of anisomycin is due to the activation of p38 MAPK. In whole cell experiments, pipette-applied activated p38α MAPK (5 ?g/ml) led to a decrease in input resistance (IR) 15 min after the start of recording (p38α=?36.7 ± 7.7%, n = 4; in control =?13.9 ± 3.7%, n = 6, p < .05). Perfusion of p38α MAPK decreased temporal summation (TS) elicited by a train of 20 Hz alpha-function current injections after 15 min pipette application (?23.6 ± 5.6%, n = 4; in control =?8.6 ± 3.1%, n = 6, p < .05). We then tested whether p38 MAPK is necessary for the action of LTG. A specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (SB, 10 ?M), produced an ?22mV hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation (V1/2 in SB =?111 ± 3.6 mV, n = 6, p < .0001). When SB was applied with LTG (100 ?M), the depolarizing effect of LTG was blocked by the hyperpolarizing effect of SB (V1/2 in LTG =?83.6 ± 1.6 mV, n = 5; V1/2 in SB/LTG =?104.2 ± 5.6 mV, n = 5, p < .05). Conclusions: These results show that p38 MAPK plays an important role in the regulation of Ih. Activation of p38 MAPK activity produced a significant upregulation of Ih in hippocampal PLPs which decreased the excitability of PLPs by diminishing IR and TS. These results also suggest that p38 MAPK is necessary for LTG action on Ih. The effects of p38 MAPK on Ih imply that the p38 MAPK pathway is a promising target for novel AEDs.

Eugene Ramsay, 3 Flavia Macias, and VA Cooperative Study #428 Study Group ( 1 Neurology, Bronx VA Medical Center and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY ; 2 Neurology, VA Medical Center and University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL ; 3 Neurology, VA Medical Center, Miami, FL ; and 4 Neurology, 18 VA Medical Centers Across the USA ) Rationale: VA Cooperative Study (VACS) #428 reported on treatment of 593 older individuals (average age 72, range 59?91) with newly diagnosed seizures who were assigned to one of three treatment groups: carbamazepine (CBZ), gabapentin (GBP) or lamotrigine (LTG ? Neurology 2005;64:1868?1873). The GBP and LTG groups demonstrated significantly better one year retention in study than CBZ (p = 0.0001), due primarily to superior tolerability. There was little difference among the groups with respect to seizure control. We now consider whether there were age-related differences in our population with respect to seizure control and AED tolerability. Methods: We divided our population into three groups: ages 60?69, 70?79 and 80+. For each group we determined seizure-free rates at three, six and 12 months. Likewise, we determined retention in study at 12 months for the three groups. Finally, we considered the incidence of one of the study's principal side effects, sedation, for each age group. Results: For the three age groups, the intent to treat (ITT) seizure free rate at 12 months showed a steady decline from the youngest to the oldest group for all three treatments. The only exception was an improvement for GBP in the 70?79 group followed by a decline for the 80+ group. Overall, LTG was superior to the other two treatments. Breaking down the data into three, six and 12 month observations, we found that seizure free rate for GBP did not decline until after six months for the 60?69 group, whereas it declined steadily for the two older groups. For LTG, decline was arrested after six months for the 80+ group. For CBZ the only steady decline was in the 80+ group. An important side effect, sedation, showed a steady increase in age-related incidence for the LTG and GBP groups. In particular, two-thirds (65.6%) of the GBP 80+ group reported sedation comapred with just over half that number (34.4%) for the 60?69 group. There was little change over the ages for CBZ. Conclusions: In elderly patients with newly diagnosed seizures, seizure control appears to decline with increasing age for all three treatments studied in VACS #428. Sedation shows an age-related increase for LTG and GBP, but little change for CBZ. The most profound increase in sedation occurred with GBP. Age considerations should play an important role in determining AED selection and usage in the elderly.

Specchio ( 1 Department of Neurological Science, Centre of Epilepsy, Bari, Italy; Clinic of Neurology, Epilepsy Centre, University of Catanzaro; Clinic of Neurology, Epilepsy Centre, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy; Clinic of Neurology, Ospedale Bellaria, Bologna, Italy; Clinic of Neurology, Epilepsy Centre, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy; CINEDIV (Centro Interuniversitario Per Lo Studio dell?Epilessia E dei Disturbi Della Vigilanza), Universities of Foggia and Bari, Foggia, Italy; Department of Neurological Science, Centre of Epilepsy, Bari, Italy; and CINEDIV (Centro Interuniversitario Per Lo Studio dell?Epilessia E dei Disturbi Della Vigilanza), University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy ) Rationale: Patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) may be resistant or show adverse effects to valproate. Several reports and open label studies have pointed out the efficacy of levetiracetam in generalised epilepsy (Patsalos, 2004). Moreover, levetiracetam has been shown to be effective in preventing photoparoxismal response in subjects with photosensitive epilepsy (Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenité et al., 1996). Our previous open-label study suggested levetiracetam might be effective and well tolerated in resistant cases of JME or may become a reasonable alternative to valproate in newly diagnosed patients. We present a multicentre, prospective, long-term, open-label study evaluating the effects of levetiracetam on EEG epileptiform abormalities and on the photoparoxismal response in patients affected by JME. Methods: Ten patients with newly diagnosed and 38 resistant/intolerant to previous AEDs JME were enrolled. After a 8 week baseline period, levetiracetam was titrated in 2 weeks to 500 mg b.i.d. and then increased up to 3000 mg/day according to the patient's response. An EEG evalutation has been performed before starting the treatment and every 3 months. Efficacy parameters were: reduction or sopression of interictal epileptiform abnormalities and photoparoxismal response. Results: The overall mean dose of levetiracetam was 2208 mg/day. The mean study period was 19 (range 0.3?38) months. Four patients had a normal EEG before starting the treatment, 41 had diffuse/generalized spike-waves and 11 showed a severe phoparoxismal response. After drug administration 27 patients had a normal EEG, 20 showed diffuse/generalized spike-waves discharges which were judged to be less frequent and wide, and in 4 we had the persistence of phoparoxismal response. The mean monthly frequency of DWM and of GTC seizures in the entire group was significantly reduced after levetiracetam. Conclusions: This open-label study suggests levetiracetam may be effective in reduction of epileptiform abnormalities, it suppress the photoparoxismal responce and it is well tolerated in resistant cases of JME or may become a reasonable alternative to valproate in newly diagnosed patients. 1 Hermann Stefan, 1 Martina Wangemann, and 1 Bernhard Vens-Cappell ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Clinic of Neurology, University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany; Clinical Research, Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH, Hamburg, Germany; and Scope International AG, Hamburg, Germany ) Rationale: The aim of the study was to investigate the absorption characteristics of a new modified release dosage form of oxcarbazepine after once daily (OD) or twice daily (bid) application in comparison to an immediate release reference formulation during steady state conditions. Methods: Using an open three-period crossover design, 3 different treatments were examined after multiple dose administration of oxcarbazepine to 18 healthy male subjects. The test formulations administered were either oxcarbazepine modified release [OXC MR] 600 mg OD or 300 mg bid. The immediate release formulation of oxcarbazepine [OXC IR] 300 mg bid served as the reference formulation. The three treatments were administered during an up-titration phase of 6 days. Plasma concentration profiles were measured on day 7 during a 24-hour interval at different time points. A wash-out period of 14 days elapsed between the periods. Monohydroxycarbamazepine [MHD], the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine as well as the prodrug oxcarbazepine [OXC], were determined in EDTA plasma samples by a validated HPLC method with UV detection. Results: The results of the multiple dose study demonstrated the consistency of the absorption of the primary parameter MHD from the novel OXC MR formulation after OD or bid application. The time concentration profiles following bid administration of 300 mg OXC MR showed that the mean extent parameters for absorption of MHD are equivalent with the OXC IR reference preparation. Results for peak trough fluctuation [PTF] indicate that fluctuation is reduced in the case of the OXC MR formulation [PTF = 39% for OXC MR and 54% for OXC IR]. In addition, Cmin concentrations of MHD were 10% higher and Cmax concentrations were 6% lower after OXC MR bid compared to the respective results for OXC IR bid. Furthermore, confidence intervals for the extent of absorption [AUC] demonstrated equivalence between OXC MR 600 mg OD and OXC MR 300 mg bid [AUC: 87?96%] or OXC MR 600 mg OD and OXC IR 300 mg bid [AUC: 88%-97%]. The confidence intervals met the commonly accepted range for bioequivalence of 80?125%. Conclusions: The newly developed OXC MR formulation exhibit appropriate modified release characteristics with similar extent of exposure [AUC], reduced peak plasma concentrations [Cmax] and reduced PTF for the major active metabolite MHD compared to the IR formulation when applied twice daily. From Cmin-values observed in this study it may be concluded that effective concentrations should be maintained over the entire dosing interval at steady state. Moreover, the OXC MR formulation seems suitable also for once daily dosing in individual cases and therefore improves patient compliance.

Phenytoin (PHT) and valproate (VPA) are both known to influence bone health, whereas levetiracetam (LEV) belongs to a new class of drugs with no reported adverse effects on bone. Methods: Female Wistar rats were fed twice daily for 90 days through a gastric tube with either LEV 50 mg/kg (n = 10), 150 mg/kg (n = 12), VPA 300 mg/kg (n = 12), PHT 75 mg/kg (n = 9) or control solution (n = 12). We studied the effect of LEV, VPA and PHT on bone densitometric indices, biomechanical strength and bone turnover serum markers. Results: Mean serum drug concentration 4 hours after last dose was 122, 277, 431 and 74 mol/l in low-dose LEV, high-dose LEV, VPA and PHT treated animals, respectively. Whereas PHT and VPA reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) in one or more bone compartments, LEV did not. Only VPA increased bone turnover, whereas treatment with low-dose LEV caused significant reduction in levels of serum osteocalcin (a bone formation marker) relative to controls. Interestingly, low-dose LEV also caused reduced biomechanical strength of the femoral neck. Histomorphological analyses showed retention of cartilage remnants at the growth plate metaphysis in low-dose LEV-treated vs. control rats (n = 6, each group), suggesting reduced cartilage resorption secondary to impaired local bone mineralization. VPA and PHT promoted cellular differentiation and mineralization of primary rat calvarial osteoblasts in vitro, while LEV was without effect. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate differential effects of PHT, VPA and LEV on bone mass and strength, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Remarkably, the ability of low-dose LEV to cause decreased biomechanical strength of the femoral neck, without affecting BMD, suggests a primary effect of this drug on bone quality. This should warrant further studies in humans to rule out potential adverse effects of LEV on bone development and growth, especially in children and adolescents. 1 Mutaz Tabbaa, 2 Susan P. Kerls, 2 Anne E. Hammer, 2 Alain Vuong, and 2 John A. Messenheimer ( 1 Neurology, Bay Neurological Institute, Panama City, FL ; and 2 Neurosciences Medicine Development Center, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine (LAMICTAL, LTG) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients with a history of absence seizures. The effect of LTG on PGTC seizures has not been previously evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial. Therefore, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive therapy with LTG in the treatment of PGTC seizures in patients ≥2 years of age. These results were presented previously. A sub-analysis of the data was performed for patients with a history of absence seizures and those results are presented here. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy with PGTC seizures who were receiving 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at entry were eligible. Patients with partial seizures were excluded based on seizure history and screening electroencephalograms. There were three phases: Baseline; Escalation, during which drug was titrated to a target dose (12 wks if 2?12yrs, 7 wks if > 12yrs); Maintenance, during which doses of drug and concomitant AEDs were maintained for 12 wks. Results: Thirty-eight (18 LTG, 20 placebo (PBO)) patients with a history of days with absence seizures received drug. Median percent decrease from Baseline in PGTC seizures during the entire treatment period (ETP) was 64% in the LTG group and 30% in the PBO group. This was similar to the efficacy in the overall study population. The median percent change from Baseline in absence seizures during the ETP was a 26% decrease in the LTG group and a 100% increase in the PBO group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were headache (22% LTG, 35% PBO) and nausea (22% LTG, 10% PBO). Conclusions: Adjunctive LTG therapy was effective in controlling PGTC seizures and was well tolerated among patients with a history of absence seizures.

Preclinical and clinical pharmacological data have been established in a series of trials and phase 3 development is currently ongoing for both indications. Information about the pharmacokinetic drug-drug-interaction (DDI) potential of lacosamide is an important part of its safety profile. Methods: Regarding the DDI potential the results of several preclinical studies as well as of 9 Phase 1 trials (n = 184 subjects) and a Phase 2 trial (n = 91 patients) are presented. Results: In vitro lacosamide is not substantially metabolized. In vitro results also show no or low potential to inhibit or to induce CYP isoforms. Since lacosamide has low binding to plasma proteins (<15%), drug displacement interactions are unlikely. In a Phase 1 trial lacosamide was administered to extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 and the results showed that the activity of CYP2C19 has no clinically relevant effect on the metabolic fate of lacosamide. Further phase 1 DDI trials have been performed with the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine (inducer of CYP450 system) and valproic acid (inhibitor of CYP450 system) under steady-state conditions. In these trials, lacosamide had no influence on rate or extent of absorption of carbamazepine or valproic acid and vice versa. DDI trials with digoxin and metformin showed no relevant influence of these drugs on lacosamide and vice versa. Lacosamide did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral contraceptive Microgynon? (containing 0.03mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15mg levonorgestrel). Coadministration of food did not alter the rate or extent of gastrointestinal absorption of lacosamide. A clinical trial in subjects with epilepsy showed no influence of lacosamide on plasma levels of common antiepileptic drugs including phenytoin. Conclusions: No DDI have been observed in these studies. Therefore the data suggest that lacosamide has low potential for DDI in clinical use. 1 Alain Vuong, 1 Susan Kerls, 1 Anne Hammer, and 1 John Messenheimer ( 1 Neurosciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Durham, NC ) Rationale: This abstract reports long term efficacy and tolerability results from the Continuation Phase of a study with lamotrigine (LTG) as adjunctive therapy in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS). Methods: LTG-naïve patients (≥ 2 years, ≥ 13 kg) with inadequately controlled PGTCS, receiving a regimen of 1 or 2 AED(s) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) with evidence of generalized epileptiform discharges or no evidence of interictal expression of partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (results presented at AES 2005). Patients having ≥ 3 PGTCS over an 8-week Baseline were randomized to receive LTG or placebo (PBO). Subjects, from either group, who completed the Blinded Phase, could enroll into a 1-year Continuation Phase (subjects on PBO converted to LTG). Results: 89 subjects entered the Continuation Phase. LTG group: n = 42, 50% male, median age = 27 years (n = 9 for 2?12 years, n = 33 for > 12 years, range = 2?53 years),50% with 1 concurrent AED, most common concurrent AEDs were valproate (n = 19, 45%) and phenytoin (n = 15, 36%) median PGTCS during Baseline = 2.0. PBO group: n = 47, 68% male, median age = 23 years (n = 9 for 2?12 years, n = 38 for > 12 years, range = 2?58 years), 68% with 1 concurrent AED, most common concurrent AEDs were valproate (n = 25, 53%) and phenytoin (n = 9, 19%), median PGTCS during Baseline = 2.7. The median percent decrease from Baseline in PGTCS was 90% and 84% during the Continuation Phase for subjects who received LTG and PBO in the Blinded Phase, respectively. For the LTG group, this decrease was similar to that observed in the Blinded Phase (82%). The median PGTCS counts per month were 2.0 and 2.7 during Baseline, and 0.2 and 0.1 during the Continuation Phase for the LTG and PBO groups, respectively. For the LTG group, the median PGTCS count per month was 0.8 in the Blinded Phase. Drug-related adverse events were 14% (LTG) and 19% (PBO). Conclusions: The results from this study, combined with the efficacy and safety of LTG for partial seizures, demonstrate that LTG is a broad spectrum AED for patients with either partial or generalized seizures.

James Lee ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ; 2 Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, L.L.C., Springhouse, PA ; and 3 SK Bio-Pharmaceuticals, Fairfield, NJ ) Rationale: RWJ 333369, S-2-O-carbamoyl-1-O-chlorophenyl-ethanol, is in clinical development for the treatment of focal epilepsy. The present investigation describes the results obtained from the extensive preclinical anticonvulsant studies that have been conducted to date. Methods: RWJ 333369 was tested in several mouse [MES, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), bicuculline, and picrotoxin] and rat (MES and PTZ) acute seizure models following oral (p.o.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. It was also tested for its ability to: block audiogenic seizures in the Frings mouse, block behavioral and electrographic seizures in the corneal and hippocampal kindled rat, the lamotrigine (LTG)-resistant amygdala kindled rat; and refractory seizures in the 6 Hz seizure model. Lastly, RWJ 333369 was tested for its ability to prevent and interrupt Li-pilocarpine (Li-Pilo)-induced status epilepticus in rats. Results: In mice, i.p. RWJ 333369 was found to be active in the MES, PTZ, bicuculline, picrotoxin and audiogenic seizure tests. In rats, it was active in the acute MES test following p.o. administration. RWJ 333369 reduced seizure severity in the corneal kindled rat and seizure severity and afterdischarge duration (ADD) in the hippocampal kindled rat models of partial epilepsy. RWJ 333369 was also active in two models of refractory epilepsy at doses devoid of motor impairment. In the LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat, RWJ 333369 produced a dose-dependent reduction in the behavioral seizure score and ADD. In the 6 Hz seizure model, the antiseizure activity of RWJ 333369 was maintained as the stimulus intensity was increased from 22 to 44 mAmp. When administered prior to Li-Pilo, RWJ 333369 (i.p.) prevented the onset of status epilepticus. Following i.v. administration, it was able to interrupt fully established Li-Pilo-induced status epilepticus. Conclusions: In animal models, RWJ 333369 was active at non-toxic doses and found to possess a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant profile in rodent models of generalized and partial epilepsy. When administered prior to, or after, the onset of Li-Pilo-induced status epilepticus, it was able to either prevent, or halt, Li-Pilo-induced status epilepticus, respectively. In contrast to CBZ, PHT, LTG, and TPM, RWJ 333369 possesses activity in the LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat and the 6 Hz seizure models. These latter findings suggest that RWJ 333369 possesses a unique profile relative to these well-established AEDs and support the continued development of this investigational AED.

Rothman ( 1 Neurology and Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Although levetiracetam (LEV) has established antiepileptic utility, there is still no convincing mechanistic data that account for its therapeutic success. Based upon recent binding experiments that show high affinity for SV2A, a synaptic vesicle protein, we decided to investigate the possibility that LEV inhibits neurotransmitter release. Methods: Imaging and electrophysiology experiments were carried out on 500 ?m thick rat hippocampal slices cut on a vibratome and maintined in a submerged perfusion chamber. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the Schaffer collateral layer and evoked potentials were recorded in the dendritic layer of CA1. The synaptic vesicle label FM1?43 was imaged with a 2-photon microscope. Results: When slices were exposed to LEV (100 ?M) for 30 minutes, we found no alteration of baseline evoked synaptic potentials nor any change in paired pulse potentiation (PPP). However, when slices were preincuabated in LEV for 3 hours, there was a significant, frequency and concentration dependent, reduction in both PPP and synaptic facilitation. At 40 and 80 Hz stimulation, 30 ?M LEV reduced PPP from 160% to 139% of control and 155% to 120% of control, respectively (n = 8 slices). With 100 ?M LEV, stimulation frequencies as low as 5 Hz, reduced PPP from 125% to 110% of control (n = 8 slices). With repetitive stimulation from 5?80 Hz, there was a progressive decrease in successive responses in LEV-treated (100 ?M) slices that was not seen in control slices. The figure below shows the effect of a series of pulses at 80 Hz, control slices are on top, LEV below. [figure 1]When slices were incubated in ucb L060 (100 ?M), a LEV enantiomer lacking antiepileptic and SV2A binding activity, there was no effect on synaptic physiology. When slices were preincubed in FM1?43 and electrically stimulated to destain, there was a significant reduction in destaining rate in LEV (100 ?M) exposed slices, compared to control and enantiomer-exposed slices, suggesting that LEV inhibited some phase of vesicle release. Conclusions: Our data are most economically explained by a presynaptic effect of LEV on neurotransmitter release. It is possible that LEV directly blocks vesicle docking and that this effect is amplified at higher rates of stimulation. Alternatively, LEV could alter calcium buffering in presynaptic terminals or the actual flux of calcium into the terminals. Any of these mechanisms would be compatible with the known affinity of LEV for SV2A. LEV may require access to some intracellular compartment, explaining the necessity for a prolonged slice exposure.

We have shown that SE is associated with impairment of single cells in the hippocampus that fire action potentials when the animal is in a specific location in space, the so-called place cells, and that place cell function correlates well with performance in tasks of visual-spatial memory. Place cell patterns therefore appear to be an excellent measure of spatial memory and may serve as a tool to assess seizure-induced impairment in memory. Here we determined the relationship between spatial memory and place cell function following SE. In addition, we determined if levetiracetam (LEV), an antiepileptic drug with a novel mechanism of action, can improve cognitive function and place cell firing patterns when administered following SE. Methods: The study was designed to i) assess to relationship between learning and memory as measured in the Morris water maze with place cell firing patterns and histopathology in rats with and without a prior history of SE; and ii) determine whether LEV administered after SE alters subsequent outcome as measured by performance in the water maze, place cell function, and histopathology. Adult male rats were subjected to lithium-pilocarpine (Li-Pilo) SE at postnatal (P) day 70 (n = 30) and then treated with LEV or normal saline (NS) for 14 days. Following discontinuation of the drug animals were studied in the water maze and then had electrodes placed and single units recorded starting at P120. Following the testing, brains were examined for cell loss using and mossy fiber sprouting. Results: SE was associated with severely impaired performance in the water maze with SE rats demonstrating no learning over four days of testing. Paralleling this memory deficit was a marked disturbance in firing patterns of pyramidal neurons in CA1. Non-SE rats learned quickly over four days of water maze testing and had normal pyramidal cell firing patterns. LEV had no major effects on water maze performance or place cell function. Histopathological examination of the brains showed severe cell loss in CA1 in all of the SE rats with lesser degrees of injury in CA3 and the hilus. LEV treatment resulted in less histological damage in the hippocampus but had no effect on spatial memorty function or place cell physiology in either control or SE rats. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that abnormalities in place cell firing patterns can be associated with adverse behavioral consequences. The profound deficit in pyramidal cell function in this study parallels the deficiencies in spatial memory seen in our rats. While LEV did not alter water maze performance, less cell loss was seen in animals receiving LEV than animals receiving NS. Because of the severity of the SE-induced it is quite likely that any subtle beneficial effect of LEV on cognition would not be apparent.

Barry Sinclair, 1 Daphne Quigley, 2 Blayne Iskew, and 3 Arto Ohinmaa ( 1 Medicine (Neurology), University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ; 2 Regional Telemedicine Program, Capital Health, Edmonton, AB, Canada ; and 3 Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Most epilepsy patients require regular follow-up care ideally done by a neurologist. In Canada, most specialist care is confined to the major cities, and long distances incur significant costs for both patients and health care system. In Alberta, Canada there are more than 280 videoconferencing sites that can be used for telemedicine in clinical consultations. In disciplines where clinical history and focused examination is sufficient for decision making, telemedicine is expected to substitute a proportion of conventional visits. The aim of the study was to estimate cost savings and patient satisfaction of the telemedicine compared to the conventional clinic visit. Methods: This prospective randomized controlled study includes all out-of-town epilepsy patients coming to follow-up at the epilepsy clinic. After an informed consent, patients were randomized to either conventional (n = 20) or telemedicine (n = 20) clinics. Patients or caregivers filled patient satisfaction and travel cost questionnaires in both alternatives. Cost analysis included costs of traveling, lodging and lost productivity. Results: Average age of the population was 40 years (range 19?73; 45% females). 83% of patients preferred their next visit through telemedicine. About 90% of patients indicated a need for companion travel (mainly by car) to conventional clinic. Average lost working time for conventional clinic was 5.6 hours and 4.7 hours for caregivers and patients respectively. The value of lost productivity ($16.40/hour) was $169, hotel cost (12%; $85/night) $10.20 and the value of car mileage (2 ? 280 km; $0.33/km) $185, totaling about $364. Patient costs for telehealth were minor. Conclusions: Telemedicine can play a major role in the follow-up care of epilepsy patients, reduce patient costs and improve patient satisfaction. This is the first full time epilepsy telemedicine clinic in Western Canada.

Hamer, 2 Annika Spottke, 1 Christiane Aletsee, 1 Susanne Knake, 1 Janine Reis, 1 Wolfgang H. Oertel, 1 Felix Rosenow, and 1 Richard Dodel ( 1 Neurology, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany ; and 2 Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany ) Rationale: There are no recent studies on the direct and indirect costs of epilepsy in Germany. Therefore, we performed a pilot study to estimate these costs of epilepsy in a German epilepsy center. Methods: A prevalence-based, cross-sectional convenience cohort of adults attending the outpatient clinic of our tertiary epilepsy center was evaluated. Seizure-free patients and patients presenting with their first seizure were excluded. Direct and indirect costs were prospectively recorded over a three months period using questionnaires and a patient diary. Cost driving factors were identified. Results: 101 patients were included (40.7 ± 15.2 years; disease duration: 18.1 ± 15.3 years; 6 patients had focal epilepsy with simple partial seizures only, 28 with complex partial seizures, 43 with secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures; 20 had idiopathic generalized epilepsy). The total costs of epilepsy per patient were in average ? 2550 ± 4200 over the three months period. Direct cost contributed 41% to the total costs. Costs of anticonvulsant medication were the main contributor to the direct costs while indirect costs were caused mainly by losses due to early retirement. Cost driving factors included higher seizure frequency, longer disease duration, ictal falls and inadequate behavior. Conclusions: Indirect costs were higher than direct costs in adult patients with active epilepsy attending a German epilepsy center. Medication contributed the most to the direct costs and early retirement was the main factor for the indirect costs. The costs of epilepsy in this German study were above average of the European costs of epilepsy. 1 Mark Rusch, and 2 W. Curt LaFrance Jr. ( 1 Psychology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ; and 2 Neurology and Psychiatry, Rhode Island Hospital/Brown Medical School, Providence, RI ) Rationale: Psychological nonepileptic seizures (NES) are sudden paroxysmal alterations in consciousness, behavior, sensory-motor function or autonomic activity without epileptiform correlates that are often misdiagnosed as epileptic seizures. Definitive diagnosis occurs with video EEG long term monitoring (LTM), usually conducted during admission to comprehensive epilepsy centers. Although many newly diagnosed NES patients are referred for psychiatric or psychological treatment of a presumed underlying emotional disorder, others are simply discharged without clear direction or recommendations. A recent NINDS/NIMH/American Epilepsy Society (AES) sponsored international NES Treatment Workshop (Washington, DC, May 2005) identified a lack of knowledge in the field regarding standard of care in the management of patients with NES. Methods: We administered a preliminary survey to AES members via web and on paper to determine actual post-diagnostic instructions given to patients and referral practices, or NES ?treatment as usual? (TAU). Results: Half of the 90 respondents were neurologists, 12% were neuropsychologists/psychologists, and 9% were psychiatrists, from 12 countries and 25 states. Video EEGs were done at 80% of the sites, and LTM is used in one-third of the sites to confirm NES diagnosis. Provocative testing was used at half of the sites. All respondents reported discussing the diagnosis of NES with the patients, and 91% discuss with the family. The term most often used for the events was ?nonepileptic seizures,? and stress, anxiety/depression, and past trauma were the three etiologies most commonly given to the patient. Treatment was recommended by 95% of the respondents, and 69% of neurologists continued to follow the patient after NES diagnosis. Referrals were most commonly made to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists for treatment. The respondents thought that NES education, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacologic interventions were the most effective treatments. AEDs were tapered by 77% of the respondents, and 37% prescribed psychotropics if comorbid diagnoses were made. Conclusions: The preliminary survey results are intended to inform clinicians and researchers about the range of standard practices among physicians and allied health professional members of AES regarding their responses to NES patients. The survey addresses what neurologists and clinicians discussed with patients about the diagnosis of NES, the terms used to describe the episodes, and the recommendations for treatment. The final survey will summarize national practices, and the range of care, or TAU, offered to patients with NES.

Data collection and management in research proves cumbersome due to limitations posed by incomplete, inaccessible, unreadable paper charts or data stored on disparate electronic databases, compromising quality, integrity and integration of data. For example, identification of patients who meet inclusion criteria for clinical research studies is arduous. Reliability of phenotyping for genetic research can be similarly compromised. A secure, standardised EPR can overcome data management limitations by allowing multiple users simultaneous access to information at different locations. It facilitates ease of updating, interrogation, auditing and detailed analysis of complex data. The aim is to develop an epilepsy EPR to support epilepsy clinical and research services. Methods: A review of various research projects in the epilepsy programme was conducted including: imaging research, SUDEP, pharmacogenetics, and epilepsy and pregnancy. Interviews with researchers were carried out to understand information requirements. Strands of information common to all projects and project specific information was recorded. The feedback was used to build and tailor system screens more appropriate to user needs. Reports were constructed to understand how researchers interrogate the system and identify trend data required for statistical reporting. Results: The epilepsy EPR is at an advanced stage with the development of five core components including: clinic-administration, demographics, social history, medications and epilepsy history. Technical development is based on international healthcare standards to facilitate exchange of data between different systems. It has two components: one manages generic patient information and one that manages epilepsy specific information based on the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The system architecture can therefore be applied to develop EPR's for the management of other diseases. Conclusions: Better data management is critical to advance the quality of research activites. An EPR can facilitate this by providing researchers with information where and when needed. Benefits include standardised data entry using international code sets to ensure efficient exchange of information, allowing for interrogation of large data populations. Capturing data at the point of care will improve quality and integrity. Improving efficiency of clinical research is highly dependable on quality clinical information. An EPR can contribute by acting as an interface between clinical care and research. A demonstration of the epilepsy EPR will be available in the exhibition area at the AES. (Supported by Irish Health Research Board.) 1 John McDermott, 1 Chalres Deacon, and 1 Cecile Walti ( 1 Neurology, Sherbrooke University Hospital ? Centre Hospitalier Universitaire De Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada ) Rationale: CSE is a medical emergency with significant risk of mortality and neurologic sequellae. Prompt treatment may reduce this risk. Methods: We designed a protocol for the treatment of CSE according to the recommendations found in the literature and the pharmacological agents that are locally available. CSE was defined as generalized tonic-clonic (or tonic in children) seizure activity beyond 5 minutes or repeated seizures without return of normal level of consciousness. The protocol was presented to the emergency, neurology and pediatrics departments with the goal of optimizing treatment of CSE at the Sherbrooke University Hospital. The major recommendations include optimal support therapy at onset, lorazepam at minute 1, phenytoin at minute 5 and a choice of propofol, phenobarbital or midazolam for refractory seizures. A retrospective review of 19 episodes of CSE from January 2005 to May 2006 was then performed. The initial management, investigation and use of antiepileptic agents were evaluated. Where possible the doses and the timing of administration were also evaluated and compared to the recommendations proposed in the protocol. Results: 13 cases of CSE were identified in adults (12 patients) and 6 in children (4 patients). A clear etiology was found in 18 cases. Supportive treatment and initial investigations were generally appropriate. In all cases, patients received lorazepam. 9 received less than 50% of the recommended dose and significant delays (>5 min since management began) occurred in 4 cases. In 11 cases, lorazepam was administered in a stepwise, incremental manner. Phenytoin was indicated in all 19 episodes and administered in 15. Five adult patients received 1 gram IV without titration to weight, contributing to a low dose. It was administered at a rate < 30 mg/min in 4 adult cases. Perfusion was initiated only after significant delay (>15 min since management began) in 8 cases. Patients were intubated in 10 cases. Two patients who were intubated had received sub-optimal initial treatment. In both, seizure activity stopped when provided intubation induction agents. CSE persisted from < 10 minutes to 45 minutes from onset of management. EEG monitoring was performed in 7 patients, none had residual seizure activity. One patient had continued seizure activity subsequent to administration of initial agents; it was controlled with intubation induction agents. Conclusions: We found a tendency to administer medications below the recommended doses. In some, significant delays occurred prior to treatment. A tendency to administer lorazepam in an incremental manner contributed to delays in optimal treatment in some cases. Closer adherence to recommendations is suggested to minimize duration of seizure activity. 1 Blagovest Nikolov, 1 Douglas Labar, 1 Kenneth Perrine, 2 Joyce Cramer, and 1 Cynthia Harden ( 1 Neurology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ; and 2 Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine ) Rationale: Mood disorders are a frequent comorbidity in persons with epilepsy. As part of the Epilepsy Foundation's initiative on mood disorders, a survey was developed to assess knowledge of and attitudes and practices towards mood disorders in epilepsy. After this survey was piloted at the American Epilepsy Society Meeting in 2004, it was thought that information was needed from a more representative sample of US neurologists; therefore the survey was distributed to members of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). Methods: The survey entitled ?Mood in Epilepsy Neurology Practice Questionnaire?consists of 14 questions including three demographic items. A 5-degree Likert scale was developed for most answer choices. We used an internet survey provider to send the questions via e-mail to 900 randomly selected AAN members. Results: 156 responses (17%) were obtained and the percentages of the answers to selected questions follow: 1)? How often do you ask epilepsy patients about their mood? Never 1/Rarely 7/Sometimes 26/Often 46/Always 20 2)? How much do you think that symptoms of a mood disorder are important factors in determining an epilepsy patient's quality of life? Very little 1/To a mild degree 1/Somewhat 10/Quite a bit 52/A lot 36 3)? When you diagnose a mood disorder in an epilepsy patient, how often do you initiate a medication to treat it (medication for depression, anxiety, etc)? Never 6/Rarely 12/Sometimes 38/Often 38/Always 6 4)? When you diagnose a mood disorder in an epilepsy patient with a mood disorder, how often do you refer the patient to a psychiatrist for initiation of treatment? Never 3/Rarely 21/Sometimes 44/Often 24/Always 8 5)? How frequently do you limit your prescribing of antidepressants because of concern about exacerbating seizures? Always 1/Often 5/Sometimes 30/Rarely 50/Never 14 6)? In your practice, how much of an obstacle is the patient's insurance coverage when referring epilepsy patients with depression for psychiatric treatment? Overwhelming obstacle 7/Often an obstacle 26/Sometimes an obstacle 31/Usually not an obstacle 13/Rarely an obstacle 13/Don't know 10 7)? Your age in years 25?35 = 17; 35?45 = 29; 45?55 = 27; 55?65 = 22; 65 and older = 5 8)? Type of Practice Adult Neurology ?Academic = 33 Adult Neurology ? Private = 39 Adult Epileptology ?Academic = 11 Adult Epileptology ? Private = 4 Pediatric Neurology ?Academic = 9 Pediatric Neurology ? Private = 4 Pediatric Epileptology ?Academic = 4 Pediatric Epileptology ? Private = 0 Conclusions: A random survey of AAN members finds that practitioners are aware of the importance of mood problems in patients with epilepsy. Further, the respondents often ask these patients about their mood and initiate a plan of treatment. However, since completing this survey was voluntary, the sample may have been biased in favor of such responses. Difficulty with insurance issues when trying to obtain psychiatric care is consistently reported. (Supported by Epilepsy Foundation.) 1 Cheryl P. Shore, 1 Janice M. Buelow, and 2 Jingwei Wu ( 1 Indiana University School of Nursing, Indiana University/Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN ; and 2 Division of Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indiana University/Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN ) Rationale: In a sample of caregivers of children with epilepsy and significant learning problems, we noted that some caregivers gave accounts of a prompt diagnosis of epilepsy, while others described a delay. The purpose of this pilot study was to answer the research question: What factors are associated with a delay to a diagnosis of epilepsy in children with both a seizure disorder and learning problems? Methods: Qualitative data from twenty retrospective, open ended interviews with primary caregivers of children who had both a diagnosis of epilepsy and significant learning problems were examined for presence or absence of factors. Interviews were dichotomized into two categories: those that described a timely diagnostic process, and those that told of a delay. The qualitative data were then coded as to the presence or absence of factors. These included: annual income greater than $30,000, both parents actively involved with the child, parental college education, generalized tonic/clonic seizures as the presenting seizure type, caregiver mention of child fever or febrile seizures, and a diagnosis of developmental delay prior to diagnosis of epilepsy. Child age at diagnosis was also noted. SPSS was used to describe the data and conduct logistic regression analysis to explore for associations between presence/absence of factors and age of child with delay to diagnosis. Results: Of the twenty caregivers, 11 described the diagnostic process as prompt, while 9 regarded it as delayed. Older child age at diagnosis was found to associate with the delayed group, (p = .05). Three of the dichotomous factors described above were significantly associated with group membership (delay to diagnosis versus prompt diagnosis): some college education of at least one parent/caregiver (p = .02), generalized tonic/clonic seizure as the presenting seizure type (p = .04), and a diagnosis of developmental delay prior to diagnosis of epilepsy (p = .04). Conclusions: While our pilot study utilized a small sample, our findings suggest that delay to diagnosis might be associated with child, parent and seizure factors. Our sample was too small to conduct multifactor logistic regression analyses which would allow us to explore the influence of factors in combination. Our goal is to conduct a larger study with a more diverse sample in order to explore combinations of factors that are associated with an increased risk for delay to a diagnosis of epilepsy.

Ting, 1 Olukemi Ajayi, 2 Krauss Gregory, 1 Krumholz Allan, 1 Hopp Jennifer, and 1 Joseph Martinez ( 1 Neurology, University of Maryland SOM, Baltimore, MD ; and 2 Neurology, Johns Hopkins University SOM, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Acute repetitive seizures (ARS), multiple seizures within 24 hours with recovery between seizures, are common. It has been thought that ARS requires urgent treatment in the Emergency Department (ED), but the management of ARS is not as well-defined as other acute seizure presentations such as status epilepticus or alcohol withdrawal seizures. ARS is commonly treated with benzodiazepines (BZD) sometimes with a longer-acting antiepileptic drug (AED), such as intravenous phenytoin (PHT), valproic acid (VPA), or leviteracitam (LEV). A better understanding of the characteristics of ARS and its response to therapy may help to optimize treatment of ARS in an ED setting. Methods: Patients who presented to the UMMC ED (Baltimore, MD) with ARS between 11/01/05 through 2/1/06 were identified. Initial search criteria included all patients at least 18 years of age with discharge diagnosis code(s) for seizure(s). ARS characteristics, ED treatment course including length of stay, and outcome were extracted. Patients who presented with status epilepticus or alcohol withdrawal seizures were excluded from this analysis. Results: Over a 3-month period, 88 patients presented to the ED with seizures. Of these, 20 (23%) met criteria for ARS (median 3 seizures). Eight patients received either no treatments or only a single dose of BZD. Nine patients received some combination of BZD with a longer acting AED (PHT or VPA). Three patients received only a longer acting AED (PHT or LEV). No patients had recurrent seizures after treatment (or lack of treatment). Patients who received a combination of BZD and longer acting AED or a longer acting AED alone had an average length of stay greater than 10 hours and were more likely to be admitted, while patients who received no treatment or BZD only stayed in the ED for less than 10 hours on average and were less likely to be admitted. Conclusions: The majority of patients with ARS do well, even when not treated or given only a single dose of BZD. While all patients in this study had an excellent outcome, patients who were treated with a longer acting AED or a combination of longer acting AED and BZD tended to have longer ED stays and were more likely to be admitted. Based on these findings, perhaps the urgent use of longer acting AEDs to treat ARS in the ED setting should be reconsidered.

AB  - Abstract Tendon injuries are common musculoskeletal system disorders in clinical, but the regeneration ability of tendon is limited. Tendon stem cells (TSCs) have shown promising effect on tissue engineering and been used for the treatment of tendon injury. Exosomes that serve as genetic information carriers have been implicated in many diseases and physiological processes, but effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury repair is unclear. The aim of this study is to make clear that the effect of exosomes from TSCs on tendon injury healing. Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of TSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Rat Achilles tendon tendinopathy model was established by collagenase-I injection. This was followed by intra-Achilles-tendon injection with TSCs or exosomes. Tendon healing and matrix degradation were evaluated by histology analysis and biomechanical test at the post-injury 5 weeks. In vitro, TSCs treated with interleukin 1 beta were added by conditioned medium including exosomes or not, or by exosomes or not. Tendon matrix related markers and tenogenesis related markers were measured by immunostaining and western blot. We found that TSCs injection and exosomes injection significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 expression, increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) and Col-1a1, and increased biomechanical properties of the ultimate stress and maximum loading. In vitro, conditioned medium with exosomes and exosomes also significantly decreased MMP-3, and increased expression of tenomodulin, Col-1a1 and TIMP-3. Exosomes from TSCs could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing for its balancing tendon extracellular matrix and promoting the tenogenesis of TSCs.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic splenectomy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term impairment of humoral and cellular immunity. Alternatives to surgery have been developed to minimize or avoid the immediate and/or long-term complications of splenectomy. Herein we investigated the long-term effect of non-operative management (NOM) of the traumatic rupture of the spleen on the distribution of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte populations and cytokine production by T cells. PB samples were drawn from six NOM patients, 13 age-matched adults who had undergone splenectomy after trauma (SP patients) and 31 age-matched controls. Cellular phenotypes and the intracellular production of interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in T cells were determined in whole blood?±?mitogens by flow cytometry. NOM patients did not show any changes in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the distribution of their subsets, compared to the controls. In contrast, SP patients showed a sustained increase in the percentage and/or absolute numbers of lymphocytes, CD8 T cells, activated CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK)?T cells, NK cells and ?δ T cells, and a reduction in naive CD4 T cells. The constitutive or induced cytokine production by T cells of the NOM group was similar to the control group, whereas SP patients had increased percentages of constitutive IL-2- and IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells and IFN-?-producing CD4 T cells. Our findings indicate collectively that the healing process in NOM does not affect the architecture of the spleen to such an extent that it would lead to long-term alterations of the proportions of PB lymphocytes or the T cell cytokine profiles.

The dog in question, a 6-year-old Welsh springer spaniel, was presented with flaccid tail and faecal and urinary incontinence. The histological lesions included severe mononuclear cell infiltration of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and of the lumbar nerve roots. The infiltrate was composed of large numbers of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and small numbers of macrophages. Polymerase chain reactions of brain and spinal tissues were positive for Neospora caninum.

Michael ( 1 Mental Retardation Research Center, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 2 Division of Neurosurgery ; and 3 Department of Neuropathology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Based on histopathology, cortical dysplasias (CD) are classified into mild CD if the cortex shows architectural abnormalities only and severe CD if the cortex also presents cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells in addition to architectural changes. Both types induce intractable seizures in children. We showed that GABAergic cell numbers and GABA terminals were altered in severe CD but not in mild CD. GABA peak currents, densities and desensitization time constants were also differentially altered in mild and severe CD, suggesting that mechanisms of seizure induction might be different in those two types of pediatric CD (Andre et al., Epilepsia 46 Suppl. 8: 5, 2005). The present study characterized further postsynaptic GABAA receptor function in non-CD, mild and severe CD human brain. Methods: Cortical samples resected for the treatment of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy were collected from non-CD (n = 10), mild (n = 6) and severe CD (n = 10) patients. Brain tissue slices were acutely dissociated and electrophysiological recordings were performed on isolated pyramidal neurons. Patch electrodes were filled with N-methyl-D-glucamine for whole-cell voltage clamp recordings. Different concentrations of GABA and GABAA receptor modulators were applied to the cells. Results: EC50 values were similar in non-CD and severe CD but higher in mild CD cells suggesting less sensitive GABAA receptors. Zinc reversibly decreased GABA peak currents in all cells. However, severe CD cells had a smaller sensitivity to zinc compared to non-CD cells. Zolpidem, a benzodiazepine (BZ) of type I that binds specifically to α1 subunits, reversibly enhanced GABA peak currents in all cells. Zolpidem sensitivity was significantly smaller in severe CD cells compared to mild and non-CD cells. Conclusions: GABA sensitivity determined by EC50 values was similar in non-CD and severe CD cells. However, GABAA receptors responded differently to modulators in severe CD vs non-CD. Sensitivity to zinc was smaller in severe CD, suggesting higher expression of ?2 subunits. Zolpidem effect was also decreased in severe CD vs non-CD indicating a decreased expression of α1. As α1 and ?2 subunits are part of the BZ binding site, alteration in their expression is likely to change the efficacy of BZ used to treat seizures in severe CD. In mild CD, effects of modulators binding to α1- and ?2-containing receptors were not different from non-CD indicating those subunits are not altered. However, GABA sensitivity was lower in mild CD, which could implicate a loss of inhibition and lead to seizures. Together, these results indicate that GABAA receptor subunit composition is differentially altered in mild and severe CD and suggest that different drugs targeting GABA function might be needed to treat the two types of CD.

Van Rijen, 1 Dirk Troost, and 1 Eleonora Aronica ( 1 Department of (Neuro) Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery/Rudolf Magnus Institute for Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Developmental glioneuronal lesions, such as gangliogliomas (GG) are increasingly recognized causes of chronic pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. The cellular mechanism(s) underlying the epileptogenicity of GG remain largely unknown. It has been postulated that chronic epilepsy in patients with malformations of cortical development is associated with dysfunction of the inhibitory GABAergic system. We aimed to identify the subtypes of interneurons present within GG specimens and the expression and cellular distribution patterns of GABA receptors (GABAR) and GABA transporter 1 (GAT1). The expression of the various components of the GABAergic system were also analysed in the perilesional cortex. Methods: We investigated immunocytochemically the expression of parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), GABAAR (a1 subunit), GABAB (R1 and R2) and GAT-1 in 30 specimens of GG obtained during epilepsy surgery, including 10 cases with sufficient amount of both perilesional and adjacent normal control cortex. Results: Immunocytochemistry for parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y demonstrate the presence of inhibitory neurons of different subtypes within the GG specimens. Most interneurons were NPY positive, whereas fewer reacted to calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin. Both GABAAR and GABABR (R1 and R2) subtypes were detected within the neuronal component of GG specimens. In addition, GABABR2 immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in glial cells. GG specimens displayed also expression of GAT-1 IR. Compared to normal cortex, reduced perilesional IR for parvalbumin was observed in 70%, for calbindin in 60% and for GABAR and GAT-1 in 30% of the specimens. Increased staining was detected for NPY in 80% of the cases. Conclusions: The cellular distribution of components of the GABAergic system in GG, together with the perilesional changes suggest that alterations of the GABAergic system may contribute to the complex abnormal functional network of these highly epileptogenic developmental lesions.

Parisi ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; 2 Child and Adolescent Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester ; 3 Division of Neuro-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN ; and 4 Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery outcomes may differ among the focal malformations of cortical development (MCDs). Specifically, most pathologic studies have suggested that balloon cells portend a better prognosis compared to other ?focal cortical dysplasias.? This could impact surgical decision making, since there are several MRI features highly suggestive of balloon cells. For example, focal cortical thickening with T2 signal abnormality extending towards the ventricle has been reported to be 94% specific for balloon cell pathology. We have previously proposed a categorization scheme for focal malformations of cortical development, discarding the term ?focal cortical dysplasia? since these lesions are not precancerous. This study correlates the histopathologic type of focal malformation with epilepsy surgery outcomes. Outcome of each focal MCD category Pathologic subtype Engel class I outcome (free of disabling seizures) Architectural disorganization 1 of 6 (17%) Cytoarchitectural dysmorphism without balloon cells ?9 of 12 (75%) Cytoarchitectural dysmorphism with balloon cells 12 of 20 (60%) Polymicrogyria 4 of 8 (50%) Indeterminate 0 of 1 (0%)? p = 0.12 Methods: Pathologic specimens were retrospectively reviewed from 49 consecutive focal MCDs resections at Mayo Clinic Rochester. These cases were all removed for intractable epilepsy. Specimens were systematically classified using microscopy and standardized immunohistochemical techniques, according to our recently reported classification scheme. Clinical outcomes were compared between different histopathologic subtypes. Results: Of the 49 cases, three were excluded since there was no post-operative follow-up. Of the remaining 46, 26 patients (57%) remain free of disabling seizures (Engel class I). Average follow-up was 34 months. Patients with cytoarchitectural dysmorphism (with or without balloon cells) trended towards better outcomes compared to architectural disorganization and polymicrogyria. However, balloon cells did not portend the best prognosis. Only 60% of patients with balloon cells (?cytoarchitectural dysmorphism with balloon cells?) were free of disabling seizures compared to 75% of those with cytologically abnormal neurons and architectural disorganization without balloon cells (?cytoarchitectural dysmorphism without balloon cells?). Conclusions: Epilepsy surgical outcomes remain suboptimal in focal MCDs. Other focal lesions causing epilepsy, such as cavernomas or mesial temporal sclerosis, are associated with excellent outcomes in up to 90% of patients. In contrast, we found that only 57% of patients with focal MCDs remained seizure-free. In our cohort, balloon cells did not portend a better prognosis than other focal MCDs. 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio, 1 Timothy A. Simeone, 2 Frank Schottler, 1 Do Young Kim, 1 Harold Rekate, 1 Jack Kerrigan, and 1 Jong M. Rho ( 1 Barrow Neurological Institute, St Joseph's Hospital  and 2 Alpha Med Sciences Co., LTD, Osaka, Japan ) Rationale: The hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) represents a rare but important model of subcortical epileptogenesis. Clinical studies, based primarily on intracranial electrode recordings have established that the HH itself is epileptogenic, but the mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we examined the network properties of surgically-resected human HH tissue using a planar multielectrode array recording system. Methods: HH tissue was obtained with patient consent and upon resection was immediately submerged in ACSF bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Tissue slices (400 ?m) were placed in a microelectrode dish (Alpha Med Systems, Osaka, Japan) and perfused with warmed (35°C) oxygenated ACSF. The electrodes were arranged in an 8 ? 8 grid with 150 ?m separation. Slices were arbitrarily placed over the entire electrode grid. Results: Paired-pulse stimulation (50 ms interval) to random points within the tissue elicited small negative field potentials and stimulation-evoked single unit firing within specific regions of the tissue. A 5?20% paired-pulse depression of the field potential was evident in most areas, and was converted to a similar magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation by picrotoxin (100 ?M) suggesting the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic components. Furthermore, the stimulation-evoked single unit firing increased (?4-fold) with the second pulse consistent with paired-pulse facilitation of an excitatory component. Picrotoxin substantially increased evoked unit firing suggesting that endogenous GABAergic neuron activity is present normally, and inhibition or shunting of an excitatory component is prominent. In addition, we recorded spontaneous single unit firing of individual cells from multiple electrodes with frequencies ranging from 1?14 Hz and spontaneous negative slow wave activity with amplitudes ranging from 5?300 mV. Interestingly, the frequency of spontaneous slow wave activity decreased with application of picrotoxin and increased with muscimol (30 ?M). Conclusions: Our observations indicate that HH tissue is composed of neurons that are strongly modulated by GABAA receptor-mediated mechanisms. This is consistent with earlier observations demonstrating positive immunoreactivity of HH tissue to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67). A novel finding in this study is that populations of neurons also give rise to spontaneous slow wave discharges. It is of interest to determine if the spontaneous activity will become synchronous across the tissue and develop into epileptiform activity in response to provocation. Future studies will characterize the spontaneous activity and the functional architecture of HH tissue. (Supported by NIH and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Jan A. Gorter, 2 Karin Boer, 1 Erwin Van Vliet, 2 Sandra Redeker, 3 Fernando H. Lopes da Silva, 3 Wytse J. Wadman, and 2 Eleonora Aronica ( 1 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences/Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; and 3 Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands ) Rationale: The complement cascade has been suggested to be involved in the inflammatory responses observed in a variety of disorders of the central nervous system. Recent evidence suggests that complement activation may contribute to seizure activity and promote neurodegeneration. We investigated the possible involvement of the complement cascade during epileptogenesis in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the chronic phase of spontaneous seizures in both experimental as well as human TLE. Methods: RNA was obtained from three different brain regions (CA3, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum) at three different time points (1 day = acute phase; and 1 week = latent phase; 3?4 months = chronic epileptic phase) after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE) in rat. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Gene Chip System (230A). The immunohistochemical pattern of C1q, C3c and C3d was assessed in human hippocampal specimens from controls and medically intractable TLE with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Results: Genes involved in the complement pathway (e.g. C1qa, C1qc, C3, C4a, Cfh) were upregulated after induction of SE in rat and remained elevated in the chronic phase. C1qa and C1qc were already induced in the acute phase. C3, C4a and C8b were induced in the latent phase and showed the highest expression at the end of the latent period. In human TLE with HS, glial expression of C1q, C3c and C3d was observed particularly within regions where neuronal cell loss occurs (e.g. CA1 and hilus). Conclusions: Our data indicate that within the immune response the complement activation represents a prominent process during epileptogenesis. The persistence of complement activation is supported by the data on human HS specimen showing increased expression of complement factors in activated glial cells. Although the complement system may be useful in eliminating aggregated and harmful proteins associated with epilepsy, abnormal activation of the complement system can also have damaging effects through activation of inflammatory processes.

Hantus, 1 Dileep Nair, 1 Richard Burgess, and 1 Imad Najm ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: One third of epilepsy patients are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a well-recognized cause of refractory epilepsy that can often be cured by surgical resection. The presence of periventricular heterotopia (PVH) is associated with the development of epilepsy, although the role of these lesions in the generation of epileptogenicity and their cellular/molecular characteristics remain unclear. Methods: In this report, we present the histological and immunocytochemical (ICC) characteristics of a periventricular nodule that was resected from a 17 years old female with a history of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, a lateral temporal MCD and multiple PVH. Invasive video electrographic encephalography (VEEG) with subdural electrodes and a depth electrode targeted at the PVH did not confirm the PVH as the seizure onset zone. The patient underwent a temporal lobectomy that included the removal of a subcortical nodule. She remained seizure free on no antiepileptics for four years, then presented with a single generalized seizure. Results: Histological and ICC examinations of the resected nodule showed dysmorphic neurons lacking any laminar or columnar organizations. These neurons were intermixed with GFAP positive glial cells, immature neurons (TUJ1 positive) and immature astrocytes (vimentin positive). Some subcortical neurons expressed doublecortin, a marker of migrating cells. The expression of GABA (Calbindin, parvalbumin) and NMDA (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) receptors were also examined. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PVH is constituted of a mixture of neuronal and glial cells at various levels of differentiation that failed to mature and migrate to their final position in the neocortex. It is unclear if these nodules are epileptogenic. Further studies of the role of PVH in epilepsy are needed in order to further characterize the electrophysiology and molecular biology of the constituent cells of these lesions and their overlying neocortical areas. 1 David C. Henshall, 2 Clara K. Schindler, 2 Akitaka Yamamoto, 1 Carmen Bellver-Estelles, 1 Brona M. Murphy, 1 Seiji Hatazaki, 2 Norman K. So, 2 Roger P. Simon, and 2 Robert Meller ( 1 Physiology  2 RS Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ; and 3 Oregon Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Neurological Sciences Center, Portland, OR ) Rationale: The role of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is incompletely understood. Experimental modeling suggests seizures activate TNFR1 and downstream pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades, although little is known about whether these pathways function in human TLE brain. Methods: We examined TNFR1 signaling in hippocampus surgically obtained from refractory TLE patients (n = 10), and compared results to matched autopsy controls (n = 6). TNFR1 signaling was also examined in hippocampus obtained from mice following focally-evoked limbic seizures. Samples were processed for detection of protein in whole cell lysates or subcellular fractions, immunoprecipitation studies and immunohistochemistry. Results: Western blotting established total protein levels of the TNFR1 proximal signaling adaptor TNFR-associated protein with death domain (TRADD) and cleaved caspase-8 were higher in TLE samples than matched autopsy controls. Intracellular distribution analyses determined cytoplasmic levels of TNFR1, TRADD and the caspase-8 recruitment adaptor Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and microsomal levels of TRADD, FADD and cleaved caspase-8, were raised in TLE samples. Immunoprecipitation studies, supported by fluorescence microscopy revealed increased TNFR1-TRADD and TRADD-FADD association in TLE samples. Expression and localization of these proteins was similar in mouse hippocampus. Seizures evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid increased microsomal levels of TNFR1 signaling components and triggered TNFR1-TRADD and TRADD-FADD complex formation and caspase-8 processing. Conclusions: These data show seizures in mice activate hippocampal TNFR1 signaling and reveal this pathway to be engaged in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Accordingly, the TNFR1 pathway may be a potential target for adjunctive neuroprotective therapy following status epilepticus or in the setting of recurrent epileptic seizures.

Most of the resected hippocampi of patients with TLE resistant to pharmacological treatment are characterized by neuronal loss and abnormal mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the fascia dentata. The main goal of this work was to study neuron density and mossy fiber distribution in the hippocampi of TLE patients with different MRI volumetric hippocampal profiles. Methods: Using MRI hippocampal volumetry, patients were classified as: 1) normal volume (NV; n = 8; hippocampal volume with at least 2.5 cm3); 2) mild atrophy (MA; n = 9; hippocampal volume between 2 and 2.5 cm3); and 3) severe atrophy (SA; n = 10; hippocampal volume with less than 2 cm3). Corresponding hippocampal histological sections were stained with cresylecht violet or hematoxylin/eosin for hippocampal cell counts and neo-Timm histochemistry for mossy fiber detection. Histological controls were autopsy patients (n = 13; without antemortem clinical seizures or evidence of brain pathology on postmortem examination). Results: 1) Compared to autopsies, all three TLE groups showed loss of granular cells (NV: 44%; MA: 43%; SA: 48%) and CA1 (NV: 83%; MA: 69%; SA: 72%), CA2 (NV: 39%; MA: 39%; SA: 47%); CA3a (NV: 64%; MA: 70%; SA: 62%) and CA4 (NV: 55%; MA: 63%; SA: 64%) pyramidal cells, p < 0.001; 2) all TLE groups presented higher neo-Timm staining in the inner molecular layer of the fascia dentata than their autopsy controls (gray level: Control: 7,6 ± 4; NV: 72,6 ± 8; MA: 90,8 ± 10,8; SA: 95,5 ± 8; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Atrophy profile observed on MRI does not necessarily reflect either cell loss intensity or axonal reorganization in patients with TLE. (Supported by BAP-FAMERP; FAPESP ?

The present study was designed to demonstrate: i) a pathological vascularization associated with TLE, ii) angiogenic processes active in chronic focus, iii) an impact of vascular remodeling on epileptogenicity. Methods: Hippocampi were collected from 40 patients after surgery for intractable TLE with various etiologies and from 5 non epileptic (NE) patients (autopsies or hippocampectomy for parahippocampal tumor). By immunohistochemistry or immunoblot, we evaluated: microvessel density, expression of markers of immature endothelial cells, of angiogenic factors and their receptors. We also checked impairments of blood brain barrier (BBB). In parallel, we studied the kinetics of these processes in the rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced limbic epilepsy. Results: We observed division markers in vascular cells in neurogenic areas of epileptic hippocampi. The microvessel density was significantly higher in TLE patients than in NE patients. More, there was no quantitative differences between TLE with hippocampal sclerosis and TLE with other etiologies. Most of these microvessels were positive for markers of immature endothelial cells. The angiogenic factor VEGF was expressed mainly by neurons and often by astrocytes, and its receptor Flk-1 was localized on thin vascular sprouts. In all cases of TLE, we observed impairments of BBB, allowing IgG leakage and blood cell extravasation. In rats, the degree of vascularization increased progressively from 1 week after status epilepticus. VEGF was rapidly and strongly overexpressed after seizures, whereas the other markers appeared during the silent period. The BBB was early damaged. In the chronic stage, these phenomena were still obvious, as for human TLE. Conclusions: For the first time, we demonstrate a neo-vascularization of the TLE focus, independently of etiology. We suggest that the pathological angiogenic processes are related to the persistent inflammation and are maintained by recurrent seizures. The consequences of this vascular remodeling may concern hemodynamics, inflammation, neurotoxicity, BBB permeability and drug refractoriness.

Becker ( 1 Department of Neuropathology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn ) Rationale: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are characterized by a localized malformation of the neocortex and the underlying white matter. Balloon cells, similar to those observed in tuberous sclerosis (TSC) are present in a significant number of cases (FCDIIb). Histopathological similarities indicate that FCDIIb may be pathogenetically related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, that normally constitute a tumor suppressor mechanism. Accumulation of coding allelic variants affecting exons 5 and 17 of TSC1 as well as loss of heterozygosity of the second TSC1 allele have been observed in many FCDIIb patients (Becker et al., Ann Neurol 2002). Here, we have studied the potential functional relevance of coding allelic variants of TSC1 found in FCDIIb with respect to the interaction of the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Methods: Sequence variants of the TSC1 allele found in FCDIIb patients were introduced in the full-length TSC1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. M. Nellist, Amsterdam) by site-directed mutagenesis. We have further generated TSC1 cDNA variants with mutations found in TSC patients, i.e. by introducing premature stop codons. Protein interaction assays were performed to analyze a potentially compromised interaction between the TSC1/2 proteins hamartin and tuberin. Results: TSC1 sequence variants were successfully introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Compromised interaction of the hamartin-tuberin complex was most pronounced in TSC1 mutants bearing the premature stop codon at position R692X (p < 0.01). Sequence alterations of TSC1 present in FCDIIb (H732Y) also resulted in significantly compromised TSC1/2-interaction compared to wild-type TSC1 (p < 0.05). The latter was comparable to findings obtained by the expression of the TSC-determining allele variant R786X. Conclusions: Our data suggest, that allelic variants with amino acid exchange of the TSC1 gene in FCDIIb may be associated with compromised TSC1/TSC2 interaction. The functional relevance is currently studied in cell culture and animal systems.

The aim of our study is to systematically review the pathology around the cyst in patients with epilepsy treated with AC and cortical resection. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient data from epilepsy surgeries at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 1978 and 2006. Only those patients treated with resection of cyst and adjacent cortex were included in the study. Patients' records were reviewed for demographic data, follow-up duration, EEG, MRI or CT imaging, and histopathology reports. Results: Of 1880 patients, only 10 patients had AC and six were treated with cyst resection. There were five males and one female patient. The locations of the AC were in the left temporal fossa in four, left peri-rolandic region and right sylvian fissure in one each. Ictal onset zone was localized to the AC region in all patients. The mean duration of epilepsy was 12.2 + 8.8 years and the mean cyst size was 5.7 ? 4.2 ? 4 cms. Review of pathology showed mild subpial gliosis around the AC in all patients. Four of these showed normal adjacent cortex. However, one patient showed mild cortical dysplasia and another showed hippocampal sclerosis. At follow-up ranging from 9 ± 0.24 months, all 6 patients were seizure free (one patient had 3 seizures at 2 months and none thereafter). Patients with abnormal cortical pathology were found to have earlier onset, longer duration, and lower frequency of seizures. Conclusions: A cortical abnormality either independently or in association with subpial gliosis appears to be the cause of seizures in patients with AC. Identifying the cortical pathology preoperatively with the help of high-resolution MRI and a dedicated epilepsy imaging protocol could influence the type and extent of resection required. It is important to have proper orientation of the cyst and adjacent cortex in order to verify the pathological substrate for the seizures. 1 Mary T. Silvia, 3 Alexander R. Judkins, 2 Phillip B. Storm, 1 Robert G. Kalb, and 1 Brenda E. Porter ( 1 Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery ; and 3 Department of Neuropathology ) Rationale: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is the cause of intractable pediatric epilepsy in up to 60% of surgical case series.1 Previously identified histologic features of CD include large dysmorphic neurons and prominent disorganized neurites. We hypothesize that there are differences in dendrite morphology (total dendrite length and branching patterns) between CD tissue and controls. To better understand the cellular morphology of CD, we quantitatively characterized the dendritic tree of dysmorphic neurons from Palmini grade II A and II B dysplasia from children with refractory epilepsy.2 Methods: Tissue from pediatric CD patients was collected at the time of epilepsy surgery and stained using the Golgi-cox method. We have analyzed dendrite length and branching order from 3 refractory patients. Dendrites attached to the cell body are first order dendrites and those arising from the first order are called second order dendrites, and so on. Branching order is a measure of the neuron's dendrite tree complexity. Dendrite length refers to the summed total of the basilar dendritic tree. Slides were analyzed for total dendrite length, and dendrite order for at least 10 neurons per patient and compared against literature autopsy controls.2,3 Results: Patients 1, 2, and 3 were 11% (461?m ± 74.7 SEM), 30.3% (1271 ?m ± 182.3 SEM) and 17.0% (714.8 ?m ± 121.5 SEM) of the total dendrite tree length compared to literature controls (4193.4 ?m ± 250 SEM). The most complex of our patients neurons branched to the 5th order, compared to the 8th order in controls. The largest difference in branching order occurred in 3rd and 4th branches, with Patients 1, 2, and 3 at 8%, 22%, and 2.7% of the control values, respectively, for number of dendrites per cell that branched to a 4th order. Conclusions: Pediatric CD tissue varied significantly from literature autopsy controls', with shorter total dendrite length per cell and decreased branching, indicating that CD dendrite trees are smaller and simpler in structure. Our findings suggest that the large and disorganized appearance of neurites in type II CD is associated with lack of dendrite organization rather than dysmorphic neurons with enlarged dendrite trees. Our data also suggest the dysmorphic neurons are similar to immature neurons with less complex dendrite trees. We are analyzing autopsy specimens from multiple ages to address this issue.

Several reports have described the neurogenesis from surgical specimens of temporal lobe epilepsy, not only in an animal epilepsy model. However, the function of neurogenesis remains to elucidate. We herein examined the neurogenesis in the human hippocampus from temporal lobe epilepsy patients by immunohistochemical staining, and compared the neurogenesis between the specimens from hippocampal sclerosis and non-hippocampal sclerosis. Methods: Six surgical specimens were examined by immunohistochemical staining using NeuroD, PSA-NCAM, GFAP, Ki-67. Three cases thus demonstrated hippocampal sclerosis in both magnet resonance imaging and pathological evaluations, and another 3 showed non-hippocampal sclerosis. The cell counting of positive cells of each type of staining was applied in the ammon horn and the dentate gyrus. We also observed the nature of the cell and axon with positive staining. Results: PSA-NCAM positive cells were mostly detected in the hilus, and also in the granule cell and CA1 pyramidal cell layers in both the hippocampal sclerosis and non-hippocampal sclerosis groups. The PSA-NCAM positive immature neurons were co-stained with NeuN, but not with either NeuroD or Ki-67. The PSA-NCAM positive immature neurons were frequently detected in the non-hippocampal sclerosis group. Conclusions: The PSA-NCAM and NeuN co-stained immature neurons were located in the hilus of human temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the ability of neurogenesis was found to be higher in the non-hippocampal sclerosis group than in the hippocampal sclerosis group.

Loeb ( 1 Department of Nuerology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI ; 2 Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics ; 3 Department of Pediatrics ; and 4 Department of Pathology ) Rationale: Cortical malformations are one of the most common causes of medically intractable epilepsy. One of the more common malformations is polymicrogyria (PMG), where up to 80% of patients have epilepsy. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this high incidence of epilepsy are not known, nor is it known if epileptic regions of neocortex differ between patients with PMG and patients with non-lesional neocortical epilepsy. Recently, we used a functional genomic strategy to identify a small group of activity-depdnent genes are induced in neocortical epileptic foci, regardless of the underlying cause. Here, we hypothesize that both common and as well as unique patterns of gene expression can be identified in children with PMG compared to patients with non-lesional neocortical epilepsy. Localization of these induced genes can identify neuronal populations involved human epilepsy associated with malformations. Methods: Electrically mapped neocortical tissue was obtained from 8 children with intractable epilepsy (4 with PMG, and 4 with gliosis) who underwent a two-stage surgical resection. The seizure onset region and a nearby area without spontaneous epileptiform activity as a ?control? were compared by histology, real-time qPCR, and Agilent genome wide microarrays. Genes identified as differentially expressed were characterized further by in situ hybridization to identify populations of activated neurons. Results: Despite a marked difference in tissue histology between PMG patients and those with gliosis, there was a remarkably similar pattern of gene induction at regions of seizure onset and maximal interictal spiking. Patients without malformations expressed these activity-dependent genes predominantly in normal-appearing layers II-IV pyramidal neurons. In patients with PMG, these same genes were also restricted to layer II-IV neurons, in highly epileptic regions directly adjacent to thickened layer I regions in the polymicrogyri. In addition to common gene expression changes, we also identified genes uniquely altered in PMG neocortex that could underlie some of the morphollgical features of this malformation. Conclusions: Results genomic studies of PMG suggest that similar molecular pathways are activated in PMG as in other non-lesional forms of neocortical epilepsy, however, the expression of some of these activity-dependent genes in PMG localize to neurons directly adjacent to malformations. In addition, there are unique patterns of gene expression in PMG that are likely to relate directly to the malformation. (Supported by: 1. NIH NINDS R01 NS45207.; 2.

Talos, 2 Joseph R. Madsen, 2 Peter M. Black, and 1 Frances E. Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: The most common neurological symptom of human neocortical dysplasias is early-life epilepsy, including infantile spasms. Frequently, these patients develop pharmaco-resistant seizure disorders, which require surgical excision. The exact mechanisms of epileptogenesis and high incidence of pharmaco-resistance to conventional antiepileptic drugs (AED) in cortical dysplasias are poorly understood. GABA receptors (GABARs), which are normally hyperpolarizing, can become depolarizing under certain circumstances and actually increase neuronal excitation. This depends on the intracellular chloride concentration, regulated by the chloride-importer NKCC1 and the chloride-exporter KCC2. Increased NKCC1 and decreased KCC2 expression in hippocampal subiculum from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients renders GABARs depolarizing (PNAS 103:8465;2006). We hypothesized that similar to TLE, neurons from neocortical dysplastic tissue would demonstrate higher NKCC1 expression and lower KCC2 levels relative to control neurons, a profile consistent with the presence of depolarizing GABARs. Methods: Cortical tissue from 6 patients ages 1?6 years were obtained during brain surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy. In all cases, malformations of cortical development were confirmed by histopathological examination (tuberous sclerosis, n = 3; focal cortical dysplasia, n = 2; hemimegalencephaly, n = 1). Age-matched autopsy cortical samples from cases with normal neurologic history were used as controls (n = 4). Tissue was collected and handled in accordance with the Clinical Research Committee at Children's Hospital, Boston. 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue blocks were cut at 50 microns and immunohistochemically double labeled with cell markers (NeuN, non-phosphorylated neurofilament, vimentin, GFAP) in combination with transporter antibodies NKCC1 (1:100, Chemicon) and KCC2 (1:500, Upstate). Results: Staining of dysplastic tissue with neuronal and glial markers demonstrated loss of cortical lamination, the presence of disoriented, misshaped neurons, an increase in number of white matter neurons and a variable degree of gliosis. In addition, in cortical tubers and hemimegalencephaly tissue, cytomegalic dysplastic neurons could be easily identified. In all cases, increased NKCC1 expression associated with a moderate decrease in KCC2 levels was observed in most normal-size and cytomegalic dysplastic neurons, compared to controls. Notably, strong NKCC1 immunoreactivity was observed in glial cell population as well. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an imbalance in neuronal NKCC1 and KCC2 expression (increased NKCC1: KCC2 ratio) in human neocortical dysplasias that may render GABARs depolarizing. This mechanism may play a critical role in increased seizure susceptibility and relative refractoriness to GABAR agonists in these patients.

Najm ( 1 Department of Neurology, Section of Adult Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method often used for the assessment of patients with epilepsy. More than a quarter of patients who present with drug-resistant epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia (CD) show no MRI abnormalities. The role of differential expression of glutamate receptors as a substrate for hyperexcitability in epilepsy has been shown. We intended to develop a non-invasive and sensitive imaging technique to be used with specific biomarkers for epileptic tissue. Methods: Anti-NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) antibody (Chemicon AB1516) was labeled with Gd-DOTA (NR1/Gd-DOTA) using an activated carboxyl to create an amide coupling. In a first study, ex vivo human brain slice tissue was maintained alive immediately following surgical resection, and optimized T1-weighted MRI was acquired using a 9.4T MRI scanner. Following baseline MRI, each tissue was treated with NR1/Gd-DOTA or NR1 without Gd-DOTA for two hours and washed for one hour to remove non-specific binding. In a second study, MRI (7.0T) was acquired before and after ex vivo live rat brain slices were treated with NR1/Gd-DOTA or control treatments (vehicle only, Gd-DOTA only or anti-NR1 only). Additional 3-hour washing followed by MRI was conducted in order to verify signal variation over time. Results: The first study (Figure) demonstrated that optimized high-field MRI and antibody-based MRI probes can be used to non-invasively detect cell receptors within freshly resected brain tissue. The second study validated that MRI contrast was due to specific binding of the labeled antibody to cell receptors. Fading in the signal detected after additional washing revealed a temporal dependence on the amount of antibody probe bound to tissue slices. Conclusions: Our preliminary data show that NR1 protein can be detected in freshly harvested human and rat brain tissue samples using high field MRI techniques. The development and application of new antibody-based MRI probes that can be selectively detected and quantified will provide a new platform technology for visualizing molecular substrates of epileptogenic brain areas and other pathologies.

Saskia Van Der Hel, 2 Peter C. Van Rijen, 2 Cees W.M. Van Veelen, and 1 Pierre N.E. De Graan ( 1 Pharmacology and Anatomy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ; and 2 Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate have been linked to the initiation and maintenance of seizures in patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Impairment of the glutamate-glutamine cycle, responsible for the inactivation and recycling of extracellular glutamate, has been implicated.One of the key neuronal components of this cycle is the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT), which mediates the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Three types of VGLUTs have been identified so far. VGLUT1 is the major type in the hippocampus. Little is known about VGLUT expression in the human hippocampus. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in VGLUT expression in the hippocampus of patients with TLE. Methods: We examined the hippocampal distribution of the VGLUT subtypes by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation in 7 ?m paraffin sections. Protein levels were assessed by semi-quantitative western blotting. Measurements were performed in hippocampal biopsies obtained during surgical resection as treatment for TLE. Comparisons were made between hippocampi of TLE patients with (HS group) and without hippocampal sclerosis (nonHS group) and autopsy controls without neurological symptoms. Results: VGLUT1 immunoreactivity (IR) showed a diffuse neuropil staining of the subiculum, the pyramidal cell layer of all CA fields, the hilus, and the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Large punctate structures around neuronal cell bodies and axons were observed in CA4 and CA3. No IR was detected in cell bodies. VGLUT1 mRNA was abundant in granule cells and pyramidal neurons. In nonHS and HS hippocampi VGLUT1 mRNA levels were decreased compared to controls, especially in areas with neuron loss. However, VGLUT1 protein levels were significantly increased in the nonHS hippocampus compared to both the HS and control hippocampus. This upregulation indicates translational regulation within hippocampal neurons. In addition, VGLUT1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in the DG of the HS hippocampus, consistant with the increased number of mossy fiber synapses onto granule cells due to mossy fiber sprouting. VGLUT2 IR was very weak in controls, but it was upregulated in the molecular layer of the DG in TLE patients. In the nonHS group VGLUT2 IR was only found in the outer molecular layer, whereas in the HS group VGLUT2 was also present in the inner molecular layer. These data indicate an upregulation of VGLUT2 associated with mossy fiber sprouting. Conclusions: Hippocampal mRNA expression of VGLUT1 is decreased and correlates with loss of glutamatergic synapses due to neuron loss. The increase in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 protein found in TLE patients is most likely due to new glutamatergic synapse formation. This increase in glutamatergic signalling may contribute to the progression and pathology of TLE. 1 Jie Wu, 1 Jamie DeChon, 2 Nasim Bahadorani, 3 Harold Rekate, 1 John F. Kerrigan, and 2 Yongchang Chang ( 1 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Neurobiology, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Barrow Neurological Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: Human hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are associated with precocious puberty, gelastic seizures and severe refractory epilepsy. Emerging evidence suggests that the HH itself plays a pivotal role in this syndrome. ?-aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in modulation of fast inhibition through GABAA receptors. Abnormal GABAA receptor function is an important mechanism of epileptogenesis in various types of human epilepsy and animal epileptic models. However, it is unknown whether functional GABAA receptors are natively expressed in HH neurons ? and if so, what are the functional, pharmacological and molecular properties of these receptors. Methods: Acutely enzymatic/mechanical dissociation of HH neurons was performed. Fresh resected HH tissues were immediately placed in ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM): 136.7 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.1 NaH2PO4, 9.84 HEPES, 16.6 glucose and 21.9 sucrose. After incubation at 22 ± 1 °C for at least 1 h, tissue sections were treated with papain (4?6 mg/ml at 31 °C for 50?60 min), and then one tissue fragment was mechanically dissociated. Isolated single HH cells usually maintained function for 2?6 h. Perforated patch-clamp whole-cell recording combined with U-tube drug application was applied to characterize function and pharmacology of GABAA receptors. Results: Under perforated patch-clamp recording in voltage-clamp mode, GABA induced an inward current (IGABA) at a holding potential of ?50 mV. The IGABA was mimicked by a GABAA receptor agonist (muscimol) and blocked by GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline), suggesting that the IGABA was mainly mediated through the activation of the GABAA receptor. The concentration-response relationship curve of IGABA showed that the EC50 and Hill coefficient were 1.3 mM and 0.9, respectively. The current-voltage relationship current was linear at a reversal potential close to zero with a symmetric external and internal chloride concentration. HH neurons exhibited heterogeneity for allosteric modulations. Although most HH neurons presented an enhancement of IGABA by pentobarbital and pregnenalone, only ?60% of neurons showed potentiation of IGABA by diazepam. RT-PCR showed normal GABAA receptor subunit expression in HH tissues. Conclusions: We are the first to describe the functional, pharmacological and molecular properties of the GABAA receptor expressed in human HH. An understanding of functional GABAA receptors in HH neurons provides new insights into the epileptogenesis of gelastic seizures.

Levine, and 1 Carlos Cepeda ( 1 Mental Retardation Research Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA ; 2 Department of Neuropathology ; and 3 Division of Neurosurgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in TSC genes that encode hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2). These proteins affect cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation in multiple organs, including the brain. In particular, it has been suggested that these proteins may represent growth suppressors. Epilepsy is one of the major complications of TSC and affects about 85% of patients. TSC shares histopathologic similarities with severe forms of focal cortical dysplasia (CD), specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. Methods: In this study we examined the morphological and electrophysiological properties of cells in cortical tissue samples from pediatric cases with TSC (n = 11, ages 1.8?10.1 yr) or severe CD (n = 15, ages 0.2?14 yr), that underwent surgery for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Normal- and abnormal-appearing cells in slices were identified morphologically by infrared videomicroscopy and biocytin labeling (n = 72 in TSC and n = 151 in severe CD). Electrophysiological membrane properties were assessed with whole-cell patch clamp recordings in current and voltage clamp modes. Results: In both TSC and severe CD cases, abnormal-appearing cells were observed in the cortical mantle and classified into four principal groups. The first consisted of very large, pyramidal-shaped cells corresponding to cytomegalic neurons. The second group included large, non-pyramidal cells with atypical somatodendritic morphology that correspond to balloon cells. The third group included misoriented and dysmorphic pyramidal neurons, and the fourth consisted of immature-looking pyramidal cells. Morphologically, abnormal cells from TSC and severe CD cases were very similar. Electrophysiologically, the most abnormal properties were found in cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. Cytomegalic neurons were hyperexcitable, whereas balloon cells had no active inward currents and lacked synaptic inputs. Balloon cells were found more frequently in TSC cases, whereas cytomegalic pyramidal neurons occurred more frequently in severe CD cases. Conclusions: Besides the frequency of occurrence, there were no clear morphological or electrophysiological differences in cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells from TSC and CD patients, suggesting a link between the lesions produced by TSC gene mutations and the cellular alterations observed in severe forms of CD. (Supported by NIH NS38992.) 1 Andreas V. Alexopoulos, 1 Cristiane Q. Tilelli, 1 Roger Oghlakian, and 1 Imad M. Najm ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) was recently identified as the specific binding site for levetiracetam in the brain and as a promising target for drug development. We have previously reported the differential expression of SV2A in the neocortex of patients with cortical dysplasia (CD)-associated pharmacoresistant epilepsy (Alexopoulos et al., Epilepsia 46 Suppl. 8:273, 2005). The objective of this study is to investigate the expression of the same protein in a well-characterized animal model of CD. Methods: Sprague-Dawley time-pregnant rats received 145cGy whole body irradiation at embryonic day 17, resulting in pups with multifocal hippocampal (HIP) and cortical abnormalities. These animals exhibit recurrent, spontaneous seizures following ?a second hit? in the form of a single dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ 30 mg/kg i.p.; postnatal day 60). Occurrence of seizures was confirmed by video-EEG and behavioral monitoring. Age-matched, nonirradiated controls received the same subconvulsive dose of PTZ. Video-EEG recordings were obtained for 1 month before and after PTZ injection in all animals. Brains were examined using Cresyl Violet and immunostaining for SV2A and neuron-specific nuclear protein. Results: Irradiated rats (n = 8), but not control rats (n = 3) developed spontaneous behavioral and electrographic seizures following PTZ (?second hit?), characterized by extended periods of arrest, facial or forelimb clonus and occasionally rearing and falling. Immunocytochemical (ICC) analysis in the cortex and HIP of non-irradiated controls showed SV2A to be localized in regions surrounding cell bodies. Punctate staining was observed in HIP areas occupied by mossy fiber terminals. Histological examination of stained slices of irradiated animals confirmed the presence of multifocal CD and neuronal dispersion in HIP. ICC analysis of irradiated epileptic animals displayed a redistribution of the SV2A protein from the cell bodies to the neuropil (figure 1). SV2A in HIP of irradiated rats occupied the area of the hilus and apical dendrites in the dentate gyrus and cornus ammonis. Conclusions: The differential changes in SV2A immunoreactivity following recurrent seizures in dysplastic but not control animals are reminiscent of those observed in human epileptic and dysplastic tissue. Further studies will examine the influence of seizures in the SV2A redistribution, and its potential role in the expression of epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance.

Edward Dudek ( 1 Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Animal models of chronic epilepsy with spontaneous seizures may be useful for antiepileptic (AED) drug development. Convenient and effective methods for testing potential AEDs over days and weeks should facilitate many experiments. This study investigated the effect of carbamazepine (CBZ) administered in food pellets on rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Methods: Adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley; 150?250 g) were given repeated low-dose kainate treatment (5 mg/kg ip hourly until convulsive status epilepticus persisted >3 h). Food pellets with CBZ were provided (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day) in three 2-week trials (n = 7?9 rats) involving 5 days of CBZ or control treatment, separated by 2 recovery days. The total amount of food provided corresponded to normal caloric diet of 60 gm/kg/day. Results: All animals consumed the entire daily drug-in-food dose intermittently but continuously throughout the 24-h day. CBZ significantly reduced mean seizure frequency in a dose-dependent manner. At 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, CBZ treatment consistently failed to block all motor seizures, but no motor seizures were observed in any of the rats at 300 mg/kg/day. Conclusions: This AED-in-food protocol appears to be an effective means of chronic drug administration. When administered over 5-day periods, CBZ reduced the frequency of spontaneous motor seizures in a dose-dependent manner, but very high doses were required to block all motor seizures. The effects on electrographic seizures remain to be determined. (Supported by NS 049620 (FED).) 1 Michael R. Kasten, 1 Sanghoon Lee, and 1 Matthew P. Anderson ( 1 Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Recent studies have found epilepsy-associated mutations in non-ion channel genes. LGI1, a secreted protein of unknown function, was found to be mutated in patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). To investigate the functional effects of this protein on native neural circuits, we developed methods to study wild-type and mutant LGI1 protein in living brain tissue. Methods: Transgenic mice were created using a full-length LGI1 gene engineered to contain the epilepsy-associated LGI1 gene mutations. We also created transgenic mice using the wild-type, full-length LGI1 gene. In order to measure the effect of this mutant protein on neuron excitability and synaptic communication, we prepared acute brain slices from adult LGI1 transgenic and control mice and compared the electrophysiological properties of individual neurons. Because ADLTE is characterized by auditory hallucinations during seizures, we studied neurons in a second order thalamic nucleus that relays auditory sensation to the cortex, the dorsal medial geniculate nucleus (DMGn). Results: Mutant LGI1 transgene increased the intrinsic excitability of DMGn thalamic neurons. Mutant LGI1 transgene also increased phosphorylation of a number of protein kinases. Conclusions: These findings support our current hypothesis that mutant LGI1 causes epilepsy through a unique mechanism involving altered signal transduction.

Scammell, 1 Donald L. Schomer, and 1 Matthew P. Anderson ( 1 Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) with auditory features were recently found to harbor mutations in the non-ion channel protein LGI1. To determine if mutations of this protein are sufficient to produce epilepsy, we created a transgenic mouse from the full-length LGI1 gene engineered to contain an epilepsy-associated gene mutation. As a control, other transgenic mice were also created that carry extra copies of the wild-type, full-length LGI1 gene. We predicted that ADLTE mutant LGI1 will produce epilepsy in mice. Methods: Mice of each genotype were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes for polysomnogram recording. After > 9 days of recovery from surgery, they were transferred to recording cages in a sound-attenuated chamber with a 12 hr light/dark (LD) cycle (30 lux; lights on at 7:00 A.M. and off at 7:00 P.M.) and a constant temperature (22?24°C) for 5 days of continuous recording. Video recordings were also performed during the last day in a subset of mice. The signals were digitally filtered (EEG, 0.3?30 Hz; EMG, 2?100 Hz) and semi-automatically scored in 10 sec epochs as wake, NREM sleep, REM sleep, or seizures. Sleep analyses were focused on the last recording day. The preliminary scoring was visually inspected and corrected when appropriate. Results: Mutant LGI1 transgenic (n = 5), full-length LGI1 transgenic (n = 4), and wild-type littermate (n = 5) mice showed no significant differences in the hourly amounts of NREM, REM, or wakefulness. Seizures induced by pentylene-tetrazol (60 mg/kg, i.p.) were also examined. Conclusions: ADLTE mutant LGI1 transgene does not significantly influence the pattern of sleep. We are currently testing the hypothesis that mutant LGI1 is sufficient to cause epilepsy.

Aujla, 2 Michael Fetell, and 1 Frances Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 2 IVAX Pharmaceuticals, Key Biscayne, FL ) Rationale: Hypoxic encephalopathy is a major cause of neonatal seizures, and can lead to long term neurologic deficit and epilepsy. Neonatal seizures can be refractory to conventional AED medication. AMPARs are overexpressed on cortical neurons in the neonatal rat and term human, when the susceptibility to hypoxic seizures is highest (J. Comp. Neur. 2006; 497:42). We have shown that the AMPA subtype of neuronal glutamate receptors in cortex and hippocampus play a critical epileptogenic role in a rodent model of neonatal seizures (J. Neurosci. 2005; 25:3442), and AMPAR antagonists such as NBQX and topiramate effectively suppress the acute and long term epileptogenic effects of hypoxia in the perinatal rodent (Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50:366; Epilepsia 2004; 45:569). Here we evaluated the efficacy of talampanel (GYKI-53773), a novel orally-available non-competitive AMPAR antagonist in our rodent model. Methods: P10 rat pups were exposed to global hypoxia per our previous protocols (J. Neurosci. 2001; 21:8154). Rats were pretreated i.p. with talampanel or vehicle 30 minutes prior to hypoxia and seizure time and severity were recorded by videotape and scored blinded. A second outcome measure was evaluated by assessing susceptibility of rats to KA-induced seizures 20 days (P30) after they were exposed to hypoxia. KA was administered i.p. (10 mg/kg) and seizure activity was recorded over a 3-hour period. Rats given KA on P30 were killed on P33 by transcardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Each brain was removed, postfixed, cyroprotected in 20% sucrose overnight, and mounted onto a freezing microtome. To quantify DNA fragmentation, counts of positively stained cells per 12,500?m2 in CA1, CA3 and amygdala were made as previously described (Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50:366). Results: Acute hypoxia-induced seizures at P10 were suppressed by talampanel in a dose-related manner. Anticonvulsant activity was maximal at 7.5 and 10 mg/kg, where seizures were blocked 74.6% at 10 mg/kg (25.4 ± 7.3, n = 17; p < 0.001) and 86.7% at 7.5 mg/kg (13.3 ± 3.2, n = 17; p < 0.001). Rats pretreated with vehicle prior to hypoxia showed significantly more neuronal injury in amygdala following KA-induced seizure at P30 than did nonhypoxic controls or rats pretreated with talampanel (7.5 and 10 mg/kg) prior to hypoxia at P10 (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). Conclusions: Talampanel exhibited a dose-dependent effect on hypoxia-induced hypoxic seizures in the immature rat. Futhermore, acute talampanel treatment during hypoxia protected the rats from later life increases in seizure susceptibility that are observed in vehicle treated hypoxic controls. These data suggest talampanel may have clinical potential in the treatment of neonatal seizures.

PPARα activation by fenofibrate can protect cerebral injury by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study, we tested PPARα activation on the cerebral excitability before study its potent neuroprotective effects in status epilepticus. Methods: Wistar rats (280g-320g) were separated in two groups (n = 8). Sham group (Sh) received a complete powder diet ad libidum, while experimental group (F) received powder diet containing 0.2% fenofibrate. After 14 days of treatment, pentylenetetrazole threshold (PTZth) was used to assess anti-convulsive effect. PTZ was dissolved in a saline solution (10 mg/ml) and was infused i.v. at 5 ml/h. Two threshold doses (mg/kg) were studied: the first bilateral forelimb myoclonus and the start of generalized seizure. Liver weights were recorded in each animal to assess that fenofibrate was pharmacologically active. All values are given as mean ± sem. Results: Rats receiving diet with 0.2% Fenofibrate had an increase of liver weight (liver weight/body weight): 0.063 ± 0.004 versus 0.036 ± 0.002 (p = 0.001). Myoclonic and seizure PTZ thresholds were increased in F group in comparison to Sh group: myoclonic PTZth were 40.85 ± 3.06 mg/kg in F group vs. 34.28 ± 1.26 mg/kg (Sh) (p = 0.028); seizure PTZth were 46.85 ± 3.58 mg/kg in F group vs. 37.29 ± 1.8 mg/kg (Sh) (p = 0.021). Conclusions: A treatment with 0.2% fenofibrate significantly increases myoclonic and seizure PTZ thresholds suggesting anticonvulsive proprieties. The role of PPAR activation in brain excitability should be investigated.

Miller ( 1 Pediatrics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: We used the rat in utero radiation model of cortical dysplasia (CD), which is characterized postnatally (P) by neuronal dyslaminations, polarity disorientations, and daily increases in cortical thickness. At P30 these rats may exhibit cortical seizures from the region of the permanent CD. Because the CD is present at birth and increases daily in size with the growth of neurons and dendrites, we hypothesized that a permanent increase in NMDA receptor densities may develop early in the first week to enhance CD neurons' excitability. Methods: Dams were radiated with 145 Rads (cGy) at embryonic day 17 (E17), their offspring were studied at 24 hour intervals, postnatal ages P0?10 and P21?36. The development of CDs measured neuron sizes and neuron densities in cortical layers II-V. Densities were compared to age matched controls using stereology. In siblings, expressions of NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B were measured by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Statistics between control and radiated age matched pups were made between treatments and across ages. Results: Daily increases in neuron sizes were found from P0 through P10 in both groups, and after that there were no greater cytoplasmic increases in either group. At P0 and P1 nearly all neurons were spherical or oval in shape, lacking dendritic processes. At P2 neurons developed larger cytoplasms and larger proximal dendrites, which gave the neurons a pyramidal shape in all cortical layers. Growth of dendritic and axonal processes began at P2 and continued after P10. The expression levels for NR1 and NR2B at P0 and P1 were low, but increased significantly by P2; however, this increase plateaued after P2 and through P10. It is important to note that these developmental patterns were the same for both radiated and nonradiated pups. Conclusions: We used the rat in utero radiation model to identify postnatal malformations of cortical neurons and their NMDA receptor subunit expressions. During the earliest postnatal period, P0-P10 the cortex is expanding with increasing neuron sizes and neuritic outgrowths. Only P0 and P1 had significantly immature neurogenesis, with small, round neurons lacking dendrites and having the lowest NMDA receptor expressions. At P2-P10 neuron sizes and dendritic lengths increased. Also, at P2 NMDA expressions were maximal, and neither NR1 nor NR2B expressions increased on subsequent days. These developmental patterns in neurons and receptors were the same for control and radiated rats that always had permanent CD starting at birth. Hence, the later (P30) process of epilepsy likely occurs when all the axo-dendritic synapses, including aberrant excitatory connections within the CD, are fully mature.

Michalopoulos, 4Cristian Achim, and 1,2,3 Elizabeth M. Powell ( 1 Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: Inhibitory neurotransmission functions in neural circuits by repressing of excitatory output. Local GABAergic interneurons are the main source of inhibition in the cerebral cortex. Loss of these neurons leads to epilepsy along with other neurological disorders. Interneuron development is tightly regulated by molecular cues including hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). HGF/SF signals via its receptor MET to promote cellular survival, differentiation, mitogenesis and migration dependent upon cellular context. HGF/SF, which is secreted as a single chain precursor form, must be cleaved for biological function by serine proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). uPAR, the receptor of uPA, efficiently increases the protease cleavage by uPA. Adult uPAR?/? mice have decreased numbers of neocortical GABAergic interneurons and severe behavioral dysfunction such as spontaneously generated seizure and increased susceptibility to PTZ(pentylenetretrazol)-induced seizures. These defects of GABAergic interneurons have been attributed to a reduction of HGF/SF. Methods: The uPAR?/? mouse was bred with transgenic mouse overexpressing HGF/SF under the astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (GFAP). Immunohistochemistry and seizure behaviors to PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) were used to evaluate anatomical and functional recovery of GABAergic interneuron in wildtype, GFAP-Hgf, uPAR?/?, and uPAR?/?:GFAP-Hgf mice. Results: The loss of interneurons in the uPAR?/? mouse is restored in uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse, in which the uPAR?/? mouse was bred with an HGF-overexpressing mouse line (GFAP-HGF). Reduction of PV(parvalbumin), a marker of GABAergic neuron, in the uPAR?/? mouse is rescued in uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse (Figure 1). The seizure susceptibility to PTZ of uPAR?/? mice is decreased in the uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse, to frequencies and severity observed in wildtype animals. The latency to seizure activity after PTZ treatment is also increased in the uPAR?/?xGFAP-Hgf mouse as compared to uPAR?/? mouse. Conclusions: These data suggest that restoring HGF/SF levels can recover the anatomical interneuron defects and neocortical circuitry, leading to prevention of the seizure activity of uPAR?/? mice. This study will help uncover molecular mechanisms critical for seizure onset and their possible therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

Beachy ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT and 2 Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 1- 2/1000 live births. Approximately 40% of the infants with HIE and neonatal seizures develop epilepsy by 4 years of age. The Levine rat pup model of hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) insult is a well characterized model of HIE. Recently, it has been reported that 40% of rat pups exposed to H/I insult at 7 days of age exhibit spontaneous seizures by 6 months of age (Epilepsia 2004; 45(10):1210?1218). We hypothesize that a H/I insult will alter seizure threshold and, thus, predispose the rat to the development of spontaneous seizure activity. Methods: Seven day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were anesthetized with isoflurane and subjected to right carotid artery ligation. After recovery, the pups were returned to their dams for 2 hours. Pups were then exposed to 8% oxygen/92% nitrogen for 2 hours. Temperature was maintained at 34.5?36°C. Convulsive current curves for clonic (forebrain) and tonic (hindbrain) seizures were generated at 1 and 2 months after H/I insult and compared to those obtained from age- and sex-matched naive control rats (> 25 rats per treatment group). Data were compared using Probit analysis (Minitab statistical software program). Results: Data for each seizure type is presented as CC50, the current at which 50% of the rats exhibited seizures ± standard error. A decrease in CC50 suggests increased seizure susceptibility. In naive male rats, CC50 significantly increased over time. Female naive rats had significantly deceased CC50 at 2 months of age (clonic 18.2 ± 0.4 mA, tonic 29.2 ± 0.9 mA) when compared to male naive rats (clonic 27.3 ± 0.9 mA, tonic 52.6 ± 1.4 mA). When compared to naive female rats, the CC50 for clonic seizures in female rats was significantly decreased (p = 0.005) at 1 month post H/I insult but increased at 2 months (p = 0.001). CC50 for tonic seizures in female naive and H/I rats did not differ. Male rats exhibited increased CC50 for tonic seizures (p = 0.007) at 1 month (35.5 ± 1.2 mA) and 2 months (61.6 ± 1.7 mA) when compared to naive male rats (28.3 ± 1.7 mA and 52.6 ± 1.4 mA, respectively). Conclusions: Alteration in seizure susceptibility is dependent on sex and time after H/I insult. Female rat pups exhibited enhanced clonic (forebrain) seizure susceptibility at 1 month after H/I insult but deceased susceptibility 2 months after insult. Interestingly, H/I insult in male rats decreased tonic seizure susceptibilty at 1 and 2 months after insult. Thus, H/I insult does not appear to consistently increase seizure susceptibility as evaluted by the MES method. Based on these results, it would appear that electrical population seizure threshold testing is not predictive of long-term outcome (e.g. spontaneous seizure activity).

Cole, and 1 Fei Zhu ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA ; and 2 Epilepsy Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: We sought to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TcES) via concentric ring electrodes on ictal electrographic and behavioral activity and mortality in rats with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (290?330 g) were briefly anesthetized and 3 concentric ring electrodes were afixed to their scalps one day before the experiment. Scopolamine methylnitrate (2 mg/kg i.p.) was given 30 minutes prior to pilocarpine. Pilocarpine HCl (310 mg/kg i.p) was given to cause long lasting SE. Laplacian EEG was recorded from tri-polar concentric electrodes on the scalp. TcES was applied 5 minutes after the onset of SE. Time-frequency analysis was performed on the Laplacian EEG signals to compare the electrographic activity before and after the application of TcES. Behavior was monitored by inspection. Survival was assayed at 24 h after administration of pilocarpine. Results: Control rats (n = 8) followed the classic electrographic stages of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus described by Treimen (1987) and expired on average 15 hours after the pilocarpine injection. TcES-treated rats (n = 8) lived significantly longer (p = 0.013, Two-Sample t-Test), which were euthanized on average at 48 hours. Twenty-four hours after the pilocarpine injection, six (75%) TcES-treated rats versus one (12.5%) control rat were alive (p = 0.041, Mann-Whitney U test). Both electrographic and behavioral manifestations of seizure activity were reduced or abolished after the application of TcES. All surviving TcES-treated rats recovered to baseline activity, including eating and drinking. By contrast, none of the control rats ate or drank after they entered SE. The time-frequency analysis showed evident differences before and after TcES. Conclusions: The application of TcES increased survival of rats with pilocarpine-induced SE. Positive TcES effects on electrographic and behavioral manifestations of seizure activity were significant and persistent. TcES may represent a novel and effective early treatment for SE.

Cavazos ( 1 Neurology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX ) Rationale: Early life status epilepticus is detrimental to the behavioral and cognitive development in childhood and increases the risk to develop epilepsy in later life. Recurrent seizures during the first two weeks of life in rats induce limited neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Holmes et. al., 1999; Cilio et. al., 2003). These neurobiological alterations enhance the degree of neuronal injury and the duration of status epilepticus experienced after a second excitotoxic injury later in life (Koh et al., 1999; Schmid et al., 1999). The present study examines the frequency of late spontaneous seizures one year after early life kainic acid induced status epilepticus. Methods: Kainic acid was administered in age specific doses for the following experiments. On postnatal day (P) 15, kainic acid was administered to induce convulsive status epilepticus and control rats received equal volumes of saline. On P45, half of rats from each group received kainic acid induced status epilepticus. Status Epilepticus was monitored for 6 hours and behavioral seizures were scored using a previously described scale. These four groups were allowed to mature for 1 year and then underwent surgical implantation of bipolar hippocampal electrodes to monitor the occurrence of late onset spontaneous seizures. Rats were then monitored for 8 hours to determine the frequency of late onset spontaneous seizures. After rats were monitored they were perfused with sodium sulphide and paraformaldehyde/gluteraldehyde for histological examination with Timm's reagent and Cresyl Violet. Results: After one year of maturation, rats that received kainic acid or saline on P15, did not demonstrate late onset spontaneous seizures over several 8 hour monitoring sessions, however mossy fiber sprouting was detected in the oriens of the CA3b region. Rats that receive saline on P15 and kainic acid on P45 developed late onset spontaneous seizures with an hourly seizure frequency of 0.22 ± 0.13 (mean ± SEM). This excitotoxic insult induced neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway into the dentate gyrus and CA3b regions. Rats that received a ?double hit? kainic acid on P15 and P45 developed severe late onset spontaneous seizures, with an hourly seizure frequency of 0.62 ± 0.31. These rats also developed widespread neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway into the dentate gyrus and the CA3b regions. Conclusions: Early life status epilepticus induced by kainic acid induces limited neuronal injury and synaptic reorganization in the CA3b region, which is not sufficient to initiate the process of epileptogenesis. However, alterations after early life seizures shift the neurobiology in a pro-epileptic direction that enhances the susceptibility to seizures and accelerates epileptogenesis after subsequent insults during adulthood. 1 Marion Czapp, 1 Jens P. Bankstahl, 2 Mark Helm, 3 Ulrich Massing, 3 Vittorio Ziroli, 4 Uta Huelsermann, 4 Gert Fricker, and 1 Heidrun Potschka ( 1 Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany ; 2 Department of Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany ; 3 Clinical Research, Clinic for Tumorbiology, Freiburg, Germany ; and 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Pharmacology, University of Heidelberg, Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany ) Rationale: Despite the launch of several new antiepileptic drugs (AED) during the last two decades pharmacoresistance of epilepsy remains an unsolved problem. It is hypothesized that local overexpression of multidrug transporters (MDT) in the epileptic tissue of pharmacoresistant individuals results in limited access of AED to the epileptic focus region. Downregulation of MDT by RNA interference (RNAi) would be a possible approach to overcome pharmacoresistance. Aim of the present study was to test if specific delivery of siRNA targeting the mRNA sequence of the major MDT P-glycoprotein (Pgp) to brain-capillary endothelial cells is possible. Methods: Liposomes were coupled with ApoE4 peptides which are discussed to mediate an uptake of liposomes into brain-capillary endothelial cells via LDL receptors. ApoE4-liposomes loaded with fluorescence-labelled siRNA targeting the rat Pgp mRNA sequence were administered i.v. to female Wistar rats. Distribution of siRNA was investigated at different time points (4, 10, 24 h) post administration by confocal microscopy in rat brain sections. Based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect the integrity of siRNA was controlled (siRNA was labelled with two fluorescent dyes). The influence of siRNA molecules on Pgp expression was evaluated 24 h post administration by immunhistochemistry and compared with control groups. Results: Fluorescence microscopy of rat brain sections after siRNA administration demonstrated a successful targeting to brain-capillary endothelial cells. An accumulation of labelled siRNA in the cells was obvious at all time points. The intensity of fluorescence increased from 4 to 24 h post administration. FRET analysis indicated that the siRNA was still intact 24 h following administration. Preliminary results of the immunhistochemical investigations gave evidence for a reduced Pgp expression in rats treated with siRNA in comparison with control groups. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that specific delivery of siRNA encapsulated in immunoliposomes to brain-capillary endothelial cells can be achieved. Thus, the study substantiates the suitability of this novel approach for siRNA delivery. Reduction of Pgp expression in brain-capillary endothelial cells will be investigated in further experiments to ensure that an RNAi-based downregulation of Pgp takes place and enhances AED efficacy in the amygdala kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

This study investigated whether VNS affects the threshold for provoking focal motor seizures using cortical electrical stimulation. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were implanted with a custommade cuff-electrode around the left vagus nerve. Stainless steel electrodes were bilaterally implanted on the rat motor cortex for stimulation and recording of EEG. Motor cortex stimulation (50 Hz, biphasic current pulses) with increasing amplitude (0 to max 2000 ?A) was performed. At the time of the first clinical seizure symptoms, the stimulation train was acutely aborted and the threshold intensity was determined by means of continuous video-EEG monitoring. The vagus nerve was stimulated for one hour with an intensity of 0,75 mA and a maximum duty cycle. For each rat, seizure thresholds (ST) were assessed before and immediately after VNS during 2 or 3 sessions on different days. Results: In 7/8 rats, ST increased after one hour of VNS. In 1/8 rat ST remained unchanged. In total, 21 sessions of VNS were performed in the 8 rats; for each session, ST were assessed at least 3 times before and 3 times after VNS. There was a significant increase (99% CI) of the ST after one hour of VNS (mean: 1424 ?A; SD: 315; range: 869?1999 ?A) compared to the baseline value (mean: 1077 ?A; SD: 244; range: 673?1754 ?A). Conclusions: In this study VNS significantly increased ST in a cortical stimulation model used for evaluating efficacy of antiepileptic treatment for motor seizures. These data indicate that VNS is capable of modulating cortical excitability. (Supported by V. De Herdt is supported by a grant (?aspirant?) from the FWO-Flanders.) 1 Stefanie M.

Human positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown altered GABAA receptor expression using flumazenil (FMZ), a ligand with a high affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR). Small animal PET, using serial scans in the same epileptic animal, is potentially a powerful technique to investigate the evolution and pathophysiolgical basis of these changes during epileptogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 2?-[18F]fluoroflumazenil ([18F]FFMZ) to study the GABAA/cBZR complex in rats utilizing small animal PET. Methods: In five male non-epileptic control rats (350?375 g), two serial dynamic PET scans were acquired under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia after bolus injection of [18F]FFMZ (66.6 ± 3.7 MBq). Six scans were acquired after injecting a tracer dose. In addition, a pre-saturation scan, consisting of a cold FMZ injection followed 10 min later by [18F]FFMZ, and two displacement studies (cold FMZ injection during the dynamic scan) were performed. PET/MRI co-registration was performed to delineate different regions of interest (whole brain, hippocampus, pons). Results: In the hippocampus, a structure with high GABAA/cBZR density, the signal intensity was higher (10%) than in the whole brain (p < 0.05) with no difference between left and right hippocampus. In the pons, which has low GABAA/cBZR density, the signal intensity was approximately 20% lower than in the whole brain (p < 0.01). Pre-saturation and displacement studies showed a high non-specific component in the measured signal, which may be due to recirculation of [18F]-fluoroethanol, a metabolite of [18F]FFMZ. [figure 1] Conclusions: This study has demonstrated differential uptake of [18F]FFMZ into key structures in the brain, with the highest activity in the hippocampus. However, significant non-specific activity in the brain will limit the ability to detect changes in GABAA/cBZR density during epileptogenesis and therefore alternative ligands need to be investigated. (Supported by the CRC for Biomedical Imaging Development.) 1,2 Karine Bressand, 1 Corine Roucard, and 2 Antoine Depaulis ( 1 Co, SynapCell, Grenoble, France ; and 2 INSERM, U704, Grenoble, France ) Rationale: The syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) represents a major challenge in the clinical management of focal seizures mainly due to drug refractoriness. Both morphological and electroclinical features of MTLE can be mimicked in the adult mice by a unilateral injection of kainic acid (KA) in the dorsal hippocampus. Neuronal loss in CA1, CA3 and hilus as well as gliosis and mossy fiber sprouting are observed in the injected side, as well as dispersion of the dentate gyrus, as observed in MTLE patients. In addition, recurrent focal hippocampal discharges occur two weeks after KA which share many similarities with human focal discharges. Whether these discharges are suppressed by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was addressed in this study where the effects of different classical AEDS were compared to a new AED: pregabalin. Methods: C57BL/6 adult mice were stereotaxically injected with KA (1 nmol in 50 nl) in the dorsal hippocampus and equipped with cortical and hippocampal electrodes. After 3 weeks, mice were injected with different doses of AEDs or vehicle in a random order and EEG recordings were performed for 20 min pre-injection and up to 120 min post-injection. Diazepam (0.5, 1, 2, 3 mg/kg) (n = 6), valproate (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) (n = 6), lamotrigine (30, 60, 90 mg/kg) (n = 7), carbamazepine (25, 50 mg/kg) (n = 12) and pregabalin (n = 8) (10, 50, 100 mg/kg) were injected i.p. Only animals with cell loss and dentate gyrus dispersion were used in the analysis. Cumulated durations of hippocampal discharges during 20 min periods were compared between the different drug conditions and versus vehicle using ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: Hippocampal discharges were suppressed in a dose-dependent way following diazepam (1, 2 and 3 mg/kg). Suppression of seizures was also observed with high doses of valproate (400 mg/kg) and lamotrigine (90 mg/kg) without dose-dependency and with occasional behavioral side-effects. No suppression was obtained following carbamazepine (25 and 50 mg/kg) and aggravation was observed after a low dose of lamotrigine (30 mg/kg). Pregabalin significantly suppressed hippocampal discharges in a dose-dependent way (50 and 100 mg/kg). Conclusions: Our study shows that besides benzodiazepines, only pregabalin suppresses focal discharges in a dose-dependent way in the kainate-mouse model of MTLE. On the contrary, classical AEDs were effective only at high doses (valproate, lamotrigine) or were without effects (carbamazepine). In addition to the histological, electrophysiological and behavioral features of this model, the resistance to classical AEDs suggest a form of drug-refractoriness often observed in human MTLE. Therefore this model fulfils most criteria for an efficient preclinical development of antiepileptic therapeutical strategies for MTLE. The suppressive effects of pregabalin suggest that this compound could be effective on human MTLE.

Willmore ( 1 Department of Psychiatry, Miyazaki Medical College, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan ; and 2 School of Medicine, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Kindling is a form of epileptogenesis that can be induced with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We undertook this study to evaluate the contribution of glutamate and GABA transporters in the process of PTZ kindling. Methods: Rats were kindled with PTZ (40 mg/kg) injected i.p. three times per week until two consecutive stage five seizures were observed. Experiment 1 Animals underwent pentobarbital anesthesia and decapitation at 24 hours (Group A) or at 30 days (Group B) after their last PTZ induced seizure. Rats in Group A and B were compared with each control rats (Group C and D). Experiment 2 We collected early-established animals (Group E) and kindling resistant animals (Group F). Early-established rats had consecutive stage five seizures with less than 5 injections of PTZ. Kindling resistant animals did not have fully kindled seizures by 12 injections of PTZ. Under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital brain tissue was collected at 30 days after the last PTZ injection. We used western blotting to measure the changes in hippocampal glutamate and GABA transporters in all animals. Results: GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAC-1 of Group A were elevated significantly compared with Group C. No change was found in any transporters of Group B compared with Group D. However, at 30 days (Group B) after their last PTZ induced seizure, animals had stage 5 seizure with PTZ. In early-established rats (Group E), levels of EAAC1 and GAT1 were decreased by 30% when compared to kindling resistant animals (Group F). In these animals, the level of GLT-1, GLAST and GAT3 equaled control. Conclusions: Activation of NMDA receptors is critical to the kindling process. Since all glutamate transporters were increased at 24 hours after establishing kindling with PTZ we considered this effect a response to seizure induced glutamate turnover. While animals remain kindled at the chronic phase, the lack of sustained changes in glutamate transporters suggest these proteins are not involved in the maintenance of epileptogenesis. We wonder if the glutamate and GABA transporters might be operant in the convulsion threshold set factor or as a pace factor for kindling.

The nucleus reuniens (RE) is the largest of the midline nuclei and major source of projections to the hippocampus. Afferent projections originate mainly from limbic structures. Immunocytochemical studies have revealed calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) immunoreactive neurons in the RE and 70% of CR-immunoreactive cells also showed CB-immunoreactivity. The present study was focused on distribution and dynamics of neuronal degeneration in the RE and on changes in CR-immunoreactivity within this nucleus in immature rats surviving up to one week after lithium-pilocarpine SE. Methods: Experiments were performed in Wistar rats 12, 15, 18, 21 and 25 days old. Lithium-pilocarpine model of SE was used. Only animals exhibiting convulsive SE were included in this study. Rats of all age groups were sacrificed 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours and 1 week after SE. Animals were deeply anesthetized with urethane (2.5 g/kg i.p) and perfused with 0.01 PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were postfixed and cryoprotected. Blocks of the brain were sectioned in a coronal plane (50 ?m), mounted on gelatin-coated slides and processed for FluoroJade B (FJB) histochemistry. Another group of 25-day-old animals surviving 1 week after SE was processed for localization of CR. To determine the CR-expressing cells the standard immunocytochemical techniques were used. Sections were observed under an epifluorescence microscope Olympus Provis AX 70 using FITC filter set. Results: Since P15 massive neuronal degeneration was evident in the RE. Damage was found in all age groups (P15, 18, 21, 25) and number of degenerated (FJB positive) neurons?increased with age of SE elicitation and with survival interval. Neuronal degeneration was evident in all parts of nucleus, but the majority of FJB-positive cells was in the rostral half of the RE. A significant decrease in number of CR-positive neurons was apparent in animals surviving 1 week. CR-reactive neurons were absent in the lateral portions of the RE, while the medial part of the nucleus exhibited a few of CR-positive cells. Conclusions: The reuniens nucleus belong among thalamic nuclei where massive neuronal degeneration was evident since P15. The number of degenerated neurons increased with age and survival time after SE. Significant decrease in number of CR-immunoreactive neurons indicate that calretinin has no neuroprotective effect within the reuniens nucleus.

Henshall ( 1 Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Prolonged seizures in adults can damage the hippocampus and cause epilepsy. However, the effects of prolonged seizures on the immature brain remain poorly understood. A small number of studies have suggested seizures in rats < P14 cause damage, however the date at which vulnerability emerges is contraversial. If these seizures were able to cause hippocampal sclerosis, a characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), this could have significant implications for seizure treatment and approaches to anti-epileptogenesis. Methods: We have developed a novel animal model in P10 Sprague-Dawley rat pups that provides the unique ability to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis following seizures in the developing brain. The model features early-life prolonged seizures, induced by intraamygdalar injection of kainic acid (KA), that trigger acute neuronal death in the hippocampus, leading to hippocampal sclerosis at adulthood. EEG was recorded both acutely and over a period of weeks at adulthood to confirm the presence of seizures. Results: Seizures were induced and hippocampal injury was then examined at various time points thereafter. Seizures induced largely unilateral hippocampal damage, affecting CA1 and CA3 regions. Western blot revealed that cell death was associated with activation of apoptotic pathways. By adulthood animals exhibited profound unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. Long-term EEG confirmed the presence of spontaneous seizures in these animals. Administration of a neuroprotectant FK506 during the initial seizures provided protection from hippocampal sclerosis at adulthood. Conclusions: We have successfully developed a novel model of unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and TLE in P10 rat pups. Using this model valuable insights may be gained into epileptogenesis in the developing brain and provide targets for anti-epileptogenic treatments.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ) Rationale: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide and its characteristics are a predisposition to recurrent unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal hypersynchronous discharges of neurons. Through experimental modelling and clinical neuroimaging it has been shown that seizures are capable of causing neuronal death and this may contribute to epileptogenesis, impairments in cognitive function or the epilepsy phenotype. Neuronal death in this setting is, at least in part, due to the induction of the molecular machinery of apoptosis. Studies using clinical material from patients who suffer recurrent seizures and animal epilepsy models have confirmed changes in expression and activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the caspase and Bcl-2 protein family. Another consistently up-regulated pro-apoptotic protein in seizure models is the tumour suppressor protein p53. Recently a new p53 up-regulated target gene has been identified named PUMA. PUMA, a BH3-only protein, is one of the most potent pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family which is also expressed in the central nervous system. In this study we examine the role of PUMA in seizure-induced neuronal death using PUMA knock-out mice. Methods: Seizures were focally evoked in adult C57Bl/6 mice by unilateral stereotaxic microinjection of kainic acid into the basolateral amygdala nucleus. The EEG was continuously monitored until lorazepam was administered to terminate seizures after 40 minutes. For Western blotting, samples were homogenized in lysis buffer and loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel. For immunohistochemical analysis, coronal brain sections were stained with NeuN and analysis of cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation was performed using fluorescein-linked TUNEL. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Fisher's paired least significant difference test as appropriate. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Results: In C57Bl/6 wild-type mice, p53 and PUMA were up-regulated in the hippocampus shortly after seizure induction. Assessment of the phenotype of PUMA knock-out mice revealed normal numbers of hippocampal and amygdala neurons, and normal expression of the kainate receptor in the amygdala and hippocampal site of seizure elicitation. Seizures elicited by intra-amygdala kainate were of similar frequency and severity in the PUMA knock out mice. However, neuropathological analysis revealed neuron survival was significantly greater in PUMA knock-out mice than in wild-type mice and TUNEL counts were significantly lower in PUMA knock-out mice than in wild-type mice. Conclusions: The present data suggest that PUMA contributes to the neurodegeneration taking place during seizure-induced neuronal death and may therefore represent a therapeutic target for adjunctive therapy to prevent hippocampal damage following status epilepticus.

Englot, 1 Ulrich Schridde, and 1,2 Hal Blumenfeld ( 1 Department Neurol., Yale University School Med, New Haven, CT ; and 2 Department Neurobiol., Yale University School Med, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Partial seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are often classified as either complex, characterized by deficits in consciousness, or simple, involving no loss of consciousness. Prior intracranial EEG studies of complex-partial seizures in TLE patients have shown large amplitude slow waves in the frontal and parietal cortices ictally, most prominent in the orbitofrontal cortex. This neocortical slowing is associated with decreased cerebral blood flow in these areas measured using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has been hypothesized that ictal neocortical slowing may reflect abnormal cortical and subcortical network interactions during temporal lobe seizures, responsible for the deficits in consciousness seen in TLE patients. However, an animal model is needed to further study the mechanisms and pathophysiology of neocortical slowing. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a bipolar stimulating/recording electrode in the dorsal hippocampus, and a frontal recording electrode in the association (n = 5), cingulate (n = 6), or lateral orbital (n = 5) cortex. After one week of recovery, animals were kindled with a daily 1s train of 1ms, 60 Hz biphasic pulses at the threshold current necessary to produce an afterdischarges of >3s duration. EEG recordings from the hippocampal and frontal electrodes were compared. Behavior was rated using the standard Racine scale. Results: Hippocampal EEG showed seizure activity, consisting of polyspike discharges, during all events. While frontal recordings in the association and cingulate cortices showed rapidly propagating fast (polyspike or sharp) activity within 1?2s of hippocampal stimulation, large amplitude slow waves of approximately 3?4 Hz were seen ictally in the lateral orbital cortex. Behaviorally, these seizures did not involve motor convulsive activity. As daily stimulations proceeded, the slow rhythm in the lateral orbital cortex progressively converted to fast spike activity, suggesting seizure propagation. Conclusions: Our results show neocortical slowing in the lateral orbital cortex during hippocampal seizures in rats. These data suggest that hippocampal kindling may provide a good animal model of complex-partial seizures in patients with TLE, demonstrating neocortical slow activity outside the region of seizure initiation. Further studies into the fundamental mechanisms of neocortical slowing in this model may provide insight into pathophysiology of altered consciousness in complex-partial seizures, and may lead to improved treatments of TLE.

Yamada, 1 Michael Wong, and 1 Liu Lin Thio ( 1 Neurology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Leptin is a neurohormone that helps regulate body weight and also has complex effects on neuronal excitability. Because its predominant effect on neuronal excitability in vivo is unclear, we examined the susceptibility of leptin deficient ob/ob mice to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced seizures. Methods: We studied PTZ induced seizures in 31 wild type (C57BL/6J) and 30 ob/ob (B6.V-Lepob/J) male mice at 44?58 days of age using continuous video EEG recordings. After 15 minutes of baseline recording, a 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/kg dose of PTZ was injected intraperitoneally. The recording continued for 30 minutes after the injection or until death, whichever came first. PTZ induced generalized absence, myoclonic, clonic and clonic-tonic seizures. Maximal clinical seizure severity, latency to clinical seizure onset, latency to the first epileptiform abnormality and the normalized cumulative epileptiform duration were determined. Clinical seizure severity was rated as: 0 = no seizures, 1 = absence seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 2 = myoclonic seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 3 = generalized clonic or clonic-tonic seizures with normal clinical behavior and EEG interictally, 4 = repetitive absence or myoclonic seizures without normal interictal behavior or EEG throughout the 30 minute recording, 5 = death. The normalized cumulative epileptiform duration was the sum of the duration of all epileptiform abnormalities divided by the total time of the recording after PTZ injection. Comparisons were made using a t-test with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: The background EEG for both wild type and ob/ob mice showed 6?7 Hz theta activity without any epileptiform abnormalities. In both groups, PTZ induced the same types of clinical and electrographic seizures in a dose-dependent manner. The latency to the first clinical seizure and to the first epileptiform abnormality was the same in wild type and ob/ob mice at all PTZ doses. The maximal clinical severity at 25 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg PTZ were the same in wild type and ob/ob mice. However, at 75 mg/kg PTZ the clinical severity was 5.0 ± 0.0 for the ob/ob mice because all mice died whereas it was 3.5 ± 0.8 (p < 0.05) for wild type mice. At 75 mg/kg PTZ, the normalized cumulative epileptiform duration was 9 ± 3% for ob/ob mice and 5 ± 1% for wild type mice (p < 0.05). ob/ob mice also showed a higher maximal clinical severity and normalized cumulative epileptiform duration at 50 mg/kg PTZ. A greater number of generalized clonic and clonic-tonic seizures accounts for the greater severity of seizures in the ob/ob mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that PTZ induces more severe seizures in ob/ob mice. These results are consistent with leptin acting as an endogenous anticonvulsant and support a role for leptin in the treatment of epilepsy.

The syndrome is characterized primarily by intellectual impairment, ranging from mild learning disability to profound mental retardation. We are interested in studying the cellular electrophysiological factors underlying the pathophysiology of seizure activity in the brain tissue of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) gene knockout mice (KO). Methods: We have characterized the induction of seizure-like events (SLE) in young adult mouse hippocampal slices exposed to low Mg-ACSF and tetanic stimulation bouts, as with our previous KO mice. All recording were performed on transverse hippocampal slices (400 ?m) from mice aged 6?9 weeks, in oxygenated ACSF, at 33°C. SLEs and extracellular field responses were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampal slices, in response (were appropriate) to Schaffer collateral stimulation. Results: The KO mice hippocampal slices were more easily induced into SLEs with either low Mg-ACSF, or by repetitive tetanizations. KO slices showed a shorter lag time to SLE of 15.4 min. vs 26.5 min. in wt slices, required fewer tetanic stimuli to produce SLEs. A brief application of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (at 1 or 10 ?M delayed the onset of low Mg-induced, but not tetanic stimulation-induced SLEs in KO hippocampal slices by more than 3-fold. However, we found that longer application of this same drug leads to diminished (with low Mg-ACSF exposure) or increased susceptibility (with tetanic stimuli) to SLEs in the KO hippocampus. Also, we have found that inhibitory network that regulates paired-pulse inhibition in CA1 of the hippocampus, is dramatically reduced in the KO hippocampus, leading to a complete lack of PPI that can be elicited in the wt slices. Conversely, we have found that paired-pulse facilitation is significantly enhanced in the KO hippocampus as compared to the wt, and that this may point to alterations in presynaptic calcium handling in these FMRP knockout mice. Conclusions: We have found that hippocampi from FMRP knockout mice are more easily induced into seizure-like events in vitro. We are continuing work to further elucidate the nature of mGluR regulation of SLEs in this model, as well as the influence of inhibitory inputs in the KO hippocampus on seizure susceptibility in these mice.

Kalynchuk ( 1 Psychology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada ; 2 Cell Biology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago, Spain ; 3 Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 4 Psychology, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that has important roles in the developing nervous system as well as in the adult nervous system. It is believed that extracellular reelin may act as either a stop or as a chemoattracting signal for radially migrating neurons. Deficits in reelin signaling have been found in a variety of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disorders, including epilepsy. However, in the adult nervous system, the specific role of reelin is not fully understood. Reelin is synthesized and released by GABAergic interneurons and recent studies have suggested that reelin might modulate and even enhance long-term potentiation in the adult brain. Importantly, enhancement in synaptic transmission is thought to play a crucial role in the intensification of afterdischarges and progressive development of convulsions in the amygdala kindling model of epilepsy. Methods: To determine if amygdala kindling was associated with changes in reelin expression, rats were surgically implanted with an electrode into the basolateral amygdala and subjected to 99 kindled or sham stimulations. An additional group of non-kindled genetically prone FAST kindled rats was also processed in order to determine if basal reelin expression was altered in rats that were genetically more susceptible to enhanced amygdaloid excitability and the effects of kindling. Brains were processed for immunohistochemical determination of reelin, NeuN, and doublecortin. Results: The total number of reelin positive cells in the hilus was not substantially different between all groups; however, there was a slight decrease in the number of these cells within the subgranular zone for the kindled and non-kindled FAST rats. A decrease in reelin expression within the stratum lacunosum-moleculare was also found for kindled and non-kindled FAST rats. Doublecortin immunohistochemistry revealed that some newly born neurons migrated ectopically into the hilus for kindled rats but not for sham-stimulated controls or for non-kindled FAST rats. Interestingly, we often observed several abnormally located reelin positive cells scattered throughout the dentate granule cell layer for non-kindled FAST rats suggesting a possible pre-existing GABAergic circuit malformation in this group of rats. Conclusions: These findings suggest that changes in reelin expression within the hippocampus during development might influence network formation that may influence susceptibility to epilepsy. (Supported by NSERC.) 1 Patrick D. Fox, 1 Hyokwon Chung, and 1 Sookyong Koh ( 1 Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Northwestern Medical School, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Chronic epilepsy often starts with an isolated early life seizure, a period of remission, and then the re-emergence of seizures later in life. To mimic this event in rats, we developed a ?two-hit?-kainic acid (KA) model and demonstrated that an early life seizure increases susceptibility to seizures and to seizure-induced neuronal injury in adulthood. We have found that activation of resident microglia and subsequent increases in mRNA of inflammatory cytokines and complements appear to be the key initiating events for seizure-induced inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that the inflammatory reaction provoked by early-life seizures primes the developing brain and microglia, leading to rapid reactivation by a second seizure in adulthood. Blocking of this microglia activation through pharmaceuticals such as minocycline may prevent some neuronal injury typically seen following these later life seizures. Methods: Postnatal day 21?25 LE rats were injected with KA (10 mg/kg, I.p.) or saline. The first dose of minocycline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered immediately after KA injection, and 6 more doses were given 24 hours apart over the next 7 days. Two weeks after KA/PBS injections, all remaining rats were given KA. Rats were perfused two days later and all brain sections were processed for immunocytochemistry (ICC) using IbA1/Aif antibody to visualize activated microglia. CA1 subregions of the hippocampal sections were analyzed using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.). An average percent of area above the set threshold (threshold area containing immunoreactive cells captured at 20x) and the number of stained cells were calculated per animal. Results: Cellular hypertrophy of microglia suggestive of activated state was observed within 24 h after KA-induced seizures. The group that experienced early-life seizures (K/K) had a marked increase in the number of activated microglia compared to control littermates who received single KA in adulthood (S/K). These microglia were larger and formed a complex, web-like network localized within the hippocampus especially over the CA1 region. Over two fold increase in immunoreactive areas was noted in K/K compared to S/K (KA: 9.0 ± 1.3 vs. Saline: 4.0 ± .1.0, p < 0.04, n = 8). The microglia count was also significantly greater (KA: 233.1 ± 12.1 vs. Saline 153.5 ± 9.2, p < .039, n = 8). This hypertrophic, hyperplastic, reactivating effect of an early-life seizure on microglia was abolished in minocycline treated rats. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the experience of early life seizures primes the microglia and elicits a much more robust activation in response to later life seizures. Whether microglial reactivation is causally related to the epileptogenic effect of early-life seizures to increase seizure susceptibility and cell death will be determined.

Rogawski ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS/NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Kainate (KA) receptors are formed from homomeric or heteromeric combinations of subunits, including GluR5 and GluR6. Studies with transgenic mice indicate that KA receptors containing GluR6 subunits play a role in KA-induced seizures (1). Here we used kainate receptor knockout (KO) mice to determine the clinical seizure and EEG correlates of GluR5 kainate receptor activation, and the roles of kainate receptor subunits in other seizure models. Methods: Video-EEG monitoring was carried out during slow tail vein infusion of the selective GluR5 agonist ATPA in wild type (WT), GluR5-/-, and GluR6-/- mice. We also assessed seizure thresholds using the i.v. PTZ and 6 Hz models. Results: Slight myoclonic jerks/twitches associated with single sharp waves occurred at lower doses of ATPA in WT than in GluR5-/-, but generalized seizures occurred at similar doses. Myoclonic jerks occurred at comparable doses in WT and GluR6-/- mice; paradoxically, EEG seizure patterns began with lower doses in GluR6-/- mice. There were no significant differences between any of the genotypes in their thresholds for clonic seizures induced by i.v. PTZ or in the 6 Hz seizure model. Conclusions: GluR5 kainate receptors contribute to ATPA-induced myoclonic jerks, but not to generalized seizures. The increased sensitivity of GluR6 KO mice to ATPA was unexpected. In the KO animals, the existence of GluR5 homomers instead of GluR5/GluR6 heteromers may account for the phenomenon since GluR5 homomers are about 2.4-fold more sensitive to ATPA than are GluR5/GluR6 heteromers (2). GluR5 and GluR6 kainate receptors do not appear to play a role in seizure activity in the PTZ and 6 Hz models. 1 Mulle C, Sailer A, Perez-Otano I, et al. Nature 1998;392:601?605. 2 A. Alt, B. Weiss, A.M. Ogden, et al. Neuropharmacology 2004; 46:793?806. 1 Michael A. Galic, 2 James G. Heida, 3 Campbell G. Teskey, and 2 Quentin J. Pittman ( 1 Neuroscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; 2 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: There is increasing evidence that immune and inflammatory processes in early life are capable of producing lasting effects on physiology and CNS function and raise the possibility that a single inflammatory episode during development could evoke changes in seizure susceptibility later in adulthood. Methods: To explore this hypothesis, postnatal day 14 male rats received either the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (25?250 ?g/kg), or the viral mimetic Polyinosinic:Polycitydylic acid (POLY I:C) (1 mg/kg) to induce a mild inflammatory process. Two months later, rats received lithium and pilocarpine (LI-PILO), kainic acid (KA) or were subjected to amygdala kindling to discern any changes to seizure susceptibility. Following KA seizures, subsets of animals were killed and brains evaluated for neurodegeneration using Fluoro jade histochemistry. Results: Neonatally LPS-treated, but not POLY I:C-treated rats, showed significantly faster seizure onset times (SOTs), by about 25% compared to controls. Adult rats given LPS and then LI-PILO two months later, did not show the same reduction in SOT as found with the neonatal treatment. Separate experiments determined a comparable susceptibility of neonatally LPS-treated rats to adult convulsions evoked with KA, but not to amygdala kindling. Behavioural sensitivities to KA were also reflected in the amount of neuronal degeneration in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampus 24 h after SOT. Conclusions: Taken together, we have observed that long-lasting changes in seizure susceptibility can be evoked following a mild inflammatory episode during development, possibly through a mechanism involving, or specific to, the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (LPS-activated), but not TLR-3 (POLY I:C-activated) pathways.

Good, 3 Shivkumar Sabesan, 2 Trevor D. Boone, 2 Leon D. Iasemidis, and 1,2 David M. Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University ; and 3 Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: In the last decade, substantial progress has been made in the study of the human epileptic brain by utilizing concepts and measures from nonlinear dynamics. The hallmark of this research is the ability to predict seizures prior to their clinical or electrographic onset (IEEE TBME 2003; 50:616?627). As the ability to predict leads to the possibility of control, research in controlling seizures with closed-loop systems is expected to flourish in the near future and will most likely include studies performed in animal models of epilepsy. We have thus applied the concepts from nonlinear dynamics, namely the Largest Short-Term Lyapunov exponent (STLmax), to evaluate the effectiveness for real-time seizure prediction in the lithium pilocarpine rat model of chronic epilepsy as a precursor for a closed-loop seizure control system that utilizes deep brain stimulation. Methods: Three male Sprague-Dawley rats (300?350g) were stereotaxcially implanted with a customized array of Tungsten depth wire electrodes which included four cortical, two hippocampal, and two thalamic contacts. Chronic epilepsy was established several weeks after an episode of prolonged status epilepticus using the lithium pilocarpine model (3 mmol/kg LiCl followed by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine 24 hrs later). Continuous EEG/video recordings were made during the entire experiment and all data analyzed in real-time. STLmax values were calculated for each electrode and entrainment of STLmax was evaluated utilizing a pair t-statistic (T-index). True and false predictions were noted with a seizure prediction horizon set at 180 minutes. Results: Continuous EEG data from Rat1 (55 seizures in 166 hours), Rat2 (25 seizures in 384 hours), Rat3 (16 seizures in 739 hours) resulted in a total of 96 seizures in 1289 hours of recording. The seizure prediction results from each rat were: Rat1, prediction rate 35/55 = 63.4%, 11 false positives (0.0663/hr), mean prediction time = 111 minutes; Rat2, prediction rate 22/25 = 88.0%, 50 false positives (0.1302/hr), mean prediction time = 149 minutes; Rat3, prediction rate 10/16 = 62.5%, 114 false positives (0.1543/hr), mean prediction time = 114 minutes. Overall prediction rate- 67/96 = 69.8%, 175 false positives (0.1358/hr), mean prediction time = 125 minutes. Conclusions: While the overall prediction rate of ?70% is less than the one reported in human data (?80%), similar false positive rates (?1 every 8 hours of recording), and an extended prediction time were noted. Given these results, prediction of seizures in the lithium pilocarpine rat model of chronic epilepsy appears feasible as a model of chronic epilepsy for testing real-time feedback control systems utilizing thalamic deep brain stimulation.

Dudek ( 1 Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO ; 2 School of Pharmacy, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY ; and 3 Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Animal models of chronic epilepsy, such as the kainate-treated rat, may be useful in the discovery of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The present study evaluated the effectiveness of carbamazepine on the frequency of spontaneous motor seizures in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Another aim of the study was to of develop a paradigm for continuous, long-term oral administration of potential AEDs. Methods: Single intraperitoneal (IP) injections of carbamazepine (10?100 mg/kg) were compared to vehicle [i.e., 20% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-?-cyclodextrin] injections via six AED-versus-vehicle tests using a repeated-measures cross-over protocol. To establish an effective dose and the time-course of the anticonvulsant effect, two trials (8?9 rats per trial) evaluated single per os[i.e., oral- by mouth (PO)] doses of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine. Each PO trial included 3 AED-versus-vehicle tests comprised of carbamazepine-containing or control pellet feedings on alternate days with a recovery day between each treatment day. Based on the single-feeding studies, carbamazepine at 100 mg/kg was administered three times per day (TID) for 5 days. Results: Carbamazepine significantly reduced seizure frequency at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg after single IP injections, and caused complete seizure cessation during the 6-h post-drug epoch in 25% and 70% of animals at 30 and 100 mg/kg. Single IP injections and single oral feedings of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced seizure frequency relative to control treatments during 6-h and 22-h epochs following drug administration. A single feeding of carbamazepine (100 mg/kg PO) was significantly effective for 20 h and full recovery was complete within 23 h. Continuously administered carbamazepine (100 mg/kg PO, TID) significantly reduced seizure frequency by >50% for 24 h and completely suppressed motor seizures in 50% of the animals tested. Conclusions: High doses of carbamazepine (30 and 100 mg/kg) were highly effective at suppressing spontaneous seizures, and were associated with a high percentage of motor seizure freedom. Administration of higher doses of carbamazepine did not further suppress spontaneous motor seizures. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg carbamazepine was as effective as IP injections. Significant anticonvulsant effects of 100- mg/kg PO carbamazepine were sustained for the duration of the 5-day trial.

Certain forms of synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on modifications of the presynaptic release machinery. However, our knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms and the role of the presynaptic release machinery in functional changes that underlie epileptic activity at the level of the synapse is very limited. Therefore, we have analyzed whether the expression patterns of components of the presynaptic release machinery are altered in different stages of an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We have furthermore characterized knock-out mice deficient for three proteins that are integral components of the release machinery, RIM1α, RIM2α or Synaptotagmin 10 (Syt 10), in an experimental model of TLE. Methods: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced by systemic application of pilocarpine to rats as well as to three mutant mouse lines. Changes in mRNA levels were analyzed by Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH). Seizure susceptibility was determined after induction of SE. The frequency and severity of chronic recurrent seizures was analyzed with a telemetric EEG system (DSI) and parallel video analysis. To study hippocampal damage, the amount of segmental hippocampal loss of neurons and gliosis were analyzed in wild-type and knock-out mice after SE. Results: To investigate changes in the mRNA expression level of various components of the presynaptic release machinery hippocampal subregions (dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1) were isolated from rats 4, 6 and 8 hours and 5 and 28 days after SE induced by pilocarpine. Analysis of these samples by Real-time PCR, ISH and Affymetrix-Micro-Arrays showed distinct changes in the expression patterns of several constituents of the release machinery; e.g. Syt 10 could not be detected in the CA1 region of control rats/mice, neither by single cell PCR nor by ISH, however, its mRNA was strongly expressed in CA1 cells 6 h after SE. To study if ablation of individual components of the presynaptic release machinery affects epileptogenesis we are analyzing three mutant mouse lines in the pilocarpine model of TLE: knock-out mice for the active zone proteins RIM1α and RIM2α, which exhibit defects in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, and Syt 10, whose mRNA expression is induced by seizures. So far the results obtained by Video- and EEG-Monitoring of these animals suggest that RIM1α knock-out mice have a higher susceptibility to seizures than wild-type littermates (n = 5). Furthermore, the latency to the first seizue and to SE seem to be reduced. Conclusions: Our results suggest that components of the presynaptic release machinery are modified during epileptogenesis, may play a pathogenetic role and constitute targets for new therapeutic approaches in TLE.

Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered for 7 days with physiological solution (SF) or mercaptopropionic (MP) acid. The day of the experiment, a shunt micrordialysis probe or a concentric probe was inserted into the carotid artery or the hippocampus respectively, in order to monitor extracellular phenytoin (PHT) levels. In SF and MP treated rats, PHT (30 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 30 after an intraperitoneal administration of SF or nimodipine (NIMO, 2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data was made using TOPFIT program. Results: No differences were found in PHT plasmatic levels comparing all experimental groups. In rats pretreated with SF, hipocampal PHT concentrations were signicantly lower in MP treated rats (maximal concentration (Cmax): 2.7 ± 0.3 ?g/ml, p < 0.05 vs SF rats) compared to SF animals (Cmax: 5.3 ± 0.9 ?g/ml). Whilst pretreatment with NIMO did not modify central pharmacokinetics of PHT in SF treated rats (4.5 ± 0.8 ?g/ml), PHT levels were significantly higher in MP rats pretreated with NIMO (Cmax: 6.8 ± 1.0 ?g/ml, p < 0.05 vs MP rats pretreated with SF) compared to MP animals with previous administration of SF. Conclusions: Thus, our results suggest that central pharmacokinetics of PHT was altered in epileptic rats by MP administration. The effect of NIMO on hipocampal concentrations of PHT suggested that P-gp is implicated in the reduced central bioavailability of PHT in MP epileptic rats. (Supported by University of Buenos Aires.) 1 Susan L. Campbell, and 1 John J. Hablitz ( 1 Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: Elevated glutamate levels have been reported in several epilepsy models. The electrophysiological changes that occur when transporter function is disrupted in experimental models of epilepsy have not been examined. The freeze-induced model of cortical dysplasia results in abnormal lamination of cortical structures associated with hyperexcitability in the region adjacent to the microsulcus. Here we used this model to test the role of glutamate transporters in synaptic transmission in the hyperexcitable region. Methods: Focal freeze lesions were induced in postnatal day (PN) 0 Sprague-Dawley rats using methods described previously. In freeze-lesioned cortex, recordings of layer II/III pyramidal cells were obtained 0.3?1.5 mm lateral to the microsulcus. Synaptic responses were evoked with a bipolar stimulating electrode (twisted pair of 25 mm Formvar insulated nichrome wires) positioned 150?200 ?m below the recording pipette. Stimuli were current pulses 10?100 ?A in amplitude and 50?100 ms in duration. A stimulation frequency of 0.05 Hz was used. The glutamate uptake antagonists DL-threo-?-benzylozyaspartic acid (TBOA) and dihydokainate (DHK) were bath applied. Results: TBOA prolonged postsynaptic currents (PSCs) and decreased the threshold for evoking spontaneous epileptiform activity in lesioned cortex. Uptake inhibition also induced an increase in holding current in the dysplastic cortex. In contrast, responses in sham operated and control animals were not affected. The effect of blocking uptake was mediated primarily by the glia glutamate transporter (GLT-1) since the selective GLT-1 blocker DHK mimicked the effects of TBOA. The increases in the holding current suggested that glutamate was accumulating extracellularly and activating ionotropic glutamate receptors. The increase in excitability following uptake inhibition appeared to be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors since prior application of D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) prevented TBOA-induced effects and TBOA-induced changes were reversed by APV. In the freeze-lesioned cortex spontaneous epileptiform activity does not occur at a high rate. Under control conditions, the probability for the occurrence of spontaneous discharge was 0.09 ± 0.06 (n = 22) which increased significantly to 0.59 ± 0.1 (n = 22) when TBOA was applied. Conclusions: These results indicate that glutamate transporter function is altered in rat focal cortical dysplasia and these changes contribute to the observed hyperexcitability. Alteration in transporter function could result in increasing extracellular glutamate concentrations and over activation of NMDA receptors during neuronal activity. (Supported by NS22373.) 1 Kiyotaka Hashizume, 1 Seiji Takebayashi, and 1 Tatsuya Tanaka ( 1 Neurosurgery, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan ) Rationale: The aim of this study was a comparison of the antiepileptic effect between deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN), using the same epilepsy model. Methods: A guide cannula was stereotactically implanted into the left sensorimotor cortex of male Wistar rats. Focal cortical seizures were induced by a microinjection of kainic acid (KA) into the left sensorimotor cortex. Using this focal seizure model, High-frequency electrical stimulation of STN or ATN was performed intermittently when the animal developed into the seizure status. The seizure frequency of DBS-on and DBS-off was measured from a video-EEG system. The data was analyzed statistically. Results: An intracortical injection of KA was induced focal and secondarily generalized seizures in all animals. The ipsilateral (the side of KA injection) STN-DBS suppressed the seizure frequency to 50?60% of the DBS-off phase. The effect of bilateral STN-DBS showed no significance than the ipsilateral DBS. When the electrode was implanted into bilateral ATN, no seizure was induced by KA injection. The implantation of the ipsilateral ATN lead to seizure suppression, and the ipsilateral ATN-DBS suppressed seizures more strongly. Conclusions: Both DBS of STN and ATN suppressed KA-induced focal seizures. The antiepileptic effect of ATN-DBS was stronger than STN-DBS in this animal model. The seizure suppression of the electrode implantation alone may be caused by a focal destruction of ATN. 1 Henry J. Hasson, and 1,2 Solomon L. Moshe ( 1 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 2 Neuroscience and Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency and a common problem in neonates. To date, effective treatments to stop ongoing status epilepticus in this age group have not been identified. To assess efficacy and morbidity from the treatment of prolonged seizures in the immature brain, it is necessary to develop screening assays. Methods: SE was induced in postnatal day 15(P15) and 21(P21) rats by systemic administration of kainic acid (KA) 3.5 mg/kg (P15) and 10 mg/kg (P21) or lithium-pilocarpine (PI) 60 mg/kg (P15) and 30 mg/kg (P30). Rats were monitored by EEG with an electrode in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In both models behavioral seizures continue for several hours and electrographic seizures continue for more than 24 hours if left untreated. After one hour of electroclinical SE, rats were treated with pentobarbital (PB), diazepam (DZ), or saline. Rats were then intermittently monitored for cessation of behavioral and electrographic seizures, and for mortality for 3 days following treatment to confirm that the seizures stopped and did not recur. Results: Both drugs can stop the ongoing seizures both behaviorally and electrographically. PB (50 mg/kg) was XX% effective in stopping KA and PI induced SE in both P15 and P21 rats. DZ (20 mg/kg) was effective in stopping SE in 50?64% of rats in 3 of the 4 groups. In the KA P21 group, it was not effective. Higher doses of diazepam did not improve the outcome in P15 pups in KA-SE. When effective, DZ stopped SE much quicker than PB (p < .0001). In most groups, mortality from SE did not change irrespective of whether SE was stopped or not. In the P15 PI group, treatment with either drug had increased mortality compared to untreated SE. Conclusions: This study shows that it is possible to abort seizures in the developing rat even after 1 hour of SE using drugs at appropriate doses. The drugs, when effective, stop both the behavioral and the EEG seizures. The action of DZ is rapid, suggesting that subsequent treatments can be quickly initiated if SE does not stop within 1?2 minutes. On the other hand, PB takes significantly longer to work, and more time is needed to determine if the therapy will stop the seizures. Age and cause of SE may contribute to drug-induced morbidity. Our protocol can be used to assess the efficacy and morbidity of new agents.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology, Royal College of Surgeon In Ireland, Dublin, Dublin, Ireland ) Rationale: Sublethal brain insults can confer protection against cell death induced by subsequent (prolonged) damaging insults. While best described for ischemia, there is some evidence brief seizures may precondition the brain against damage following prolonged seizures (e.g. status epilepticus). To study this so-called ?epileptic tolerance?, we examined neuronal damage following status epilepticus in mice that received various doses of sublethal preconditioning seizures and at various intervals between the conditioning and injurious stimuli. Methods: Seizure preconditioning activity was induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of kainic acid (KA) at various doses (5.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg; n = 5, plus vehicle controls, n = 9) and subsequent status epilepticus was induced by intra-amygdala (i.a.) injection of KA (1.0 ug) at two time-points (24 or 72 hours) after the first insult. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and NeuN immunostaining was used to detect neuronal damage within the hippocampus. Results: Preconditioning seizures did not induce significant hippocampal damage at any dose tested. Mice that received preconditioning seizures induced by KA i.p. at 15.0 mg/kg given 24 hours before i.a. KA showed significant reductions in TUNEL counts and significantly more surviving neurons as assessed by NeuN in the ipsilateral hippocampus, particularly the CA3 subfield (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the duration of high amplitude polyspike seizures evoked by i.a. KA in mice that received preconditioning. Surprisingly, increasing the time interval between preconditioning and prolonged seizures to 3 days resulted in raised mortality rates (e.g. 3/5) when mice underwent the second prolonged (i.a. KA) seizures: evidence of preconditioning-induced sensitization to seizures. Conclusions: This study provides a new model with which to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying endogenous neuroprotection programmes in brain. (Supported by Science Foundation Ireland grant B466.) 1 James G. Heida, 1 Jana Veliskova, 1 Libor Velisek, 1 Ondrej Cudomel, 1 Solomon L. Moshe, and 1 Aristea S. Galanopoulou ( 1 Neurology and Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: It is widely accepted that status epilepticus (SE) in early life does not result in major neuronal death as observed in adults. There is increasing evidence however that more subtle aspects of brain physiology are permanently affected. Of particular interest is the potential effect of repetitive early life seizures on the physiology of endogenous seizure controlling circuits, such as those involving the substantia nigra reticulata (SNR). The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of 3 episodes of SE, during early postnatal development, on the seizure controlling function of the SNR in rats. Methods: Three episodes of SE were induced in Sprague Dawely rat pups of both sexes on postnatal days 4 (P4), P5, and P6 by systemic injection of kainic acid ([KA] 1.25, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg i.p. respectively). Animals were left until P28 when they were implanted with bilateral cannulae aimed at the anterior SNR. At P30, rats received bilateral infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (100ng/0.25 ?l per side), which has been shown previously to have an anticonvulsant effect when infused into the anterior SNR at P30 (Veliskova  2 Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Yale University, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Reductions in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) have proven useful for the lateralization and localization of seizure foci in patients with intractable epilepsy. Since most patients to date have been studied only after years of intractable seizures, it is unclear, if the deficits in NAA precede the onset of overt seizures or, alternatively, are solely a consequence of chronic, intractable seizures. To determine when the reductions in NAA occur, we used a pilocarpine rat model and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Methods: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in male rats with pilocarpine and terminated after 1 hour with diazepam. Control rats received sham-injections of saline (n = 10 control rats). The severity of the SE was graded according to Racine, and rats with severe generalized seizures (stages 3, 4 and 5) were included for analysis (n = 11). Two and seven days post-SE, MRSI data were acquired with 2ul resolution. Three voxels within each hippocampus (6 voxels per rat) were selected for analysis. Following the day 7 MRSI study, the rats were maintained under anesthesia and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Neuronal loss in the regions spanned by the spectroscopic images was assessed using stereologic methods as described by West. Results: Displayed in Fig. 1 are hippocampal spectra from a sham injected animal (control) and 2 and 7 days post-SE in a pilocarpine treated rat. NAA is significantly reduced at 2 days post-SE (27.5 ± 6.9% decrease, p < 0.001) and 7 days post-SE (17.3 ± 6.9% decrease, p < 0.001) in comparison to sham-injected controls (Fig. 1). Despite the substantial reductions in NAA 7 days post SE, neuronal counts averaged over the entire hippocampus showed a non-significant reduction of 2% in comparison to sham treated animals. Conclusions: Hippocampal NAA content in this rat model of epilepsy is significantly reduced during the latent period prior to the development of overt spontaneous seizures. The reduction in NAA, 17%, is not due to neuronal loss, since neuronal numbers are not significantly decreased over the volume sampled. The presence of decreased NAA during the latent period suggests that spectroscopic studies of NAA provide an early marker of the processes underlying the development of epilepsy, prior to the manifestation of overt seizures. If validated in patients, this would provide a non-invasive method for evaluating and identifying those patients at risk to develop epilepsy following a first provoked seizure.

Mareci ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 5 Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Using MRI at 17.6 Tesla, we have studied structural changes that occur during the latent period of epileptogenesis in an animal model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and correlated these changes with histological analysis. Methods: Five 50-day-old adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were anesthesized and implanted with stimulating electrodes to induce self-sustained status epilepticus in 4 out of 5 rats. Subsequently, rats were video monitored to capture spontaneous seizures. After eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed, transcardially perfused, and the intact fixed brains imaged in vitro at 17.6 Tesla. After imaging, brains were processed for histology and stained with Fluoro-Jade C, Timm, GFAP, Black Gold and Perl iron stains to correlate structural changes with those observed with MRI. Results: Three of 5 rats presented with observable spontaneous seizures during the epileptogenic period. These rats showed significantly decreased T2 in the pyramidal cell layer CA1 of the hippocampus and the dorsal thalamic nuclei bilaterally [Fig. 1]. One presented with a cavity and increased T2 in the parahippocampal gyrus on the contralateral side of stimulation. No T2 changes were observed in the frontal cortices of these seizing rats. The two rats with no observable seizures either hadn't been stimulated or had stimulating electrode placement in the dorsal thalamus instead of the hippocampus. These rats showed no significant T2 abnormalities in any brain region. Histological analysis has been completed for one of the seizing rats and revealed mossy fiber sprouting around the dentate gyrus bilaterally, iron deposition in the dorsal thalamus and demyelination and astrocytic proliferation in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions. Conclusions: These results suggest that there may be a correlation between T2 changes in the parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus (related to mossy fiber sprouting and gliosis on histology) and the seizure activity of animal models of MTLE. Future work will correlate these changes with in vivo MRI at different time points after electrical stimulation and structural changes using specific histological methods. [figure 1] (Supported by NIH grant R01 EB004752, the Wilder Epilepsy Research Center and University of Florida Alumni Foundation.) 1 Riikka J. Immonen, 1 Asla Pitkänen, and 1 Olli H.J. Gröhn ( 1 Department of Neurobiology, A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mn2+-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) can reveal functional, structural, and connectional alterations in the brain with a high spatial resolution in vivo. We showed that Mn2+ injected in the entorhinal cortex is transported via perforant pathway to the dentate granule cells resulting in labeling that correlates with the density of mossy fiber sprouting [Nairismägi et al. Neuroimage 2006]. Now we hypothesized that systemic Mn injection and MEMRI can be used for detection of mossy fiber sprouting. Methods: MnCl2 (45 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to 10 adult Wistar rats. After 12 hours, status epilepticus (SE) was induced with kainic acid (KA) in 6 rats (MnSE group). T1 weighted (gradient echo, TE = 2.7ms, TR = 120ms) and quantitative T1 mapping (IR- fast spin echo, TI = 10, 400, 1000, 1600 ms) MRI was performed under 1% halothane anaesthesia at 4.7T, 3 and 25 hours after KA injection. Two months later, follow-up MRI was performed before and 24 hours after injection of Mn. In the end, rats were perfused for histology, and brains were stained to detect neurodegeneration, gliosis, and mossy fiber sprouting. Results: At 15 h after KA injection, T1 relaxation times did not differ between the groups. This indicates that Mn accumulation during generalized seizures is not activity dependent. Two months after KA administration, Mn-enhanced MRI indicated thickening of the dentate gyrus (DG) and proximal CA3 in T1-weighted images in the MnSE group (260 ± 40% increase compared to controls, p < 0.05). The CA1/adjacent corpus callosum signal intensity was 1.37 ± 0.03 in the MnSE and 1.22 ± 0.03 in the control group (Fig. 1, p < 0.05), confirming the increased accumulation of Mn in the CA1 region of the KA-injected animals. The initial histological analysis shows both mossy fiber sprouting (DG) and neuronal loss related gliosis (CA1) in the signal enhancement areas. [figure 1]Fig.1 Manganase enhanced T1-wt images 25h (A,C) and 2 months after KA injection from two representative animals. Conclusions: MEMRI contrast after systemic Mn injection is not associated with brain activation during and after SE. Alterations in the thickness and shape of the DG and CA3 or CA1 regions of hippocampus proper can be attributed either to mossy fiber sprouting or gliosis, respectively. According to our data it is evident that MEMRI after systemic administration is able to reveal cellular level changes in the hippocampus. It remains to be studied if the accumulation of Mn into mossy fibers and/or glia can be differentiated. (Supported by Finnish Cultural Foundation of Northern Savo.) 1 John R. Ives, 2 Krista L. Gilby, and 2 Dan C. McIntyre ( 1 Department of Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Carlton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: We tested the effects of TMS using a model MagPro X100 (Medtronic Canada Inc., Toronto, ON) on well-established kindled seizures in rats as there seems to be no studies in this area. First we determined whether 60 Hz TMS could evoked seizures in kindled rats. Second, we determined whether low frequency (1 Hz) TMS (LFTMS) had any effect on the threshold or performance of kindled seizures. Methods: Since kindling was originally established in 21 rats using 2 sec of low intensity 60 Hz sinusoidal electrical stimulation, we set the TMS parameters to 2 sec of 60 Hz, biphasic, magnetic stimulation at 100%. The 21 rats, 7 amygdala and 14 ventral hippocampal kindled, previously received more than 10 generalized seizures and their thresholds were stabile. These 21 rats were also from 3 selectively bred groups, 6 ?Fast kindler?, 5 ?Slow kinders ? and 10 ?F1 hybrids?. Two types of TMS coils were used to stimulate the rats, the round and the figure 8. The round coil had a central-hole that was positioned over the rats' implanted headplug connector, when the kindling leads to the rat were not attached. The figure 8 coil was used when the leads were attached. In 12 ventral hippocampal kindled rats, we tested the efficacy of LFTMS against the kindled seizures in two experiments, A) 1 Hz, 70%, for 30sec, wait 1min and determine the seizure threshold and behavioral profile, and B) 1 Hz, 70%, for 5min, wait 24hrs before testing. Results: No TMS protocol alone triggered a convulsive seizure or focal after-discharge in any rat. Further the focal after-discharge threshold to the kindling stimulus was not affected by LFTMS. However, the latency to forelimb clonus of the kindled seizure was significantly lengthened by both LFTMS protocols, indicating a delay in the recruitment of the convulsive kindled seizure. Surprisingly, TMS did not block or even marginally obscure the online EEG from the implanted bipolar Nichrome electrodes. Conclusions: TMS alone does not trigger seizures in seizure-prone or -resistant rats with a well-established kindled focus in either the amygdala or hippocampus. 1 Hz TMS does not effect the AD threshold, but significantly affects the recruitment of the convulsive seizure, which is an anti-epileptic effect.

Elisevich ( 1 Neurosurgery, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ; 2 Anesthesiology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ; and 3 Neurology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Epileptogenesis precipitated by status epilepticus (SE) is believed to evolve during a latent period which intervenes between SE and the emergence of spontaneous seizures. Vascular pathologies have been observed in several limbic structures in chronically epileptic animals following SE, including upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among reactive astrocytes, angiogenesis, and increases in neovascular permeability. Here we have investigated the temporal evolution of these vascular pathologies following SE in the rat. Methods: SE was induced in male wistar rats (250 g ? 350 g) by systemic kainic acid injection (10 mg/kg, i.v.), and was terminated four hours after onset by injection of pentobarbital (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The control group received vehicle injections and did not develop SE. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (50 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered daily for seven consecutive days to separate cohorts beginning 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, or 49 days post-SE. Animals in each cohort were sacrificed 14 days after completing the BrdU injection series, and angiogenesis was subsequently assayed by double-label immunohistochemistry for BrdU and von Willebrand factor. Prior to sacrifice, vascular permeability was assayed serially at 7, 14, 21, 24 and 56 days post-SE, using gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gd-DTPA was administered using a stepped down infusion protocol that maintained a relatively constant blood Gd-DTPA level during 20 min of imaging. Pre-contrast T1-weighted images (T1WI) were subtracted from post-contrast T1WI to identify enhancing areas. Results: Endothelial proliferation was significantly increased (p < 0.05) during the first two weeks (day 1 and day 7 cohorts) post-SE, spanning the duration of the average latent period. At sacrifice, coincidently labeled cells were commonly found in abnormal neovessels within regions damaged by SE. MRI image subtraction indicated that vascular permeability increased toward the end of the latent period, coinciding with the formation of abnormal neovascular complexes within regions of epileptogenesis. Conclusions: The evolution of vascular pathologies following kainic acid-induced SE occurred primarily during the latent period which preceded the onset of spontaneous seizures. These were observed exclusively in regions of the brain damaged by SE and consist of abnormally permeable neovascular complexes formed via angiogenesis. The timing of events in relation to SE suggests that the resultant increase in vascular permeability may bias the adjoining neuropil toward hyperexcitability and promote the emergence of spontaneous seizures.

This has widely been thought to be a consequence of the epileptic process, but recent evidence suggests there could be a common causal link. This study investigates whether the GAERS (Generalised Absence Epileptic Rats from Strasbourg) strain of rats, a phenotypic animal model of generalised absence epilepsy, also display behavioral abnormalities, and attempts to determine whether these behaviors are present prior to the development of absence seizures. Methods: Mixed gender GAERS rats were compared with Non-Epileptic Controls in neurobehavioral tests for anxiety (elevated plus maze) and depression (sucrose-preference test). Comparisons were made at 7 or 13 weeks, the equivalent neurodevelopmental age of adolescence in a rat, and also before and after the development of seizures. Results: GAERS rats showed increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze at both 7 and 13 weeks of age compared with NEC rats, as evidenced by a significantly lower number of open arm entries (at 7 weeks: 3.14 ± 0.53 entries (n = 14) vs 7.90 ± 1.01 (n = 20); at 13 weeks: 4.67 ± 1.03 entries (n = 15) vs 6.09 ± 0.73 (n = 11) ? two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0019). This strain of rats also displayed a significantly reduced preference for sucrose drinking water (at 7 weeks: 3.18 ± 0.66ml (n = 11) vs 6.67 ± 0.88ml (n = 3); at 13 weeks: 3.00 ± 0.84ml (n = 5) vs 4.83 ± 0.63ml (n = 12) ? two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0054), indicating an anhedonic state and suggestive of a depressive phenotype. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that GAERS rats, when compared with non-epileptic controls, display anxious and depressive behaviors which are present prior to the onset of absence seizures. This suggests that affective disorders may not be a consequence of seizures, and also raises the possibility that there may be a common neurodevelopmental causality which predisposes humans to both affective disturbance and epilepsy.

Kelly ( 1 Department of Neurology, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA ; 2 Department of Neurology, Stroke Program, The Medical Center at the University of Texas at Houston, Houston, TX ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Several rat strains have been studied extensively and are well-known as genetic models of absence epilepsy. Less well-known is the fact that many common laboratory rat strains frequently express spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a similar fashion. These SWDs are usually 6?9 Hz, and are associated with motor arrest of the animal. Generally, SWDs tend to be more frequent and longer in duration as the animals grow older. To our knowledge, however, no study in Long Evans rats has included a detailed observation of SWDs and how SWD expression changes throughout their lifetime. Previously, we reported that cortical infarction by middle cerebral artery/common carotid artery occlusion results in a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of SWDs compared to sham-operated control animals (Kelly et al, 2006). In this study, we sought to extend these observations to gain a better understanding of the timecourse of SWDs and the effect of lesion-associated changes on their expression in these animals. Methods: Five Long Evans rats lesioned by MCA/CCAO and four Long Evans sham-operated controls were intermittently monitored by video-EEG over a six-month period as previously reported (Kelly et al, 2006). Fifty-hour samples were then chosen from each animal's EEG record and visually reviewed for the presence of SWDs. The time and date of each SWD observed was documented, as well as the duration of the event. Preliminary results were obtained by plotting SWD data on a timeline for analysis by linear regression. Results: Preliminary results in control rats indicate that in 4 of 4 animals (100%) SWDs tend to increase in frequency of occurrence as the animal grows older. The average duration of SWDs tended to increase with age in 2 of 4 animals (50%), while decreasing in the other 2 animals (50%). Preliminary results in lesioned animals show a trend toward both greater frequency of occurrence and longer duration of SWDs in 2 of 5 (40%) of animals, and a decrease in both frequency of occurrence and duration in 2 of 5 animals (40%). One animal (20%) showed an increase in the frequency of occurrence, but a decrease in the average duration of SWDs. Conclusions: Since 7 of the 9 animals included in this study showed a trend toward an increase in the frequency of occurrence of SWDs over the six-month monitoring period, these studies appear to be consistent with reports of an aging-related increase in SWD expression in other rat strains. Changes in average duration of SWDs over time appear to be variable animal to animal. No reported changes in SWD expression are clearly related to the lesion.

The functional meaning of NO and NOS in epilepsy remains controversial despite previous studies from animal models. In present study, we investigated NOS expression in the hippocampus of rat with pilocarpine-induced seizures. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (200?250g) were pretreated with atropine methylbromide (1 mg/kg s.c.) and 30 min later with pilocarpine hydrochloride (330 mg/kg i.p.). After 40 min, the Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated by injection of diazepam (4 mg/kg i.p.). Animals were sacrificed 1 day, 3days, 2 wk (silent phase) or 1 month (chronic phase) after status. Neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and epithelial NOS (eNOS) expressions and the density of mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the hippocampus were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and neo-Timm's histological procedures. Results: iNOS and eNOS expressions were more strongly upregulated than nNOS expression at both phases. nNOS expression gradually increased until 3 days and decreased after 2 wk. iNOS expression had no alteration at both phases. eNOS expression tended to decrease after 2 wk. The density of MFS gradually increased and was strongest at 1 month. Conclusions: Our data indicate that nNOS and eNOS with the strongest upregulation in the silent phase may have a correlation with epileptogenesis while iNOS with the durability of upregulation in both phases may have something of influence on the hippocampus also after the epileptogenesis was acquired. 1 Rafal M. Kaminski, 1 Hamid Sheikhi, and 1 Michael A. Rogawski ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS/NIH, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: 11-Beta hydroxylase is involved in final steps of steroid hormone synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to accumulation of hormone precursors, which may eventually enter an alternative metabolic pathway and become neurosteroids. Neurosteroids are potent anticonvulsants acting via positive modulation of GABAA receptors. We have previously shown that they are particularly effective against 6 Hz seizures in mice. In the present study we investigated whether inhibition of 11-beta hydroxylase protects against 6 Hz seizures and whether this effect is associated with increased neurosteroid synthesis. Methods: Male NIH Swiss mice were the experimental subjects. The animals were pretreated with either metyrapone or etomidate, which both are potent inhibitors of 11-beta hydroxylase, and challenged at various time points with corneal 6 Hz electrical stimulation (32 mA, 3 sec.) to induce seizures. Separate groups of animals were additionally treated with finasteride to test whether seizure protection following administration of metyrapone or etomidate is attenuated by inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis. Results: Metyrapone afforded dose-dependent protection against 6 Hz seizures 30 min. after injection (ED50 = 190.6 mg/kg). However, the potency of metyrapone was much higher (6-fold increase) when the animals were tested 6 hrs. following injection (ED50 = 30 mg/kg). Etomidate displayed very similar pattern of protection against 6 Hz seizures with respective ED50 values of 4.5 and 1.7 mg/kg. Finasteride partially attenuated the anticonvulsant effects of both 11-beta hydroxylase inhibitors. Conclusions: Inhibition of 11-beta hydroxylase produces prolonged anticonvulsant actions in mice. This effect may be associated with an increased neurosteroid production, which could be responsible for protection from seizures. 1 Irina Kharatishvili, 1 Riikka Immonen, 1 Olli Grohn, and 1 Asla Pitkanen ( 1 A.I. Virtanen Institute, Kuopio University, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: The risk of posttraumatic epilepsy positively correlates with the severity of brain injury. Up to 50% of patients with penetrating head injury can develop epilepsy later in life, whereas for moderate injury the incidence of epilepsy is only 4.2%. Our previous study with lateral fluid percussion brain injury model (FPBI) demonstrated that severe impact strength resulting in 31?33% mortality, causes development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in 43?50% of experimental animals (Kharatishvili et al., Neuroscience 2006;140:685?97). In this study, we aimed to examine if in FPBI model, similarly to humans, probability of developing epilepsy is associated with injury severity. Methods: Head trauma was induced by lateral FPBI in adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 15, 5 shams). The pressure of the applied impact, as recorded by a transducer, varied from 2.3 to 3.3 atm. The low mortality rate (23%) indicated moderate severity of the injury. Quantitative MRI was used to monitor the progression of the lesion starting at 3 hrs post-injury and repeated at 3 d, 9 d, 2 month-, 3 month- and 6 month post-injury time-points. Morris water maze test (MWM) was used to assess the long-term behavioral outcome (spatial learning and memory) 7 months after FPBI. After that, 24h/day continuous video-EEG monitoring was performed to assess the development of seizure activity; animals were implanted with depth electrode in the ventral hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury site and contralateral cortical electrode, and followed by continuous video-EEG for 2 + 2 weeks with 3 week interval for up to 12 months. Results: The mean volume of the cortical damage at 6 months post-injury was 40.8 ± 38.1mm3 (range 2.7?130.0 mm3). MWM test demonstrated no difference in spatial learning in injured rats compared to shams (p>0.05). EEG monitoring revealed 2?20 sec runs of 6?8 Hz monomorphic rhythmic activity with a spike-like negative phase in 70% rats both in the FPBI and control groups. This rhythm was registered in drowsiness over the injury side and was responsive to movement. No epileptiform discharges/seizures were recorded during the entire monitoring period. Conclusions: Rats with moderate FPBI had substantial cortical lesion. However, the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory deficit was not as pronounced as previously found in animals which developed epilepsy after severe FPBI (p < 0.05). Also, none of the rats had electrographic seizures. In lateral FPBI, the moderate force of the impact results in progressive brain damage but does not increase the likelihood of posttraumatic epileptogenesis.

Growing evidence suggests that pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules are synthesized during seizures in the brain at the sites of seizure initiation and propagation, and that rapid induction of these inflammatory mediators may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. We hypothesize that activation of microglia and subsequent increases in cytokines, chemokines, and complements are the key initiating events for seizure-induced inflammatory responses. Methods: In a total of 40 heterozygous Cx3cr1GFP/+ adult mice, Cx3cr1 encoding fractalkine chemokine receptor has been replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene by targeted deletion via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Seizures were induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA, 20 mg/kg); control with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The mice were sacrificed 30 min, 1day, 2 days, 7days, or 14 days after the injections. Three 50-?m-thick horizontal sections (6 hippocampal sections per brain) were selected for quantification of microglia. An average percent of area above the set threshold (containing green fluorescent cells/hippocampal hilar region capture at 20X magnification) and number of fluorescent element were calculated per animal, and comparison was made between KA and Control animals. Results: Enhanced fluorescent signaling indicative of microglial activation was already apparent in the hippocampus 30 minutes after KA-induced seizures. Within 2 days, microglia in the hippocampus appeared enlarged and more numerous. A nearly 2 fold increase in the area of fluorescent cells was noted in KA treated mice compared to control littermates (PBS:1.67 ± 0.15 vs KA:3.08 ± 0.28, p < 0.005). Also, significant microglial proliferation occurred 2 days after KA-induced seizures (113 ± 5 vs 189 ± 9, p = 0.0002). These increases in the area and number of fluorescent cells persisted to 7 days after KA (area%: 1.64 ± 0.10 vs 2.35 ± 0.21, p < 0.01; spot counts: 102 ± 3 vs 141 ± 5, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Taking advantage of transgenic mice in which all microglia are fluorescently labeled, we have unequivocally demonstrated an acute and persistent microgliosis after KA-induced seizures. Neuroinflammation provoked by seizures thus appears to be mediated via activation of resident CNS immune cells, microglia. Our data implicates microglia in seizure-induced neuronal excitability and degeneration, and suggests an inhibition of microglia activation as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Schauwecker ( 1 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Cell and Neurobiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Susceptibility to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death varies among inbred mouse strains due to variation in genetic background. Our QTL mapping studies have shown that distal chromosome 18 (Sicd1) contains a gene(s) conferring different susceptibility to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death between C57BL/6J (B6) and FVB/NJ (FVB) inbred mouse strains. We have verified that the causal gene(s) reside in the Sicd1 QTL utilizing congenic strains. We found the congenic strains having the Sicd1 QTL-resistant locus from a cell-death resistant strain (B6) and the remainder of their genome from a cell-death susceptible strain (FVB) are less susceptible to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death as compared to the cell-death susceptible strain (FVB). We hypothesized that a strain-specific variation in one or more genes is responsible for the Sicd1 QTL effect. Methods: We have focused on two potential candidate genes, Galr1 and Mbp, based on their putative role in modulating seizure susceptibility and excitatory amino acid-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis we sought to identify sequence variants in the Galr1 and Mbp genes between B6 and FVB strains using DNA sequencing. As a complimentary method to identify the Sicd1 QTL gene(s), we have examined changes in gene expression at the mRNA level of Galr1 and Mbp in hippocampal homogenates from both the parental inbred and the reciprocal congenic strains. Studies are underway to detect aberrant splicing based on cDNA sequencing and differential expression of Galr1 and Mbp at the protein level between our parental strains, B6 and FVB, as well as our reciprocal congenic strains. Results: Based on preliminary results, no coding sequence variants have been detected in the Galr1 and Mbp genes. We have found genotype-dependent differences in Galr1 mRNA expression between B6 and FVB parental strains using qRT-PCR (p = 0.023). Differential expression of hippocampal mRNA for Galr1 was also found by qRT-PCR between the FVB.B6-Chr18 congenic strain and the parental FVB strain. In contrast, no statistically significant differences in Mbp mRNA expression were observed either between the parental strains or recombinant congenic strains (p = 0.816). Conclusions: Based on the expression variation and its putative role in modulating seizure susceptibility and excitatory amino acid-induced cell death we consider Galr1 as a strong candidate gene responsible for the Sicd1 QTL effect. Follow-up studies whether there is functional expression differences in Galr1 gene between B6 and FVB would support Galr1 as a Sicd1 QTL gene. Results from the proposed studies will add to our understanding of the molecular determinants critical for the pathogenesis of seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death.

This study examined the contributions to this effect of the subtypes of glucocorticoid receptors: mineralocorticoid (MR, high-affinity for CS) and glucocorticoid (GR, low-affinity for CS). Methods: Female Non-Epileptic Control rats 10?13 weeks of age were ovariectomized and implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala. Five experimental groups were studied: 1. Water-control (n = 6), 2. CS treated (n = 6), 3. CS + Mifepristone (Mif ? GR-antagonist, 25 mg/kg sc, n = 7), 4. CS + Spironolactone (Spir ? MR antagonist, 50 mg/kg, n = 5), and 5. CS + Mif (25 mg/kg) + Spir (50 mg/kg) (n = 6). Corticosterone was dissolved in drinking water (6 mg/100 ml) and administered ad libitum (groups 2?5) throughout the kindling period. Rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (Groups 1 and 2) or the relevant antagonist in vehicle (Groups 3?5) twice daily for the entire kindling period. Rapid Amygdala Kindling (RAK), which began two days after initial treatment, consisted of 10 sec bursts of 400?A every 15?20 mins, with up to 24 stimulations per day. Results: Groups differed significantly in the number of stimulations required to reach the ?fully kindled state? defined as five Class V seizures on the Racine scale (p = 0.04, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). The CS-treated group kindled faster than either the water-treated control group (p < 0.05) or either of the three CS+antagonist groups (p < 0.10). No significant differences were found between the any of the CS+antagonist groups and the water-treated controls. Conclusions: The data implicate both high affinity (MR) and low affinity (GR) glucocorticoid receptors in the mechanism by which low-dose CS accelerates kindling epileptogenesis. This may have implications for understanding the potential effects of chronic stress and depression in initiating and/or exacerbating TLE.

Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Division of Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 3 McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging imaging modality that has the potential to image the dynamic function of the brain due to its unique ability of imaging biological tissues with high optical contrast and ultrasound resolution. Here we report the first application of our finite element based PAT method for imaging of seizure-onset zone in an animal model of focal seizures. Methods: Male Harlen Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 50?60g, were used in this study. The rats were anesthetized with urethane 1 mg/g in all the experiments. Focal seizures were induced by microinjection of a GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the left parietal neocortex. A mechanical scanning photoacoustic system with single acoustic transducer was employed for collecting the light-induced acoustic signals. A reconstruction algorithm was used to generate PAT images. Results: Following microinjection of BMI into the left parietal cortex, focal seizures were induced and confirmed with electroencephalogram recordings which showed high amplitude spike and wave discharges. These seizures were accurately localized tomographically by PAT. The dynamic changes in PAT imagings were comparable to EEG changes during seizures. Conclusions: Our result showed that PAT is an emerging non-invasive imaging modelity to localize the seizure-onset zone. Compared to other neuroimaging modalities, PAT has not only the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution, but also the ease of use. It has the potential to bring brain imaging to the bedside, clinic and daily life, and coincide a scan with a seizure such that an epileptic focus and seizure occurrence can be visualized in real-time.

Wood, and 1 Paula E. Schauwecker ( 1 Cell and Neurobiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Studies have shown a correlation between estrous cycle and seizure susceptibility in humans and most mammals. This effect is also seen during menopause, or reproductive senescence. It has been hypothesized that the hormonal fluctuations throughout the various stages of estrous exert some type of influence on seizure occurrence, prevalence, and severity. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of ovarian hormone cyclicity at different stages of estrous, the loss of ovarian hormones and the relationship to kainate-induced seizure susceptibility and seizure induced cell death. Methods: Control female mice of the FVB/NJ (FVB) strain were administered kainic acid (KA) at different stages of the estrous cycle. Estrous cycle was determined by vaginal cytology and only regularly cycling animals were chosen for the experiments. KA or saline was administered systemically to female FVB mice at various stages of the estrous cycle, to ovariectomized (OVX) females, OVX females treated with estradiol (OVX + E), and VCD-treated female mice. Mice were monitored for 4 hours for seizure onset, severity, and activity and scored for latency to onset of first severe seizure and duration of severe seizures. After 7 days of recovery, neuronal damage was evaluated throughout the hippocampus proper. Results: Among ovary-intact female FVB mice, estrous cyclicity was without effect on seizure susceptibility. In particular, no significant differences in latency to onset or duration of severe seizures were noted. In contrast, in the OVX + E female mice, seizure duration was significantly increased, and latency to onset of seizures was reduced, as compared to OVX and ovary-intact female mice. The extent of hippocampal cell death among ovary-intact mice was not affected based on estrous cycle staging. In particular, no significant differences in the extent of cell death were observed between ovary-intact female FVB mice injected with KA during estrus, when gonadal hormone levels peak, or during diestrus, the nadir of gonadal hormone levels. Conclusions: Our results suggest that estradiol may lower the threshold for seizure activity. While we found no modulatory effects of estradiol on seizure susceptibility or cell death based on estrous cyclicity, it is important to note that two different models for the modulation of ovarian steroid levels were used. In one model, ovariectomy (OVX) causes a complete disruption of gonadal hormones. In contrast, ovarian steroid levels vary across the estrous cycle in ovary-intact female mice. In addition, OVX + E mice have none of the protective effects of progesterone present. Studies are ongoing to compare two models of reproductive senescence: the OVX model and the chemically-induced VCD model. Insight into the mechanisms of brain related-changes as a result of the loss of ovarian steroids will help identify risk factors for seizure susceptibility and cell death in aging women. 1 Jesus Machado-Salas, 3 Patricia Guevara, 1 Dongsheng Bai, 1 Reyna Duron, 2 K.

Methods: Our Laforin-deficient knockout mice were produced by deleting the Laforin domain coding region of the EPM2A gene (Hum Mol Genet 11:1252?1262.2002). Similar groups of control and homozygous null mutant mice were sacrificed at fixed intervals and their encephalons were fixed with glutaraldehyhde and processed with PAS and immunocytochemical techniques. Monoclonal antibodies were used against neurofilaments M and L (NFM/L) . Results: Our experimental animals showed neuronal death at 2 months of age, in the absence of apoptotic changes or accumulation of Lafora bodies (LfB). At 9 months of age the number of LfB was very prominent in large nerve cells. They were positive to PAS, Ubiquitin and AGEP. Large neurons from the brainstem, hippocampus and cerebellum showed abnormal immunoreaction for NFM/L, which, in some cases, very much resembled neurofibrillary degeneration. Clusters of fragmented and distorted neurites were seen, very much like ?senile? (neurite) plaques. Analysis of LfB has revealed some unexpected structural components that appear to establish an anatomofunctional link between them and the neurocytoskeleton . Conclusions: Our observations apppear to indicate that our model of Lafora disease presents morphological evidence of a neurodegenerative process in absence of apoptotic cell death. Lafora bodies do not primarily participate in neuronal death. With age, they increase in size and number, accumulating poliglucosans and, probably, also misfolded proteins. The presence of a complex structure in the ring of Lafora bodies, allows us to postulate an active role for these still enigmatic inclusions.

To utilize potential of these drugs attention is now focused on specific NMDA antagonists. We decided to study effects of representants of the two above mentioned classes low-affinity noncompetitive antagonist memantine and NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil in immature rats. Methods: Two models of epileptic seizures were used ? pentetrazol(PTZ)-induced motor seizures and cortical epileptic afterdischarges (ADs) induced by stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex. Male rats of the Wistar strain 12, 18, and 25 days old were tested. The same age groups were studied behaviorally to find possible side effects. Spontaneous behavior in the open field was registered and motor performance was checked by means of age-specific tests. Memantine was administered intraperitoneally in doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, ifenprodil in doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg. Each age and dose group in each experiment was formed by 8 to 10 animals. Results: Memantine suppressed generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in a dose-dependent manner in all age groups. In contrast, it potentiated minimal clonic seizures. Ifenprodil suppressed only the incidence of the tonic phase of GTCS in 12- and 18-day-old rats. Memantine increased threshold intensities for elicitation of spike-and-wave type of AD in 12- and 18-day-old rats as well as threshold for the other (mixed) type of ADs (due to a transition of epileptic activity into the limbic system) in 25-day-old rats. Duration of ADs was shortened in all age groups. Ifenprodil pretreatment decreased threshold intensities for elicitation of mixed type of ADs in 18- and 25-day-old rats and increased duration of these ADs in 25-day-old rats. If administered when the animals allready passed repeated ADs, it significantly shortened ADs in 12- and 18- but not 25-day-old animals.All doses of memantine increased locomotor activity in 12- and 18-day-old rats, the change in the oldest group was not significant. The 20- and 40- mg/kg doses impaired motor performance in all age groups. Ifenprodil increased locomotor activity only in 12-day-old rats and motor performance was changed only with the highest dose in 12- and 25-day-old rats. Duration of the impairment of motor performance by either drug was shorter than duration of an anticonvulsant effect. Conclusions: Memantine exhibits anticonvulsant action as well as side effects described for common NMDA atagonists. Ifenprodil has an action mostly in the youngest group what is in agreement with developmenal decrease of NR2B subunits in the NMDA receptors.

Treiman ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Status epilepticus (SE) is a dynamic state. There are progressive changes in clinical behavior, response to treatment, extent of neuronal damage, and EEG pattern during prolonged clinical and experimental status epilepticus. SE also causes deficits in learning and memory, but progressive impairment with increasing severity of SE has been little studied. We tested the hypothesis that the EEG stage during SE predicts the extent of subsequent cognitive impairment. Methods: Forty-three 250?280 gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 4 stainless steel epidural electrodes for EEG recording. Status epilepticus was induced by 3 mmol/kg IP LiCl followed 24 hrs later by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. EEG was continuously recorded before and after injection, and SE was stopped at EEG stage I (discrete seizures), III (continuous ictal activity), IV (continuous ictal activity punctuated by flat periods), or V (periodic epileptiform discharges) (Treiman et al., Epilepsy Res5:49?60, 1990) with IP diazepam (10 mg/kg) plus phenobarbital (25 mg/kg). Control rats were given PB and DZM prior to SE induction and thus did not develop SE. Spatial learning and memory were assessed one week prior to SE induction and one week after SE using a modification of the Morris Water Maze (Morris, J Neurosci Methods11:47?60, 1984). Learning impairment was tested in six trials on each of four sequential days. Effect of the SE stage on the mean escape times to a submerged platform were determined by a multiple analysis of variance. Pair-wise multiple comparisons of groups were done by Fisher's least significant difference. The mean escape time for the trials on test day 1 post-SE was compared with the mean of the trials on test day 4 pre-SE to assess the effect of SE on spatial memory. Results: Mean time to stop SE from pilocarpine injection was: Stage I 25 min, Stage III 65 min, Stage IV 100 min, and Stage V 210 min. There were no significant differences between these groups in pre-SE water maze performance. However, post-SE day 1 mean escape times were significantly worse compared with pre-SE day 4 (test of memory) as well as the mean escape times for all test days (test of learning) in Stage IV and Stage V rats when compared to controls, Stage I, and Stage III rats (p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between control, Stage I and Stage III rats, nor between Stage IV and Stage V rats. Conclusions: SE results in a marked impairment of both visual-spatial memory and learning in the late stages of SE. Stage IV, and V rats demonstrated a greater impairment than controls, or Stage I-III. Thus progressive cognitive impairment, in addition to other dynamic changes cited above, is also an effect of prolonged SE. These data provide further evidence that the EEG stage during prolonged SE is a marker of its severity. (Supported by the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Stella M. Valiensi, 1 Oscar A.

Propofol is an anaesthetic with anticonvulsant effect, but its use is limited by complications such as Rhabdomyolisis? There are no experimental studies that can demonstrate neuroprotective activity of Propofol in S.E, neither R. attributed to this drug . Objectives: 1 ? To evaluate if Propofol in an animal model of Pilocarpine ? induced S.E can prevent neuronal damage in hippocampal structures. 2 ? To evaluate if Propofol in S.E. in this experimental model can cause R. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats, (200 to 300 g) were used. Biosecurity rules defined by the Institute of Basic Sciences and Experimental Medicine of our Hospital were followed. 1.CONTROL GROUP : n = 9 rats: 4 cm3 saline solution intraperitoneal (i.p) 2.PILOCARPINE GROUP : n = 10: 1 mg/kg N-Hyoscine butylbromide+ 350 mg/kg of i.p Pilocarpine. 3.PROPOFOL GROUP : n =10: 1 mg/kg N-Hyoscine butylbromide+ 350 mg/kg of i.p Pilocarpine. After 30 minutes of S.E., 20 mg/kg Propofol. Behaviour and Scalp EEG monitoring were evaluated. Brains were removed after 2 hours,and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H.E). The hippocampus was assessed. 4 histologic groups with signs of neuronal damage(dark and shrunken) were identified . 1) No damage 2) Mild damage: (+) 2?3 neurons per field (400 X) 3) Moderate damage (++) 3?5 neurons per field 4) Severe damage (+++) 5?7 neurons per field The muscle quadriceps femoralis was removed and stained with H.E. The presence of macrophage in and around the fibres was evaluated . The pathologist performed analyses blinded to the treatment received by the rats. Results: Brain damage in every area was analyzed with a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon sum rank).A p < 0.05 was considered a significant difference. Between Group1 and Group 2, greater difference was found in temporal neocortex and subiculum in Group 2. Significant damage decrease was observed in Group 3, with less damage in the CA3?4 regions (p = 0.0019). BEHAVIOUR All the rats had S.E. EEG: Group1: normal EEG. Group 2: continuous epileptiform activity . Group 3: continuous epileptiform activity during S.E. Propofol produced suppression of the epileptiform activity. R.: 2 rats in each group(Group 2 and Group 3) had signs of R.There were no statiscally significant differences between treatment groups. Conclusions: Neuronal damage was less severe in the rats treated with Propofol, with decrease neuronal damage regarding the CA region, specifically in the CA3?4 regions, which suggests its neuroprotective effect. R. was not considered a statiscally significant finding. 1 Brona M. Murphy, 2 Clara K. Schindler, 2 Sachiko Shinoda, 1 Carmen Bellver-Estelles, 1 Mark Dunleavy, 2 Robert Meller, 1 Jochen H.M. Prehn, 2 Roger P. Simon, and 1 David C. Henshall ( 1 Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 Robert S. Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Seizures whether brief or prolonged are capable of causing neuronal death. Apoptosis signaling pathways play a role is such neuronal loss. Previous studies have demonstrated that experimental seizures can activate the apoptotic intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway and that components of this pathway are altered in involved brain structures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We have developed a mouse model of seizure-induced neuronal death with features of programmed cell death. Presently, we examined the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in this model and contrasted this to events within human epilepsy brain. Methods: The experimental methods used in this study included, a mouse seizure model: intraamygdala kainic acid injection in adult mice, terminated after 40 min by diazepam, human temporal lobe specimens: hippocampal resections obtained following surgery for intractable epilepsy compared to matched autopsy controls, Western blotting and Immunofuorescence. Results: Seizures evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid in C57BL/6 mice caused ipsilateral death of CA1 and CA3 neurons within the hippocampus. Western blotting revealed seizures induced overexpression of Bax, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and ?7. Analysis of hippocampi from patients with intractable epilepsy revealed cleaved caspases 9 and 7 were present. In searching for relevant anti-apoptotic proteins we found no changes to expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl but a rapid decline in Bcl-w levels at both 0.5 (p < 0.01) and 4 h following seizures. Reasoning that loss of Bcl-w may promote cell death after seizures we investigated hippocampal injury following seizures in mice lacking Bcl-w. Bcl-w knockout mice exhibited no obvious neuroanatomical differences to their wildtype littermates and expressed similar hippocampal levels of a range of apoptosis-associated proteins including Bcl-2 and similar amygdala levels of the kainic acid (KA) receptor GluR5?7. Seizures evoked by intraamygdala KA induced significantly more hippocampal neuronal loss and DNA fragmentation (terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling) in Bcl-w knockout mice compared to wildtype mice. Extending these data, we found higher cytoplasmic levels of Bcl-w in hippocampus from patients with TLE compared to autopsy controls. Conclusions: These data identify Bcl-w as an endogenous neuroprotective gene that may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of seizure-induced brain injury and temporal lobe epilepsy.

This study was designed to investigate immediate (24 hours) and long-term changes (2, 4 and 6 weeks) in GABAA/cBZR expression, neuronal loss and MFS in the hippocampus in the kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE. Methods: Age-matched non-epileptic control male rats were randomized into control and KA groups (at least n = 6/group). MFS and GABAA/cBZR expression, neuronal loss and MFS were measured in hippocampal subregions, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 in both the control and epilepsy groups. GABAA/cBZR expression (Bmax value) was measured by saturation-binding analysis using [3H]-Flumazenil, a cBZR antagonist. Stereological counting was performed for cell counting and volume analysis of the CA3 SPc subregion of the hippocampus. MFS into the dentate molecular layer was quantified from Timm-stained brain slices. Results: At 24 hours post-SE, Bmax was significantly increased compared to controls in the whole hippocampus (+29.4%± 5.7; p < 0.001) and parietal cortex (Par Ctx) (+30.6%± 12.8; p < 0.05) as well as in all subregions of the DG, CA1, and CA3 with the exception of CA3 SPc (Repeated measure ANOVA, p < 0.02). Calculated from absolute values, no changes in receptor expression were seen over 2?6 weeks. There was no difference in MFS 24 hours post-SE compared with controls but MFS increased in the dentate molecular layer at 2 weeks post SE (20% above control; p < 0.05) and showed a progressive increase over time reaching 70% above controls (p < 0.001) at 6 weeks. At 24 hours, statistically significant neuronal loss occurred (?24 ± 9.3%) in the CA3 SPc region (control = 6, KA group = 6, p < 0.05) associated with a significant increase in GABAA/cBZR expression per surviving neuron. No recovery of neurons was apparent through to the end of 6 weeks post-SE. Conclusions: Changes in GABAA/cBZR expression, cell loss and synaptic reorganization occur during epileptogenesis and may influence the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Elevated receptor expression observed early after status epilepticus (within 24 hours) may be a protective response by the brain to dampen excitability and increase resistance to future seizures. MFS, a form of neuronal reorganization, is a prominent feature in the KA model of TLE progressively increasing during the latent epileptogenic period up to onset of SRS. GABAA/cBZR expression and MFS were not correlated until 6 weeks implying that MFS may affect seizure activity in late stages of epilepsy onset. 1 Sandeep P. Nair, 4 Wendy M. Norman, 1 Linda K. Dance, 1,3 Panos M. Pardalos, 1,2 Jose C. Principe, and 1,4 Paul R. Carney ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida ; 2 Electrical and Computer Engineering ; 3 Industrial and Systems Engineering ; and 4 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Gradual, progressive preictal dynamical convergence among brain regions has been reported in human epilepsy (IEEE TBME 2003; 50; 616?27) and in an animal model of chronic limbic epilepsy (CLE) (Epilepsia 45 (S7): 211?212). We have used a spontaneously seizing animal model of limbic epilepsy to investigate the occurrence of spatiotemporal transitions involving such dynamical convergence among different regions in an epileptogenic brain. We hypothesize that the frequency of these transitions increases progressively from the time of initial insult to the subsequent manifestation of epilepsy. Methods: Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4) were used in the study. The model was developed using chronic hippocampal stimulation (CHS). The animals animals, after allowing sufficient time for recovery from the stimulation procedure,were connected to an automated system that monitored the T-index calculated from short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents estimated from multiple brain regions. A (dynamical convergence (transition) was defined as a drop in T-index value from a preset upper threshold (UT= 10) to a lower threshold (LT= 2.662). The time leading to the first seizure was divided into blocks of 12 hours and the frequency of transitions in each block was calculated. The null hypothesis is rejected if the regression slope is found to be significantly positive (p < 0.05). Results: Two out of the four animals developed spontaneous seizures after CHS. The first showed a progressive increase in frequency of spatiotemporal transitions leading up to the first seizure (recording time before seizure?232.9 hrs, slope = 0.09, p = 0.0005), the second animal showed an abrupt increase in incidence immediately preceding the seizure (recording time before seizure?142.5 hrs, slope = 0.07, p = 0.0228). No dynamical transitions were observed in the two animals that did not develop spontaneous seizures. Conclusions: These results suggest that spatiotemporal transitions involving convergence of dynamical values among brain regions may be a marker for epileptogenesis.

We investigated whether carbamazepine (CBZ), levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA) as monotherapy are antiepileptogenic or disease modifying. To mimic clinical study design, treatment was started 24 h after the beginning of electrically induced SE. Methods: SE was induced by stimulating the lateral nucleus of the amygdala of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 98) electrically for 20?40 min. One group of vehicle treated non-stimulated animals served as controls for histology and behavioral analysis (SHAM, n = 37). SE was stopped with diazepam (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) at 4 h after SE induction (additional injection of DZP 10 mg/kg was given at 3h after the first injection). Administration of compounds (CBZ 120 mg/kg/d, n = 17; LEV 300 mg/kg/d, n = 18; VPA 600 mg/kg/d, n = 16; vehicle VEH, n = 47) was started 24 h after the beginning of SE. On the first day, AEDs were administered intraperitoneally, and thereafter i.g. All compounds were administered at 8 h intervals for 7 d. SE and the development of spontaneous seizures were monitored with video-EEG. The occurrence of epilepsy and seizure frequency were assessed at 10 weeks after SE induction with a continuous video-EEG monitoring (24h/day) for 2 weeks. To confirm antiepileptogenesis or disease modification, the second 2-weeks continuous video-EEG was started 14 weeks after SE. Thereafter, animals underwent behavioural testing (Morris water-maze and fear conditioning) and were perfused for histology. Results: Altogether, 62% of VEH, 89% of LEV, 53% of CBZ, and 88% of VPA treated animals developed epilepsy. The mean seizure frequency in the VEH group was 6.3 ± 12.8 sz/d (range 0.04?50, median 0.39), in the LEV group 4.8 ± 7.6 sz/d (range 0.04?24.2, median 0.88), and in the VPA group 7.6 ± 18.5 sz/d (range 0.07?70). In CBZ group the mean seizure frequency was 0.6 ± 0.6 sz/day (range 0.04?1.63, median 0.46). However it did not differ from that in the VEH group. Mean behavioural seizure severity did not differ between groups. The mean seizure duration was longer in the CBZ group compared to that in the VEH group (77 ± 16 sec vs. 68 ± 19 sec, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The three AEDs with different mechanisms of action, LEV, CBZ, and VPA were not antiepileptogenic when started at 24 h after SE induction and continued for 7 days.

Fisher ( 1 Neurology, Stanford, Stanford, CA ) Rationale: Since CSF drug delivery is clinically useful for antibiotics and antineoplastics, direct delivery of anti-epileptic medication to the CSF may also be useful and improve the tolerability and efficacy of these drugs. We performed a proof-in-principle study of intraventricular gabapentin (GPN) in the rat. Methods: Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with two Alzet model 2001 osmotic pumps, each delivering 1.0 ?L/hour for one week. Pumps were connected to left and right intraventricular catheters, with tips in relation to Bregma at: 1.4 mm lateral and 0.8 mm posterior on the right, 2 mm lateral and 1.3 mm posterior on the left, and 2.5 mm below the top of cortex. GPN 80 ?g/?L was installed into each pump and delivered at 3.8 mg per day. Half of the animals had pumps filled with isotonic normal saline (control group), and half with GBP. Seizure theshold was tested after five days, by dripping the convulsant liquid anesthetic flurothyl onto tissue paper at 10 ?L/minute in a sealed 3.2 L container. A single observer, blinded as to treatment group, recorded the time to first myoclonic twitch, first partial seizure and first tonic-clonic seizure. Seizures were judged behaviorally; no EEG was used as part of this protocol. Results: Of 60 rats used, 6 were lost due to mortality or pump/catheter malfunction. For the surviving 54, time to first tonic-clonic seizure was 295.8 ± 58.8 s (n = 28) for control group, versus 338.0 ± 89.9 s (n = 26) for the rats with GBP in the pump (p = 0.049 by two-tailed t-test). The mean time to onset of first myoclonic jerk was 158.7 ± 20.8 vs. 164.6 ± 33.5 s (p = n.s.). Effects of flurothyl can be influenced by animal weight; however, regression of time to tonic-clonic seizure versus weight yielded no significant relationship. Serum gabapentin levels obtained immediately after testing the seizure threshold were undetectable (<1 ?g/ml) in every animal. We did not perform quantitative studies of GPN distribution through brain, but methylene blue dye in the pumps distributed into periventricular white matter and also over cortex, especially ipsilaterally. Conclusions: Intraventricular delivery of gabapentin elevates the threshold for generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the rat flurothyl model, but not time to the first myoclonic jerk or first partial seizure. Interpretation is limited, as the degree of penetration and distribution of the GPN into brain cannot be detailed. Unmeasurable serum levels suggest the effect is not systemic. Intraventricular delivery of antiepileptic drugs would be useful for drugs with poor oral absorption or which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Intraventricular administration of drugs that do penetrate into brain after oral ingestion (e.g. GPN) may or may not be useful, depending upon achievable improvements in the therapeutic/toxic ratio and in steady brain levels of drug.

Mareci ( 1 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: In this study, we used MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine the temporal hippocampal and parahippocampal structural changes in vivo at 11.1 Tesla (T) during the latent period of epileptogenesis and to examine these same regions in the excised intact brain at 17.6 T. The mesial temporal lobe model was also used to determine if chronic stimulating/recording microelectrodes distort MR images collected at 11.1 T. Methods: Fifty micron gold plated tungsten wires (2) were implanted in the ventral hippocampus in Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6). Spontaneously seizing rats were obtained following experimentally inducted status epilepticus (SE). Rats were video recorded to capture spontaneous seizures. Injured rat brains were examined in vivo at 11.1 T pre/post wire implantation and after SE at 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60 days. The intact excised brain of 2 rats were imaged at 17.6 T. Diffusion weighted images were acquired using gradient directions specified by the tessellations of an icosahedron on the hemisphere. The diffusion weighted images were fit to a rank-2 tensor model of diffusion. Results: Five of the 6 rats developed seizures. The DT images of the rat, without seizures, looked identical to controls. In the other 5 rats, diffusivity increased in the hippocampus and fimbria in vivo. In 2 of these rats, diffusivity also increased in the entorhinal cortex. Increased diffusivity was seen as early as day 7 post-stimulation. We examined the excised brains of a seizing rat and one that did not. In the seizing rat, the diffusivity increased bilaterally in the hippocampal region, identified with mossy fiber sprouting. The hippocampus showed atrophy ipsilateral to the simulation. Decreased fractional anisotropy indicated a loss of structure in the dentate gyrus and CA2/3 region of the pyramidal cells (Fig.1). Conclusions: The induced SE produces bilateral structural changes, visible in detail with DTI, in the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. Stereotaxic images allowed repeated measures of the structural changes during epileptogenesis and the implanted wires produced minimal distortions. Future work will relate the physiological and structural changes, during epileptogenesis, using electrophysiology and DTI.

Henshall ( 1 Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin, Ireland ; and 2 RS Dow Neurobiology Laboratories, Legacy Research, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Hippocampal sclerosis is the commonest lesion identified in temporal lobe epilepsy and has been proposed as both cause and effect of seizures. Additionally, an emerging concept in epilepsy research is that the propagation of paroxysmal activity is necessary and sufficient to transform a naïve structure into one that is capable of generating spontaneous (epileptic) seizures. This transformation underlies the formation of an epileptogenic focus that can entrain the generation of seizures in interconnected structures. However, whether seizure-injury occurs within such communicating fibre tracts is largely unknown but recent reports document the presence of lesions within white matter tracts in epilepsy patients. According, we evaluated white matter tract injury within the corpus callosum in a novel seizure model in mice. Methods: Adult male C57Bl/6 mice underwent focally-evoked seizures induced by intraamygdala kainic acid microinjection with continuous electroencephalography. Seizures were terminated by intravenous lorazepam 40 (n = 10) or 50 minutes (n = 7) following kainate/vehicle (n = 3) injection and brains obtained 24 hours later. Coronal sections were processed for detection of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL technique. To identify the cell populations of the corpus callosum, the slides were labelled for oligodendrocytes with antibodies against 2,3-cyclic-nucleotide 3- phosphodiesterase (CNP) or myelin basic protein (MBP) and for astrocytes with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Results: Seizures in mice terminated after 40 min resulted predominantly in unilateral TUNEL staining within ipsilateral CA3 and CA1. In contrast, when seizure activity was extended to 50 min contralateral CA1 and CA3 hippocampal damage was more frequently observed. Examination of the ipsilateral and contralateral corpus callosum revealed the presence of cell death. Our data also revealed significant correlations between numbers of degenerating cells in contralateral (r = 0.460, p < 0.05) corpus callosum and the severity of neuronal cell death in CA3 hippocampus ipsilateral. Seizures induced oligodendrocyte death in the corpus callosum as revealed by the immunofluorescence colocalization of TUNEL/MBP or CNP. In contrast, the presence of a gliogenesis is shown around the corpus callosum. Conclusions: The present data establish that prolonged focal limbic seizures in mice induce damage to non-neuronal elements within the corpus callosum and show the degree of this injury is a function of hippocampal damage. Our data indicate seizures injure white matter tracts and offer a potential mechanism for seizure generation and spread to contralateral and extrahippocampal structures.

Schwartz ( 1 Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Cortical stimulation is playing an increasing role in clinical neuroscience in the treatment of epilepsy, stroke and pain. The neuromodulatory effects of cortical stimulation include both excitation and inhibition, the balance of which varies with the stimulation parameters. As a result, cortical stimulation also influences cerebral hemodynamics, including perfusion and oxygenation, which may also vary depending on the stimulation parameters, although little data exists on this subject. In this study, we investigate the effects of stimulation frequency on the hemodynamic response using optical recording of intrinsic signals (ORIS). Methods: Using bipolar tungsten electrodes, the rat sensory neocortex was stimulated at variable frequencies in a pseudo-random fashion at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 250 Hz at a constant charge (CC). The amplitude remained constant at 1 mA. CC was maintained by delivering stimulation at 100 spikes at each frequency and varying the duration of stimulation. Simultaneous field potential (f.p.) recording and ORIS was performed at 570 nm and 610 nm to quantitatively measure total hemoglobin (Hbt), deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbr) and oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) using a pathlength correction. Optical data was averaged over 10 trials at each frequency and each trial lasted 100 sec so the optical signal could return to baseline. Trials with afterdischarges were eliminated. Results: A large increase in Hbr was recorded at all stimulation frequencies but the maximum occurred at 10 Hz (2.12 ± 0.20%, n = 3). The relationship between the increase in Hbr and stimulation frequency (in log scale) could be characterized by the equation y =?1.1164 ? 2 + 3.1836x ? 0.2979 (R2 = 0.74). There was a significant correlation between the duration of stimulation and the duration of the increase in Hbr (r = .86, p < 0.05). The largest increase in Hbt occurred at 50 Hz (4.04 ± 1.08%, n = 3) and the relationship between the increase in Hbt and stimulation frequency (in log scale) could be characterized by the equation y =?1.3816 ? 2 + 5.3414x ? 1.2291 (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.05). The duration of the increase in Hbt was generally longer than the duration of stimulation by 80 seconds, regardless of frequency. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the duration of stimulation is more important than the frequency in determining the duration of the dip and that the relationship between frequency and both Hbt and Hbr is not linear, with a plateau occurring between 10?50 Hz.

The process is especially prominent in the hippocampus, which is involved in mood and memory functions and epilepsy. A new hypothesis for the development of depression in humans has been formed over the last few years, which includes neurogenesis as a factor of importance in the depressive disease: Reduction of neurogenesis in the hippocampus is a causality factor in the generation of depression and stimulated neurogenesis is part of the recovery process from the depressive state. The same applies for epilepsy. VNS therapy, which has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of epilepsy, was early on in its development noted to have mood elevation effects in VNS treated patients, with effects on depressive symptoms. This anti-depressive effect from VNS has been proven in clinical studies, and VNS is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe depression in humans as well as epilepsy. The mechanisms behind the antiepileptic and anti-depressive effects from VNS are, however, not fully understood. We hypothesize that a VNS-induced stimulation of the neurogenesis is part of the mechanism behind the observed clinical effects from VNS. Methods: The degree of stem cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was studied. The number of new cells were measured by BrdU (bromodeoxy-uridine) incorporation. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against BrdU were used for the detection of the newly divided cells. Eight rats implanted with VNS-leads and generators were stimulated for two days with the following parameters: 0.75 mA output current, 250 microseconds pulse width, 20 Hz frequency, 30 seconds on and 5 minutes off. These rats were compared with eight control rats that had VNS surgery for implantation of the VNS equipment, but with devices constantly in the off position. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups with a 50% increase of stem cell proliferation at the 0.03 significance level in the VNS-stimulated rats as compared to sham operated animals. Conclusions: These results indicate that VNS treatment in the rat affects the stem cell proliferation in the hippocampus. In the light of the prevailing theory of a link between hippocampal neurogenesis, epilepsy and depression, this finding might represent an interesting path in the search for mechanisms behind the actions of VNS.

Jensen ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 2 Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ) Rationale: rTMS is a noninvasive method for cortical stimulation that is emerging as a new therapeutic tool in epilepsy. The technique is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction where small intracranial electrical currents are induced by a strong rapidly-changing extracranial magnetic field. Limited human trials and animal experiments in our laboratory show acute suppression and reduction in frequency of partial seizures with EEG-guided single pulse and 0.5 Hz rTMS. However, the capacity of rTMS to suppress generalized (absence) seizures has not been thoroughly examined. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether whether 0.5 Hz rTMS can suppress frequent PTZ-induced generalized seizures in a rat absence epilepsy model. Methods: Generalized (absence) seizures were triggered in adult male Long Evans rats (n = 10) with PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.). Immediately after PTZ injection, and thereafter at 30-minute intervals, one group (n = 4) was treated with 0.5 Hz repetitive TMS for 10 minutes (300 stimuli). A second group (n = 6) remained as untreated controls. Continuous EEG was recorded with subdermal wires electrodes for 120 minutes after PTZ injection, and then analyzed for seizure frequency during periods between TMS sessions. Results: (1) Frequent brief absence seizures accompanied by generalized spike-wave discharges on surface EEG were triggered by PTZ injection in all rats. (2) 3/6 untreated rats died within the monitoring period ? 0/4 rats died in the 0.5 Hz rTMS group. (3) Average cumulative seizure frequency was lower in the treated group after 60 min (t = 2.65; p < 0.033), 90 min (t = 2.98; p < 0.021) and 120 min (t = 2.85; p < 0.030) of monitoring. Conclusions: 0.5 Hz rTMS is effective in suppression of generalized seizures in the PTZ absence epilepsy rat model. Or finding may be a step toward eventual treatment of generalized epilepsy with low frequency rTMS.

In the developing rat brain, untreated LiPC-SE results in age dependent hippocampal injury as well as widespread extrahippocampal neuronal damage. We examined whether brief durations of SE are sufficient to induce injury in the immature brain. Methods: EEG data was collected using acquisition software obtained from wireless transponders implanted s.c. in two week old wistar pups. Rats were pretreated with LiCl (3 mEq) on the day of surgery and then subjected to SE 16?20 hr later with pilocarpine (60 mg/kg) at P14. Diazepam (5 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (25 mg/kg) were given after varying durations of SE using EEG recordings to determine both the delay of onset after PC injection, as well as the total duration of SE. 24 hr after the onset, rats were given pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) followed by perfusion/fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were embedded in paraffin and cut at 8 ? intervals. Sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade B (F-J B) as a marker of neuronal injury, and analyzed using a semiquantative scale (0 = no injury, 1 = trace, 2 = < 10%, 3 = 10?25%, 4 = 26?50%, 5 = > 50% F-J B labeled neurons) bilaterally in three sections containing the dorsal hippocampus. Results: SE was established in over 90% of the P14 rats. Behavioral manifestations of seizures appeared almost immediately after PC injection, but synchronized video monitoring revealed a delay of 9.8 ± 1.6 min before the appearance of continuous, rhythmic, high frequency electrographic activity used to mark the onset of SE. Prolonged recordings showed that the combination of diazepam/phenobarbital was sufficient to prevent the return of seizures over the following 24 hr period. While 30 min of SE was not sufficient to induce hippocampal injury with the exception of trace dentate granule cells, injury was seen in the amygdala (2.3 ± 0.1) and cortex (1.8 ± 0.1). No brightly labeled neurons were seen in the thalamus, but some lightly stained, irregularly shaped neurons were detected. Conclusions: Previous studies have shown that P14 rats subjected to LiPC experience several hours of SE resulting in extensive neuronal injury, particularly in the CA1 hippocampal subfield. While early pharmacological intervention was sufficient to protect those neurons from injury, extrahippocampal structures remain vulnerable after only 30 min of SE. Studies in adult rats suggest protection of the Ammon's horn alone is not sufficient to prevent epilepsy. 25% of untreated P14 rats undergoing LiPC-SE go on to demonstrate spontaneous seizures. Whether the neuronal injury that results after only 30 min is sufficient to induce epilepsy is under investigation.

Both loss and gain of FLN-A function have been proposed to disrupt the migration initiation of cortical neurons. Here we show that MEKK4 (a MAP3K member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway) is involved in Fln-A regulation and PVNH formation. Methods: We performed histological analyses on the brains of MEKK4-deficient mice. Additionally, we designed short interference RNA (siRNA) constructs targeting MEKK4, incorporated these constructs into the developing cerebral cortex by in utero electroporation and analyzed the fates of transfected cells. Immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, GST-pulldown and western blot analyses were also performed Results: MEKK4?/? mice develop bilateral PVNH in the cerebral cortex that arise from breaches in ventricular surface lining. Using neuronal markers, we show that cells within PVNH have differentiated and failed to migrate into the cortical plate. In utero electoporation of MEKK4 siRNA at E14.5 and analysis at P0 revealed dramatic disruption of migration-initiation of cortical neurons compared to control. Analysis of Fln-A expression in MEKK4?/? forebrain revealed elevated and ectopic Fln-A, while MEKK4 RNAi increased Fln-A phosphorylation in vitro. Finally, recombinant-MKK4/SEK1 protein precipitated a complex containing MEKK4 and Fln-A suggesting that MKK4/SEK1 bridges these molecules during development. Conclusions: Disrupted migration initiation in MEKK4-deficient cells may be related to both defects of the ventricular surface lining and dysregulated Fln-A. Our data demonstrate an essential role for MEKK4 in the migration of developing cortical neurons and provide insight into the pathogenesis of human PVNH.

HupA reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase and reduces glutamate-induced neuronal death as an NMDA receptor antagonist. We previously reported that huperzine potently protects mice against clonic seizures induced by s.c. pentylenetetrazol at 1 mg/kg (White, 2005) with a TD50 of 0.83 mg/kg. We now report results from the 6-Hz model of psychomotor seizures. Methods: Anesthetic/electrolyte solution (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride in 0.9% saline) was applied to the eyes of male, 18?25 g CF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) prior to placement of corneal electrodes. Seizures induced by 6-Hz corneal stimulation (Barton, 2001) using three levels of stimulation ? 22, 32 and 44 mA ? (3 sec duration) were assessed at various times after i.p. administration of 0.09 ? 1.1 mg/kg HupA. Median effective doses (ED50) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each the three current stimulations evaluated. Results: ED50 values for i.p. HupA were 0.28, 0.34 and 0.78 mg/kg for 22, 32, and 44 mA, respectively. The following results were observed at the highest doses tested at each stimulation level: at 22 mA, 7/8 animals were protected with a dosage of 0.7 mg/kg; at 32 mA, 8/8 animals were protected with 0.83 mg/kg; and at 44 mA, 6/8 animals were protected with 1.1 mg/kg. Conclusions: HupA produced a potent anticonvulsant effect in the 6-Hz model of psychomotor seizures at all stimulation levels tested and with ED50 values less than the TD50, suggesting a possible advantage over phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and topiramate, each of which display limited efficacy in this model at doses devoid of behavioral toxicity. Further, the less than 2-fold ratio of dosages effective across the range of stimulations suggests a possible advantage over other drugs active in this model such as levetiracetam. These findings and the known action of huperzine as an NMDA receptor antagonist warrant further pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. References Barton ME et al. Epilepsy Res 2001;47:217?27.

Recordings in A/J mice confirmed that the onset of behavioral status reflected the onset of electrographic status (n = 4). All DBA mice demonstrated neuronal loss in CA3 (n = 6/6), but all A/J mice did not (n = 3/6). Neuronal loss was detected in area CA1 in DBA (n = 3/6) but not A/J mice (n = 0/6). Both strains demonstrated NPY expression in mossy fibers (A/J: n = 5/6; DBA: n = 4/5). There were more EGCs in DBA mice (A/J: 3029.9 ± 1053.4 cells/hippocampus, n = 4; DBA: 9590.2 ± 1979.2, n = 6; p < 0.05). Conclusions: A/J and DBA/2J mice show differences in acute behavioral and long-term anatomical changes with the pilocarpine model. Differences suggest that use of one variable to define susceptibility can be misleading. The results suggest guidelines for future studies of strain-dependent seizure susceptibility, and characterize an infrequently-studied strain for QTL mapping of seizure susceptibility.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the ability of viral vector-mediated hippocampal overexpression of GDNF to supress seizures and alter seizure-induced cell death and neurogenesis. Methods: A recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) encoding for GDNF or GFP (control) was injected in multiple sites of the hippocampal formation of rats. A recording/stimulating electrode was placed in the ventral hippocampus, and animals were stimulated either for 1 s once daily, inducing kindling epileptogenesis, or for 1 h continously to induce self-sustained status epilepticus (SE). Kindled animals were re-stimulated (i.e. re-kindled) four weeks following termination of kindling to assess the sustainability of hyperexcitability. Behavioural seizure activity (graded according to the scale of Racine) and EEG were recorded throughout the experiments. All experiments were conducted according to international ethical guidelines for animal care and were approved by the local ethical comittee. Results: Using the kindling model, we found that transfection with rAAV-GDNF decreased the number of generalized seizures, prevented an increase of the duration of behavioural convulsions seen in re-kindled control animals, and increased the threshold for induction of re-kindled seizures. In the SE-model of epilepsy, animals overexpressing GDNF developed fewer generalized stage 5 seizures and exhibited a significantly better survival rate following SE. We further found that in GDNF-overexpressing animals, a higher proportion of new-born (BrdU+) cells acquired a neuronal fate, as determined by staining for DCX and Neun, compared to control animals. The SE-induced damage in hippocampal CA1/CA3 and dentate gyrus, as assessed by fluorojade staining, was unchanged by rAAV-GDNF transfection. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that rAAV-mediated gene transfer is a feasible method for long-term delivery of GDNF to the seizure focus, and that such GDNF overexpression is able to suppress seizures in different animal models of epilepsy.

Mareci ( 1 Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 2 Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; 3 Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 4 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: We used an 11.1 Tesla (T) magnet to determine in vivo temporal hippocampal and parahippocampal structural changes in the latent period of epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We also determined if chronic microelectrodes distort MR images to assess the feasibility of MRI with electrophysiological arrays. Methods: Fifty micron gold plated tungsten wires (2) were implanted in the ventral hippocampus in Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4). Spontaneously seizing rats were obtained following experimentally inducted status epilepticus (SE). Rats were video recorded to capture spontaneous seizures. An MRI compatible stereotaxic frame was developed, to allow repeatable positioning under isoflurane in the 11.1T/40 cm bore magnet, along with a 3 cm, 150 degree arc, linear surface MR coil. Rats were imaged pre/post wire implantation and after SE at 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, 60 days. T2-weighted images were collected and quantified. Results: Brain images and wire locations were obtained with the stereotaxic frame, which provided a repeatable platform. Significantly increased T2 values were observed in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, particularly on the contralateral side to stimulation, in three out of four rats. T2-weighted images of the first rat showed a contralaterally growing volume of hyper-intense tissue in the hippocampus and amygdala (Fig. 1). The brain of the second rat did not change; the wires were medial to the hippocampus near the alveus. The third rat showed hyper-intensity in the contralateral amygdala, with wires in the ventral hippocampus. The fourth rat was hyper-intense in both sides of the hippocampus and amygdala by day 3, but slightly decreased in time, with wires in the hippocampus near the alveus. Conclusions: Unilateral electrically induced SE produces bilateral structural changes in the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. Stereotaxic images allowed repeated measures of the structural changes during epileptogenesis. The implanted wires produced minimal distortions. Their positioning in the ventral hippocampus may play a role in which structures show changes. Future work will relate the physiological and structural changes during epileptogenesis using electrophysiology and high resolution MRI.

Farber ( 1 Sleep Disturbance Research, VA GLAHS, North Hills, CA ) Rationale: To describe some similarities and dissimilarities between feline epilepsy models, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) and Electrical Status Epilepticus in Slow-sleep (ESES) with respect to sleep state modulation, neurobehavioral consequences and early intervention. Methods: The sleep-wake state distribution of seizures and neurobehavioral consequences were quantified in relation to monoamine concentrations (microdialysis) as well as before and after lesions, systemic and localized drug administration and/or photic stimulation in feline epilepsy models (n = 86), mostly in the amygdala kindling epilepsy model. 1 Similarities and Dissimilarities of age-related amygdala kindling in kittens to Electrical status epilepticus (ESES) and/or Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) SIMILARITIES DISSIMILARITIES AGE DEPENDENCY Critical period for onset GTCs can last to adulthood in kittens SPONTANEOUS SEIZURE-RELATED SYMPTOMATOLOGY: Seizure types (GTCs, partial motor, atypical absence, complex-partial); IID types ?

Results: 1) Table 1 compares the kindling model to LKS and ESES with respect to sleep state modulation, spontaneous neurobehavioral consequences and early intervention. 2) Neural generators of synchronous EEG oscillations (tonic background slow waves and sleep EEG transients), can combine to promote electrographic seizure propagation during NREM; antigravity muscle tone permits seizure-related movement. 3) Neural generators of asynchronous neuronal discharge patterns can reduce electrographic seizures during REM sleep; skeletal motor paralysis blocks seizure-related movement during REM. 4) Neurobehavioral consequences depend on the site of the focus, regardless of overt histopathological change in the young. 5) The prognosis is best with early intervention. Conclusions: The kindling process is thought to have trans-synaptic effects on cells distal to the kindled focus. Age-related changes could underlie the progression of epileptic and non-epileptic symptoms in kindled kittens, LKS and ESES. 1 Ajay K. Srivastava, and 1 H. Steve White ( 1 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Recently we have characterized the pharmacology of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the lamotrigine (LTG)-resistant pentylenetetrazlole kindled (Epilepsia 2003; 44,42) and LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat (Epilepsia 2004; 45(7):12). In this model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, CBZ, PHT, and TPM were all inactive at non-toxic doses. In contrast, VPA and retigabine (Epilepsia 2005;46(8):217) were both effective. The broad-spectrum AED felbamate (FBM) displays a favorable preclinical profile in various models of epilepsy including the phenytoin-resistant amygdala kindled rat (Neuropharmacology 2000;39(10):1893?903). The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of FBM in the LTG-resistant amygdala kindled rat model of refractory epilepsy. Methods: Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were kindled via basolateral amygdala stimulation according to the method described by Srivastava et al., (Epilepsia 2004; 45(7):12). One hour before each kindling stimulation, rats in the control group received 0.5% methylcellulose and rats in the experimental group received LTG (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Seizure severity and afterdischarge duration was recorded after each kindling stimulation. Treatment was continued until all rats displayed 4 consecutive Stage 5 seizures (Clin Neurophysiol 1972; 32:281?294). Two days later, both groups were challenged with 15 mg/kg, i.p LTG to confirm LTG-sensitivity (control) and LTG-resistance (experimental). The efficacy of FBM (100, 150 and 200, mg/kg administered 90 min prior to kindling stimulation) was then evaluated. The ED50 and 95% confidence intervals were calulated using Probit analysis. Results: Felbamate dose-dependently reduced the seizure severity and decreased the ADD in the fully kindled LTG-resistant rat. At the highest dose tested (200 mg/kg), FBM decreased the seizure score from 5 ± 0 to 2.25 ± 0.6 and the ADD from 57 ± 5 sec. to 22 ± 30 sec. The calculated ED50 and (95% confidence intervals) for FBM against Stage 4 and 5 seizures was 169 and (131 ? 206) mg/kg, respectively. Conclusions: In an animal model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy, the broad-spectrum AED FBM was found to effectively block the fully kindled secondarily generalized kindled seizure. In this particular model, FBM is as effective as VPA and the investigational AED retigabine (albeit less potent than retigabine). These findings demonstrated that the LTG-resistant kindled rat can be utilized to differentiate the AED profile of novel AEDs and confirm that FBM possesses a unique profile relative to CBZ, PHT, LTG, and TPM. Ongoing studies continue to evaluate the mechanism underlying the development of pharmaco-resistance in this model.

Steve White ( 1 Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ; and 2 Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of childhood death and disability. Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) and cognitive disabilities are common sequelae that may manifest years after TBI. PTE afflicts 10% of children after severe TBI but remains poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that TBI during brain development increases seizure susceptibility later in life, we used standard electrical stimulation techniques to assess seizure thresholds in a rat TBI model. Methods: Immature, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20/grp) underwent TBI by controlled cortical impact (6-mm rounded tip, 4 m/sec velocity, 2-mm deformation, 100 msec duration) to left parietal cortex using isoflurane anesthesia (1%) on post-natal day (PND) 16?18. Results were compared to those obtained from age-matched sham (craniotomy only using isoflurane) and naive rats (n = 20/grp). Seizure thresholds were assessed during adolescence and adulthood for tonic (PND 34 and 60), clonic (PND 37 and 63) and limbic (PND 40) seizures. Full convulsive current (CC) curves were generated by staircase procedure and the median CC (CC50) was calculated using Probit analysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Tonic and clonic seizure thresholds increased with age in naive rats (p < 0.05). As shown in Table 1, seizure responses during adolescence (PND 34?40) were similar among groups for tonic and clonic seizures; however, limbic seizure responses showed a trend toward lower thresholds after TBI. In adults (PND 60?63), tonic seizure thresholds were decreased in both sham and TBI (vs. naive) groups. Conversely, clonic seizure thresholds were similar among sham and naive rats but decreased after TBI (vs. either naive or sham). Conclusions: TBI to left parietal cortex during brain development attenuates normal maturational increases in clonic seizure thresholds and may increase susceptibility to limbic seizures. Given the involvement of frontal cortex and limbic system in learning and decision-making functions, this finding may have implications not only for PTE, but also for post-injury learning and behavioral deficits. Delineation of the incidence of PTE and cognitive deficits, as well as further characterization of longitudinal maturational changes in seizure thresholds post-TBI are ongoing. 1 Seizure Thresholds Tonic Clonic Limbic adolescent ?naive 27.7 (25.1, 30.5) 12.3 (10.4, 13.9) 89.0 (87.6, 90.5) ?sham 30.4 (29.0, 33.0) 13.7 (12.0, 15.5) 87.8 (86.4, 89.2) ?TBI 26.9 (23.7, 29.6) 11.6 (9.7, 13.5) 87.2 (85.4, 88.9)# adult ?naive 36.5 (35.1, 37.8) 15.0 (13.7, 16.3) ?sham 34.5 (33.8, 35.8)* 14.8 (13.5, 16.1) ?TBI 33.7 (32.1, 35.3)* 12.0 (10.3, 13.7)*?

Stewart, 2 Robert S. Fujinami, 1 Karen S. Wilcox, and 1 H. Steve White ( 1 Pharmacology  and 2 Neurology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Viral infections of the CNS are associated with a significantly increased risk for seizures and epileptogenesis. Up to 50% of adult-onset epilepsy cases in developing countries are associated with CNS infection. To our knowledge, no available animal model accurately reproduces the pathology of human encephalitis-induced epilepsy. We have established an animal model where infection of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leads to the development of seizures during the acute encephalomyelitis phase of infection. Stage 4/5 seizures (Racine, Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophys. 32: 281?94, 1972) occur in approximately 50% the mice between 3?10 days post infection and appear to remit as the infection clears. The present study tested the hypothesis that seized mice have altered seizure thresholds post inoculation, which increases their risk for the development of spontaneous seizures. Methods: B6 mice were infected intracerebrally with the Daniel's strain of TMEV (TMEV-DA). Animals were monitored for the development of seizures and separated into two groups: seized versus non-seized. Two months after infection with 3 ? 105 PFU TMEV-DA, minimal clonic and maximal tonic hindlimb extension (THE) seizure thresholds of seized and non-seized mice were assessed by electroconvulsive seizure testing (EST). Additionally, the rate of corneal kindling acquisition (number of stimulations required to reach fully kindled state, i.e., 3 consecutive Stage 5 seizures) was assessed to determine whether TMEV inoculation leads to an increased rate of kindling. Results: At two months post infection, seized mice had a significantly lower minimal clonic seizure threshold compared to the non-seized mice (seized CC50= 6.7 mA, non-seized CC50= 7.8 mA, p < 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant difference in maximal THE seizure thresholds between the seized and non-seized mice (seized and non-seized CC50= 13.5 mA, p < 0.99). In a preliminary study to assess acquisition rate of corneal kindling, 8/8 seized mice displayed fully generalized Stage 5 seizures, versus 5/8 non-seized mice. Furthermore, seized mice had much shorter latencies to generalized seizures than non-seized mice. Conclusions: The results obtained in the present study demonstrate altered seizure susceptibility following recovery from seizures associated with TMEV- induced encephalitis. Furthermore, they suggest that these animals may be more susceptible to epileptogenesis following subsequent challenges. Although preliminary, these results further support this as a model of encephalitis- induced hyperexcitability.

An international team has been assembled to identify Asian herbal medicines used for epilepsy, isolate their constituent compounds, and test these compounds in established animal models of epilepsy and in vitro assays to determine their potential mechanisms of action. We report the preliminary findings from the first herbal medicine to be evaluated. Methods: Five pure compounds were isolated from an Asian herbal extract commonly used for epilepsy and were designated ADD 377008, 377009, 377010, 377011, and 377012 by the NIH/NINDS Anticonvulsant Screening Project. Compounds were assessed in the mouse maximal electroshock and s.c. Metrazol (pentylenetetrazol; s.c. Met) models of generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, respectively, following p.o. administration to Swiss-Webster mice. Minimal motor impairment was evaluated in the rotarod test. Four of the compounds were tested for effects against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures derived from rat cortex (Sun et al., NeuroSignals 2003;12:31?8). Results: ADD 377010 protected 5/5 animals after a dose of 300 mg/kg (i.p.) in the scMET model and had no effect in the MES model. No other compound was active up to 300 mg/kg in either model, and none caused motor impairment. All four compounds tested prevented NMDA receptor-mediated cytotoxicity when co-applied with NMDA. Conclusions: Compounds isolated from an Asian herbal medicine demonstrate promising activity in the NMDA assay, and one also effectively blocked seizures in the scMET model, suggesting it may be responsible for the anticonvulsant properties of its parent extract. Further evaluations of compounds isolated from herbal medicines used for epilepsy are warranted. (Supported by an American Epilepsy Society Research Infrastructure Award.

Wasterlain ( 1 Epilepsy Research, VA GLAHS, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Neurology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: The role of febrile seizures (FS) in epileptogenesis and the contribution of fever to the long-term consequences of prolonged FS and febrile status epilepticus (SE) are poorly understood. Controversy remains regarding any causal relationship between prolonged FS and temporal lobe epilepsy. This study investigated the contribution of hyperthermia per se to SE-induced epileptogenesis, using the lithium-pilocarpine model of SE in immature rats, and carefully controlling for brain temperature and seizure severity. Methods: SE was induced in rats at postnatal day 10 (P10) by administration of lithium (3mEq/kg, i.p.), and 24 hours later by pilocarpine (60 mg/kg, s.c.). Body temperature was maintained during 30 min of SE at 39 ± 1°C (hyperthermic animals) or at 35 ± 1°C (normothermic animals). SE was terminated by diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Control animals received lithium and diazepam in presence of hyperthermia or normothermia. The course of SE was recorded by video/EEG for 24 hours. The severity of SE was assessed by measuring the following parameters: duration of SE (time of last seizure), and total seizure time (time spent in seizures subtracting interictal time) using Harmonie Software. Separate groups of animals, subjected to SE at P10 without surgery, were monitored four months later for the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) by telemetry/videotape continuously for one month. Results: We were able to control brain and body temperature during and after SE in both study groups: hyperthermic (39 ± 1°C) and normothermic (35 ± 1°C). Terminating SE by diazepam was effective in both groups (10.2 ± 1.5 min in hyperthermic animals and 12.3 ± 2.2 min in normothermic animals). Total seizure time (54.5 ± 15.2 min after SE in hyperthermic animals and 56.7 ± 12.1 min after SE in normothermic animals) and duration of SE (87.2 ± 23.2 min after SE in hyperthermic animals vs. 95.2 ± 28.2 min after SE in normothermic animals) were similar between groups. Only hyperthermic animals developed convulsive seizures (50%). Both groups of animals that experienced SE at P10 developed electrographic seizures 4 months later (83 vs 55%). However, the frequency and seizure severity were significantly higher in hyperthermic animals (12.5 ± 3.5 vs 4.2 ± 2.0 SRS/day). Conclusions: Since the precise role of hyperthermia during SE in long-term consequences such as epileptogenesis and neuronal injury has never been adequately defined, this study tightly controlled seizure duration and seizure severity in order to isolate hyperthermia as the main variable and to study its consequences. In this model, hyperthermia greatly increased the epileptogenicity of SE, leading to subsequent behavioral seizures not seen in the normothermic group, and increased the severity and incidence of spontaneous electrographic seizures.

Sudbury, and 1,2 Massimo Avoli ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ; and 2 Human Physiology and Pharmacology, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy ) Rationale: The participation of the insular cortex (IC) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has long been suggested from studies of human epileptic patients; however, its network interactions with the perirhinal cortex (PC) and hippocampus remain uninvestigated. Here, we used a hippocampus-parahippocampus-IC rat brain slice to provide the first characterization of network epileptiform interactions among these structures during application of the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Methods: Brain slices (450 ?m) were prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Field potential recordings were acquired using ACSF-filled glass electrodes positioned within area CA3 of the hippocampus, the PC and the IC. 4-AP (50 ?M) was bath applied to induce epileptiform synchronous network activity. Results: 4-AP induced three types of epileptiform activity: (i) fast interictal events (duration = 0.1?0.2 s; interval of occurrence = 0.7?1.2 s) that were mainly observed in CA3 as well as (ii) slow interictal (duration = 0.5?2.0 s; interval of occurrence = 4.0?21.7 s) and (iii) prolonged ictal-like (duration = 11.3?48.7 s; interval of occurrence = 17.9?332 s) that occurred synchronously among the PC and the IC and occasionally entered the hippocampus. Only slow interictal discharges were present in PC and IC in 15/30 slices. Moreover, slow interictal and ictal events were generated by the IC following surgical isolation. Ictal discharges were abolished by NMDA receptor antagonism while interictal activity persisted. Further antagonism of non-NMDA glutamatergic receptors abolished interictal discharges and disclosed slow field potentials that recurred at intervals of 11.4?28.0 s in all structures. Bath application of the ?-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4-,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAGO, 10?M) significantly reduced the occurrence of these slow potentials in all structures (n = 5); this effect was reversible with naloxone methiodide (20?M). Application of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (50?M) abolished these field potentials. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that epileptiform activity occurs synchronously among PC and IC networks, while analogous activity can be generated independently within the isolated IC. These observations suggest that the network characteristics necessary and sufficient to initiate epileptiform network events are present within the IC.

Roopra ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: During investigation of mechanisms of the ketogenic diet, the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG had unexpected anticonvulsant and antiepileptic effects in hippocampal slices and against seizures evoked by kindling of the perforant path. Anticonvulsant and antiepileptic properties of 2DG were further characterized by kindling of olfactory bulb and in screening models in cooperation with the NINDS Antiepileptic Screening Program (ASP). Cognitive and systemic toxicity was examined in rats receiving 2DG for as long as 6 months. Methods: Rats received olfactory bulb or perforant path kindling stimulation twice daily with 1-sec trains of 60-Hz 1-ms pulses at the lowest intensity evoking ADs by a standardized protocol. Interictal and ictal burst frequencies were examined in rat hippocampal slices in 7.5 mM [K+]o. 2DG was evaluated in NINDS ASP screening models in rats and mice including maximal electroshock, subcutaneous metrazol, 6-Hz stimulation, and Frings audiogenic mice. Cognitive effects were evaluated in rats in the Morris water maze. Results: Application of 2DG (10mM) to hippocampal slices in 7.5 mM [K+]o reduced CA3 interictal bursts by ?40% and ictal bursts by 60%. 2DG (250 mg/kg) 30 min before kindling of perforant path in rats induced a 2-fold increase in AD threshold (an anticonvulsant effect) and a 2-fold increase in the number of ADs required to evoke Class V seizures (an antiepileptic effect). In contrast, 2DG prior to olfactory bulb kindling also resulted in 2-fold slowing of kindling progression, but had no effect on AD threshold. Initial evidence of anticonvulsant activity was observed in preliminary screening against seizures evoked by subcutaneous metrazol in rats, by 6-Hz stimulation in mice, and in Fring's audiogenic mice, but not against seizures evoked by maximal electroshock. Additional testing is underway to further characterize the activity found in these models. 2DG at 2 gm/kg daily for 2 weeks in rats had no effect on Morris water maze performance, and body weights of rats receiving 0.5 gm/kg daily for 6 months did not differ from controls. Conclusions: 2DG has novel anticonvulsant and antiepileptic activity against experimental seizures compared to currently available anticonvulsants and a favorable preclinical toxicity profile. Acute anticonvulsant action was observed in vitro against both interictal and ictal discharges. Robust chronic antiepileptic action against kindling progression was independent of the seizure initiation site, but anticonvulsant action against AD threshold was stimulation site specific. The in vivo chronic effects on kindled seizures have been associated with a novel mechanism of antiglycolytic metabolic suppression of seizure-induced BDNF and trkB expression by the NADH sensor CtBP and the transcription factor NRSF, which regulates neuronal gene expression.

Moreover, neurogliaform cells are the only known cortical cell type that can reliably activate postsynaptic GABAA and GABAB receptors after discharging a single action potential. Using three-dimensional light microscopic reconstructions and correlated electron microscopic investigations, we found that neurogliaform cells formed synapses (62 ± 28 ?m) closer to the soma of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells than Martinotti cells (102 ± 48 ?m) that evoked faster inhibitory responses. Thus, the slow kinetic properties of GABAA responses evoked by neurogliaform cells can not be explained exclusively by the dendritic localization of the synapses. However, there is a twofold difference in unitary axon densities between neurogliaform cells and other interneurons (0.954 ± 0.299 and 0.453 ± 0.015 ?m axon in 1000 ?m3).We propose that neurogliaform cells release GABA all over their dense axonal field to activate GABA receptors on dendrites present in the axonal cloud. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we studied the physiological properties of responses between neurogliaform cells, other identified interneurons and layer 2/3 pyramidal cells using whole cell patch clamp recording in neocortical slices with the AMPA, NMDA and GABAB receptors blocked. Results: Neurogliaform cells evoked slower GABAA currents (10?90% rise time: 4.5 ± 1.6 ms, weigthed decay time constant: 42 ± 9.7 ms, amplitude: 97 ± 69 pA) than basket cells (10?90% rise time: 0.7 ± 0.2 ms, weigthed decay time constant: 8.1 ± 1.9 ms, amplitude: 130 ± 109 pA). The variability in amplitudes of neurogliaform cell-evoked IPSCs (0.14 ± 0.04, S.D./mean) was much less than in the basket cell-evoked responses (0.29 ± 0.1). Furthermore, gradual changing of extracellular calcium resulted in continuous increases in the amplitude of the responses. Blocking of GABA transporter 1 by NO-711 dramatically increased the decay time constant of neurogliaform cell-evoked IPSCs (by 203 ± 110%) and did not affect basket cell-evoked IPSCs. The low affinity, competitive antagonist of GABAA receptors, TPMPA had a larger effect (58 ± 17%) on the amplitude the neurogliaform cells effect compared to basket cells (35 ± 17%). Alfa1 subunit specific GABAA agonists (zolpidem, Cl218,872) had significant effets on the neurogliaform cell-evoked responses. However, the properties of this modulatory action was different than on basket cell-evoked IPSCs. Conclusions: These results indicate that a spill-over-like mechanism of GABA release takes place following single action potentials in neurogliaform cells, in contrast to the more conventional basket cell synapses. These data suggest that neurogliaform play highly specialized role in regulating neuronal activity in the cortical networks.

This study compared changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) during intermittent light stimulation (ILS) between photosensitive and asymptomatic baboons. Methods: Six photosensitive and four asymptomatic baboons, matched for age, gender and weight, were selected based upon previous scalp EEG evaluation. Continuous intravenous ketamine (5?13 mg/kg) was used for sedation. Subjects underwent five sequential blood flow PET studies within 60 minutes using 20 mCi 15O-labelled water. Images were acquired in 3D mode (CTI/Siemens HR+ scanner, 63 contiguous slices, 2.4mm thickness). Three resting scans were alternated with two activation scans. ILS was performed at 25 Hz for 60 seconds before to 60 seconds after the start of an activation scan. PET images were coregistered with MRI (3T Siemens Trio, T1-weighted 3D sequence, TE = 6, TR = 14, TI = 800msec, flip angle 19°, NEX = 6). PET scans were reviewed and corrected for motion artifact. Resting scans were contrasted with activation scans and averaged independently for both groups. Results: The controls showed greatest ILS-induced activation in the left middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri, left brainstem structures and right postcentral gyrus, and bilaterally in the occipital lobes, posterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. In contrast, the photosensitive animals showed strongest ILS activation in the right anterior cingulate and medial orbital gyri, amygdala, globus pallidum, left inferior and superior temporal gyri, and the pineal gland. A striking finding was the absence of occipital activation during ILS in the photosensitive animals. Deactivations were noted in the right orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in the controls, and in the posterior cingulate gyrus, brainstem and cerebellum of the photosensitive animals. Conclusions: The patterns of ILS-induced CBF changes differed between control and photosensitive groups. These differences of activations and inhibitions suggest involvement of specific cortical-subcortical networks in photosensitivity.

White, 2 Krista Gilby, and 2 Dan C. McIntyre ( 1 MIRECC, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA ; and 2 Department of Psychology, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Kindling is a progressive increase in seizure activity following the daily application of focal, low-intensity electrical stimulation of different forebrain regions. Two strains of rats were developed to exhibit different rates of amygdala kindling, and were called Fast and Slow kindlers. These animals also show different response profiles to α2-adrenoreceptor (AR) agonists. Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine α2-AR binding sites and subtype mRNA expression in the CNS of naive Fast and Slow rats. Methods:α2-AR binding sites were measured in naive Fast (n = 8) and Slow (n = 8) kindlers with the α2-AR antagonist [3H]RX821002. α2-AR binding sites were measured in the locus coeruleus (LC), neocortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, septum, amygdala, habenula and hippocampus. α2-AR is composed of three different subtypes. α2A- and α2C-AR mRNA were determined in the CNS of Fast and Slow kindlers by in situ hybridization with oligonucleotides. α2A-AR mRNA was measured in the LC, cortex, septum, hypothalamus and amygdala, and α2C-AR mRNA was measured in the LC, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, caudate and nucleus accumbens. Results:α2-AR binding sites, as determined by [3H]RX821002, were not statistically different between Fast and Slow kindlers in all regions of the CNS. α2A-AR mRNA expression, the subtype responsible for [3H]RX821002 binding, therefore, was not different. However, α2C-AR mRNA expression was different between Fast and Slow kindlers in many regions of the CNS, including nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus granule cell layer, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum and neocortex layer II: in these cases, α2C-AR mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the Slow compared to Fast kindlers. Conclusions: These data indicate a signifcant increase in several brain structures in the α2C-AR mRNA expression in Slow versus the Fast kindlers. These differences in α2C-AR mRNA may explain the different α2 adrenergic pharmacological profiles between the two strains, and speak additionally to adrenergic involvement in epileptogenesis.

Epileptogenesis in EL mice is thought to be caused by collapse of redox state induced by either decreased antioxidant protection or excessive free radical formation. However, measurement of reductants in brain tissue extracts is problematic because synergistic actions of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol or glutathione are effective in scavenging free radicals. Using in vivo methods we developed, we evaluated hippocampal antioxidant ability in EL mice with X-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and microdialysis. Methods: Using sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, each mouse underwent stereotactic implantation of guide cannula into the ventral hippocampus. EL mice were injected i.p. with the nitroxide radical 3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl (PCAM) at 677 micromol/kg (3.3 ml saline/kg). Following PCAM injection sequential measurements with EPR were used to monitor levels of nitroxide radicals in the extracellular fluid of the hippocampus. In vivo antioxidant efficacy was estimated based on the principle that PCAM loses paramagnetism and that the decay rate of the EPR signal expressed as half life will reflect tissue antioxidant efficacy. Animals used included experimental groups of 6 five week old and 6 eight week old EL mice; all animals were interictal. Mice from the originating strain of EL mice, DDY mice of similar age, were used as controls. Results: EPR half-life in the five week old mice was equal to control. However, by eight weeks there was significant prolongation in EPR half-life in EL mice when compared to both control groups of DDY mice. None of the EL mice used in this experiment were subjected to seizure-inducing stimulation and they remained in the interictal state. Conclusions: Since five week EL mice do not seize in response to tossing stimulus while by eight weeks EL mice are subject to seizures, we concluded that the decreased in vivo antioxidant ability is a fundamental change related to development of seizures.

However, the effect of focal cooling on seizures arising from the temporal lobe has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We devised an apparatus for the cooling of the hippocampus in order to examine the effect of focal cooling on experimental hippocampal seizures. Methods: We developed a cooling needle (measuring 1 mm diameter and 6mm length) made of copper which was attached to a thermoelectric (Peltier) chip. Next, experiments were performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats under halothane anesthesia. The cooling needle, a thermocouple and a needle electrode for the EEG recording were then inserted into the right hippocampus after performing a craniotomy. Kainic acid (KA) (1 mg/ml, 1 ?l) was injected into the left hippocampus to provoke epileptiform discharges (EDs). Thereafter, focal cooling was started and it was continued for 5 minutes after confirming the appearance of EDs in the right hippocampus which had been provoked by the KA in the contralateral hippocampus. Results: The temperatures of the cooled site in the hippocampus were 9°C in the center, while they were under 25°C within 2.4 mm in radius from the cooling center in phantom experiments using the cooling device.The EDs began to significantly decrease in amplitude from 90 seconds after the start of cooling (p < 0.01). The mean amplitudes of the EDs were suppressed to 68.1 ± 4.8% at the end of the cooling and then stayed low values during the subsequent period. The temperatures of the cooling site were maintained at 33.1 ± 0.7°C before cooling and then they decreased to 14.5 ± 1.3°C finally. Conclusions: We confirmed that hippocampal cooling suppressed the EDs provoked by KA injection in the contralateral hippocampus. Our results therefore seem to suggest that hippocampal cooling may thus be a potentially useful minimally invasive therapy, which might thus be able to replace the need to perform a temporal lobectomy. 1 Kristina Surdova, 1 Erik Taub?ll, 2 Anette Krogenæs, 2 Ellen Dahl, 2 Jan L. Lyche, 2 Irma C. Oskam, and 2 Erik Ropstad ( 1 Department of Neurology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; and 2 Department of Production Animal Sciences, Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: It is well known that valproate (VPA) affects endocrine function. There are, however, contradictory reports in the literature as to whether or not VPA affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Such effects, if present, are important since this hormonal axis is crucial in the homeostasis of fundamental bodily functions and in regulation of stress responses. In the present study the effects of VPA exposure on basal and stress-induced cortisol was investigated in male adolescent goats. Methods: Twenty-three bucks aged 2 months at the start of experiment were given VPA mixture (n = 16) or control solution (n = 7) perorally twice daily for 8 months. VPA mixture was given in single doses up to 62.5 mg/kg to sustain therapeutic plasma concentrations (300?600 ?mol/l). In Experiment 1, blood samples were analyzed for cortisol weekly from weeks 35 to 50 of the year. In experiment 2, bucks aged 9 months were exposed to a period of mild stress associated with blood sampling from indwelling jugular vein catheters every 15 minutes for 7 hours. The effects of VPA on plasma cortisol concentration were studied in repeated measured mixed model analyses. Results: VPA treated bucks in experiment 1 had significantly lower basal cortisol concentrations than control animals during the study period (F1,14= 6.22, p = 0.026). A significant time effect (F7,98 = 5.92, p < 0.0001) was found with a decrease in basal cortisol plasma concentrations towards the end of the study period. A significant time/treatment interaction (F7,98= 2.63, p = 0.016) was found with a more pronounced decrease in plasma cortisol in the control group than in the treated group. In experiment 2 the cortisol response to mild stress was different in the VPA group compared to control. Overall, there was a lower cortisol response in the VPA group compared with controls. Mean basal plasma cortisol concentration was 2 ng/ml in both groups. During the first period of mild stress plasma cortisol concentration in the control group was 4?8 ng/ml compared to 3?6 ng/ml in the VPA group. In both groups cortisol decreased after 1.5 hours of blood sampling. The group difference was significant when only main effects were included in the model (F1,14= 47.2, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: VPA exposure was associated with a significant reduction in both basal and stress-induced plasma cortisol concentration in male adolescent goats. The observed effects can be a potential problem with long-term VPA treatment. On the other hand, it may be speculated that the reduction in cortisol levels and reduced response to mild stress could be related to the mood stabilizing effect of VPA. 1 Michael R. Taylor, 1 Matthew T. Dinday, 2 Sally Chege, and 1,2 Scott C. Baraban ( 1 Neurological Surgery, UCSF, San Francisco, CA ; and 2 Graduate Program In Neuroscience, UCSF, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Studies from humans, rodents, and fruit flies have identified dozens of single gene mutations that result in heritable forms of epilepsy or increased seizure susceptibility. Although this genetic basis for epilepsy and seizure susceptibility is well established, there have been no efforts to identify gene mutations conferring seizure resistance. Large-scale mutagenesis screening in simple vertebrates offers a powerful approach to further studies of the genetic basis of epilepsy. Here we describe the initial results of the first forward-genetic screen to identify seizure resistant zebrafish mutants. Methods: Approximately 5,000 F1 adult fish were generated from matings between ENU-treated males and wild-type females. From these founders 1,896 F2 families were generated and ?500,000 F3 larvae were used for screening. Using a behavioral assay, we isolated several seizure-resistant (SR) familes based on their ability to survive prolonged exposure to the convulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). All SR mutants were further characterized by examining resistance to another convulsant (pilocarpine), tracking behavioral responses, and recording electrical activity. In addition, mutants were genetically mapped by bulked-segregant analysis, and recombination analysis with microsatellite markers was used for fine-mapping. Results: Six seizure-resistant mutant families were identified in a forward-genetic screen over a four-year period. One mutant, s198, was also shown to be resistant in a pilocarpine survival assay, suggesting multi-convulsant resistance. Three of the mutants exhibited reduced behavioral activity upon acute PTZ exposure (s139, s333  and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: Treiman et al. (Epilepsy Res 5:49?60, 1990) described five stages of progressive electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during clinical and experimental status epilepticus (SE), which reflect the underlying severity of the episode of SE. Longer duration of SE and later EEG stages translate to increased problematic cessation of seizures, perhaps due to progressive attenuation of GABA-mediated inhibition. We hypothesized that marked electrophysiologic changes in GABAA receptor function correlate with a specific EEG stage during experimental SE in rats. Methods: Ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were injected (i.p.) with 3 mM LiCl followed by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine 24 h later to induce SE. Animals were sacrificed before initiation of SE (control), or during EEG Stages I, III, or V, and brains were rapidly removed, placed in cold (4°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for 1 min, sliced using a vibratome, and then oxygenated for 1 h in ACSF at room temperature. Paired-pulse responses with interpulse intervals (IPI) of 30, 50, 100 and 150 msec were induced by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and recorded from the cell-body layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. ? oscillations (30?80 Hz) were then elicited by tetanic stimulation at a voltage twice that of threshold and were also recorded from CA1. Some Stage V hippocampal slices were perfused with 100 ?M GABA or 1 ?M diazepam following initial electrophysiological recordings. Results: Paired-pulse stimulation resulted in increased inhibition in Stage I hippocampal slices compared to control slices (p < 0.05, IPI = 50 msec) but decreased inhibition in Stage V slices compared to Stage I slices (p < 0.05, IPI = 50 msec). ? oscillations were progressively attenuated in slices from later EEG stages. Amplitude (p < 0.01), duration (p < 0.05) and spike count (p < 0.05) were all reduced in Stage V slices compared to control slices. Perfusion with GABA, and to a lesser extent with diazepam, resulted in recovery of ? oscillations in Stage V slices. Conclusions: These results are consistent with other reports of attenuation of GABA-mediated inhibition during prolonged SE, which may explain the increased refractoriness of later stages of SE to treatment. In addition, our results indicate a possible impairment of presynaptic release of GABA occurred in this model. This observation suggests GABA reuptake inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. We also report the new finding that paired-pulse inhibition is greater during Stage I compared to control slices and speculate that this may represent an initial compensatory response to excessive excitation before GABA-mediated inhibition begins to deteriorate as SE progresses.

Garvey ( 1 Neurology Research, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 2 Harrington Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ ) Rationale: There is a need for more effective drugs for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) but testing potential SE drugs in human patients is difficult. The cobalt-homocysteine model of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) (Epilepsy Res 2:79?86, 1988) can be used to predict the median effective dose (ED50) and median effective concentration (EC50) of drugs against SE. We used this experimental model to study the potential efficacy of levetiracetam in the treatment of GCSE. Methods: 135 male 200?300 gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 4 stainless steel epidural electrodes for EEG recording. 2.5 mg powered cobalt was placed under the left frontal electrode. When the rat exhibited interictal polyspikes and/or right UE twitching, SE was induced by injecting 8 mM homocysteine thiolactone IP. Immediately after the 2nd GTC seizure, levetiracetam (LTA) was administered IP and was considered effective if no further seizures occurred 10?30 minutes after injection. Animals were euthanized at 30 minutes after onset of SE and blood and brains collected for LTA determination by HPLC. Because LTA was not effective alone, its ED50 was determined after administration of 0.1 mg/kg diazepam (ED50 of DZM alone =? 5 mg/kg), using doses from 0 to 1000 mg/kg. The neuroprotective potential of LTA was determined by comparing visual-spatial performance in a Morris Water maze at various EEG stages of SE with and without LTA (500 mg/kg). Results: LTA alone at doses of 10 to 6000 mg/kg was not effective at stopping GCSE in the cobalt-homocysteine model. The ED50 of LTA, when given in combination with 0.1 mg/kg DZM, was 550 mg/kg (CI 385?800 mg/kg), based on doses from 0?800 mg/kg. Paradoxically, at 1000 mg/kg only 14% of the rats stopped GCSE. 500 mg/kg LTA had no neuroprotective effect on water maze performance in rats in which SE was stopped at EEG stage V, whether given during SE (Stage III), or when SE was stopped at Stage V. Serum and brain LTA concentrations 30 minutes after administration will be shown. Conclusions: LTA is not effective alone in the cobalt-homocysteine model of GCSE. Its efficacy is enhanced by prior- or co-administration of a subtherapeutic dose of diazepam, but the ED50 is still ? 550 mg/kg. Whether or not LTA should be considered for use in human SE will at least partially depend on the serum concentration that corresponds to the ED50 of 550 mg/kg in this model. If the serum concentration is in a range safe for human administration, it can serve as a target concentration in further study of the potential of LTA in the treatment of human SE. It may be that LTA will be an effective second treatment that should be used to provide long-term protection against relapse in human GCSE after initial use of a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam. (Supported by UCB and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.) 1 Andrew K. Tryba, and 2 Charles J. Marcuccilli ( 1 Physiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ; and 2 Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: The neurotrophin, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), plays a critical role in neural development, migration, plasticity, recovery from injury and learning. In epileptogenic brain areas, such as the temporal lobe, BDNF is up-regulated during repeated seizures, whereby it is proposed to enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission and decrease GABAergic inhibition, enhancing the overall excitability of the network (Neuroscientist. 2005 11(4):282?7). BDNF additionally enhances intrinsic neuronal membrane excitability (Nature 1999;401 (6756):918?21). Thus, BDNF has been proposed to promote epileptiform activity (Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24(1):47?53). Although, BDNF over-expression and exogenous application lead to reduced seizure threshold in experimental models where inhibition is reduced, no one has before shown that BDNF alone induces cortical epileptiform activity. Here, we test the hypothesis that BDNF application can trigger epileptiform activity. Methods: We used brain slice preparations containing temporal lobe cortex of CD-1 mice (age P10-P15), where we simultaneously recorded network population activity and from individual cortical neurons using whole cell current clamp techniques. Results: BDNF application (50ng/mL) triggered paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) bursting (n = 9/10); PDS bursts were NMDA-dependent and blocked by the NMDA antagonist, CPP. BDNF enhanced bursting properties in intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons (n = 3), but not in non-rhythmogenic neurons (n = 7). Application of BDNF also induced seizure-like population activity in some (n = 8) preparations. Conclusions: Our data support our working hypothesis that BDNF can preferentially enhance bursting properties of rhythmogenic neurons that may trigger SLA. Additionally, BDNF can trigger PDS bursting, one of the hallmarks of epilepsy. Thus, our results suggest that BDNF signaling may be involved in the genesis of epilepsy.

Ozen ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; 2 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ; and 3 Neuroconnections Program, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has a long history of therapeutic use in the treatment of a number of neurological disorders, perhaps most effectively for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Neural stimulation may also provide a promising innovative technique for the treatment of pharmacoresistant seizure disorders. While there is experimental and clinical evidence that direct electrical stimulation of deep brain structures can prevent or decrease seizure activity, fundamental questions remain to be resolved including the identification of the most effective brain sites and stimulation parameters, long-term consequences and potential side effects. The mechanism underlying deep brain stimulation is as yet unknown, although it is thought that the application of high-frequency stimulation results in a net inhibitory effect that serves to desynchronize activity, effectively abolishing pathologically synchronized epileptiform activity. This may explain why stimulation of a number of structures have been shown to have anticonvulsant properties. Methods: In this study we examined the effect of high frequency stimulation (applied to a number of subcortical sites) on seizure thresholds of electrically kindled temporal lobe seizures. The DBS consisted of unipolar, biphasic square wave pulses, with pulse durations of 300 ?s, delivered at a frequency of 100 Hz and an intensity of 200 ?A. The DBS was applied 1 second prior to the application of the kindling stimulation to ensure effective activation prior to the seizure inducing stimulus. The seizure activity was scored with respect to the afterdischarge (AD) duration and seizure severity. Results: Preliminary data revealed DBS applied to the entopeduncular nucleus resulted in a strong anticonvulsant effect on the seizure threshold and AD characteristics. We observed the increase in seizure threshold to occur over time which was observed to commence at about the 12th kindling session. The nominal progression in AD characteristics typically observed during kindling were largely absent, with the AD duration becoming shorter, the spike frequency lower and the spike complexity more simplistic. Conclusions: We conclude there may be strong anticonvulsant effects of DBS on temporal cortex seizures that are dependent on the site of stimulation.

Gorter ( 1 Center for Neuroscience, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands ; 2 Epilepsy Institute of the Netherlands, Heemstede, Netherlands ; and 3 Department of (Neuro) Pathology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands ) Rationale: Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been found to be associated with various neurological disorders, including the acquired epilepsies such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, it is not known to what extent the BBB integrity changes during epileptogenesis and whether alterations in BBB permeability may contribute to the development of epilepsy. To get more insight into this, we determined BBB permeability in epileptic rat and human and studied the possible consequences of BBB opening for the subsequent progression of TLE. Methods: BBB permeability was investigated in the rat at different time points after electrically induced SE using various tracers that bind to albumin. The cellular localization of albumin was further investigated using immunocytochemistry in rat and human epileptic brain specimens. In addition, we investigated whether BBB opening was related to seizure progression. Results: In a rat model for TLE, in which epilepsy develops after an electrically induced status epilepticus (SE), the BBB was most affected 1 day after SE in limbic brain regions. Although a partial recovery took place during the latent period, the BBB was still permeable in the chronic epileptic phase. Tracer deposits (albumin) were found in microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Similarly, albumin extravasation in human was most prominent directly after a fatal SE in astrocytes and neurons, and to lesser extent in hippocampi of temporal lobe epilepsy patients. BBB permeability in chronic epileptic rats was positively correlated to seizure frequency. Artificial opening of the BBB by mannitol in the chronic epileptic phase induced a persistent increase in the number of seizures in the majority of rats. Conclusions: These findings indicate that BBB leakage occurs during the latent and chronic epileptic phase and suggest that this permanent disruption can contribute to the progression of epilepsy.

Voskuyl ( 1 Division of Pharmacology, LACDR, Leiden, Netherlands ; 2 LAP 3 Department of Nuclear Medicine  and 4 Epilepsy Institute of the Netherlands (SEIN), Heemstede, Netherlands ) Rationale: The GABAA-receptor plays an important role in epileptogenesis. A key question is whether downregulation or changes in receptor properties are involved in reduced efficacy of antiepileptic drugs, in particular in pharmacoresistance. Recently, a full saturation approach was developed, in which the whole range of receptor occupancies, obtained from a single PET-experiment per animal, was used to calculate both GABAA-receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (KD). This method was used to examine the influence of kindling on Bmax and KD. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were amygdala kindled up to 5 consecutive stage V seizures (n = 12). Implanted but unstimulated rats served as controls (n = 22). The PET experiment was performed 10?14 days after the last seizure. After injection of an excess amount of flumazenil (FMZ) to fully saturate the receptors, the concentration-time curves of FMZ were measured in blood with HPLC-UV and in brain with PET. Next, Bmax and KD were estimated using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling. The model consists of a blood, a tissue and 2 brain (?free? and ?bound?) compartments. The total FMZ concentration in brain, as measured by PET, reflects the sum of ?free? and ?bound? concentrations. In the model, exchange between blood, tissue and ?brain free? compartments is described by first order rate constants, and specific binding depends on both the concentration of free ligand and the concentration of receptors available for binding. Population PK modelling allows for simultaneous analysis of data from all animals, taking interindividual parameter variability into account. Results: In control rats, all model parameters, including specific binding of FMZ in the brain, as characterized by Bmax (14.5 ± 3.7 ng/ml) and KD (4.68 ± 1.5 ng/ml), could be estimated adequately. Kindling did not affect KD, but Bmax decreased to 64 ± 16% of control. This finding corresponds with a reduction in maximal effect of the allosteric modulator midazolam to 72% of control, as reported by Cleton et al. In addition, the volume of distribution of the brain was increased to 180 ± 27% of control, indicating that transport from the brain was decreased. Conclusions: This study shows that the full saturation technique, using a single injection of FMZ, allows detection of moderate reductions in GABAA-receptor density and changes in brain PK. The decreased Bmax may underlie the reduced efficacy of midazolam in kindled rats. In addition, the study shows the feasibility to conduct (longitudinal) studies on epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance development in chronic epilepsy models.

De Lanerolle, and 1 Tore Eid ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; 2 Department of Anatomy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Glutamine synthetase (GS), which converts glutamate to glutamine, is deficient in specific areas of the sclerotic hippocampus in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). A key question is whether hippocampal GS deficiency is causally related to the generation of seizures in MTLE. Methods: The GS inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (MSO) was infused chronically into the hippocampus of rats at the following doses: 1.0 mg/ml (n = 4), 2.5 mg/ml (n = 18), 5.0 mg/ml (n = 11), and 10 mg/ml (n = 39). Saline infused animals (n = 30) were used as controls. The animals underwent long-term intracranial EEG and video monitoring for up to 83 days; the activity of GS was assessed biochemically; and the brain pathology was explored by Nissl- and silver-staining of histological sections. Results: Infusion of MSO, but not saline, caused significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of brain glutamine synthetase. A dose of ≥ 2.5 mg/ml MSO consistently produced spontaneously recurrent seizures (stages I ? IV) after a clinically silent interval of 5?9 days, whereas no seizures were observed in saline treated animals. Hippocampal gliosis and neurodegeneration were present in all MSO-treated animals in a dose-dependant manner (i.e. increasing severity in pathology change with higher dose of MSO). Conclusions: These studies suggest that the deficiency of hippocampal GS is a causative factor in the generation of spontaneously recurring seizures in MTLE, and that GS may represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease. 1 Andrew M. White, 1 Philip A. Williams, 1 Jennifer L. Hellier, 2 F. Edward Dudek, and 1 Kevin J. Staley ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver, CO ; and 2 Department of Physiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Following severe head trauma, 10 ? 50% of survivors will develop epilepsy. Identifying the subset of individuals that will go on to have chronic seizures would greatly improve their clinical care. We used the repeated low-dose kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy to investigate the spectral content of the EEG before and after treatment (pre-ictal) to determine if there are EEG predictors of future epilepsy. Methods: We used implantable radiotelemetry units to continuously monitor the EEG in freely behaving rats. Three sets of rats were observed: (1) rats treated until motor status (MSE) (n = 5), (2) rats treated until electrical status (ESE) (n = 5), and (3) saline treated rats (n = 3). An average Fast Fourier Transform was calculated using the Welch method and a rectangular window. Each window contained 65,536 points (262 sec). The results were averaged over an entire day (329 windows). Three power sectra were compared: (1) prior to kainate, (2) 3 days after kainate, and (3) 8 days after kainate. Results: All MSE rats developed chronic epilepsy. Their power spectrum did change after kainate administration. In 4/5 of the rats considered, the total power increased. The increases corresponded mostly to the lower frequencies, below 5 Hz. These increases persisted in 3/5 of the rats 8 days after treatment. By comparing the spectral density when frequent spikes are present (this was present only with MSE rats) with that when they were absent, we note that there is an increase in both high frequency (due to the sharpness of the spike) and low frequency (due to the periodicity of the spiking) power. We note that the results were invariant to the type of window used (Hamming, Hann, rectangular). None of the ESE rats developed chronic seizures. In these rats, we note that the total power decreased after kainate treatment in 4/5 of the rats. The fact that the power does not increase is not surprising because visually there was no change in the signal (no spikes). We also do not see the low frequency increase in the power spectrum noted in the MSE rats. For control rats the average EEG total power changed by only 10% from before to after kainate treatment. Conclusions: Kainate-injured rats that develop epilepsy exhibit spectral changes (increases in low-frequency power) in the EEG that appear prior to the onset of frequent motor seizures. Some of these spectral changes are due to the appearance of spikes (either individually or in clusters). If similar changes are found to be present in humans, it could be possible to predict whether an individual is likely to go on to develop chronic epilepsy following a brain injury. This will have a large positive influence on the care of patients with brain injury and could focus treatment trials on those at highest risk.

Wilson, 1 Isabel Chung, and 1 Sookyong Koh ( 1 Neurology, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Prolonged seizures during childhood can lead to neuropsychiatric consequences including memory impairment, learning disability, and behavioral problems. No effective post-seizure treatment exists to prevent this neurological insult. Using kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we have demonstrated a reversal of seizure-induced decrease in exploratory behavior in open field testing of young rats by exposure to an enriched environment for 7?10 days after KA. These behavioral changes were accompanied by transcriptional alterations of genes involved in proliferation, long-term potentiation, and memory consolidation including Arc, Homer1a, and Egr1. The expression of these genes were decreased after KA-induced seizure but significantly increased after post-seizure exposure to an enriched environment. To demonstrate a causal role for these genes in alleviating seizure-induced behavioral deficits, we have delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV2) containing Arc into the hippocampus of young rats after KA-induced seizure and assessed the subsequent behavioral effects. Methods: Arc, Homer1a, and Egr1 were cloned into AAV2 shuttle vectors and high-titer rAAV2 vectors were produced by the CMRC Viral Vector Core. Long-Evans male rats were injected either with PBS or KA at postnatal day 21 (P21) and divided into 5 groups (KA-ARC, PBS-ARC, KA-GFP, PBS-GFP, PBS-No Surgery). One day later, rAAV2-Arc or rAAV2-GFP was stereotactically injected into the hippocampus of anesthetized rats in the surgical groups. Rats underwent the open field test at P28, 35, and 42. Animals were sacrificed at P44 and brains were immediately flash-frozen. 40 ?m cryostat sections were cut and processed for quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), in situ hybridization (ISH), immunocytochemistry (ICC), and western blot. Results: In the open field test, KA-ARC animals explored significantly more than KA surgical controls (two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0196, n = 8). By the third week of open field testing, a 1.6-fold increase in exploratory behavior of KA-ARC rats compared to KA controls was paralleled by a >2.5-fold increase in Arc mRNA (qRT-PCR, p = 0.0013, n = 8) and a 2-fold increase of Arc protein in western blot with Arc antibody. Shown by ISH and ICC, Arc mRNA and protein were primarily localized to the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus. Exploratory behavior significantly correlated with Arc mRNA expression seen in qRT-PCR (r = 0.701, p = 0.0012, n = 18). Conclusions: Expression of Arc mRNA and protein was increased by injection of rAAV2-Arc into rat brain, which led to an improvement in exploratory behavior after KA-induced seizure. These results demonstrate that Arc expression can reverse seizure-induced behavioral impairments. Future in vivo studies injecting viral vectors containing Egr1 and Homer1a into rat brain will elucidate whether these genes will also afford protection against behavioral deficits after seizure.

Chromosome substitution strains (CSS) are strains in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing. A panel of CSS in which each chromosome is represented may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to a phenotype. Pilocarpine hydrochloride is a muscarinic cholinergic agonist that causes limbic seizures in mice, modeling human temporal lobe epilepsy. QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures have not been reported. C57BL/6J (B6) mice have been shown to be resistant to seizures; the A/J strain has been less studied, but appears more susceptible to seizures. Here, we report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) X A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Methods: 340 adult male mice?at least 10 of each CSS, 50 B6, and 39 A/J?were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures between 10 and 12 weeks of age. Mice were pretreated with atropine (5 mg/kg), followed in 30 minutes by pilocarpine (250 mg/kg), then continuously observed for 3 hours. Using a seizure staging system adapted from established (Racine) rodent seizure scales, highest stage reached, latency to each stage, and latency between stages were recorded for all mice. Significance of results in the CSS panel screen was determined by nonparametric comparison of mean highest stage reached (Mann-Whitney), and cox proportional hazard regression was used to generate hazard ratios and p-values for latency variables. Results: B6 mice were more resistant to seizures and were slower to reach each stage compared to A/J mice (p < .01). The CSS for chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe seizure stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 seizure-resistant phenotype (p < .01). Latency to all seizure stages and between stages was also significantly shorter for CH10 and CH18 mice, with hazard rates as high as 25 times that of B6 mice. Conclusions: Results of CSS mapping suggest the presence of seizure susceptibility loci on mouse chromosomes 10 and 18. This approach can provide a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.

Frankel ( 1 Neurogenetics, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME ) Rationale: BRUNOL4 (Bruno like 4) is a brain specific RNA binding protein, the loss of which leads to both convulsive and absence seizures in mice. The expression of Brunol4 is concentrated in neurons of the brain regions controlling synchronization and oscillation such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, suggesting that BRUNOL4 may play important roles in the maintenance of normal neuronal rhythmic activities. We hypothesize that BRUNOL4 is involved in the processing of mRNAs encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation. Thus, BRUNOL4 deficiency would lead to altered expression of several molecules which in turn would result in seizures. This study aims to identify differentially expressed genes in the Brunol4 mutant brains and to determine how BRUNOL4 regulates gene expression. Methods: RNAs were extracted from mutant and control brains before the onset of overt seizures. The transcriptomes between mutants and controls were compared by microarrays, followed by northern and western analysis to confirm the expression difference. A potential BRUNOL4 recognition site in the target RNA transcripts was identified by multi-species sequence comparison. Direct binding between BRUNOL4 and its RNA targets was demonstrated by RNA-immunoprecipitation in neurons. The consequences of the BRUNOL4-RNA interactions were investigated through reporter assays and RNA decay studies in cultured neurons. Results: Multiple potential BRUNOL4 target RNAs with altered expression were identified in mutants. Subsequent work confirmed the reduced expression of four RNAs encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation in the mutant brain. The RNAs encode N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, serotonin receptor 2c, synapsin II and α-synuclein, some of which have been implicated in seizures while others may represent novel pathways in epilepsy. Sequence analysis revealed a highly conserved U/G rich motif in the 3? untranslated region (UTR) of all four genes. RNA- immunoprecipitation showed that BRUNOL4 interacts with the 3? UTRs of the four RNA transcripts through binding to the conserved U/G rich region. In luciferase reporter assays, the expression of chimeric reporters containing 3? UTRs of the target RNAs was down-regulated in the Brunol4 mutant neurons compared with wildtype neurons, a defect that can be rescued by adding back BRUNOL4 through transfection. Preliminary studies suggest that the mRNA decay rates of the four RNA transcripts are shorter in mutant neurons. Conclusions: BRUNOL4 appears to modulate neuronal excitability at the RNA level through fine-tuning the stability of RNA transcripts encoding proteins critical to neuronal excitation. Brunol4 mutant mice represent the first animal model where compromised mRNA processing leads to epilepsy, thus providing a novel disease mechanism for seizure disorders.

Kelly ( 1 Neurology, Center for Neuroscience Research, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Pittsburgh, PA ; and 2 Neurology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Macroscopic properties of the EEG are frequently correlated with abnormal behaviors. We observed an apparent correlation of increased generalized spike wave discharge (SWD, absence seizure) amplitude to abnormal behaviors in aged F344 rats during long-term video-EEG recordings. We sought to validate quantitatively whether SWD amplitude could be used as a reliable marker to predict myoclonic arousals and limbic seizures in these animals. Methods: SWD amplitude recorded from six EEG channels during the initial 5 hours of a 24 hour recording was observed, and 7 schema were established to predict two major types of abnormal behaviors (myoclonic arousal and limbic seizures) in the following 19 hours of recording. The 7 schema consisted of: 1) event occurrence frequency; 2) myoclonic arousal; 3) head nodding (class II); 4) forelimb or hindlimb clonus (class III); 5) running and rearing (class IV); 6) falling and jumping (class V); and 7) fatality. Five episodes of SWDs were chosen randomly in the first 5 hours of recording and an average amplitude was generated from 6 EEG derivations: F3-C3, C3-P3, F3-P3, C4-P4, F3-F4, and C3-C4. Quantitative prediction for different abnormal behaviors were determined based on the amplitude variation of the 6 channels. For example, it would be predicted that there would be no myoclonic arousal when the amplitude of F3-C3 was greater than that of F3-P3 by more than 5%, whereas there would be 1 to 2 events of myoclonic arousal in the subsequent 19 hours when the F3-P3 amplitude was over 10% greater than F3-C3 while the amplitude of C3-P3 was less than or equal to C4-P4. For purposes of simplicity, a standard scheme of quantitative comparison was designed: 1 class III event = 2 class II events, 1 class IV event = 4 class II events. Accuracy was judged by comparing the number of observed events to the predicted results. For example, based on SWD amplitude, the range of actual class II events is predicted between 5 and 8 times. Prediction failure occurs when the actual class II event number is 3 or 10. Results: Twenty two EEG files of 20 month old F344 rats (n = 9) were analyzed and 3 prediction categories included: 1) frequency of occurrence of myoclonic arousal; 2) event frequency; and 3) limbic event class and fatality. Analysis indicated prediction accuracy of 80% for myoclonic arousals, 70% for event frequency, and 75% for limbic events ± fatalities. Taken together, prediction accuracy was ?70%. Conclusions: These findings suggest that macroscopic properties of electrocerebral activity in aged F344 rats may be used as predictors of abnormal ictal behaviors in these animals. These findings also suggest the possibility that specific differences in EEG spectral power may be quantifiable and equally predictive of these behaviors.

Holmes ( 1 Neuroloscience Center at Dartmouth, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy suffer from varying degrees of postictal impairment including confusion and amnesia. This impairment adds substantially to the disease burden of epilepsy. However, the mechanism responsible for postictal cognitive impairment is unclear. In this study we monitored place cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus before and after spontaneous seizures in epileptic rats. Place cells fire action potentials when the animal is in a specific location in space, the so-called place field. Place cell function correlates well with performance in tasks of visual-spatial memory and are an excellent measure of spatial memory. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at P70 were given lithium chloride (127 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally (IP) 18 hours before an IP injection of pilocarpine (34 mg/kg) to induce SE. One month later the rats were implanted with eight tetrodes and place cells and interneurons recorded. We compared place cell and interneuron firing patterns before and after spontaneous seizures. For the pyramidal neurons we measured coherence, information content, AP firing, and total number of APs. Results: A total of 12 spontaneous seizures were recorded from six rats. Of 87 cells recorded in these six rats, 20 met the requirements for a place cell and were detected during all four recording sessions (two before and two after the seizure). In these cells there were significant decreases in coherence, information content, firing rate and total spikes following the seizure (Figure). In addition, eight cells that did not have place firing prior to the seizure developed firing fields following the seizure. Nine cells that had firing fields on both recording sessions prior to the seizure could not be recorded following the seizure. Seven interneurons were recorded from four rats were recorded. The seizures had no effect on firing frequency of the interneurons. Conclusions: Following seizures there was a dramatic decrease in firing rate of action potentials. In addition, firing fields were aberrant with reduced coherence and information content. In addition, to postictal suppression of firing patterns, seizures lead to the emergence of previously silent cells. Interneuron firing was not affected by seizures. The concept that postical impairment is due to simple neuronal exhaustion is no longer tenable. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of seizures are complex, affecting neuronal function in a cell specific manner.

Ardesch, 1 Laetitia J.J.C. Wagener-Schimmel, 2,3 Hans E. Van Der Aa, 1 Gerard Hageman, and 3 Hendrik P.J. Buschman ( 1 Neurology, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 3 Twente Institute for Neuromodulation, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: Few adverse events on heart rate have been reported with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for refractory epilepsy. This effect may be caused by electrical stimulation of the efferent nerve fibers innervating the heart. We describe three cases with intraoperative bradycardia during device testing. Methods: From 1999 until 2006 approximately 90 patients with medically refractory epilepsy have been implanted with a VNS system in our centre. We review 3 patients who showed a bradycardia during intraoperative device testing (Lead Test) and their VNS-therapy follow-up outcome. Results: Patient 1, a 32 year old female with complex partial epilepsy, experienced a bradycardia of 43 beats/min during the first Lead Test, and 25 beats/min during a second test. Ten days after the operation the VNS system was activated under ECG-monitoring. No cardiac events occurred. Patient 2, a 52 year old male with partial epilepsy, experienced bradycardia of 40 beats/min. Ten days after implantation no cardiac effects were recorded when VNS therapy started. Patient 3, a 59 year old female with tonic clonic seizures, had a change in heart rate from 63 beats/min to 54 beats/min. No change in cardiac rhythm occurred when VNS therapy started. All three have had 4?6 years of chronic stimulation without cardiac side effects. The effect on epilepsy varied between 30%? > 50% reduction in seizure frequency. They also had less severe seizures and improved postictal recovery. Patient 1 and 2 have received a new pulse generator when battery was depleted. During the subsequent intraoperative Lead Tests no cardiac changes on ECG occurred. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bradycardia during intraoperative device testing does not have to be a reason for aborting the operation. However, postoperative VNS-therapy onset should be done carefully and under ECG monitoring. Furthermore, long-term VNS in these patients seems safe in respect to heart rate. 1 Edward Bromfield, 1 Barbara Dworetzky, 2 Shelley Hurwitz, 1 Zina Eluri, 1 Lara O?Brien, 1 Sonia Replansky, and 3 David Mostofsky ( 1 Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA ; 2 Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 3 Psychology, Boston University, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Fatty acids reduce seizures in animal models, but there is little human data. In a recent randomized trial (Epilepsy and Behavior 2005;7:253?8), patients with intractable epilepsy showed only a transient response. We are reporting the second such trial. Methods: Adults with uncontrolled epilepsy (at least 4 seizures/mo) were randomized 1:1, double-blinded, to PUFA (eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexanoic acid (DHA), 2.2 mg/d in a 3:2 ratio) or placebo (mineral oil). Following a 4-wk prospective baseline and 1-wk titration phase, subjects entered a 12-wk treatment period. Quality of life was assessed (QOLIE-31) before and after treatment. Upon completion, subjects had the opportunity to participate in a 1-mo open-label PUFA trial. Nonparametric statistics were used. Results: 27 subjects were randomized; 4 decided not to participate before entering baseline (3 had been randomized to placebo and 1 to PUFA). 2 other subjects, both randomized to placebo, were dropped during baseline, 1 because of noncompliance and the other because of increased seizures. Completers included 12 PUFA subjects (7F, 5M; ages 25?55 (mean 37)), vs 9 on placebo (5F, 4M; ages 22?62 (mean 39)). 10 on PUFA and 6 on placebo had focal epilepsy, while 2 and 3 had generalized epilepsy (cryptogenic/symptomatic in 2 and 1, idiopathic in 2 on placebo). Subjects took from 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs, with no significant group differences. 2 on placebo vs. 0 on PUFA had >50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline during the 12-week treatment (p = 0.17). Seizure frequency increased 6% on PUFA and decreased 12% on placebo (p = 0.21). On the other hand, of 19 subjects completing the 4-wk open-label PUFA trial, 15 experienced fewer seizures than during baseline (p = 0.02), 5 by at least 50%; 4 of these 5 had previously been on placebo. QOLIE-31 scores increased an average of 1 point among PUFA subjects, and decreased 6 points among placebo subjects (p = 0.23). PUFA subjects during the randomized trial and all subjects during the open-label phase showed no differences in serum drug concentrations other than lamotrigine, which declined by a mean of 17% among 6 patients. Conclusions: In this trial, PUFA was not superior to placebo as a treatment for intractable epilepsy. Given PUFA's absence of adverse effects and efficacy in animal models, additional trials of different doses or EPA:DHA ratios could be justified, particularly a longer, larger trial including children as well as adults. Adequate controls will be needed to account for what can be a strong placebo effect.

Van Der Aa ( 1 Institute for Neuromodulation (TWIN), Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Biomedical Signals  3 Otolaryngology and Phoniatrics, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 4 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: VNS is an effective treatment for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. It is generally accepted that VNS owes its antiepileptic effect from afferent nerve fiber stimulation. Co activation of efferent fibers can cause side-effects. One of the most frequent reported side-effects is hoarseness due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. At high stimulation amplitudes even spastic contractions of ipsilateral intrinsic laryngeal muscles can occur. For a group of VNS-therapy users this side-effect interferes severely with their daily activities. We investigated the recruitment properties of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and analyzed electromyographic and morphometric alterations on the vocal folds during VNS. Methods: Vocal fold EMG experiments were conducted intra-operatively during the implantation of a VNS system. When the patient was anesthetized the endotracheal EMG tube (XOmed) was inserted, and the recording wires connected to the Monitor. During surgery the VNS-therapy stimulation lead and pulse generator were implanted following normal procedure. The pulse generator was then programmed to stimulate in magnet mode for 14 seconds at 2 Hz, and one of the following pulse durations: 130, 250, 500, 750, or 1000 micros. At each pulse width the EMG-threshold current was determined by electrical stimulation of the VN with increasing stimulation currents. When EMG signal amplitude saturated upon stimulation a second pulse duration was randomly selected and the above procedure repeated. Laryngostroboscopic examination was performed 1 and 6 months after surgery. Special attention was given to the effects of spontaneous stimulation on the larynx. If no effect was noticed a higher intensity stimulation cycle was given by means of ?magnet-activation?. Results: The vocal fold EMG and morphodynamic changes in the larynx have been analyzed in 5 patients. In all patients left vocal fold EMG threshold was between 0.25 and 0.50 mA. Pulse duration had little influence on the EMG threshold level. Vocal fold EMG saturation levels were reached between 0.75 and 1.00 mA. Videostroboscopic monitoring at therapeutic levels (1.25 ? 2.25 mA) showed that VNS is well tolerated. ?Magnet? stimulation induced an adductory spasm of either the ipsilateral vocal fold or the vestibular fold, and was present remarkably irrespective of the presence of hoarseness. Conclusions: VNS causes pronounced effects on the vocal folds even at low stimulation amplitudes. At therapeutic levels the effect on the vocal folds is maximal even at the lowest stimulation pulse durations. The vocal fold contractions, however, do not necessarily give audible effects (hoarseness). 1 Robert S. Fisher, and SANTE Study Group ( 1 Neurology, Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, CA; and See Listing on Epilepsycontrol.com ) Rationale: We present an interim report for the SANTE (Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus for Epilepsy) trial, to illustrate the structure of the trial. Methods: The subject pool consists of patients 18?65 years old, inclusive, with partial onset seizures with or without generalization, and with observable clinical seizure manifestations. Seizures must be documented by prior video-EEG monitoring, and they must average at least six per month. Patients must have failed at least three AEDs, with dosing stable for 30 days prior to enrollment. Women must be using a reliable method of birth control. Excluded are patients with IQ < 70 or inability to complete neuropsychological testing, progressive lesions or diseases, or psychiatric hospitalization, suicide attempt or psychosis (excluding postictal psychosis) within five years. If present, a VNS is to be explanted at time of thalamic implantation. After a three-month baseline, eligible subjects receive bilateral anterior thalamic nuclei implantation of a dual-channel Medtronic Model 7428 Kinetra Neurostimulation System with Model 3387 DBS Brain Leads. One month later, stimulation is initiated at either 0 (placebo) or 5 (active treatment) V, with pulse width 90 us, 145 pulses per second, on for 1 minute and off for 5. The double-blind period continued for 3 months, after which there is 9 months of systematic variation of certain stimulation parameters. Results: As of 3/27/06, 98 patients were enrolled and 58 implanted at 15 US medical centers. Of these, 25 discontinued prior to implantation. Reasons included withdrawal of consent, inability to maintain stable antiepileptic drugs, status epilepticus, insufficient numbers of seizures in the baseline, and miscellaneous other reasons. Among 85 patients completing the baseline visit, age (mean ± SD, range) was 35.4 ± 10.9 (18.5?60.9) years, 45 male, 40 female. Epilepsy duration was 22.2 ± 13.1 (2?60) years. AEDs numbered 1 in 9 patients (11.3%), 2 in 37 (46.3%), 3 in 32 (40.0%), and 4 in 2 (2.5%). A vagus nerve stimulator previously had been implanted in 36 (42.4%); 17 (20.0%) had prior epilepsy surgery and 12 had both epilepsy surgery and VNS implantation. Conclusions: The SANTE trial is proceeding satisfactorily. Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed and presented after 102 patients have completed the blinded phase.

Vining ( 1 Epilepsy, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; 2 Nutrition, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; and 3 Neurology, Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet is not typically offered to adults with epilepsy due to the significant lifestyle alterations needed for its use. The modified Atkins diet has been recently demonstrated to be therapeutic for children with intractable epilepsy without the need for admission, weighing foods, and fluid, calorie, and protein restrictions. We hypothesized the modified Atkins diet would be similarly well tolerated and effective for adults. Methods: Study inclusion criteria included age over 18, and at least weekly seizures and 2 attempted anticonvulsants. Carbohydrates were initially restricted to 15 grams/day, fats encouraged, and fluids, protein, and calories were ad lib. Medications were unchanged for the first 3 months. Patients were examined and laboratory results obtained at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months on the diet. Results: Thirty patients, median age 36 years (range, 18 to 53), 19 (63%) female, consented and 29 started the diet. The median number of prior medications was 8 (range, 2?14); seizures were occurring 10 times per week (range, 1?140). Twelve patients had vagus nerve stimulators, 8 had failed resective surgery. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, approximately 40% had a >50% seizure reduction after 1 and 3 months on the diet. In those with seizure reduction, the median time to improvement was 2 weeks (range, 1 week to 2 months). Improvement was slightly higher in those with moderate to large urinary ketosis at the 1-month visit, p = 0.08. The mean weight loss was 6.9 kg; mean BMI decreased from 29.0 to 26.5, p = 0.001. Cholesterol increased from a mean of 182 to 201 mg/dl after 1?3 months, p = 0.02. Compliance was problematic; 11 (37%) discontinued the diet prior to 3 months. Conclusions: A modified Atkins diet appears to be an effective therapy for adults with intractable epilepsy and can also induce weight loss. Considering the high dropout rate, a 2-month trial appears to be adequate. (Supported by General Clinical Research Center, NIH/National Center for Research Resources grant M01-RR00052.) 1 Kevin Novak, 2 JoAnn Hoeppner, 1 Ruzica K. Ristanovic, 1 Lawrence P. Bernstein, 1 Jesse Taber, and 3 Jeffrey Cozzens ( 1 Neurology, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare; Northwestern University, Evanston, IL ; 2 Pediatrics ; and 3 Neurosurgery ) Rationale: Patients receiving VNS therapy for refractory epilepsy often appear on follow-up to be more alert, attentive, and energetic, independent of the effects of VNS on seizure frequency. This effect has not been fully demonstrated, and potential mechanisms of action have not been explored. We hypothesized that the apparent improvement in attention and energy results from a reduction in IEDs, which may interfere with cognitive processes. Methods: A heterogeneous group of 12 subjects with medically refractory, localization related epilepsy was evaluated at baseline, and at 6 months after VNS implantation surgery. Subjects had different epilepsy syndromes, baseline seizure and IED rates, and baseline IQs. During a 6 hour EEG recording session, an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to test for global cognitive function in several domains, with particular emphasis on attention. EEG spikes were detected with Persyst software, while custom software was used for EEG noise reduction and analysis of power spectrum, coherence, and statistics. Quality of life was examined with the QOLIE-31 questionnaire. Seizure frequency was recorded by subject and caregiver report. The paired Student's t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05 considered significant). Results: The group had nonsignificant reductions in seizure frequency (mean 10.0 to 2.4/month, p = 0.07) and IED rate (64.1 to 7.7 spikes/hr, p = 0.08). There were no significant changes in relative EEG power acutely (VNS-on vs -off) or chronically (baseline vs VNS-off), although there was a trend of decreased delta and increased alpha power after VNS. Coherence did not change acutely with stimulation, but 9 of 12 subjects had significant chronic changes. Quality of life trended toward improvement (QOLIE-31 raw score 52.5 to 61.9, p = 0.17). No changes were seen in any of the cognitive domains examined in standard neuropsychological testing, but the longer lasting of the two computerized tests of sustained attention/vigilance trended toward improvement (Steer clear driving: 7.02 vs. 4.95 cows/min hit, p = 0.11). The longer duration sustained attention driving test performance was correlated with baseline IED rate (r2 = 0.27, p = 0.05), and improved performance correlated with decreased IED rate after VNS (r2 = 0.31, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Although nonsignificant, 6 months of VNS in a small number of subjects resulted in a trend of reduced seizure frequency and IED rate, but had no measurable effect on cognition. The trend of reduced IED rates significantly correlated with improved ability to sustain attention in a longer duration task. Perhaps a larger study on a more homogeneous group of subjects selected for high IED rates and low to moderate baseline cognitive function would show larger changes in cognition.

Barkley ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ; 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 3 NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA ) Rationale: A significant percentage of women with epilepsy (WWE) have reported increased seizure frequency during the perimenstrual period (catamenial epilepsy). We first documented catamenial exacerbation of epileptiform activity using the Responsive Neurostimulator System (RNS) in 2005 [M V Spanaki, et al. Epilepsia 2005;46(Suppl 8):222]. In this study we continuously measured epileptiform activity in two WWE over a total of 17 menstrual cycles. Methods: As part of a FDA-approved multicenter feasibility study investigating the safety and potential efficacy of the RNS for epilepsy, we have implanted two WWE who were not good surgical candidates. The patients kept diaries of their menstrual periods. After seizure onset patterns were identified for both patients, detectors were programmed to identify electrocorticogram (ECOG) patterns that occurred prior to clinical seizures. These patterns appear epileptiform and occur frequently, but the vast majority of these bursts do not result in clinical seizures. Detection data from the RNS were then analyzed in multi-day windows around the date of menses onset and compared to detection rates on days exclusive of these perimenstrual windows to determine if the daily detection rate differed between the menstrual and non-menstrual intervals. Results: Data was gathered for 9 and 8 menstrual cycles for patients H and M, respectively. The detection rates for the different windows are shown in the graph. [figure 1]The detection data show statistical difference for both patients at window sizes of ± 3 days relative to the onset of the patient's menstrual cycle at the alpha = 0.05 level (95% confidence). Conclusions: The RNS has detection and diagnostic capabilities that allow objective measurement of epileptiform activity over prolonged periods of time in ambulatory patients. Use of RNS has confirmed the existence of perimenstrually exacerbated seizure activity. (Supported by: The RNS is limited by U.S. law to investigational use only.

Pharmacology studies have shown that the FA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, an omega-3 FA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an omega-3 FA) and arachidonic acid (AA, an omega-6 FA) can increase seizure thresholds. One study showed that the ketogenic diet increased plasma concentrations of EPA, DHA and AA. This increase may be a factor in the diet's anti-seizure effects. In a double blind study examining effects of omega-3 FA supplementation in people with epilepsy, we also examined FA profiles prior to and following supplementation. Methods: Patients with chronic epilepsy were randomised to receive capsules providing EPA (1g) and DHA (0.7g) daily or placebo (mixed vegetable oils) in a 12-week double blind study. Seizure counts, adverse events, AEDs and 28 different red blood cell (RBC) FA concentrations were assessed during the study. The effect of concomitant AEDs on baseline FA concentrations was assessed by comparing those on AEDs with those not on the AEDs, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results: The RBC FA profile obtained in 56 subjects prior to the start of the study showed mean% of AA, EPA and DHA of 13.1, 0.9 and 3.9. Carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) appear to affect baseline FA concentrations, so analysis was done comparing those on CBZ (26) and those on OXC (20) with those taking neither CBZ nor OXC (10). Those taking CBZ showed 22% lower mean DHA (p < 0.05), 20% lower long chain omega-3 FA (p < 0.05) and 5% lower monosaturated FA (p < 0.01). Those taking OXC showed non-significantly higher EPA (23%), DHA (14%) and AA (6%) levels, which together contributed to a higher total polyunsaturated FA of 8% (p < 0.05). Like CBZ, OXC was also associated with lower (8%) monosaturated FA (p < 0.001). Following 12 weeks of supplementation, the 29 subjects in supplement group showed a 13% reduction in AA (p < 0.001), 216% increase in EPA (p < 0.001) and a 55% increase in DHA (p < 0.001). Caution needs to be taken in interpreting these results as no correction factor was applied for the multiple analyses undertaken. Conclusions: CBZ appears to be associated with lower DHA and long chain omega-3 FA whilst OXC appears to be associated with higher total polyunsaturated FA. Hence OXC appears to be associated with a potentially more favourable FA profile. These findings need to be confirmed in subjects starting on these drugs as monotherapy. This study also showed that EPA and DHA concentrations are increased with omega-3 FA supplementation. (Supported by Seven Seas Ltd.

Uniparental disomy, mutations of the UBE3A gene or of an imprinting center, cause an additional 15% of cases. Refractory epilepsy is particularly common in deletion-associated cases. Multiple seizure types occur including atypical absences and prolonged non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Anticonvulsant drugs (AEDs), often in combination, are incompletely effective. Each of the molecular mechanisms known to be associated with AS causes dysfunction of the UBE3A gene product, the E3 ubiquitin-ligase protein. In deletion cases other genes, including the gene encoding g-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ?3 subunit is deleted. A model for AS, mice lacking the ?3 subunit, show myoclonic jerks, abnormal EEG and seizures with motor and learning defects. The ?3 subunit deficit may result in abnormal thalamocortical functioning, favoring atypical absence seizures and NCSE. The ketogenic diet (KD) is an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy. The mechanisms by which the KD exerts its anticonvulsant effect are not known. Proposed molecular targets include mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, potassium channels and, of interest for deletion-positive AS patients, GABA-ergic neurotransmission favoring inhibitory effect. In this context we present 3 patients with Angelman syndrome and refractory epilepsy who were successfully treated with the ketogenic diet. Methods: A modified ketogenic diet (brief fast, full hydration, acid-base correction) was initiated in hospital after neurological, nutritional and neurometabolic testing revealed no contraindication to the KD. Final KD ratio was determined based on efficacy and level of ketosis. Results: A: 3 year old girl, deletion positive AS and refractory NCSE, on 4 AEDs. Seizure free without complications on KD. Improved alertness, motor control, respiratory health, wellbeing. B: 2 year old boy, deletion positive AS, on 2 AEDs. Seizure free off AEDs on KD. More alert, more progress. C: 14 year old boy, one of 2 affected sibs with linkage to 15q11?13 but no mutation, with refractory status epilepticus, on 5 AEDs. Decrease in admissions for status epilepticus from 5/year to 1/3 years. Continued rarer seizures. Improved alertness, wellbeing. No adverse effects. Conclusions: Epilepsy in 2 deletion-positive AS cases was completely controlled, and a useful response occurred in an undeleted case. Based on these initial observations we recommend consideration of KD treatment early in the course of refractory epilepsy in AS individuals. Different molecular pathology may underlie the differential response seen in these cases. There are now 2 animal models of AS available with different molecular characteristics. Further clinical and in vivo studies of the KD in AS may clarify the role of the KD and offer insights into the pathophysiology of epilepsy in AS and into KD mechanisms. 1 A.G. Christina Bergqvist, 2 Joan I. Schall, 1 Erica L. Richard, 3 Paul R. Gallagher, and 2 Virginia A. Stallings ( 1 Division of Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; 2 Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ; and 3 Division of Biostatistics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The purpose of this study was to determine if hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia predicts clinical ketogenic diet (KD) response by evaluating first morning blood glucose during the initial 21 days after initiation of the KD in a cohort of children with intractable epilepsy. In addition, the correlation between change in weight status and blood glucose was explored. Methods: First morning fasting whole blood glucose was measured daily for the first 21 days after KD initiation. Moderate hypoglycemia was defined as a glucose < 60 mg/dL at any time during the 21 days; severe hypoglycemia as < 45 mg/dL; and hyperglycemia as > 100 mg/dL. Z-scores for weight (WAZ) and height (HAZ) were obtained at baseline, the day of discharge, 0.5 and 1 month of full KD therapy. Associations between clinical response to the KD, responder defined as > 50% reduction of seizure frequency at 3 months, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, style of KD initiation (fasting or gradual) and weight status were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and longitudinal mixed effects models. Results: Forty-five subjects ages 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 ± 2.7 y) participated. Growth status was suboptimal before KD initiation (WAZ ?0.3 ± 1.6 and HAZ ?0.4 ± 2.0). Weight status declined over 1 month of KD therapy (to ?0.6 ± 1.7 for WAZ). KD responder status was not associated with low or elevated blood glucose. A fasting or gradual KD initiation was also not associated. Children who had declining weight status during KD initiation were more likely to be hypoglycemic during full KD therapy, but this was unrelated to response to KD. Conclusions: Low blood glucose during KD therapy was not necessary for response to KD with clinically significant seizure reduction. Hypoglycemia was related to declining weight status. An effective KD can be provided in a manner to minimize side-effects and maximize efficacy.

Buzzerd ( 1 Clinical, Associates In Behavioral Health, Tunkhannock, PA ) Rationale: Roughly 500,000 children and adolescents across the U.S. suffer from seizure activity. Currently, medication management programs are the primary intervention with only varying success at controlling seizure activity. Increased attention and study needs to be focused on non-pharmacological intervention strategies like stem cell therapy. This case study evaluated the effectiveness of human, umbilical cord stem cell (hUCSC) therapy over a ten month period of time in an eight year old male with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Methods: Direct observations and indirect measures (such as standardized assessment tools) were conducted and administered; interviews with support persons were also conducted. Seizure activity, motor skills, communication skills and academic performance baseline were evaluated for change following two stem cell injections (1.8?2.0 and 2.8?3.0 million stem cells) administered six months apart. A single subject research design was used to collect baseline and post-injection data. Results: A t-test analysis of data groups presented statistical significance (at p = .05) in seizure activity. The post injection data represented the subject as exhibiting approximately a 90% reduction in both seizure frequency and duration during the period of this study. Conclusions: Although a single case study does not serve as ?proof? that stem cell therapy is an effective treatment. Studies into this new area of science must critically evaluate all outcomes that may be discovered. (Supported by Private Funder.) 1 Maria G. Dahlin, 2 Lena Hjelte, and 1 Per E. Amark ( 1 Neuropediatrics, Astrid Lindgrens Childrens Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden ; and 2 Cystic Fibrosis, Astrid Lindgrens Childrens Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden ) Rationale: The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-protein, very low-carbohydrate diet used in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy in children. Its anticonvulsant mechanism is still unclear but alterations of fatty acid (FA) levels has been proposed as a mechanism of action. We examined the influence of the KD on FA levels and seizure control. Methods: The levels of seventeen FAs in plasma phospholipids were determined before and 1, 6, and 12 months after initiation of the KD in 25 children (mean age 6.3 years) with severe epilepsy. The majority were on a KD ratio of 4:1 (fats:proteins and carbohydrates). After 1 month, the KD was supplemented with polyunsaturated omega-3 FAs by adding fish-oil (4?8 g/day). Seizures were quantified. Results: Highly significant changes in the levels of several FAs were found in relation to the KD. After 1 month on KD significant changes were seen in the levels of 8 FAs, after 6 months on KD in 10 FAs and after 12 months on KD in 12 FAs. Changes were found in the levels of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated as well as saturated FAs. Among others, increases were seen in linoleic acid (18:2 n6) and EPA (20:5 n3) and decreases in arachidonic acid (20:4 n6). The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 FAs decreased from 7.0 before diet to 4.9 at 12 months after diet start. However, no correlation of FA levels to seizure response was found. Conclusions: The ketogenic diet induced prominent changes in several major plasma fatty acid levels but a correlation to seizure control was not found. A decreased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids was observed which may be of benefit to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed on how different diet compositions, in terms of type and amount of various fatty acids, affect blood fatty acid profile, in order to define an optimal diet regime for maximal seizure control as well as minimal cardiovascular risks.

Jobst ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH) Methods of terminating seizures Patient Epileptic focus Praying Talking Swallowing Listening Writing Rubbing 1 Right + + + 2 Right + 3 Right + 4 Right + 5 Right + 6 Left + + + 7 Left + + Rationale: Patients often report that they can terminate seizures with certain cognitive tasks. Case reports decribe the ability of cognitive tasks to suppress/interrupt seizure activity. A systematic review of such experiences has not yet been documented in the literature. Is it not known whether cognitive activity arresting seizures is hemispheric specific, and whether it correlates with side of seizure onset. Methods: 20 adult patients with mesial temporal epilepsy were retrospectivley interviewed by telephone or in writing. All patients had unilateral temporal lobe seizure onset and underwent temporal lobectomy. Patients were asked to describe, whether they developed a cognitive method/technique to terminate seizures, when they were preceded by an aura. In addition a list of cognitive activities specific to each hemisphere was presented to all patients. Results: Seven patients reported cognitive acitivities that terminated seizures after an aura occured.Five patients had right mesial temporal seizure onset, two had left mesial temporal seizure onset. Patients with right mesial temporal onset seemed to control their seizures with praying, while patients with a left mesial temporal onset controlled their seizures via rubbing or tapping the contralateral affected limb (see table). The small number of patients precluded statistical analysis. Conclusions: Despite being a limited study, this survey provides an interesting observation. Some patients with right sided mesial temporal seizure onset can terminate their seizures with right hemispheric activities such as praying. Some select patients with a left mesial temporal seizure onset are able to terminate their seizures using left hemispheric tasks, such as talking, writing, tapping and rubbing the right side. Neurocognitive tasks represented in close proximity to the seizure focus could influence electrical seizure activity. Neurocognitive therapy could evolve as treatment option for epilepsy. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study with objective validation. 2 Celina C. Martinez, 1 Adam L. Hartman, and 1 Eric H. Kossoff ( 1 Pediatric Epilepsy, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ; and 2 School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Approximately 10% of children on the ketogenic diet become seizure-free after its initiation. The diet typically is discontinued after 2 years, but there is no information regarding the likelihood and severity of seizure recurrence. Methods: A retrospective chart review examined children who became seizure-free on the ketogenic diet at our institution over a 12-year period; the indication for discontinuing the diet was freedom from seizures. All children had at least 6 months of seizure freedom and were on the diet for that period prior to discontinuation. Results: Sixty-six children discontinued the diet after a median of 2.1 years due to seizure freedom; 92% were medication-free. Twelve (18%) had recurrence of their seizures at a median of 3.0 years after the diet was stopped. Seven (58%) became seizure-free a second time, 2 after reinstitution of the diet. Four patients restarted the diet but remain intractable to date. The presence of recent electrographic epileptiform activity and an abnormal MRI each significantly increased the likelihood of recurrence (45% and 38%, respectively); age, seizure type, seizure frequency, medication freedom, and time to initial diet response did not. Three patients with recurrent seizures had tuberous sclerosis complex. Conclusions: The risk of recurrent seizures subsequent to discontinuing the diet after achieving seizure freedom was approximately 1 in 5, and more than half became seizure-free again, usually with anticonvulsants alone. The risk of recurrent intractability was three times less; however the diet, when restarted in these patients, was not as successful. Obtaining a recent EEG prior to discontinuing the diet in this situation may be advisable in counseling families. 1 Hrisimir Kostov, 1 Pål G. Larsson, and 2 Geir K. R?ste ( 1 Department of Neurodiagnostics, The National Center for Epilepsy, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Sandvika, Norway ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway ) Rationale: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is accepted as an effective and safe treatment for refractory partial epilepsy. Its value for treating patients with refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is not well documented. Methods: All patients with medically refractory IGE, with EEG/video documented seizures, implanted with VNS in our epilepsy surgery program between 1995 and 2006 were included. A total of 12 patients (2 M, 10 F) from 11 to 48 years (mean age: 30.7 ± 14.4 years) were identified. Mean follow-up period was 18 months (±14; range, 3 ? 48). Patients were treated with an average of 2.25 AEDs/patient at implantation time. Wilcoxon's paired signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Results: There was 62% seizure reduction for generalized tonic-clonic seizures (p = 0.0020), 58% for absence seizures (p = 0.0003) and 40% for myoclonic seizures (p = 0.0156). Eight patients were considered responders (≥ 50% seizure reduction); two of these patients became seizure-free. Two patients had < 50% seizure reduction, and two patients showed no change in seizure frequency. At the last follow-up visit, the patients were receiving an average of 1.67 AEDs (?0.58 AEDs/patient; p = 0.0625). Two patients (both responders) are currently being treated with VNS therapy only. Most commonly used stimulations parameters were: pulse width 250 ?s, frequency 20 Hz, 30 seconds on and 5 minutes off. Median output current at the last follow-up was 1.5 mA. Due to lack of response in four patients, parameters were changed to rapid cycling (7 sec. on and 0.2/0.3 min off); two of these patients became then responders. An improvement in alertness (?better? or ?much better?) was observed in 6 of the patients. According to 5 patients, the magnet was always or most times effective. Nine patients reported some side effects, which were mild and tended to decrease over time. Conclusions: In this patient population, VNS therapy was effective and safe for the treatment of medically refractory IGE. Rapid cycling seems to be effective for some of the non-responders. There was an improvement in alertness in half of the patients, and a trend towards a reduction in the number of AEDs/patient. 1,2 Elizabeth A. Leleszi, 1,2 Eishi Asano, and 1,2 Gyula Acsadi ( 1 Neurology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI ; and 2 Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Celiac disease can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including ataxia, epilepsy, dementia, neuropathy, myopathy, cerebral calcification, cerebellar atrophy and leukoencephalopathy, which are mostly related to the metabolic consequences of severe malabsorption. We describe a four year-old child, presenting with myoclonic epilepsy described as head drops and occasional upper extremity clonus. The seizures continued to happen up to thirty times a day for several months even on multiple antiepileptic medications. An ictal EEG showed generalized high amplitude spike and slow wave activity with duration lasting 1?2 seconds. A brain MRI was normal. As part of an allergy workup, high antigluten antibodies were found and the HLA typing (HLA-DQB1*0302, 0301) was also consistent with celiac disease. Unfortunately, a jejunal biopsy was not preformed. After the patient was started on a gluten-free diet, the seizures resolved completely within three days and the EEG was normalized. The anti-epileptic medications were gradually discontinued without any relapse for at least four more months. Conclusions: Gluten from dietary sources may evoke an immune response of the gastrointestinal cells via gliadin and tissue transglutaminase in susceptible individuals and lead to celiac disease with multiorgan manifestations. However, the clinical and immunological consequences of asymptomatic gluten intolerance are not well established. This is the first case report describing a complete resolution of seizure activity with a gluten-free diet alone. Our case suggests a possibility that the epilepsy was caused by a so far unknown immunological process directed to the central nervous system (e.g. antibodies to some ion channels.) Further investigations are necessary to determine a relationship and pathomechanism between intractable epilepsy and gluten intolerance. 1 Jullie W. Pan, 2 C.J. Segal-Issacson, and 2 Brandy Cowell ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 2 Epidemiology and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: A number of reports have found that low carbohydrate (e.g., Atkins) or low glycemic index diets may help in reducing seizure frequency. Given the relatively lower ketosis achieved in such diets as compared to the ketogenic diet, it is possible that the effect of seizure control is not via direct ketone (or ketone derivatives) levels in the brain, but through a physiological mechanism. We examined for such a mechanism by studying the effects of 4 weeks of an Atkins diet on cerebral energetics in n = 7 healthy overweight control adult volunteers. Methods: We used high field 31P whole brain MRSI to study healthy overweight (n = 7, mean age 34.7 ± 10.0years, 4F) volunteers, examining them prior to initiating a low carbohydrate diet (Atkins Phase 1) and after 4 weeks of sustaining this diet. For optimum diet control, meals from a licensed caterer were provided to the subjects, and the macronutrient distribution of the diet was 65% fat: 30% protein: 5% carbohydrate. The mean body mass index at baseline was 34.0 ± 2.7, and after 4 weeks of the diet was 31.2 ± 2.2. Weight loss was achieved by all volunteers, averaging 6.7 ± 3.2 kg. 31P MRSI was performed at 4Tesla. Including scout imaging and calibrations, the duration of the 31P study was ?75min. The 31P acquisition has an effective sampling radius of 1.4cm; previous studies have shown the reproducibility to be 10%. Quantification was performed accounting for tissue volume, coil loading and relaxation. Plasma samples were frozen at ?80C until analysis; b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were spectrophotometrically assayed after each study using a COBAS-FARA analyzer. Results: A mild ketosis was achieved in all subjects, with plasma BHB rising from 0.24 ± 0.05 to 1.64 ± 0.93. Example data (position and spectra) are shown in Fig. 1, showing PCr, ATP and inorganic phosphate Pi. Data and loci of spectral analysis are shown in the Table. From all volunteers, the ATP and PCr concentrations in the hippocampus and thalamus rose significantly between D0 to D28, while there was no significant change in occipital cortical tissue. Conclusions: Cerebral energetics changed with use of a low carbohydrate diet, with increased ATP and PCr concentrations in the thalamus and hippocampus. The data are consistent with a view that the change in fuel type and availability is characterized by an alteration in energetics particularly in subcortical brain structures. The increased availability of high energy phosphates in key limbic structures may be an important factor in how a low carbohydrate diet affects seizure control.

Methods: Three client-owned epileptic dogs refractory to AED treatment were studied. All dogs were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy based on the history of generalized seizures, normal neurological examination, unremarkable brain MRI and EEG features. Affected dogs were followed for at least 60 days before and after rTMS. A calendar of the seizures was kept to evaluate the interval between seizures before and after rTMS. Each dog received multiple AED treatment including phenobarbital, potassium bromide and levetiracetam. No dosage change was made in the two months prior to and following the study. A total amount of five treatments were delivered to each dog over five consecutive days (1 treatment per day). The technique of stimulation consisted in a 9 cm focal point coil located over the skull in proximity of the vertex. Different rates of stimulation were used between dog 1 and dogs 2 and 3. In dog 1, each treatment consisted in low-rate rTMS delivered in 20 consecutive trains of 90 pulses each at 1 Hz frequency and 60% of the maximal coil output. The inter-train interval (ITI) was 120 seconds. Dog 2 and 3 received a treatment protocol consisting of two consecutive sessions at different rates. The first session consisted of priming the cerebral cortex with high-rate rTMS characterized by 20 trains (40 seconds ITI) of 60 pulses each at 6 Hz frequency and 55% of the maximal coil output. The second session of stimulation consisted in low-rate rTMS characterized by 10 trains (60 seconds ITI) of 60 pulses each at 1 Hz frequency and 60% of the maximal coil output. The longest seizure-free interval during the pre-rTMS period was compared with the seizure-free interval immediately post-rTMS. Results: Dog 1 and 3 had a short-term improvement of the seizure interval in the immediate post-rTMS period (27 days and 14 days respectively) as compared to the longest seizure-free interval of the pre-rTMS period (20 days and 12 days respectively). Dog 2 had an equal seizure-free interval between the immediate post-rTMS period (19 days) and the longest seizure-free interval of the pre-rTMS period (19 days). Conclusions: Regardless of the technique of stimulation used in this study (low-rate rTMS versus high-rTMS followed by low-rate rTMS), an equal or prolonged seizure-free interval in the immediate post-rTMS period was observed in all dogs suggesting the possible short-term beneficial effect of rTMS in canine epilepsy.

Schmidt ( 1 Neurology and Hope Center for Neurological Disorders, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ; and 2 Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA ) Rationale: Caged compounds are inert prodrugs that are capable of releasing small bioactive molecules when excited by light at the appropriate wavelength. They were initially developed to facilitate rapid, step increases in the local concentration of neurotransmitters and are typically activated with a very brief pulse from a mercury bulb or laser. We wondered whether we could use low levels of light from an ultraviolet diode (UV LED) to release GABA from a new caged analog and modulate seizure-like activity in cultured neurons. Methods: We used cultured hippocampal neurons after about 2 weeks in vitro and recorded in whole cell bridge or voltage clamp mode. GABA was applied by whole bath perfusion or by uncaging 4-[[(2H-1-benzopyran-2-one-7-amino-4-methoxy)carbonyl]amino]butanoic acid (BC204). A UV LED (Nicchia 365 nm/100 mW) was activated by a custom fabricated driver for 4 seconds in the uncaging experiments. Results: We first verified that our UV LED was capable of generating sufficiently high GABA concentrations to activate GABAA receptors in our cultures. We found that driver currents between 25 and 250 mA produced readily detectable currents in the presence of BC204 (30 ?M). These currents are well below the maximum capacity of the UV LED (700 mA). The current elicited by 150 mA corresponded to a 10 ?M GABA current, when normalized to a GABA dose response curve. The currents produced by uncaging BC204 were reduced by 89% in the presence of picrotoxin (100 ?M). BC204 itself at 30 ?M is a very weak GABAA blocker, reducing 3 ?M GABA currents by about 5%. When cultures were exposed to medium lacking magnesium, they generated increased synaptic activity, paroxysmal depolarization shifts, and often ?seizure like? discharges that were abolished by perfusion with GABA as low as 3 ?M. In the presence of BC204 (30 ?M), a 4 second illumination with 100?200 mA also eliminated spontaneous activity. The figure below shows the effect of a 4 second light pulse on bursting. [figure 1]Illumination in the absence of BC204 produced no detectable current. Conclusions: These results suggest that it may be possible to utilize a compact, low power UV LED in combination with locally applied caged GABA to activate tonic GABAA and GABAB receptors and modulate paroxysmal activity. These receptors can be activated by GABA concentrations in the low micromolar range, which it may be possible to achieve in vivo.

Stallings ( 1 Pediatrics/Neurology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Pediatrics/Division of GI, Hepatology and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The aims of this study were to describe vitamin D status including dietary intake in a contemporary cohort of children with intractable epilepsy prescribed newer anti-epileptic drugs (AED), and to determine the effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on serum vitamin D status over 15 months. Methods: Prepubertal children 1?14 years with intractable epilepsy were eligible. Serum vitamin D (25-OHD and 1,25-OHD) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were obtained prior to initiation of KD therapy and every three months thereafter. Three-day weighed dietary records were obtained at baseline and one month on KD therapy, and included vitamin and mineral supplementation. Results: 45 children with intractable epilepsy (age 5.1 ± 2.7 years) enrolled in the study. At baseline 4% had deficient and 51% had insufficient serum 25-OHD levels. Vitamin D intake was inadequate; 46% consuming less than the recommended intake. Adequate vitamin D intake, fewer AED and generalized seizures were associated with higher serum 25-OHD levels (p < 0.01). After 3 months on the KD, vitamin D status improved, 25-OHD levels increased (p < 0.001), and PTH declined (p < 0.001). Over the next 12 months of KD exposure, the 25-OHD levels steadily declined (p < 0.001), while 1,25-OHD and PTH were not significantly changed. Conclusions: Children with intractable epilepsy treated with newer AED had poor vitamin D intake and blood levels. KD therapy with vitamin D supplementation improved vitamin D status; however, over the next 12 months of KD therapy a decline in 25-OHD was observed.

Borum ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ; and 2 Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Ketogenic Therapy (KT) is a treatment for intractable epilepsy that is designed to mimic metabolism during starvation. Although KT has been practiced for many decades, the guidelines for practice have often been communicated orally and based on personal experience. Subjective measurements of seizure increase or decrease and of antiepileptic drug (AED) requirements are usually used. The goal of our project was to develop an evidence based KT program for treatment of epilepsy. Methods: A review of the literature on KT over the past decade was conducted and an evidence grading system was used to document current practice. A retrospective database was developed to evaluate KT provided at our center for the past decade. There are currently 184 current and non-current patients in the retrospective database of which 95 are males and 89 are females. The average age at initiation was 7.1 ± 4.9 years old and the average time on diet from non-current patients (n = 133) was 17.7 ± 18.9 months. Patient tracking forms for pre-initiation, initiation, post-initiation, and termination of KT were created. Systems for quantifying and tracking seizures and medications were created to evaluate patients' progress on KT. This includes Clinic Seizure Score (CSS), Daily Diary Seizure Score (DDSS), and a Medication Score (MS). The CSS is dependant upon the caregiver's recollection at clinic of seizure activity since the last clinic. The DDSS is based on daily seizure records of the caregiver and used to track the total amount of seizure activity between clinic visits. The MS allows us to evaluate both the total number and dosage of all the AEDs that a patient is taking based on their age and weight. Results: The evidence based guidelines have been created by the University of Florida Pediatric Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. For initiation, pre-therapy records are collected and the patient comes in after an overnight fast and starts on a 1.5:1 ratio at full calories which is then increased by 0.5 every other meal for oral feeders and every day for tube feeders. During post-initiation, parents document daily ketones, specific gravity, and seizure activity as well as dietary intake for 24 hours per week. Patients are monitored using the CSS, DDSS, MS as well as the following lab parameters: comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, lipid profile, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and acylcarnitine profile. Data from the patient tracking forms are entered in a prospective database on a weekly basis. Conclusions: The data obtained from the databases will allow us to evaluate and expand the evidence based KG guidelines for optimal administration and monitoring of patients throughout KT. 1 Jessica A. Yankura, 1 Amy French, 1 Michael A. Rogawski, 2 Adam Hartman, and 1 Maciej Gasior ( 1 Epilepsy Research Section, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ; and 2 Pediatric Epilepsy Center, John Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD ) Rationale: Anticonvulsant effects of the ketogenic diet seem dependent on high fat and low carbohydrate availability that results in the development of ketosis along with a modest reduction in serum glucose levels. However, it remains unclear if low glucose levels alone can decrease neuronal excitability and have anticonvulsant effects. Glucose depletion attenuates seizure activity in in vitro models whereas both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects have been reported in in vivo models (1,2). In the present study we sought to clarify the influence of glucose in regulating seizure susceptibility in vivo by simulating glucose deprivation with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a structural analog of glucose that does not undergo glycolysis. Methods: Anticonvulsant effects of 2-DG were assessed in amygdala-kindled rats and in Swiss mice in the intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and kainic acid models, and in the electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) and 6 Hz models. 2-DG (125 ? 500 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before seizure testing. Results: In amygdala-kindled rats, 2-DG had no effect on afterdischarge threshold, afterdischarge duration, behavioral seizure score and behavioral seizure duration. In mice, administration of 2-DG had no effect on seizure threshold in the PTZ test and was slightly proconvulsant in the kainic acid model. It had no effect on ECT. Only in the 6 Hz seizure test did 2-DG cause a small, yet significant, dose-dependent elevation in seizure threshold. Conclusions: In contrast to a prior study using olfactory bulb and perforant path kindling (2), we did not find 2-DG to have potent anticonvulsant efficacy in the various in vivo seizure models we studied. Our findings suggest that low glucose availability plays a limited role in the seizure protection conferred by the ketogenic diet. 1 Kirchner, A., Veliskova, J.  and 2 Neurological Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: This study examined the long-term (10 years+) psychosocial outcomes of a consecutive series of patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) compared with a group of medically managed patients. These same individuals were initially assessed in 1999 (mean 5 years follow-up) (Jones et al., 2002). This second follow-up interview occurred 6 years later in 2005. The primary focus of this study was to examine the changes maintained in actual life performance after surgery in the following areas: employment, independent living, driving and financial independence. Self-reported quality of life was also assessed. Additionally, during this second follow-up interview questions pertaining to the presence or absence of mood and anxiety disorders were included. Methods: The sample consisted of 57 adults who underwent ATL and 18 controls that were evaluated for surgery during the same time period as those who had surgery. However, the medically managed group did not have surgery and continued to receive medical management. Participants were interviewed 8?15 years after surgery or presurgical evaluation. A structured clinical interview was conducted to obtain information regarding seizure frequency and psychosocial status. Seizure frequency was evaluated for the number seizures in the year prior to the interview and number of seizures since the initial follow-up interview in 1999. Results: As indicated in the initial follow-up evaluation in 1999, significant differences in psychosocial outcomes were maintained between the surgical and medical management groups (p < .001). Favorable psychosocial outcomes were significantly more common in surgical participants (50.9%) than medically managed patients (11.1%). Individuals in the surgery group were more likely to be employed (70.2% v. 44.4%), driving (77.2% v.33.3%), living independently (80.7% v. 44.4%) and financially independent (80.7% v. 44.4%). Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of self reported quality of life. In terms of seizure frequency, 71.9% of the surgery group was seizure free in the past year compared to 27.8% in the medically managed group. Since 1999, 50.4% of participants in the surgery group have remained seizure free. Among the two groups 15.8% of the surgery participants reported a diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder in the past year compared to 17.6% in the medically managed group. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions: Surgery appears to be associated with the long-term maintenance of favorable psychosocial outcomes at a very long-term follow-up of 8?15 years after surgery. Rates of employment, driving, independent living and financial independence appear to be positively influenced by surgery. Seizure freedom and reduced seizure frequency appear to be a significant long term outcome of surgery. 1 Christine M. Bower, 1 Eric M. Cheng, 2 Susan S. Spencer, 1 Stefanie Vassar, and 1 Barbara G. Vickrey ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA ; 2 Department of Neurology, Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA ; and 3 Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Although the clinical goal of resective epilepsy surgery is seizure freedom, patients may have a wide set of expectations for this invasive procedure. This study's goals were to assess the nature, range, and frequency of preoperative expectations for resective epilepsy surgery, and to explore whether expectations vary across patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: 396 adults and adolescents with refractory epilepsy were enrolled in a seven-center cohort study and underwent resective surgery. During baseline interviews, patients responded to open-ended questions about expectations for surgery. Investigators reviewed text responses and identified a preliminary set of expectation themes. Each text response was placed on a card, then ?sorted? into piles representing distinct themes (expectations) by consensus of three investigators. Differences in the frequencies for which each expectation theme was identified were explored across gender, ethnicity, education, whether temporal or extratemporal lobe epilepsy, and side of surgery, using chi-square. Results: Among 391 respondents, nine unique expectations themes were identified by >15% of the sample: driving (n = 241, 61.6%); job/school (n = 166, 42.5%); independence (n = 115, 29.4%); seizure cessation (n = 100, 25.6%); social functioning (n = 90, 23.0%); quality of life (n = 82, 21%); medication discontinuance (n = 78, 20.0%); physical activities (n = 71, 18.2%); and cognition (n = 67, 17.1%). Non-whites and whites differed on 3 of 9 expectation themes: non-whites (n = 72, 18% of sample) endorsed job/school and cognition more frequently and driving less frequently than did whites (p < 0.03). Respondents with a higher level of education (n = 95, 24% of sample with bachelor's degree or higher) endorsed cognition more frequently than those with less education (p < 0.003). Subjects with a right-sided resection (n = 190, 49% of sample) endorsed social functioning more frequently than those with a left-sided resection (p < 0.05). There were no differences in expectations by gender or temporal versus extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Conclusions: Patients awaiting resective epilepsy surgery have definable expectations for surgery, the most predominant of which are driving and employment/educational attainment. While the majority of these expectations were similar across a range of patient characteristics, there were differences on one-third of the most frequently reported expectations by ethnicity. Future studies are needed to explore these potential sociodemographic differences, and to understand how expectations may aide in the clinical decision-making process of resective epilepsy surgery.

A previous study with a small number of patients found out that up to 20% of those patients may eventually become seizure free (Selwa et al, 2003). This information is essential to counsel patients attended in a surgical programme. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review and telephone survey on all patients who had undergone presurgical evaluation at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) of Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain) from 1995 until 2004, but did not undergo epilepsy surgery afterwards, either because they were not considered to be good surgical candidates or because the patient declined surgery. We inquired about current seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug treatment, overall impression of change, quality of life, marital and laboral situation. Results: From a total of 167 telephone calls, we finally contacted 80 patients who agreed to answer the survey. Of them, only 7 patients (9.3%) were currently seizure free, with a mean seizure free period of 3 years (2?6). Seizure freedom was associated with use of new AEDs in 2/7 patients. Five patients (6.2%) had died, with death being possibly related to seizures (SUDEP or CRA during prolonged seizures) in all of them. Among those patients who were not seizure free, the vast majority (89%) reported that their seizure frequency was either the same or lower than at the time of presurgical evaluation. No significant differences were found between seizure free and not seizure free patients respect to the type of epilepsy, etiology, presence of a lesion on the MRI and reason not to have surgery. Overall, 54% of all patients interviewed reported feeling better and more satisfied with their lives than when they were admitted to the EMU. Although most patients did not report changes in their marital or laboral status, a higher proportion of patients in the seizure free group (71%) were actively working, compared to 32% of patients in the group with continued seizures. Conclusions: A small percentage (9.3%) of patients with refractory epilepsy who undergo presurgical evaluation but not epilepsy surgery may eventually become seizure free on drugs. Up to 6% of patients may die as a consequence of their epilepsy. In patients who do not become seizure free, seizure frequency will be, in general, similar or lower with time, and up to 50% of patients will report feeling better and more satisfied with their lives than at the moment of presurgical evaluation. This information may be used to counsel patients attending epilepsy surgery programmes. 1 Shiro Chitoku, 1 Yshihiro Sumi, 2 Masahiro Mizobuchi, 1 Toshiaki Osato, 1 Takehiko Sasaki, 1 Jouji Nakagawara, and 1 Hirohiko Nakamura ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Nakamura Memorial Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Nakamura Memorial Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan ) Rationale: To analyze characteristics and risk factors of seizures following ruptured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: We studied a total of 544 patients with acute SAH treated with clipping (444), detachable coil embolization (37), and conservative treatment (67) at Nakamura memorial hospital between 1998 and 2004. The age ranged from 26 to 92 years old (mean 60 years old). We characterized seizures following SAH and compared risk factors of seizures between seizure group and non-seizure group. Results: Sixty-seven (12%) patients had seizures (seizure group) 58 (87%) in clipping, 7 (10%) in embolism, and 2(3%) in conservative treatment. Other 477 (88%) patients had no seizure history for 7 years follow-up (non-seizure group). Thirty (44%) of 67 patients presented seizure within 24 hours following SAH (acute onset), and 37 patients (56%) after 24 hours (late onset). Sudden generalized convulsions occurred in 27 (90%) patients in the acute onset group. Focal seizures occurred in 31 (84%) patients in the late onset group. Two (7%) patients had following epileptic seizure disorders in the acute onset group and 11 (30%) in the late onset group. Thirty-one (46%) of 67 patients in seizure group resulted in good prognosis (modified Rankin Scale0?2) and 320 (65%) of 477 patients in non-seizure group (p < 0.05) Seizure group showed more than three times higher rate of symptomatic hydrocephalus, 34(51%):76(16%); infarction due to vasospasm, 18(27%):41(9%); and other co-morbidities, 34(51%):48(10%); compared with those of non-seizure group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Seizure group revealed worse prognosis and more correlated with hydrocephalus, vasospasms and co-morbidities than non-seizure group. Seizures following SAH characterized generalized convulsions at acute onset, and focal seizures at late onset. The late onset seizure group tended to develop epileptic seizure disorders compared with acute onset seizure group. 1,2,3 Luciana L. D?Alessio, 3 Juan José J.J. López-Costa, 1 Hector H. Konopka, 1 Damián D. Consalvo, 1 Eduardo E. Seoane, 2 Laura L. Guelman, 1,3 Silvia S. Kochen, and 2 Luis María L.M. Zieher ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Ramos Mejía Hospital, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ; 2 Pharmacology Department, Medicine, Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ; and 3 CONICET, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Capital Federal, Argentina ) Rationale: Nitric oxide (NO) is a short lived free radical with diverse functions as a biological messenger molecule, and has been implicated in numerous aspects of the physiology and pathology of the CNS including epilepsy. NO can acts as anticonvulsant or proconvulsant depending on the experimental model and the pharmacological parameters used. There is little information about changes in NO levels in human epileptic brains. Neurons containing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) synthesizes NO. The aim of this study is to investigate the anatomical distribution, morphology, optical density and cell sizes of NADPH-d neurons in the temporal cortex of patients with hippocampal sclerosis who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for intractable temporal lobe seizures. Methods: Brain samples of 7 ? 5 ? 5 mm from temporal cortex were obtained from 7 patients was compared with 5 postmortem controls. Samples were fixed and incubated at 37°C in 1 mg/ml of B-NADPH and 0,2 mg/ml of nitroblue tetrazolio. NADPH d activity was measured as distribution of formazan deposits (endproduct of the histochemical reaction). Neuronal area and neuropil staining optical density was determined. Results: Sprouting (dendritic arborization) and larger NADPH-d positive neurons, with an increase in staining intensity were found in epileptic?s temporal cortex (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The increased area and the observed morphological changes in NADPH-d reactive cells found in this study indicate plastic changes and suggest an up-regulation in NO system in the neocortex. These changes could contribute to abnormal cortical excitability however, could also be involved in adaptative neuroprotective function. 1,2 Alaa Hassan, 1 Heinz Pannek, 1 Friedrich Behne, 1 Reinhard Schulz, 2 Mohammed Nayel, 2 Ahmed Issa, and 1 Alois Ebner ( 1 Preoperative Evaluation, Epilepsy Center Bethel, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cairo University, Cairo, Cairo, Egypt ) Rationale: To evaluate the long-term seizure outcome of 15 years of extratemporal neocortical epilepsy surgery of adults in the Bethel Epilepsy Center comparing the outcome between patients operated in three consecutive 5-year periods. Methods: Between 1991 and 2006, 221 adult patients with extratemporal drug resistant epilepsies were operated on. From 221 patients 28 patients (12.6%) had more than one operation, five patients (2.6%) received VNS. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of all patients. Patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis and those who only had a biopsy were excluded. Data was gathered by reviewing hospital files, outpatient reports, two-year in-patient postoperative follow-up results, and using mail and telephone questionnaires. Three patients were not available for review, six patients died, and in ten patients data was incomplete. Patients were divided into three groups, depending on the time of operation: group 1 (1991?1995), group 2 (1995?2000), and group 3 (2000?2005). Results: Group 1: (54 patients, 24.4%) mean age of patients at seizure onset in years 10.6 ± 8.8 (range 1?41), mean age at surgery 28.13 ± 10.3 (range 16?57), mean duration of epilepsy 17.4 ± 9.7 (range 1 to 38), mean duration of follow-up 11.4 ± 2.09 (range 1 to 14); outcome class 1 at the 6-month follow-up (47.0%), after 1 year (48.5%), 2 years (45.5%), 5 years (46.6%). Group 2: (90 patients, 40.7%), mean age at seizure onset 13.4 ± 10.4 (range 0.8?52), mean age at surgery 28.02 ± 10.1 (range 16?59), mean duration of epilepsy 15.6 ± 9.2 (range 0?44), mean duration of follow-up 7.6 ± 1.6 (range 2?10 yrs); outcome class 1 at the follow-up after 6 months (53.4%), 1 year (50.0%), 2 years (50.0%), 5 years (53.7%). Group 3: (77 patients, 34.4%) mean age at seizure onset 16.8 ± 15.0 (range 0.4?65), mean age at surgery 31.1 ± 13.1 (range 16?69), mean duration of epilepsy 14.2 ± 13.2 (range 0?64), mean duration of follow-up 2.6 ± 1.5 (range 0.5?5 yrs); outcome class 1 at the follow-up after 6 months (63.5%), 1 year (57.1%), 2 years (61.9%), 5 years (57.9%). A statistically significant difference was only found in the the 2-year outcome group (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The comparison of postoperative seizure outcome of extratemporal epilepsy surgery in adults over the last 15 years shows mixed results. A statistically significant improvement was seen only in the two-year postoperative outcome whereas at other points in time there was a tendency for improvement. 1,3 Frederick A. Schmitt, 2 Curtis A. Given, 1 Meriem K. Bensalem-Owen, 1 Michelle L. Mattingly, and 1 Toufic A. Fakhoury ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ; 2 Department of Radiology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ; and 3 Sanders Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY ) Rationale: Presurgical evaluation of language and memory using the internal carotid WADA (ICAW) procedure is a standard approach for patients with medically intractable epilepsy. However, ICAW results often provide equivocal memory data, especially in cases with a dominant hemisphere seizure focus, as a result of aphasia with amytal injection. Therefore, selective preoperative intracarotid amytal procedures (IAP) have been developed to target hippocampal functions. Several variations of the selective IAP have been reported and include selective injections of amytal into: (1) anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and (2) posterior cerebral artery (PCA). This report focuses on a clinical series of patients who had selective amytal injections through the internal carotid artery (ICA) with temporary balloon catheter occlusion of the distal ICA beyond the AchA origin. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with intractable epilepsy were evaluated using the distal ICA occlusion approach. Three patients underwent selective procedures for both hemispheres while the remaining 24 had selective injections targeting the hippocampus in the affected hemisphere along with a standard IAP of the contralateral hemisphere. Of these patients, 7 (26%) had previously ?failed? standard IAP injections given generalized anesthetic effects on the dominant hemisphere. Memory and language were evaluated in all patients using a modified McGill protocol that required learning of 3 visual objects and 3 verbal items after selective amytal injection. Subsequent free and cued recall of these items along with recognition was completed after resolution of the patient's homonymous hemianopsia. Results: All patients demonstrated homonymous hemianopsia with the selective injection and 78% showed brief temporal slowing on EEG ipsilateral to the injected hemisphere. Evaluation of memory showed encoding specific effects on memory items for 78% of cases where selective left-sided injection resulted in proportionally poorer recall of verbally encoded items. In the 3 right-sided selective IAPs, no memory encoding effects were observed. This ?selective? memory effect was independent of the presence of temporal slowing on EEG. Conclusions: Selective WADA procedures targeting the hippocampus through temporary occlusion of the supra-clinoidal ICA and injection through the AchA can be an effective tool in the presurgical evaluation of patients when evaluating information on memory preservation post surgical resection of a seizure focus. Further, selective WADA procedures generally show memory effects that are consistent with the verbal or visual presentation mode of the memory items used in IAP assessments. 1 Georges A. Ghacibeh, 1 Jeffrey Smith, 1 Keyur Patel, 1 Sandeep Konka, and 1 Stephan Eisenschenk ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL ) Rationale: Patients with mesiotemporal epilepsy have a better chance of achieving seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery than those with neocortical epilepsy. The risk of seizure recurrence depends on several factors. Previous studies revealed that interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) on post-operative EEG did not predict the risk of seizure recurrence. However, it is not known whether there is a difference based on the type of surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the relationship between IEA on post-operative EEG and seizure recurrence after epilepsy surgery is different in patients who underwent neocortical and mesiotemporal resections. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the electronic medical records of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program of the University of Florida between January 1997 and December 2002. Post-operative follow-up clinic notes were reviewed up to the last clinic note to determine the recurrence of seizures. EEG reports of the post-operative EEG were reviewed to assess for the presence of IEA. Epileptiform abnormalities were defined as frank spikes or sharp waves or electrographic seizures. Results: A total of 94 patients who had both adequate clinic follow-up and post-operative EEGs were identified. EEGs were performed on average 106 days after surgery and patients were followed in clinic on average 32 months after surgery. Seventy patients had mesiotemporal resections. Of those, 16 (23%) had IEA on their EEGs and 22 (31%) had seizure recurrence. A chi-square test revealed no significant relationship between seizure recurrence and the presence of IEA. Twenty four patients had neocortical resections. Of those, 14 (58%) had IEA and 12 (50%) had seizure recurrence. A chi-square test revealed a significant relationship between the presence of IEA and seizure recurrence (p = 0.013). However, 14 out of the 22 mesiotemporal and 8 out of the 12 neocortical surgery patients had seizure recurrence within 3 months after surgery, prior to the post-operative EEG. Conclusions: This study revealed that epileptiform activity on early post-operative EEG correlate with seizure recurrence in neocortical but not mesiotemporal surgeries. However, since most patients have seizure recurrence within three months after surgery, evaluation of the utility of earlier EEG is needed. 1 Ryder P. Gwinn, 1 John Morgan, 1 Lisa Caylor, 1 Alan Haltiner, 1 Laura Allen, and 1 Michael Doherty ( 1 Epilepsy Center, Seattle Neuroscience Institute, Seattle, WA ) Rationale: Hippocampal depth electrodes are useful in lateralizing and localizing medial temporal lobe seizures. Historically these have been placed either orthogonally or transversely using frame based or frameless stereotaxy. This method can provide quality electrical recordings of hippocampal activity, but is a blind procedure with inherent risks and limitations including bleeding, hippocampal injury, inconsistent hippocampal orientation, and incomplete sampling. We report the placement of ventricular depth electrodes under framless stereotactic and neuro-endoscopic guidance using direct visualization to assure safe and consistent placement of hippocampal recording electrodes, with quality recordings leading to successful seizure localization. Methods: Frameless stereotactic navigation (Steath Treon Plus, Medtronic) was used to guide occipito-parietal burr hole placement and endoscope trajectory. A neuro-endoscope (Channel? Neuroendoscope, Medtronic) was placed into the atria of the lateral ventricle, then guided down the temporal horn under direct visualization. A 10 contact, 5 mm spacing depth electrode (Ad-tech, Racine WI) was passed through the endoscope with 1 ? 2 contacts placed into the temporal pole. The endoscope was then removed using flouroscopy to verify stable electrode position. Electrode position was verified by co-registration of post-operative CT scan to pre-operative MRI in all patients. Results: Eleven ventricular electrodes were placed in 6 patients undergoing surgery for intracranial localization of partial seizures. Successful navigation of the temporal horn was achieved in all patients, and electrodes were verified to be touching the hippocampus in all patients visually and by post-operative imaging. No infection, neurologic injury, or post-operative hemorrhage was seen. Quality recordings were obtained from all electrodes, and seizure onsets were documented in 7/11 electrodes, with reversal potentials seen along the hippocampus using a bipolar montage. Two patients underwent anteromedial temporal resection 6 weeks post-implantation, with pathology showing gliosis adjacent to the electrode location. Conclusions: Electrocorticography may be performed using depth electrodes placed in the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Placement of temporal horn electrodes under direct neuro-endoscopic visualization can be performed safely, and provide high quality recordings of hippocampal activity without significant injury to the structure. Temporal horn electrodes are situated in a predictable anatomical relationship to hippocampal structures for reproducible recordings from the same hippocampal subfields between patients. Neuro-endoscopically placed ventricular electrodes may offer a safe and effective alternative to orthogonal and longitudinal hippocampal electrodes for localization of medial temporal lobe seizures. 1 Jeffery A. Hall ( 1 Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Proponents of tissue-sparing selective temporal resections for patients with mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable epilepsy begrudgingly acknowledge the lack of neuropsychological data demonstrating any related savings with these procedures. Seizure outcome in well-selected patients appears to be equivalent between the more ?selective? and larger traditional temporal lobectomies. One interpretation of why no obvious savings follows from selective resection is that the tissue is somehow rendered dysfunctional by the operation. Alternatively, it may be that we are not adequately probing the function of the spared temporal tissue. Methods: Ten consecutive patients who underwent transcortical (second temporal gyrus) transventricular selective amygdalohippocampectomy for mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable epilepsy were examined post-operatively with formal visual field testing. Each patient also had post-operative MRI to demonstrate the extent of resection and exclude complications. These patients were compared to a reference case of intractable non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy operated by the same surgeon. This patient underwent a more radical traditional temporal corticoamygdalohippocampectomy. Pre and post operative visual fields and MRI are available for this patient also. Results: The patient who underwent traditional temporal lobectomy demonstrated the expected homonymous superior quadrantopsia. Patients who underwent the selective procedure demonstrated some evidence of visual field loss, albeit to a lesser extent than that of the reference case. Conclusions: This finding has several important implications the most of salient of which suggests that the selective procedure results in the sparing of viable and functionally important brain tissue. Additionally, these data support the notion from recent studies of MR tractography, that the fibers of Meyer's Loop course further anterior in the temporal lobe than is generally acknowledged.

Tellez-Zenteno, 1 Samuel Wiebe, and 1 Nathalie Jette ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: In recent years, advances in surgical techniques have allowed patients without identifiable neuroimaging abnormalities to undergo epilepsy surgery. However, there is a notion that patients with normal MRI or histopathology may have worse surgical outcomes than those with lesional epilepsy. The objective of this study is to provide evidence-based estimates of the surgical outcome in patients with non-lesional epilepsy and to identify sources of results variation between published studies Methods: Medline, Index Medicus, bibliographies of reviews, original articles, and book chapters were searched to identify published articles since 1991, describing outcomes in ≥5 patients of any age who underwent resective or non-resective epilepsy surgery without an identifiable structural lesion by imaging or histopathology. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Results: Twenty-nine articles fulfilled eligibility criteria and described outcomes in 655 patients with non-lesional epilepsy surgery. Non-lesional status was defined by MRI in 56% of studies and by histopathology in 44%. Overall, 24% of patients described were non-lesional. The median proportion of seizure-free patients was 44% (95% CI 39?49) in non-lesional cases vs. 61% (95% CI 58?64) in those with lesions. The corresponding proportion was 46% (95% CI 39?53) if non-lesional status was defined by MRI, versus 42% (95% CI 35?49) if defined by histopathology. In non-lesional patients with temporal lobe surgery, 40% (95% CI 33?46) were seizure free. We explore aspects related to the validity of these results. Conclusions: Overall, non-lesional epilepsy surgery has inferior results compared with lesional cases (44% vs 61% respectively). The response after surgery was the same whether lesional status was defined using MRI or histopathology. Sources of heterogeneity are explored. 1 Hyeon-Seob Byeon, 1 Seung-Chul Hong, 1 Jong-Su Kim, 1 Jung-Il Lee, 1 Jong-Hyun Kim, 1 Do-Hyun Nam, and 2 Dae Won Seo ( 1 Neurosurgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: To compare seizure outcome in the patients with cavernous angioma treated by lesionectomy alone or further resection and to analyze the factors influencing on the surgical outcome. Methods: Fifty-nine patients (27 male) with supratentorial cavernous angioma associate with seizure were operated in our institute. Clinical, radiological and electrophysiologic data were collected retrospectively. The mean age was 32 years (ranged 2?67) and the mean follow up duration after surgery was 34.3 months (ranged 12?103). Results: Thirty-two patients underwent lesionectomy and remaining 27 patients underwent standard temporal lobectomy with tumor removal. Seizure outcome was compared using the Engel classification scheme between two kinds of technique. At the last follow up, 33 patients were involved in Engel class I, 6 patients in class II, 4 patients in class III and 2 patients were class IV. Estimated survival in patients who had shorter seizure histories and fewer preoperative seizures did not differ between the two surgical techniques. The important factors influencing the outcome were duration of seizure, location of tumor, multiple epileptic foci on electroencephalogram and surgical technique. Conclusions: These findings indicated that shorter seizure histories and fewer preoperative seizures can be effectively treated by lesionectomy alone, whereas those with longer histories and more seizures are not effectively treated by this procedure and may require epileptic surgery. And early surgical intervention is important for good treatment outcome. 1 Hariprasad Kunhiveedu, 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 1 Stephan U. Schüle, and 1 Richard C. Burgess ( 1 Department of Neurology, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Prediction of ictal onset zone by subdural interictal spike pattern has rarely been analyzed. The objective of our study was to analyze the relationship between interictal spikes and ictal onset zones on subdural EEG recordings. Methods: Fifteen patients (aged 25 to 61 years) undergoing prolonged subdural intracranial EEG recordings were included. On average 92 electrodes (range 42 to 119) were implanted. Representative interictal and ictal EEG recordings were reviewed. Interictal spike populations were identified by voltage from baseline, earliest onset, frequency of the spike population, presence of an aftergoing slow wave and duration. Distribution of the interictal activity was defined as 80% fall-off from the maximum. The electrodes with the earliest rhythmic evolution determined the ictal onset. The relationship between interictal EEG and ictal onset electrodes was analyzed. Results: Interictal spikes were seen from a discrete single focus in five patients, from two different foci in six patients and were multifocal or diffuse in four patients. Ictal onset was seen from circumscribed areas in 14 patients and was diffuse in one patient. Cases with more than one spiking pattern were not associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes. Single EEG seizure patterns were recorded in eight patients. In five patients two different EEG seizure patterns were recorded, one patient had three different EEG seizure patterns and one additional patient had five different EEG seizure patterns. Interestingly, cases with more than one subdural EEG seizure pattern were associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes (p < 0.05). In eight patients (53%) the most frequent spike focus was concordant with a subdural EEG seizure onset zone. Six out of these eight patients presented with only one subdural EEG seizure type. One of these eight patients presented with very broad spikes, but their maximum was concordant with the ictal onset zone. In three additional patients (20%) the most frequent or second most frequent spike population occurred one or two electrodes (1?2 cm) adjacent to a seizure onset zone. In three patients diffuse spiking was seen whereas the seizure onset was focal. One patient had diffuse seizure onset with focal spikes. Conclusions: Ictal onset zones on subdural EEG recordings were related to the most frequent subdural interictal spike focus in 53% of cases. After inclusion of the second most frequent spike focus and surrounding electrodes, an ictal onset zones could be predicted in 73% by interictal spiking. However, not all ictal onset zones were predicted by the interictal spike focus, in particular if a patient presented with more than one ictal onset zone. Interestingly, a higher number of implanted electrodes and a higher number of recorded ictal onset zones may be related. Analysis of interictal subdural EEG may be helpful in the prediction of the ictal onset zone. 1 Addolorata Mascia, 1 Antonio Sparano, 1 Vincenzo Esposito, 1 Sergio Paolini, 1 Roberta Morace, 1 Giancarlo Di Gennaro, and 1 Pier Paolo Quarato ( 1 Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; and Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy ) Rationale: To determine the potential effectiveness and tolerability of levitiracetam (Lev) versus oxacarbazepine (Oxc) versus placebo in preventing early postoperative seizures in patients undergoing brain surgery for mass lesions. Methods: 30 patients requiring elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain mass lesions were randomized to three groups of equal size, with a prospective, open-label, controlled design. One group receveid Lev (13.3?40 mg/kg/die) the other group receveid Oxc (18?20 mg/kg/die), the third group receveid placebo. In all the three groups the drug administration were oral with a titration performed within the 30 days preceding surgery. Early postoperative seizures (seizures occurring in the 7 days following surgery) were considered for the purpose of the study. Patients having chronic epilepsy were not included. On the contrary, heralding seizures were not considered as esclusion criterion Results: Early post-operative seizures were observed in all three groups. Patients taking Lev or Oxc showed less seizures than patients taking placebo. Conclusions: In our study Lev and Oxc seemed to be similarly effective in preventing early seizures after brain surgery. Both the drugs showed a good profile of tolerability and all patients remaining on each treatment during all the duration of the study. 1 Shearwood McClelland III, 2 Rebeca E. Garcia, 3 Daniel M. Peraza, 4 Tina T. Shih, 5 Lawrence J. Hirsch, 3 Joy Hirsch, and 2 Robert R. Goodman ( 1 Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; 2 Neurological Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ; 3 Radiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ; 4 Neurology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ; and 5 Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY ) Rationale: The nondominant amygdala is crucial for processing facial expression and emotional recognition (ER) of visual stimuli, particularly in facial fear recognition. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) often incur amygdalar and hippocampal damage. Previous studies have shown that patients with right-sided (nondominant) MTS experience impaired ER if TLE onset occurred before age six. This finding has resulted in the hypothesis that early right mesiotemporal insult impairs plasticity, resulting in ER deficits, while damage later in life (seizure onset after age five) results in no deficit. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a uniformly seizure-free postsurgical population. This study was performed to examine this issue in late-onset postsurgical patients. Methods: Controls (n = 10) and late-onset patients (n = 5) were recruited. All patients underwent nondominant anteromedial temporal lobectomy (AMTL), had TLE onset after age five, Wada-confirmed left-hemisphere language dominance and memory support, MTS on both pre-operative MRI and biopsy, and were Engel class I five years after surgery. Using a standardized (Ekman and Friesen) human face series depicting neutrality and the six basic emotions conveyed by facial expression (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise), subjects were asked to match the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face. Target faces expressed fear, anger, or happiness. Results: Statistical analysis (t-test) revealed that the late-onset group had ER (as measured by percentage of faces correct and reaction time) for fear (p = 0.871), anger (p = 0.256), and happiness (p = 0.608) comparable to controls. All 95% confidence intervals included zero. Conclusions: Following curative AMTL in nondominant MTS patients, TLE onset after age five does not predict significant ER impairment for facial expressions. Future studies are needed to examine whether early TLE onset continues to impair ER following AMTL. 1 Pradeep Modur, and 2 Warren Milteer ( 1 Neurology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY ; and 2 Hazelwood Center, Louisville, KY ) Rationale: To investigate the impact of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy in institutionalized patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) with respect to emergency room (ER) utilization for seizures. Methods: We identified patients with LGS from a retrospective chart review of 98 institutionalized patients with epilepsy. LGS was defined when all of the following criteria were met: mental retardation; multiple seizure types; frequent seizures refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); and prolonged video-EEG monitoring showing 2 of these 5 findings ? slow spike-wave discharges, generalized fast activity, multifocal (≥3 sites) epileptiform discharges, tonic seizures and atypical absence seizures. The institution's protocol specified administration of intrarectal diazepam (Diastat) for seizures or seizure clusters lasting >3 minutes, and transfer to an ER if seizures persisted >10 minutes. Because of frequent seizure clusters in this population, the number of days with documented seizures was counted instead of the actual number of seizures. The comparator group consisted of patients without VNS (non-VNS group) followed over a period of 18 months. The intervention group consisted of those with VNS, and were analyzed in two periods: 6 months before and 6 months after implantation. The primary outcome measure was the number of seizure-related ER visits in the VNS group before and after implantation. Secondary outcome measures were the number of seizure days and the number of Diastat administrations in the VNS group during the same periods. Fixed effects poisson model and poisson regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: There were 9 patients with LGS, and 4 of them had been implanted with VNS. In the non-VNS group, there were 5 patients (3 males), aged 24?53 years. In the VNS group of 4 patients (2 males) aged 25?56 years, the age at implantation was 22?53 years. Compared to non-VNS patients, the VNS patients before implantation had significantly higher Diastat administrations (p < 0.0005) and ER visits (p < 0.0005) but not seizure days (p = 0.06). In the VNS group, during 6 months of follow-up after implantation, the ER visits reduced significantly (10 versus 2, p = 0.04), the number of seizure days reduced minimally (107 versus 99, p = 0.58) while the number of Diastat administrations increased slightly (36 versus 50, p = 0.13). Conclusions: In a group of institutionalized LGS patients more prone to ER visits, VNS therapy significantly reduced the number of ER visits. The observed trend towards an increase in the administration of Diastat after VNS implantation suggests that the favorable outcome with respect to ER visits may be related to the combined effect of VNS and Diastat in reducing the duration of seizures or seizure clusters. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this and evaluate other potential factors such as VNS parameters and concomitant AEDs influencing this outcome.

Brick, 1 Warren Boling, 1 Alexander Torres-Trejo, and 1 Daunice Lohr ( 1 Neurology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV; and Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: The last few years have seen an increased interest in mechanisms regulating body weight. At hippocampal level, obesity can be viewed as the result of an imbalance between the tendency to seek a reward (food) and learned inhibitory processes. Our objective was to investigate the relation between removal of different brain structures and the development of postoperative eating disorder resulting in weight gain. Methods: In order to identify significant differences in weight changes, two groups of patients with intractable epilepsy were studied: patients with medically refractory partial seizures status post amygdalohippocampectomy (n = 25) and patients with extratemporal epilepsy who underwent surgery for the same condition (n = 18). BMI was calculated at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following surgery. Differences between the two groups were analyzed. The two groups were comparable for control of postoperative seizure, medications, age, gender and co-morbidities. Results: Postoperatively, a significant difference in weight, consisting of weight gain was observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy following the amygdalectomy compared to patients undergoing extratemporal surgery. Conclusions: Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that the amygdala plays a role in eating behavior. This might involve complex neuronal circuits controlling behaviors like rewards, learning and memory formation. This finding supports a possible role for amygdala in eating disorders and challenges the traditional idea of eating disorders associated with hypothalamic disturbances. 1 Dimitris G. Placantonakis, 1 Saadat Shariff, 2 Douglas Labar, 2 Cynthia Harden, 2 Syed Hosain, 3 Neil Schaul, 3 Dimitrius Kolesnik, and 1 Theodore H. Schwartz ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY ; 2 Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY ; and 3 Neurology, New York Hospital of Queens, Flushing, NY ) Rationale: Medically refractory epilepsy is amenable to neurosurgical intervention if the epileptogenic focus can be accurately localized. In some situations, the scalp EEG and MRI are discordant and/or non-lateralizing, yet the clinician is still highly suspicious that a single focus exists, either based on a dominant interictal focus or stereotypical semiology. In these situations, a bilateral intracranial survey can be helpful to lateralize the ictal onset zone. The risks and success of such bilateral surveys have not been well described. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with refractory seizures treated over a 4-year period. Patients underwent bilateral placement of subdural strip electrodes and, in 50% of cases, stereotactic implantation of depth electrodes into the mesial temporal lobes. In all cases the MRI scans and scalp EEG were not sufficiently concordant to lateralize seizure onsets. The mean age was 35.1 years and 75% of patients were male. Results: Patients were electrophysiologically monitored for an average of 7.4 days. Thirty-five percent (n = 7) subsequently underwent unilateral implantation of electrodes to more accurately localize the seizure focus. Sixty percent (n = 12) eventually underwent a therapeutic procedure. Of those, 58.3% underwent resection of epileptogenic foci without unilateral invasive mapping. Reasons for no further surgery (n = 8) included failing the WADA (37.5%), multifocal onsets (25%), refusal of further treatment (12.5%) and negative intraoperative ECoG (12.5%). There was 1 complication, involving a retained electrode fragment that was removed in a separate minor procedure. Of the surgically treated patients, 58.3% have no seizures currently, 16.7% have improved and 25% remain unchanged. Conclusions: Bilateral placement of subdural strip and depth electrodes to survey the cortex in patients with non-lateralizing scalp video-EEG and MRI but clinical suspicion for localized epilepsy is both safe and effective. Of those patients who go on to a therapeutic procedure, 75% are either improved or seizure-free. 1 Fabio Sebastiano, 1 Pier Paolo Quarato, 1 Vincenzo Esposito, 1 Angelo Picardi, 1 Antonio Sparano, 1 Addolorata Mascia, 1 Mario Manfredi, and 1 Giancarlo Di Gennaro ( 1 Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurosurgery, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Pozzilli, Isernia, Rome, Italy; Center of Epidemiology and Health Surveillance and Promotion, Italian National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy, Rome, Lazio, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy; Epilepsy Surgery Unit; Department of Neurology, IRCCS Neuromed; La Sapienza University, Pozzilli, Isernia, Rome, Italy; and Epilepsy Surgery Unit, IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia, Italy ) Rationale: To evaluate a novel method for localization of subdural electrodes in presurgical assessment of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Basic demographic, clinical, and neuroradiological characteristics of patients Patient N.

Electrodes were detected on post-implantation brain CT scans through a semiautomated procedure based on a MATLAB routine. Then, post-implantation CT scans were fused with pre-implantation MRI to localize the electrodes in relation to the underlying cortical structures. Two independent raters tested the reliability of this procedure by comparing 3D-rendered MR images of the electrodes with electrode position as determined by intraoperative digital photography. Results: In each patient, all electrodes could be correctly localized and visualized in a stereotactic space, thus allowing optimal surgery planning. For both raters, the agreement between the procedure-generated images and the digital photographs was good in all patients. Conclusions: While our findings need confirmation on larger samples including patients with anterior epilepsy, this procedure allowed to localize subdural electrodes and to establish the spatial relationship of each electrode to the underlying brain structure, either normal or damaged, on brain convessity, basal and medial cortex. [figure 1] 1,2 Marianna V. Spanaki, 3 Kost V. Elisevich, and 1 Brien J. Smith ( 1 Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ; 2 Neurology, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery is considered to be the most effective treatment in refractory epilepsy with seizure free outcomes from 45% to 67.9% (Engel J. Surgery for seizures. N Engl J Med 1996;334:647?652). However, little data exists on the number of older patients who are treated surgically, the post surgical complications and outcome rates in this patient population. Methods: We identified all patients who were 50 years and older and had epilepsy surgery for refractory epilepsy at Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) Epilepsy Program from 1994 to 2005. Data on age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, risk factors, noninvasive and invasive video/EEG monitoring, surgery site, pathology, outcome, and medical conditions at surgery as well as complications were collected through search of the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit admission database and the HFH electronic database (CarePlus). Patients who had tumors that presented with seizures and surgery was performed in the context of tumor treatment were not included. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Thirty five patients from 50 to 70 years old (median age = 55; 19 females) underwent epilepsy surgery at HFH. Duration of epilepsy was from 6 months to 50 years (median = 35 years). Nineteen patients (54%) with inconsistent localization during scalp continuous video EEG monitoring had invasive monitoring with grids, strips and/or depth electrodes. Thirty one patients had temporal resections (16 had left anterior temporal resection), 3 extratemporal and one subpial transection. Pathology revealed mesial temporal sclerosis in 14 patients, heterotopia in 2, dual pathology in 2, cavernous angioma in 2, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor in 1. In the remainder pathology was consistent with various degrees of gliosis or non diagnostic. Duration of follow up ranged from 1 month to 13 years (median follow up = 2 years). One patient was lost to follow up. Twenty five patients (25/34; 73.5%) were seizure free after surgery, 4 of which remained seizure free off antiepileptic medication. Medical history prior to surgery was consistent with hypertension (HTN) in 6 patients, hypercholesterenemia and HTN in 3, diabetes and HTN in 2 and coronary artery disease in 3 (2 of which had previous angioplasty). One patient had right MCA infarct one day after surgery that resulted in mild left hemiparesis. Following surgery, 1 patient developed transient angina and another one pulmonary embolism that was successfully treated. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy in older patient population is a safe treatment and yields seizure freedom outcomes that are comparable to those reported in young patients. Co-morbid conditions and advanced age should not prevent physicians from offering epilepsy surgery to appropriate candidates. 1 K. Meng Tan, 1 Elson L. So, 1 Gregory D. Cascino, 2 Fredric B. Meyer, 2 W. Richard Marsh, and 1 Gregory A. Worrell ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic ; and 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy may be excellent candidates for epilepsy surgery. However, lateralization of the ictal onset zone is not always clear from non-invasive studies. In such cases, bilateral temporal depth electrode implantation may be undertaken prior to considering temporal lobe resection. Although intraoperative pharmacologic activation is known to increase interictal epileptiform discharges on electrocorticography, the clinical relevance of this procedure has not been established. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all epilepsy patients who underwent bilateral temporal depth electrode implantation during the period 1997?2005 and received intraoperative alfentanil activation. We identified ten patients and characterized the data provided by EEG (interictal and ictal), MRI, intraoperative electrocorticography (before and after pharmacologic activation) and subsequent prolonged intracranial EEG monitoring, with respect to localization of the ictal onset zone. We focused on the correlation between pharmacologic activation and lateralization of the epileptogenic temporal lobe as determined by intracranial EEG monitoring. Results: 6 females and 4 males meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Administration of alfentanil intraoperatively caused increased activation of epileptiform discharges bilaterally in 5 patients, and no definite activation in another 3 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, the side of pharmacologic activation did not correspond with the epileptogenic temporal lobe determined on subsequent prolonged intracranial monitoring. Conclusions: Intraoperative pharmacologic activation does not appear to be useful in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy of unclear lateralization. 1 Denise S. Taylor, 1 Heber L. Varela, 1 William O. Tatum, 1 Fernando L. Vale, and 1 Selim R. Benbadis ( 1 Neurology  if non-temporal coverage was performed, patients were excluded. Outcome used Engel's classification. Results: Over a 5-year period, 21 patients underwent bitemporal subdural strips. Out of 1,356 patients monitored, this represents 1.5% of patients. The results for the 21 patients with bitemporal subdural strips evaluation was as follows: ? 11 patients (52%) had clear lateralization (100% of seizures on one side) resulting in a temporal lobectomy: 8 class I, 2 class II, and 1 class III. ? 5 patients had a predominance but less than 100% lateralization. These were offered a temporal lobectomy and presented before surgery as an unlikely seizure free outcome but a probable improvement (?palliative? interventions). 4 patients underwent a lobectomy (2 class III, 2 class IV), and 1 declined. ? 1 patient underwent resection of a large arachnoid cyst that was contralateral to seizure onset (outcome class II). ? 4 patients (19%) had true bitemporal epilepsy without predominance and no resection was performed. Conclusions: Subdural strips achieved lateralization of TLE in about half of cases where the non-invasive evaluation failed to do so. When lateralization was 100% to one side, postoperative outcome was excellent. About 19% had true bitemporal epilepsy. 3 Fuyuki Hirashima, 1 Eric Dinnerstein, 1 Karen L. Gilbert, 2 David W. Roberts, 1 Vijay M. Thadani, and 1 Peter D. Williamson ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Section of Neurosurgery, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; and 3 Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH ) Rationale: We wished to study variables that influence outcome, in terms of seizure control, among patients with mesial temporal sclerosis who undergo surgery. We compared two surgical techniques. Some patients had a standard temporal lobectomy, and others had a selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy. In this retrospective study, we compared the outcomes of these surgical techniques with respect to seizure control. Methods: 61 patients with medically refractory epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (seen on MRI and subsequent pathological examination) were evaluated. The two groups were very similar with regard to age, age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, handedness, risk factors such as febrile seizures, and side of resection. The number of anti-epileptic medications, before and after surgery, was the same in the two groups. 30 patients had a standard temporal lobectomy, and 31 had the more selective procedure. The choice of procedure was arbitrary. Follow-up information was collected at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.38 ± 1.02 years. Outcome was assessed using the Engel classification. Patients were classified as Class I outcomes if they were seizure-free for the previous year. To simplify the statistics, patients in Classes II, III, and IV were pooled. Neuropsychological testing was done before surgery, and 6?12 months after surgery. Results: Class I outcomes ranged from 63% to 96%. A trend towards a difference between the two surgical groups, with more Class I outcomes among those who had the standard procedure, was detected 4 years after surgery (89% vs. 67%), and a statistically significant difference was apparent 5 years after surgery (96% vs. 63%, p < .01). However, if the data were analyzed with Class I defined as seizure-free since surgery, there was no difference between the two groups. Neuropsychological testing did not show a significant difference between the two groups before or after surgery. Conclusions: These data suggest that in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis a better outcome with respect to seizure control may be seen with a wider resection of the anterior-lateral temporal lobe. The difference, if there is one, depends on how a Class I outcome is defined. Roughly the same% of patients in both groups has post-operative seizures; but after several years, a higher% of those who had the wider resection has been seizure-free for at least a year. The clinical significance of this difference is uncertain. 1 Alejandro Torres-Trejo, 1 Adriana Palade, 1 Warren Boling, and 1 John F. Brick ( 1 Neurology, West Virginia Univerisity, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: After epilepsy surgery for cortical dysplasia, a high percentage of patients may remain seizure free. The clinician for various medical reasons may decide to discontinue one or more antiepileptic drugs. It is reasonable to consider discontinuation of the antiepileptic drugs (AED) to perhaps decrease some of the side effects associated with these medications. We would like to identify whether patients will continue to remain seizure free after discontinuation of AED's. Methods: We are reporting five patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for resection of epileptic focus with pathology reported as cortical dysplasia. The seizure focus was localized electrographically. Structures resected include right posterior temporal region, right central sulcus, amygdalohippocampectomy, right frontal lobectomy, and a left parietal region resection. For various medical resons all of the patients had their AED's discontinued between six months to three years. Results: All of these patients remained seizure-free between six months to three years after surgery, but had recurrent seizures after withdrawal of medications was attempted. Conclusions: Patients that had successful epilepsy surgery resecting the epileptic focus due to cortical dysplasia remained seizure free while on AED's but had recurrence of seizures when the medications were discontinued. This suggests that patients with cortical dysplasia may fail AED discontinuation despite having good seizure control postoperatively if the AED's are discontinued before three years. 1 K. Upchurch, 2 J. Stern, 2 R. Staba, 2 C.L. Wilson, 2 J. Engel Jr., and 1 I. Fried ( 1 Neurosurgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 2 Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: For cases of pharmacologically refractory epilepsy in which data from noninvasive diagnostic studies (Phase I) are discordant with respect to the epileptogenic zone, a hypothesis concerning the location of ictal onset is formulated. On the basis of this hypothesis, patients may undergo invasive tests such as ictal EEG recordings via intracerebral depth electrodes (Phase II). The purpose of this study was to assess clinical outcomes (diagnostic and therapeutic) of invasive chronic depth electrode recording for patients with medically intractable epilepsy in a series of 100 patients who underwent operation by a single surgeon at a single institution. Methods: Using the UCLA Seizure Disorders Center surgical database, the history, operative course, and clinical outcomes of 100 patients with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent implantation of intracerebral depth electrodes at UCLA Medical Center between January 1993 and August 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of the 100 patients reviewed, 54 were males; mean age was 33.2 years; and age range was 12?50 years. All surgeries were performed stereotactically by the same surgeon (I.F.) with pre-operative targeting based on stereotactic cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. The average number of depth electrodes implanted for each patient was 10 (range 6 to 12). In 60/100 patients, a single epileptogenic zone was localized via the first Phase II study; 10/100 underwent a second Phase II study with subdural grids/strips; and 59/100 underwent Phase III resection. Morbidity secondary to intracerebral depth electrode implantation consisted of: (1) small intracerebral hematoma incidentally revealed on post-implant or post-deplant imaging in three asymptomatic patients; (2) contaminant bacteria on either Gram stain or culture on deplanted electrodes in two asymptomatic patients who were clinically without other evidence of infection; and one episode of fever and cerebrospinal fluid pleiocytosis during implantation in one patient whose deplanted electrodes and cerebrospinal fluid showed negative bacterial cultures. Mortality was zero. Conclusions: These data suggest that chronically implanted intracerebral depth electrodes for electrophysiologic recording are safe and continue to be important in patient selection for Phase III epilepsy surgery, despite the emergence of sophisticated noninvasive diagnostic modalities.

Buschman ( 1 Neurosurgery, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; 2 Neurology, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ; and 3 Institute for Neuromodulation (TWIN), Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, Netherlands ) Rationale: VNS-therapy for treatment of patients with medically refractory epilepsy in the Netherlands is part of a continuous quality improvement system. This encompasses the organisatory structure, responsibilities, processes and facilities for carrying out quality care. One of the basic and core elements of a quality system is the systematic monitoring of the process of care via the quality circle. The first outcome results of VNS-therapy in patients with epilepsy within this setting in the Netherlands are presented. Methods: The quality system was developed in a close collaboration with medical specialists from 5 neurosurgery and 5 epilepsy centers. Monitoring of the VNS-quality system is performed in three phases (intake, implant, and follow-up). The main indicators are reduction of epileptic seizures and changes in seizure severity, quality of life (QOLIE-89) and adverse events. The effect of VNS during follow-up was recorded after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Results: Between 2002 and 2006, 122 patients were included following the national protocol for VNS-therapy. During the first 2 years patient referral was low (?12 patients p.y.). Thereafter ?30 patients per year were included. Of these patients 9 were excluded. Of the remaining patients, at the time of analysis, seventy had received an implant, 22 were on the waiting list for implantation and 21 were in the intake phase. The mean age at intake was 40 y (SE 1.5 y). The onset of epilepsy in these patients was at 12.7 y (SE 1.1 y), and had a history with medically refractory epilepsy of 27.7 y (SE 1.5 y). They had 60.0 (SE 11.1) epileptic seizures per month. Most patients had localized partial epilepsy (59% symptomatic and 31% cryptogenic). A medically significant (>40%) decrease on seizure frequency during VNS was observed in 35% of patients after 1 month, and 49%, 61%, 42% and 64%, after respectively 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Seizure severity was markedly reduced in 46%, 46%, 52%, 62% and 55% of patients after respectively 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. About 80% of patients used ?magnet activation? to prevent or halt a seizure. 52% of patients experience a better or much better post-ictal recovery period with VNS. Side-effects were mainly voice related (hoarseness: 68%) and throat pain (32%). Quality of life showed statistically significant improvement in ?change in health? and ?general health?. Conclusions: Monitoring the effect of VNS-therapy in a national quality-system setting guaranties high quality care. Moreover it provides an effective means to review the outcome results of the participating centers. This national data-base may eventually help identify response predictors to further improve the effectiveness of VNS-therapy, which will subsequently be implemented in the national VNS-therapy protocol. 1 Kenou Van Rijckevorsel, 2 Alexandra Volckaert, 1 Marianne De Tourtchaninoff, 1 Geraldo Vaz, and 1 Christian Raftopoulos ( 1 Reference Center for Refractory Epilepsy, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ; and 2 Psychology Faculty, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ) Rationale: Epilepsy surgery is an effective treatment for seizure control, especially in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Morbidity is low, often limited to visual field defect and memory problems. However, long-term cognitive and emotional effects are poorly documented, especially in selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (Sel-AH). This paper studied memory (hippocampus,) emotions (amygdala) and quality of life (QOL) in 21 TLE patients after Sel-AH. Methods: Out of 31 Sel-AH patients operated between 2001 and 2005, 21 adults (5M, mean age 35 (19?53) years, 15 left) completed the tests; 4 children or teenagers were excluded, 4 refused or did not answer, 2 died of possible SUDEP more than 2 years after AH. Memory (immediate, work and general) was tested subjectively (QAM) and objectively (MEM-III Wechsler 3rd ed). QOL was appreciated with QOLIE-31-P questionary and emotions were analyzed by presenting computed pictures of fear, sadness and joy (Mann-Witney and Greenhouse-Geisser tests). Results were compared to matched controls or control population. Results: 15 (71.43%) are seizure free since surgery. 4 complained spontaneously from memory and 4 were chronically depressed, already before AH. For memory, patients' performances are inferior to controls' in QAM for reading and movie, especially in left AH. With MEM-III test, patients are less competent than controls, but work memory is the most preserved or the best recovered without side inference of AH. There is no correlation between QAM and MEM-III results. For QOL, patients are less anxious than unoperated epilepsy controls regarding seizures and medications. However, patients are more anxious than controls in general regarding the ongoing (test) situation. In emotional testing, there are significant differences between controls and patients, for control situations (human-animal and male-female) and in emotional testings: patients made more errors and more omissions with a slightly increased reaction time (RT). However, these differences were minimal without side inference of AH. Conclusions: Memory, QOL and emotions have been tested in 21 adult Sel-AH patients, compared to matched controls or control population. Memory is less performant in patients compared to controls, but not deteriorated by surgery. QOL is improved in surgery patients compared to unoperated epilepsy patients regarding seizures and medications. For emotions, patients differ significantly from controls by making more errors and omissions with a slightly increased RT. However, these results are the same for test and emotional situations and are probably unrelated to surgery. 1 Marcos Velasco, 1 Ana L. Velasco, and 1 Francisco Velasco ( 1 Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, Hospital General de México, Mexico City, Mexico ) Rationale: Resective surgery of the epileptic focus yields very good results, nevertheless there are cases that escape this surgical possibility, i.e. patients with bilateral hippocampal foci or patients with epileptic focus located nearby eloquent areas for speech and memory (usually the left side). These latter patients cannot be operated on because it would mean having severe neurological impairment particularly related to short term memory. These patients are candidates for neuromodulating procedures. The present study evaluates the long term efficacy of ESH in the treatment of complex partial seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Nine patients were studied. They had at least a 6 month basal period during which a careful seizure record was obtained. They all underwent bilateral hippocampal electrode implantation to establish focus was laterality and location. 3 patients had bilateral and 6 had unilateral foci. Diagnostic electrodes were explanted and definitive Medtronic electrodes were implanted directed to the hippocampal foci. Position was confirmed with MRI and afterwards the DBS system internalized. Patients signed the informed consent approved by the Hospital's Ethics Committee and started a double blind stimulation protocol. Patients attended every 3 months for seizure count and neuropsychological tests. Results: Follow up went from at least 18 months to 5 years. Patients were divided in two groups: 5 had normal MRIs and 4 had hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with normal MRI had a seizure reduction of >95%. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis had a seizure reduction of 30?50%. None of the patients showed deterioration of neuropsychological function, patients who had >95% seizure reduction, showed improvement in the neurophsychological tests. No patient showed adverse effects. 1 patient had to be explanted after 2 years due to skin erosion in the trajectory of the system. 1 patient had skin erosion which was corrected with plastic surgery. Conclusions: ESH provides a non lesional method that improves seizure outcome without deterioration of memory in patients with unilateral or bilateral hippocampal epileptic focus. 1 Clarissa L. Yasuda, 1 Leonardo Bonilha, 1 Chris Rorden, 1 Helder Tedeschi, 1 Evandro Oliveira, 1 Li M. Li, and 1 Fernando Cendes ( 1 Neurology, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil; Neuropsychiatry, University of South Carolina; and Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of South Carolina ) Rationale: Resection of hippocampus (HIP)has been the standard procedure for patients with drug resistant (DR) medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) (1), with a success rate of approximately 75%(1,2). The reasons for the failure of almost 25% of the operated patients remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the influence of resection of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in addition to HIP in the surgical outcome(SO) of these patients. Methods: We studied 43 patients with DR, unilateral MTLE who underwent anteromedial temporal resection in the Epilepsy Service at UNICAMP, between 1998 and 2004. We selected patients according to our standard surgical investigation protocol (2) and included only patients with hippocampal atrophy supporting both clinical and electrophysiological findings. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. All patients underwent a routine MRI scan at least six months after the surgery, with the following parameters: T1weighted with 1 mm isotropic voxels acquired on a 2 Tesla scanner. We used the Engel's postoperative outcome scale (1) and conducted a voxel lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) (3) of their post-operative MRI to discriminate the contribution of distinct segments of the MTL cortex to the SO (4). We computed linear regressions and applied a cost function transformation of the resection maps for each patient to a common set of spatial coordinates. Results: Patients underwent surgery with the mean age of 37 (range 17?56) years, and the mean follow up period was 40 (range 11?99) months. The SO classification was: 76% as Engel I,14% as Engel II,5% as Engel III and 5% as Engel IV. We observed that the extent of hippocampal removal was associated with better outcomes (t = 2.371, p = 0.023). However, when the resection of the HIP was associated with resection of the entorhinal cortex there was a greater likelihood of seizure control after surgery (t = 3.286, p = 0.002) (Fig. 1). Figure 1. VLSM maps are overlaid in a normal T1 template. Colors that are associated with low p-values (green, yellow and red) are the most significantly associated with a good SO and correspond to the entorhinal cortex and HIP. [figure 1] Conclusions: Based upon this finding, the efficiency of the surgical treatment of MTLE can be improved by including the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal resection.

Mello ( 1 Neurology  and 2 Neurology  all kids submitted to callosal section had a 90% decrease of the generalized seizure frequency, but none was seizure-free. All patients improved their linear growth after surgery and all of them were growing at least two percentile intervals above the preoperative level. Although not statistically significant, this ?catch-up? phenomenon was clinically more noticeable in those kids submitted to callosal section. Conclusions: Children with refractory epilepsy that underwent successful epilepsy surgery caught-up with linear growth after surgery. Although this could be seen as recovery from a chronic illness in the kids with focal resections that were seizure-free postoperatively, it is unlikely that an isolated response to improved health would be responsible for the additional growth in patients submitted to callosal section, who were not seizure-free postoperatively. In this pediatric population, an inhibitory effect on growth from the epileptic activity might explain this postoperative catch-up phenomenon, especially in children with generalized epilepsy.

Frost ( 1 Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA, St. Paul, MN ; and 2 United Neurosurgery Associates, United Neurosurgery Associates, St. Paul, MN ) Rationale: Many clinical variables are considered when selecting pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates with the objective of predicting beneficial outcome. Methods: We analyzed all pediatric patients who underwent initial resective surgery at Minnesota Epilepsy Group from Jan 2000-Dec 2002. Beneficial outcome was defined as Engel class I or II. Beneficial outcomes were compared to many diagnostic variables: attainment of early childhood milestones, presence of nocturnal seizures, history of febrile seizures, history of status epilepticus, symptomatic versus cryptogenic etiology, temporal vs. extra-temporal lobe seizures, complete vs. partial resection, and presence of multiple conflicting diagnostic variables. Outcome measurements were done at 24-months. Statistical method utilized was Fisher's Exact Test. Results: 46 consecutive subjects were identified and reviewed; 23 (50%) underwent temporal lobe only resection; extra-temporal resections included 10 (22%) frontal, 1 (2%) parietal, and 12 (26%) multi-lobe. In subjects with available follow-up data, 19/33 (58%) were seizure free at 24-months. Achievement of early childhood milestones was not associated with beneficial seizure outcome. The clinical history of nocturnal seizures, febrile seizures, or status epilepticus did not statistically separate beneficial outcomes groups. Etiology was not a statistically significant influence on beneficial outcome at 24-months (symptomatic 23/30: 77%; cryptogenic 1/3: 33%; p < 0.174); however, this is may be influenced by low numbers within the cryptogenic group. Temporal lobe surgery was statistically more successful in achieving a beneficial outcome of Engel I-II in 15/17 (88%) subjects compared to 9/16 (56%) of the extra-temporal group (p < 0.046). Complete resection of the epileptogenic zone was associated with beneficial outcome in 20/24 (83%) subjects compared to partial resections 4/9 subjects (44%) (p < 0.039). The presence of multiple conflicting diagnostic variables was the strongest predictor of beneficial outcome as 24/27 (89%) subjects achieved Engel I-II compared to none of the 6 subjects with >1 contralateral diagnostic variable (Fisher's Exact test p < 0.001). Conclusions: Favorable diagnostic variables associated with an Engel class I-II outcome following epilepsy surgery include temporal lobe resections, complete resections, and absence of multiple contralateral diagnostic variables. In this retrospective review, the absence of multiple contralateral variables was the strongest predictor. 1 Georg Dorfmüller, 1 Emidio Procaccini, 1 Martine Fohlen, 1 Christine Bulteau, 1 Claude Jalin, and 1 Olivier Delalande ( 1 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Fondation Rothschild, Paris, France ) Rationale: To present our single-center experience with a frameless robot-guided endoscopic system for the transventricular disconnection of hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) associated with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: Fourty-three patients (9 m to 34 y, median age: 10 y) were operated on either through a pterional approach (8) or by means of transventricular endoscopy (21) or subsequently by both techniques (14), in order to disconnect the HH below or at the wall of the third ventricle. For the endoscopic approach we used a frameless stereotactic robot-guided navigation (Neuromate?, Schaerer-Mayfield). The trajectory of the endoscopic approach was defined by the hamartomas plane of attachment on the hypothalamus, for which we have proposed an anatomo-topographic classification. Results: In terms of seizure outcome, we achieved the best results in HH with a vertical broad plane of attachment, extending into the third ventricle, enabling us to disconnect it through the endoscopic route. In this subtype (n = 12), 83% of the patients became seizure-free, as compared to 43% in the other three types (horizontal attachment, attachment in multiple planes and giant HH). Other parameters, such as the patients age, seizure type and frequency or the duration of illness, were not significantly related with the outcome. In all, of 42 patients followed up, 21 (50%) became seizure-free and 2 had rare events, while 17 (41%) had a worthwhile reduction in their seizure frequency, and 2 patients remained unchanged. Furthermore, improvement in several patients with disease-related cognitive and behavioural disturbances could be objectified postoperatively. In terms of surgery-related morbidity, the endoscopic approach had a significantly lower complication rate. Conclusions: Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of the disconnection of HH extending into the third ventricle with our robot-guided endoscopic approach. 1 Eliana Garzon, 2 Ajay Gupta, 2 Jennifer Haut, 2 Deepak Lachhwani, 2 Prakash Kotagal, 2 Elaine Wyllie, 3 William Bingaman, 1 Americo Sakamoto, and 2 Hans Luders ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foudation, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: In infants and young children with congenital or early onset acquired lesions, interictal scalp EEG may show generalized or multiregional abnormalities but ictal EEG concordant with semiology and brain MRI usually clarifies the epileptogenic zone for surgical option. We studied 6 children with catastrophic epilepsy whose ictal scalp EEG was classified as maximum over the unaffect hemisphere contralateral to the brain lesion. Factors leading to paradoxical lateralization of ictal scalp EEG over the unaffected hemisphere were evaluated. Methods: Of 209 patients in the pediatric epilepsy surgery database of Cleveland Clinic Foundation, clinical, EEG, brain imaging, surgery and postoperative records of 6 patients, whose EEG was classified as maximum in the unaffected hemisphere were reviewed. Digital records were restored and analyzed independently. Paradoxical lateralization was defined as scalp EEG seizure pattern that developed eiher exclusively or bilaterally but maximally contralateral to the to the side of the lesion. Results: Six patients, 4 females, 3?14 years in age at the time of the pre-surgical evaluation, were identified. Despite the paradoxical lateralization of ictal scalp EEG during recorded seizures, lateralizing signs (>1 sign in 3 patients) of focal tonic (4 patients), head versive (2 patients), hemiclonic (1 patient) and asymmetric epileptic spasm (1 patient) were noted contralateral (concordant) to the side of lesion. Interictal EEG showed generalized or lateralized and multiregional epileptiform discharges with predominance (> 65%) over the affected hemisphere in 3/6, generalized but maximum over the unaffected hemisphre in 2/6, and generalized with no focal predominance in 1 patient. Brain MRI showed extensive destructive (encephaloclastic) lesions such as stroke in 3 and encephalomalacia (post status epilepticus and infectious) in 3 patients. All patients underwent hemispherectomy and 5/6 patients were seizure free after 5 months to 3 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Extensive congenital or early onset acquired encephaloclastic lesions may produce an ictal scalp EEG pattern that appear maximum over the unaffected hemisphere. Interictal EEG in these patients may also show bilateral and multiregional abnormalities with or without any predominant region of abnormality. These scalp EEG patterns should be recognized and they do not preclude benefit from epilepsy surgery if the neurological deficits, semiology, and imaging implicate the abnormal hemisphere. Early spread to the normal hemisphere, the presence of encephaloclastic lesion modifying scalp EEG patterns, and secondary epileptogenesis may explain these findings.

Methods: The 13 patients were affected by static or progressive encephalopathies, involving the right hemisphere in 7 cases, and the left in 6. Diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by pathological study. Motor, mental, and language evaluation have been performed before surgery and at least yearly during a follow-up lasting 6?72 months (median 35.5 months). All the patient underwent peri-insular hemispherotomy. Results: Four patients had malformation of cortical development (2 hemimegalencepahly, 2 cortical dysplasia), 3 patients suffered of acquired perinatal brain damage and 6 patients were affected by Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). Age at the first seizure was 1 month ? 11 years (median 4.4 years), age at surgery was 6 months-18 years (median 7.3 years), the mean delay between the onset of seizures and surgery being 3.3 years (range 4 months-9 years). In all the patients motor deficit contralateral to the affected hemisphere, mental retardation or cognitive decline, of different severity, were present at the time of treatment. Post-op course was complicated in 2 cases (chemical meningitis, subdural hematoma). There were no life-threatening complications. Among the 10 patients followed-up for at least 12 months, surgery was judged as successful in 8 cases. Six patients became seizure-free (3/4 cases with RE, 2/2 cases with acquired brain damage, 1/2 cases with diffuse cortical dysplasia), whereas 2 children (1 with RE, 1 with cortical dysplasia) showed >50% reduction of seizures. Antiepileptic treatment was withdrawn in 3 patients, and simplified in 4. In all the 8 patients neurological condition improved: motor deficits remained unchanged in 3 patients and improved in 5; a significant cognitive and behavioural improvement was observed in 5 patients, no patient with left hemispherotomy experienced worsening in language. No improvement in seizure frequency, nor in motor and cognitive skills was, by contrast, obtained in the 2 children affected by hemimegalencephaly. Conclusions: Our data support the efficacy of peri-insular hemispherotomy in unilateral encephalopathies. As already reported, the seizure outcome is related to the underlying pathology, with the best results in acquired brain damage and in RE, and the worst in hemimegalencephaly. Our data also confirm that control of seizures is often associated with improvement of motor and mental abilities when surgery is performed in childhood. 1 Jin Sook Lee, 1 Jee Yoon Park, 1 Jin Hwa Moon, 1 Hee Hwang, 1 Ki Joong Kim, 1 Yong Seung Hwang, 2 Seung Ki Kim, 2 Byung Kyu Cho, and 3 Ho Jin Park ( 1 Pediatrics, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; 2 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 3 Pediatrics, Eulji University Hospital, Daejeon, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT) is a benign brain tumor and often occurs in association with medically intractable partial seizures. The authors report our experience of DNT patients treated with epilepsy surgery. Methods: A retrospective review and analysis of medical records were performed on brain MRI findings, interictal and ictal EEG features pathological findings, other clinical characteristics, and surgical outcome of 14 patients with refractory epilepsy secondary to DNT. Results: All patients showed cortical or subcortical lesions with T1 low and T2 high signal intensity, and only one case showed focal small enhancing portion within the tumor. Other MRI findings included cystic formation (6), calcification (2) and hippocampal atrophy (1). Temporal lobe was involved in 9 cases (64.3%), while frontal, parietal or occipital lobes were involved in 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Mean age at seizure onset was 7.2 years (range 0.3 ? 13.8 years). All patients presented with complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, however, one patient had previous history of infantile spasms. Ten of the 12 patients revealed abnormal findings on interictal EEG. Long-term video-EEG monitoring (VEM) was done in 5 patients. The epileptogenic lobe was correctly localized by VEM in 4 patients who had lesions in the temporal lobe. Intracranial recording was performed in one patient, in whom lesion was located in the parietal lobe but scalp VEM failed to localize ictal onset zone. Lesionectomy was done in 8 cases (57%) and temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy was done in 6 cases (43%). Pathology revealed associated cortical dysplasia (CD) in 4 patients (28.6%), and one of them showed oligodendroglioma component as well as CD. Mean follow-up period after surgery was 2.8 years (range 0.2 ? 5.9 years). All had an Engel Class IA outcome (3 patients still have been on antiepileptic drugs) without recurrence of tumor. Second operation was performed in one patient with temporal lobe involvement. Postoperative morbidity (visual field defect and hemiparesis) was observed in 2 cases who had lesions in the temporal lobe (21.4%). Follow-up MRI could not exclude the possibility of residual tumor in 3 cases, however, no further seizure was reported so far. Six of the 9 patients showed normal postoperative EEG. Conclusions: DNT most frequently involved the temporal lobe and was often associated with CD. Gross total removal is thought to ensure favorable prognosis in most cases regardless of type of surgery. However, careful resection is necessary to reduce morbidity especially in case of temporal lobe involvement. 1 Nicoletta Longoni, 1 Warren W. Boling, 3 Adriana Palade, 4 Angel Wabulya, 2 Frederick Andermann, 1 Priscah Mujuru, 4 Warf Benjamin, 6 Donald Gross, 5 Richard Bittar, 7 Gavin Fabinyi, and 8 Richard Byrne ( 1 Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 2 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montrea, QC, Canada ; 3 Neurology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 4 Community Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ; 5 CURE Childrens Hospital of Uganda, Mbale, Uganda ; 6 Neurosurgery, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; 7 Neurology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ; 8 Neurosurgery, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 9 Neurosurgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Since May 2005 an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) has been in place at the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda (CHU) in Mbale, Uganda, East Africa. Children are pre screened in regionalized clinics prior to evaluation at CHU comprehensive epilepsy program, the first such program in East Africa. The program is dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Prescreening relies on identifying the stereotypical signs and symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Treatment candidates must have intractable epilepsy, seizure frequency over 1 per month, and a history of two of the following: - febrile convulsions - typical aura - typical semiology of stare and/or automatisms Patients less than 6 years of age or multiple extra-temporal intracranial lesions were excluded. EEG and CTimaging are done at CHU. The data are transferred for analysis to WVU. Epilepsy surgery is performed at CHU. Results: 30 patients have been evaluated at CHU. Seizure frequency ranged between 30/day to 2/month with a mean of 2.2 seizures/day. 25 patients presented an aura. Essentially all patients had a history of malaria. 27 had febrile convulsions. To date, 19 patients have completed an evaluation in the comprehensive program. EEG recording has shown: Left temporal (5), right temporal (2), frontal (2), bitemporal (2), multifocal (3), generalized (4), and non-epileptic (1). CT showed scar in 4 cases. Four patients had convincing temporal lobe epilepsy and underwent surgery at CHU. Conclusions: Epilepsy prevalence has been estimated to be 20 per 1000 in one region of Eastern Africa, 10 times the prevalence in developed countries making intractable epilepsy a significant public health problem in the region. Malaria was essentially universal in the population screened and we suspect cerebral malaria as an important cause of intractable epilepsy. One case of ?non-epileptic spell? was identified (5% in the population studied). (Supported by USAID, American Schools and Hospitals Abroad.) 1 Angel W. Hernandez, 1 Saleem I. Malik, and 1 David Donahue ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX ) Rationale: Patients undergoing brain surgeries are at risk of developing bacterial infections post-operatively, but herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation is a rare complication. Few reports are available on patients that develop reactivation herpes virus encephalitis following epilepsy surgery. We report a case of HSV reactivation post epilepsy surgery to raise awareness of this risk and to consider treatment pre and post surgery on patient with a history of prior HSV infection. Methods: We report one case of reactivation of herpes simplex virus after epilepsy surgery on a 12 year old with pharmaco-resistant localization-related epilepsy of left temporo-parietal onset. This patient had a history of negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV as an infant. Four days after resection of the epileptogenic focus the patient developed acute repetitive seizures, meningeal signs, confusion, lethargy and high fever. PCR in the CSF was positive for HSV. Results: The patient's seizures stopped 48 hours after starting treatment with Acyclovir. The confusion and lethargy resolved 48?72 hours after initiating treatment. There were no sequelae to the infection. The patient is now 1.5 years seizure free and off anti-convulsants. Conclusions: Though early recognition and treatment of HSV encephalitis is essential, we believe that prophylactic treatment with acyclovir pre and post brain surgery is warranted in patients with prior HSV exposure to decrease the chances of this complication. 1 Manuel Marrufo, 1 Yong D. Park, 1 Ki Hyeong Lee, 2 Mark R. Lee, 2 Joseph R. Smith, and 2 Scott Y. Rahimi ( 1 Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ) Rationale: Corpus callosotomy is a treatment option for epilepsy patients who are not resective surgery candidate. EEG as predictor or outcome for corpus callosotomy cases has been studied exclusively among adult population. Methods: Patient selection: A retrospective anlysis included all patients under 18 yrs who underwent corpus callosotomy from July 02 to April 06. Data collection: The demographic data, seizure characteristics and seizure outcome was obtained from the medical records, as well as direct phone interviews at least 6 month following the surgery. The EEG findings were reviewed by two authors (YDP and MM) blinded to the outcome. Seizure and EEG patterns classification: Seizure type was classified and recorded in to two main categories: Category A for drop attacks and tonic seizures; Category B for GTCS, atypical absence, adverse postures, CPS and myoclonus. Ictal EEG was classified into two different patterns: Type A for generalized desynchronization, spike and wave, and diffuse beta activity; and Type B for focal onset confined to one hemisphere or with secondary generalization. Outcome evaluation: Two seizure outcomes were defined by the reduction of seizure: Class I ≥ 90% reduction, and Class II < 90% or less. Statistical Methods: Chi-Square test run with SPSS 13 package. Results: There were a total of 35 patients followed for 11mo (6?12mo). The average age at surgery and the average age of seizure onset were 7.4 years (range 1 ? 17 yrs) and 2.36 yrs (range 0?10 yrs) respectively. Sex ratio was 20:15 (M:F). In terms of seizure characteristic, 24 out of 35 (68%) patients belonged to category A while 11/35 (32%) to category B. When correlated with outcome of surgery, patients with Category A seizures showed a tendency to do better than Category B (Category A 85% (12/14) vs. Category B 15% (2/14), p-value 0.077). Ictal EEG pattern did not predict the outcome: Type A 47.6% (10/21) vs Type B 30.8% (4/13), p-value 0.272. Other demographic or pathology characteristics were not different between the two outcome groups. Conclusions: Our data suggest that ictal EEG pattern does not predict outcome following corpus callosotomy among the pediatric population unlike the published data on adult. However, consistent with previous reports, ?drop? seizures tended to respond better to this surgical procedure than other seizure types in our population. Careful selection of candidate regarding seizure types, not necessarily ictal EEG patterns, are recommended for corpus callosotomy. 1 Bruno Maton, 1 Prasanna Jayakar, 1 Trevor Resnick, 1 Glenn Morrison, 1 John Ragheb, 1 Catalina Dunoyer, 1 Pat Dean, and 1 Michael Duchowny ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that begins in early life is often a catastrophic disorder with pharmaco-resistant seizures and secondary neurological deterioration. Few data are available regarding epilepsy surgery performed during infancy and early childhood and no prior study has focused on TLE. Methods: We analyzed the results of temporal resection, performed for epilepsy as the primary indication, between 1979 and 2003, in children less than age 5 years at time of surgery who had at least 2 years of follow-up. Results: 20 children (14 males) were identified with a mean age at surgery of 26 months and a mean age at seizure onset of 12 months. Clinical presentation was age-dependent. Typical psychomotor seizures (n = 4; mean age at surgery 37 months) may be followed by prominent motor changes (n = 7; 30 months) that can be isolated (n = 3; 23 months). Epileptic spasms were noted in 6 patients and were frequently associated with partial seizures. The interictal EEG was lateralizing in 15 patients and ictal EEG was lateralizing in 18 patients. Brain MRI had good predictive value in 16 patients; ictal SPECT was concordant in 4/8 patients. Invasive EEG was employed in 6 cases. At mean follow-up of 5.5 years, 65% of the children were seizure-free and 15% had > 90% seizure reduction. Morbidity included infection and hydrocephalus in one case and stroke-related hemiparesis in two cases. Cortical dysplasia was identified in 8 children, tumors in 8 including 2 DNET, 2 ganglioglioma, and 4 malignant tumors. Hippocampal sclerosis was present in 4 cases as dual pathology. Conclusions: Surgery for TLE can be performed during early life with similar results as in older children and in adults. 2 Ann-Christine Duhaime, 3 Barbara C. Jobst, and 1 Richard P. Morse ( 1 Pediatrics and Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Pediatric Neurosurgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ; and 3 Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) seizures are relatively common in children but there are small numbers reported in terms of surgical approach and outcome. Despite the fact that SMA epilepsy typically begins in childhood and is often refractory to AED treatment, surgical approaches to its management most often are delayed until adulthood. We report on the clinical features, evaluative test results (SPECT, invasive EEG) and surgical outcome in a series of 5 non-lesional children and adolescents, 3 of whom have had resective epilepsy surgery. Methods: Five children were characterized by means of seizure description, V-EEG, SISCOM, fMRI, and invasive intracranial recording with brain mapping, and seizures were localized to the SMA. Results: Three of the five patients have had resective surgery, with mixed outcomes. None were initially seizure-free: one has had a few seizures due to non-compliance but otherwise has gone months at a time without seizures, one required a second resection in the primary motor cortex and is now seizure-free, and one has had a >50% reduction in seizures. Of the non-operated patients, one declined surgery and one has been moderately well-controlled with AED therapy. All patients were non-lesional on MRI imaging; pathology showed cortical dysplasia in one and non-specific changes in the other two patients. The patient who required a second operation has a mild L hemiparesis, but had no deficits after the initial resection limited to the SMA, and the other two patients have no neurologic deficits. Conclusions: SMA seizures are not uncommon in children, with characteristic clinical features and seizure semiology like those described in adults. The seizures can be approached surgically with acceptable results and without deficits. Identification and characterization of SMA in children may allow for earlier successful surgical intervention, especially in cases involving focal cortical dysplasia as the underlying cause of the epilepsy. Use of adjunctive methods to localize, including SISCOM and invasive monitoring with stimulation and mapping, is essential for non-lesional cases. A common confounder appears to be the rapid propagation to the SMA from adjacent cortical areas (primary motor) or simultaneous onset, making surgery more challenging. 1 Joo Hee Seo, 2 Su Jeong You, 2 Hoon Chul Kang, 1 Heung Dong Kim, 3 Tae-Sung Ko, 4 Yong Soon Hwang, 5 Dong Suk Kim, 6 Jung-Kyo Lee, and 4 Sang Keun Park ( 1 Department of Pediatrics, Severance Hospital, Handicapped Children's Research Institute, Brain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; 2 Department of Pediatrics, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sang-gye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ; 3 Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; 4 Department of Neurosurgery, Epilepsy Center, Inje University College of Medicine, Sang-gye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea ; 5 Department of Neurosurgery, Severance Hospital, Handicapped Children's Research Institute, Brain Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea ; and 6 Department of Neurosurgery, Ulsan University College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: We sought to evaluate the long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in refractory pediatric epilepsy. Methods: Twenty eight patients could be followed over 12 months in three tertiary care referral epilepsy centers. Data including seizure frequencies, quality of life measures and adverse events had been prospectively filed up through 5 years. Results: VNS resulted in a >50% reduction in seizure frequency in 53.6% (15/28) of children with 28.6% (8/28) patients achieving a >90% reduction. When compared a seizure reduction rate according to seizure types (generalized vs paritial seizure), etiologies (symptomatic vs cryptogenic), and seizure duration before VNS implantation, we could not find any significant difference of it. However, a seizure reduction rate had a tendency to be in inverse proportion to seizure duration. In addition, of 11 patients who had partial seizure disorders, 7 patients (63.6%) obtained a reduction of seizure frequency with >50% and then again, of 17 patients who had generalized seizure disorders, 8 patients (47.1%) did. Quality of life was also measured to be enhanced as follows, memory in 50.0% (8/16) patients, mood in 62.5% (10/16) patients, behavior in 68.8% (11/16) patients, alertness in 68.8% (11/16) patients, achievement in 37.5% (6/16) and verbal skill in 43.8% (7/16) patients. Adverse events included hoarseness in 7 patients, dyspnea at sleep in 2 patients, wound infection in 1 patient but were transient and successfully managed by careful follow-up and an adjustment of parameters. Conclusions: Our data show that VNS roles as one of alternative therapy for refractory pediatric epilepsy without any significant adverse events. 1 Nicolas Specchio, 1 Lucia Fusco, 1 Giuseppe Gobbi, 1 Federico Vigevano, and 1 Tiziana Granata ( 1 Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Rome, Italy; Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Rome, Italy; Division of Neuropediatrics, Ospedale Maggiore Cà Pizzardi, Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Division of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Roma, Roma, Italy; and Division of Child Neurology, Istituto Nazionale Neurologico C. Besta, Milano, Milano, Italy ) Rationale: Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is an acquired neurological disease characterized by intractable partial seizures and symptoms of progressive dysfunction of one cerebral hemisphere. Laboratory findings suggested the possibility of a immune-mediate component in the pathogenesis of the disease implying. However, surgical treatment still remains the preferred treatment. We report our experience on the surgical treatment of 10 RE patients collected in the context of an Italian collaborative study. Methods: The series included 10 patients with RE followed in the centers of Bambino Gesù Children's Hopsital (Roma), Neurological Institute ?C. Besta? (Milano) and Ospedale Maggiore (Bologna). Pre- and post-operative evaluations included: EEG recordings with video monitoring, MRI, assessment of motor function and cognitive evaluation based on clinical observation and standardized tests. The surgical procedures was based on functional disconnection of the affected hemisphere (hemispherotomy), performed according to vertex or peri-insular approach. Results: The series includes 10 patients (6 M,4 F), aged between 10 and 23 years (16.3 ± 3.4) observed between 1993 and 2000. The age at onset ranged between 3 and 11 years (6.5 ± 2.8); surgery was performed 8 months to 9 years from disease onset (4.1 ± 2.7). Post-surgical follow-up ranged between 5 and 10 years (6.9 ± 1.5). The disease onset was marked by partial seizures, epilepsia partialis continua and unilateral limb paresis followed by status epilepticus. Neurologic deficits appeared in all patients within 24 months. EEG recordings consistently showed slow and epileptic abnormalities over the affected hemisphere. At the time of surgery patients were treated with three or more AED. All, but one, patients became seizure-free after surgery, AE treatment has been stopped in 7 patients, and reduced in 3. Patients still treated are given a mean of 1.5 ± 1 drugs. The need for neurological evaluations and EEG monitoring reduced from monthly to yearly. Conclusions: After surgery seizures ceased in all patients, thus demonstrating the successfulness of the operative procedures. It is noteworthy that postural control improved in all patients and regained unassisted gait. Mental abilities, as evaluated by standardized scales, improved in all cases. None of them performed anymore habitual monthly EEG and neurological evaluations. Surgical treatment of RE appeared in our series as a gold standard because of its effectiveness in seizure control, dramatic improvement in cognitive evaluations and reduction in the general healthcare assistance. 1 Marino M. Bianchin, 1 Vera C. Terra-Bustamante, 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 2 Neife H. Deghaide, 1 Hélio R. Machado, 2 Eduardo A. Donadi, and 1 Américo C.

The disease has been attributed to possible viral infections or autoimmune mechanisms. HLA is the landmark of autoimmune disorders and specific alleles have been associated with different neurological diseases. Here we report the results of HLA Class-Ia study in Brazilian RE patients. Methods: After approval by the Ethic Committee of our institution and after informed consent was obtained from the patients, DNA samples were obtained from 13 Brazilian patients with pathologically confirmed RE. For the study of allele prevalence, data were compared with those for ethnically matched control population. The Fischer test was used to determine possible differences. The level of significance was established at p < 0.05. Results: No specific HLA Class-Ia was found to be strongly associated with RE in our patients.

Additionally, HLA Class-Ia molecules might have other roles in the CNS in terms of neuroplasticity and neuroprotection, or might be involved in normal brain development. In fact, HLA Class-Ia molecules have been associated with some neurological disorders like schizophrenia, autism, or dyslexia. RE is an autoimmune disorder observed mostly during the years of brain development and associated with neuroplastic alterations that leads to an intriguing form of epilepsia partialis continua. However, in spite of multiple potential roles for HLA molecules in RE, in this group of patients no specific HLA Class-Ia was found to be strongly associated with RE. We conclude that none of the specific HLA Class-Ia alleles studied here is particularly involved in RE. However, larger samples involving multicentric studies are necessary to confirm our findings.

Schwabe, 3 Wade Mueller, 3 Sean Lew, 1 Kathy Eggener, and 1 Maria Chico ( 1 Department of Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ; 2 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Erasmus Medical College, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands ; and 3 Department of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI ) Rationale: To study seizure outcome and determine the correlation between seizure outcome and quality of life measurements in children after epilepsy surgery. Methods: A consecutive, retrospective analysis of seizure outcome and quality of life assessment was conducted in 83 pediatric patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for medically refractory epilepsy at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between 2002?2005. Data was collected via a chart review and examination of post-operative patients. Data collection included seizure outcome measurements as described in the Engel classification system. Quality of life assessment was performed by sending quality of life questionnaires to caregivers of our patients (QOLCE and QOLIE-AD-48). Results: The seizure outcomes for all surgery types were Class I-68.7%; Class II-12%; Class III-19.3%. If corpus callosotomies were excluded, Class I outcome was 72%. Seizure free outcome was highest in temporal lobectomies (84.2%) followed by hemispherectomies (76.2%), focal resections (61.2%), and finally corpus callosotomies (25%). Temporal lobectomies were more common among older patients. Seizure free outcome was 50% in infants; 67.9% in young children, and 78.4% in adolescents. Cortical dysplasia was predictive of a less favorable seizure free outcome. 62.7% of the QOLCE surveys and 45.8% of the QOLIE-AD-48 surveys were returned. The quality of life measures for the surveys paralleled seizure outcome. The measures of physical activity, cognition, social activity, general health, and overall quality of life were significantly better in children with a seizure free outcome than children who were not seizure free. Conclusions: Epilepsy surgery in medically refractory epilepsy in children significantly improves quality of life as well as seizure control. 1 Warren W. Boling ( 1 Neurosurgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV ) Rationale: The author describes a novel keyhole approach to selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH). The surgical technique has proven to be successful in the treatment of medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Image guidance is required in the keyhole approach to orient the cranial opening, verify cortical landmarks for positioning the corticectomy, and assess the extent of hippocampal disconnection. The restricted surgical exposure has not limited the ability to perform SAH with favorable results on reducing the seizure tendency. Methods: All patients with one year or more follow-up after keyhole SAH at West Virginia University (WVU) were included in this report. Forty-eight surgeries for temporal lobe epilepsy have been performed since 2002 by the author with over one year follow-up. Ten had keyhole SAH performed and are the subjects reported here in. Results of surgery in keyhole SAH subjects were contrasted with individuals undergoing SAH at WVU using standard craniotomy approach. All individuals since 2002 who underwent standard SAH surgery by the author for epilepsy and with over 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included in the evaluation. Results: Ten subjects had keyhole approach for SAH performed. Seven (70%) had an excellent outcome from surgery becoming seizure free (Class I). One subject had over 90% seizure frequency reduction (Class III), and 2 had less than 90% reduction in seizure frequency (Class IV). Three subjects had no stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) performed prior to keyhole SAH (all seizure free), and the remainder had SEEG performed for further confirmation of MTLE. There were no surgical complications encountered. Twenty-One surgeries were performed for SAH using a standard craniotomy approach. 81% were seizure free after surgery. Excellent outcomes compared favorably between keyhole and non-keyhole approaches (p = 0.54). Hospital stay after surgery was determined for the subjects who underwent keyhole SAH at WVU and an age matched control of patients who had SAH performed via a non-keyhole (pterional craniotomy) approach at WVU. In keyhole SAH subjects the mean length of hospital stay was 3 days (range 2 ? 4 days). Non-keyhole SAH patients stayed in the hospital a mean of 4 days (range 2 ? 6 days) after surgery representing a trend to shorter hospital stays after keyhole SAH (p = 0.11). Conclusions: The keyhole approach to SAH is a strictly image guided procedure. The corticectomy is positioned at the upper bank of T2 anterior to the precentral suclus in the dominant hemisphere and in front of the central sulcus in the non-dominant hemisphere. These cortical landmarks can only be confirmed with image guidance. The results of surgery on the seizure tendency depend on an accurate diagnosis of MTLE, and compare favorably with non-keyhole SAH and corticoamygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy. The keyhole SAH is an effective approach in patients undergoing surgery for MTLE. 1 Richard C. Burgess ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: The Cleveland Clinic has a 25 year history as a tertiary referral center for patients with epilepsy. Rigorously kept records of seizure/epilepsy classification and neurophysiologic results are saved electronically. With the advent of a hospital-wide electronic medical record, picture archiving and communication system, digtal video recordings, and other scattered electronic repositories, data about our patients is entered electronically in many areas, but is not available in an integrated fashion when needed to generate reports to referring doctors or to carry out sophisticated research queries. We sought to put all of this information at the neurologist's fingertips for clinical and research purposes, by developing a system that provides access via standard web browser. Methods: The database contains both text and graphics. Data is imported from other servers, as well as maintained by pointers. For access we employed the Faces framework deployed on a J2EE application server. Because of its deployment in a very busy clinical center, careful attention was paid to real-time performance issues, e.g. by employing asynchronous Javascript and XML to handle page display simultaneous with data retrieval. In addition to the carefully classified neurophysiologic and epilepsy information, a range of graphical and tabular information has been organized for incorporation into the database. This includes pictorial information, formerly available ad hoc from a variety of sources, such as: grid placement maps, depth placement maps, stimulation maps, ictal and nterictal discharge maps, MRI  and 2 Functional Neurosurgery Department, Neurologic Hospital, Lyon, Rhône, France ) Rationale: Intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy assessment are done in our unit using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes. Five years ago, we explored use of these electrodes to produce RFTC lesions inside the epileptogenic area. We report the results in 42 patients. Methods: 42 consecutive patients explored by video-SEEG recordings were enrolled in this study between June 2001 and February 2006. RFTCs were produced by inducing a Joule effect between electrode contacts where discharge onsets had been recorded. Four to 31 lesions (mean, 12.5) were performed per patient. The epileptic focus (EF) was located in the frontal (8 patients), occipital (7), insular (4), parietal (3) and temporal (20) lobe. Several etiologies were found: cortical dysplasia (CD) (21), hippocampal sclerosis (4), periventricular heteropia (PH) (3), posttraumatic focal atrophy (1) and cryptogenic epilepsy (13). The results were evaluated on the decrease in the number of seizures: good outcome (GO, >70%) and using a self-administered questionnaire, each patient estimated the presence (a) or absence (b) of improvement in their quality of life (QL). Results: The GO rate 1 month after the intervention (57%) decreased to 35% at the 6-month evaluation and then stabilized. The QL evaluation showed comparable mean results (a = 38%) but rose to 66% on the subgroup of patients who were inoperable after SEEG exploration. The GO rate was positively correlated with: 1) anterior location of the EF: 75, 37 and 33% of GO for insular, frontal and temporal lobe epilepsy, respectively, with no change for parietal and occipital epilepsy. 2) the etiology, with the best results for symptomatic epilepsy (37 and 33% GO in CD and PH, respectively) vs 23% GO in cryptogenic forms. No general or neurological complication occurred during the procedures other than two transient deficits (paresthetic sensations in the mouth and mild apraxia of the hand). 20 unsatisfied patients had a secondary classical intervention (19 now in Engel class 1 and 1 in class 2) Conclusions: This study reports the results at 5 years of RFTC treatment given to 42 epileptic patients during SEEG exploration. This procedure is: 1) sure: complications are rare, minor and always reversible despite treatment often targeting high-value functional cortical and/or inaccessible areas 2) effective: benefit in terms of seizure control concerns 1/3+ patients with GO maintained long term from the 6th month after treatment 3) offers improvement in quality of life, especially for the 2/3 of patients considered inoperable after invasive exploration 4) no surgical burden on prognosis: 19/20 patients operated after RFTC failure are in Engel class 1 These results changed our SEEG exploration strategy by combining diagnosis and therapeutic potential until now unknown with this technique.

Benabid ( 1 Neurosurgery Department, CHU Michallon, Grenoble, France ; and 2 Neurology Department, CHU Michallon, Grenoble, France ) Rationale: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medically intractable partial epilepsy in adults, and surgery (anterior temporal lobectomy or a selective amygdalo hippocampectomy) is effective in the majority of patients. We have developed since 1998 a new surgical technic to treat non lesional TLE which consists in disconnecting the whole temporal lobe from the insula and surrounding structures. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and results of temporal surgical disconnection of patients suffering from non lesional TLE. Methods: Since 1998, 62 patients suffering from TLE, or extra TLE have been treated by surgical disconnection of the epileptogenic zone. Among this group, 45 patients (mean age: 35 y ± 10) suffered from TLE and underwent temporal disconnection (left and right disconnection in 20 and 25 patients respectively). There was 16 males and 29 females, 12 were left handed and 33 were right handed. All patients underwent a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation with MRI, chronic video-EEG recording and neuropsychological assessment. 16 patients (35%) underwent pre-surgical evaluation with depth electrodes (SEEG). All patients underwent a post operative MRI, neuropsychological testing, repeated scalp EEG and visual field examination. Temporal disconnection was performed under neuronavigation and consisted in disconnecting the lateral temporal neocortex, the whole hippocampus, para-hippocampus and the amygdala. Veins and arteries were spared in order to avoid post-operative temporal lobe ischemia and subsequent temporal lobe swelling. Results: At two years follow-up, 84.4% of patients were Engel's I (58% were Ia). Four patients were class II and 3 class IV. Post-operative clinical morbidity was as follow: persistent mild hemiparesia (n = 1) or mild facial paresia (n = 1), definitive quadranopsia (n = 23), hemianopsia (n = 1). In dominant temporal lobe, verbal memory was worsened in 69%. Radiological post-operative morbidity was as follow: 2 thalamic or pallidal limited ischemia without clinical consequences, 2 temporal horn cystic dilatation (one requested reintervention without clinical consequences). At 6 months and one year follow up, scalp EEG showed temporal spikes respectively in 27% and 19% of non cured patients compared to 8.5% and 6%of patients seizure free. Conclusions: Temporal disconnection was effective in 85% of patients (Engel's Class I). Post ?operative mild contro-lateral motor deficit was found in about 4%, quadranopsia in 51% and verbal memory deficit in dominant hemisphere in about 69%. Presence of spikes in post-operative scalp EEG was less frequent in patients seizure free. Comparative studies are required to evaluate temporal disconnection as an alternative to lobectomy in non lesional TLE. 1 Anita Datta, 1 Matt B. Wheatley, 1 Tom Snyder, 1 S.N. Ahmed, 1 Donald Gross, and 1 David B. Sinclair ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ) Rationale: The objective of the study was to review our experience and compare the results of the selective amygdalohippocampectomy in children versus adults with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: A retrospective case series was used in the setting of a tertiary care hospital which provides care to both children and adults. All patients underwent a selective amygdalohippocampectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon and had at least one year of follow up. Patient charts were reviewed for pertinent clinical information and the data was compared between children and adults. Outcome measures included seizure frequency, neuropsychological assessment, EEG, neuro-imaging and anti-epileptic drugs pre and post-operatively. Results: Twenty three patients, 9 children and 14 adults were studied. Age at surgery varied from 6 to 58 years. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years. Surgical outcome was variable between the two groups. Amongst the younger cohort (6?18 years of age), 5 patients had good outcome (Engel Class I or II), two patients had a poor outcome (Engel class III) and two patients had refractory seizures (Engel Class IV) that required returning to the operating room for a standard anterior temporal lobectomy. This differed from the adults, who all had a good outcome. Ten patients were seizure-free (Engel Class I) and the remainder had rare seizures (Engel Class II). Non-MTS pathology was more common in children. Thirteen of 14 (93%) had MTS in the adult population, while only 4 of 9 children (44%) had MTS. The pathology at surgery in this group included mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), brain tumors, focal encephalitis and normal pathology. Conclusions: Selective amygdalohippocampectomy can lead to favorable seizure and neuropsychological outcome in adults with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. However, preliminary results show less favorable results in children. The difference is probably related to the different pathology between the two groups. Adults most commonly have MTS, whereas children more commonly have non-MTS temporal lobe pathology. Clinicians should be aware of this difference when considering surgical management in children with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. 1 Gena R. Ghearing, 1 Drahomira Sencakova, 2 Barbara Schauble, 1 Gregory D. Cascino, 1 Elson L. So, 3 Clifford R. Jack Jr., and 1 Gregory A. Worrell ( 1 Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; 2 Section of EEG and Epileptology, Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Berne, Inselspital, Berne, Switzerland ; and 3 Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Unilateral hippocampal atrophy is associated with an excellent surgical outcome after temporal lobectomy. The management of patients with bitemporal disease is more controversial and many undergo intracranial EEG (iEEG) with bitemporal depth electrodes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of intracranial monitoring for predicting surgical outcomes in patients with both asymmetric and symmetric hippocampal volumes. Methods: Volumetric hippocampal analysis was performed on the MRIs of all consecutive intractable temporal lobe epilepsy patients between the ages of 16 and 45 years who underwent bitemporal depth electrode recording at our institution over a seven year period. Symmetric hippocampal volumes were defined by a difference between the right and left hippocampus between the range ? 0.1 and + 0.3 cm3. The hippocampal volumes were compared to age matched controls, and significant atrophy defined as greater than two standard deviation difference from control. The localization of ictal and interictal discharges on scalp and iEEG were reviewed, and surgical outcome determined for each patient. Results: Of the 27 patients, 14 had asymmetric and 13 had symmetric hippocampal volumes. The surgical outcome was available for 22 patients (four did not have surgery and one was lost to follow up) with an average follow up of 51 months. Ten of 12 surgical patients with asymmetric atrophy (83%) had an Engel class 1 outcome. Nine of these patients with a favorable outcome had significant atrophy on the resected side. The predominant side of seizure onset during iEEG was concordant with the smaller hippocampus in all patients who had significant atrophy. Four out of ten surgical patients with symmetric atrophy (40%) had a favorable outcome. The degree of atrophy did not predict surgical outcome. Two of the patients with a favorable outcome (50%) and three of the patients with an unfavorable outcome (50%) had significant bilateral atrophy. Of the four patients who had a favorable surgical outcome, three had a predominance of seizures arising from the resected side during iEEG, and three of the patients who had unfavorable outcomes also had a predominance of seizures from the resected side. Conclusions: In this limited retrospective study, patients with asymmetric hippocampal atrophy had a high probability (83%) of seizure free outcome. The smaller hippocampus was concordant with the predominant side of iEEG seizure onset in all patients with significant asymmetric atrophy. Conversely, only 40% of patients with symmetric hippocampal atrophy had favorable surgical outcomes, and iEEG did not prove helpful for predicting outcome. 1 Jorge A. Gonzalez, 2 Dileep Nair, and 1 William Bingaman ( 1 Neurological Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 University Heights, OH ) Rationale: Treatment of patients who fail epilepsy surgery is problematic. Selected patients may be candidates for further surgery, potentially leading to a significant decrease in seizures frequency and severity. The purpose of this manuscript is to present our long-term outcome series of highly investigated patients who failed resective epilepsy surgery and subsequently underwent re-operative resective procedures. Additionally, our intention is to identify possible factors associated with unsatisfactory seizure outcome, improving selection criteria for re-operation in failed epilepsy surgery. Methods: We performed a retrospective consecutive analysis of patients who underwent re-operative procedures due to medically intractable epilepsy at our institution from 1990 to 2001. Seventy patients underwent re-operative epilepsy surgery with 57 patients having a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We assessed the relationship between seizure outcome and categorical variables using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and the relationship between outcome and continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For all analyses, statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05. Results: Of the 57 patients, there were 29 males and 28 females. Age of seizure onset ranged from 3 months to 39 years (mean 10.7 ± 10.3 years, median 7 years). The mean age at re-operation was 24.7 ± 12 years (range 4?50 years). Follow-up ranged from 24 to 228 months (mean: 128 months, mode: 132 months). Seizure outcome were classified according to Engel's classification and divided in two groups: Favorable outcome (Engel's classes I and II) and non-favorable outcome (Engel's classes III and IV). Fifty two percent of patients had favorable outcome. Patients with tumors as initial pathology had better outcome in comparison with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Re-operation in selected patients failing epilepsy resective surgery should be considered as approximately 50% of patients may have benefit. Patients with MCD and MTS are less likely to improve after re-operation. 1 Robert E. Gross, 1 Edward K. Sung, 1 David LaBorde, 1 Michele Johnson, and 1 Klaus Mewes ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Frameless image-guidance techniques for implantation of depth electrodes for intracranial monitoring are increasingly used, but few reports have assessed the accuracy and precision of these techniques. Methods: Frameless image-guidance using the Stealth? (Medtronic) neuronavigational hardware and Cranial? software was used exclusively for the implantation of depth electrodes since 1998. Electrodes were implanted through burr holes using an orthogonal (trans-temporal) approach (n = 32 patients), typically into the amygdala and 2 ? 3 electrodes in the hippocampus or parahippocampal gyrus on each side, or occipital approach (n = 3 patients). We analyzed the implantation of all electrodes for which the intra-operative planning trajectories (saved on the pre-operative MRI scan by the Stealth) and post-operative MR imaging were available (n = 155 electrodes: 150 orthogonal, 5 occipital). The pre- and post-operative image sets were registered using the navigational software, and a vector was constructed from the ?intended? target to the ?actual? location of the electrode tip (taking into account imaging artifact around the electrode). Results: The discrepancy between the ?intended? and ?actual? location of the orthogonal electrode tips was 5.6 ± 2.9 mm. There was no significant difference between accuracy of electrodes implanted on the first vs. second side as might be expected from brain shift, nor on the left (n = 80) vs. right (n = 70) side. The direction of error could be characterized as ?too deep? for 93 electrodes as opposed to ?too shallow? for 50 electrodes probably due to difficulty in securing the electrode precisely during placement. Five electrodes implanted via an occipital approach had an error of 7.7 ± 8.0 mm, reflecting lower accuracy and greater variability likely due to the longer passage. No patients implanted via an orthogonal approach required reoperation in contrast to 1 of 3 patients implanted occipitally. No complications definitively related to post-operative MR imaging were detected over the 150 electrodes and 32 patients, although 2 patients recently implanted experienced transient neurologic deficits which in one patient may have been infectious in etiology but in the other was uncertain. Conclusions: Frameless image-guidance implantation of depth electrodes via an orthogonal approach is an effective technique with sufficient accuracy for intracranial monitoring. 1 Marc Guenot, 2 Jean Isnard, 2 Philippe Ryvlin, 2 Helene Catenoix, 2 Francois Mauguiere, and 1 Marc Sindou ( 1 Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Hop. P. Wertheimer, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France ; and 2 Department of Functional Neurology, Hop. P. Wertheimer, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France ) Rationale: Except in case of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Syndrom (MTLE), and despite their more recent refinement, the noninvasive techniques still often fail to clearly localize the epileptogenic zone in a large number of patients presenting with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Different techniques of intracranial recordings are currently available. StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG), which consists in the stereotactic orthogonal implantation of depth electrodes (5 to 15, 11 on average) into the brain, is the only one allowing to record the mesial as well as the lateral aspects of the temporal lobe, including the depth of the sulci. The object of this paper is to display the curent usefulness of SEEG in terms of surgical strategy related to temporal resection, in 100 consecutive procedures. Methods: 100 patients, suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy arising from a temporal onset, underwent a SEEG procedure between 2000 and 2005. For each of these patients, the non invasive investigation, which included clinical and neuropsychological examination, long-term video-EEG recording, functional imaging, and MRI scan, were not in favor of a MTLE syndrom, and were not congruent enough to clearly identify the epileptogenic focus. Consequently, the sites of implantation of the electrodes were chosen in order to precise: either the side of the onset of seizures, or their uni or multilobar feature, or a possible strictly neocortical or insular onset of the seizures, and also, using direct electrode stimulation, the proximity of speech area. Results: Complications occurred in 3 patients (1 superficial infection, and 2 breakages of electrodes). -? SEEG was helpful in most (91%) of the 100 patients to confirm, or cancel, surgical indication, and to adjust the extent of the resection: -? In 33% of cases, SEEG-recordings led to an indication of a strictly extra-limbic lobectomy, i.e. a tailored (temporo-basal or lateral) neocortectomy sparing the temporo-mesial structures. -? In 20% of cases, SEEG led to a limited limbic resection, which included the amygdala, as well as the pole, while sparing most of the (non-atrophic) hippocampus. -? In 25% of cases, SEEG allowed to plan an enlarged temporal resection, despite the fact that it showed a wide, or even multiple, epileptogenic zone. -? In 13% af cases, SEEG allowed to definitly exclude the patients from surgery. -? In 9% of cases, SEEG confirmed the indication of a conventional limbic resection (anterior temporal lobectomy). Conclusions: SEEG proved to be a safe and a very useful method for complex cases candidate for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. It should be considered as soon as the non invasive investigation do not display a clear MTLE syndrome. 1 Hirochika Imoto, 1 Masami Fujii, 2 Jouji Uchiyama, 1 Nobuhiro Tanaka, 3 Kimihiko Nakano, 1 Sadahiro Nomura, 1 Hirosuke Fujisawa, 2 Takashi Saito, and 1 Michiyasu Suzuki ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Minamikogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ; 2 Applied Medical Engineering Science, Graduate School of Medicine Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ; and 3 Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan ) Rationale: Local brain cooling using an implantable cooling system is an attractive prophylactic technique for seizures since it has a potential to be an alternative to a surgical resection of the epileptogenic foci. In this report, we applied the newly devised local brain cooling system to intractable epilepsy in humans. Methods: We utilized a Peltier chip as the cooling device and therefore applied this cooling device to two patients with medically intractable epilepsy. During surgery, cooling was performed for two minutes in the human cortex where the epileptiform discharges (EDs) were recorded and therefore it had to be resected. Electrocorticograms and the temperature just beneath the cooling site were recorded before and during cooling. Changes of EDs between before and during cooling were quantitatively analyzed. Results: The first case was a 12-year-old girl with temporal lobe epilepsy, while the second case was a 2-year-old boy with parietal lobe epilepsy caused by tuberous sclerosis. In both cases, EDs diminished during the cooling process when the temperature of the brain surface reached less than 25°C. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of the cooling device using a Peltier chip for the treatment of human epilepsy. Owing to recent advances in the precision machinery industry, an implantable local cooling system in humans is therefore expected to become a reality in the near future. 1 Floor E. Jansen, 1 Alexander C. Van Huffelen, 1 Ale Algra, and 1 Onno Van Nieuwenhuizen ( 1 Neurology, Pediatric Neurology, Clinical Neurophysiology and Clinical Epidemiology Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands ) Rationale: Cortical tubers are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability in the majority of patients with tuberous sclerosis. Seizures are often drug resistant. Uncertainties exist concerning the selection of patients suitable for epilepsy surgery. We performed a systematic review of the available literature to assess the overall outcome of epilepsy surgery and to identify factors related to good seizure outcome. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of Medline, Embase, and bibliographies of reviews and book chapters published from 1960 until May 2006 was performed. Studies were included if they at least reported quantitative seizure outcome, and a description of the type of surgery. Seizure outcome was analysed both as seizure freedom and good seizure outcome (seizure reduction of >90%) versus poor seizure outcome. Results: Twentyfive studies, including 177 patients, were found to be eligible. Seizure freedom was achieved in 101 patients (57%). Seizure frequency was reduced by > 90% in another 32 patients (18%). Moderate or severe intellectual disability (IQ < 70) (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2?2.8), the presence of tonic seizures (RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2?2.4) multifocal abnormality on SPECT examination (RR 7.0; 95% CI 1.1?43) and corpus callosotomy (corpus callosotomy versus resective surgery RR 2.5; 95% CI 2.1?3.0) predicted an unfavourable outcome. Conclusions: A good outcome of surgery (seizures reduction of > 90% or complete cure) was achieved in 75% of patients. Resective epilepsy surgery should be considered in all drug resistant TSC patient, as a relation between multiple seizure types with early onset, multiple cortical tubers and multifocal or generalized epileptogenicity and a poor outcome is not supported.

Smith ( 1 Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Following an antero-temporal lobectomy, one third to one half of patients who become free of any disabling seizures continue experiencing auras. The cause of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), duration of the seizure disorder and the presence of generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures have been identified as predictors of post-surgical outcome folloiwng a temporal lobectomy. A comorbid psychiatric history has also been associated with a worse post-surgical seizure outcome in these patients. Predictors of persistence of post-surgical auras in patients free of disabling seizures are yet to be identified. Methods: 97 consecutive patients, 58 men and 39 women with a mean age of 30.6 ± 10.7 years who underwent an antero-temporal lobectomy at the Rush Epilepsy Center were included in the study. The cause of TLE was: mesial temporal sclerosis in 60 (62%), lesional TLE in 18 (18.5%) and idiopathic TLE in 19 (19.5%). The mean duration of the seizure disorder was 19.7 ± 8.8 years. All patients had undergone a psychiatric evaluation as part of their presurgical evaluation (not out of suspicion of psychiatric disorder). All patients had to have a minimal post-surgical follow-up period of 2 years before being included in the study (mean post-surgical follow-up: 6.9 ± 3.0 years). The folloiwng variables were entered into a logistic regression model to identify the predictors of achieving a seizure-free state without auras: cause of TLE, duration of seizure disorder, occurrence of GTC seizures and life-time history of depression. Results: Among the 97 patients, 37 (38%) were free of any disabling seizures and auras since the time of surgery (Class IA of Engel). An additional 43 patients (44.3%) were free of disabling seizures but had auras (Class I-B). A life time prevalence of depression of 48.5% (n = 47) was identified among the 97 patients. The absence of a life-time history of depression was the only variable that predicted the achievemnet of a seizure-free outcome without auras (p < 0.0001). This model correctly classified 76% the data. A lifetime history of depression continued to be a predictor, but to a lesser degree when the post-surgical outcomes consisted of freedom of disabling seizures with or without auras (p = 0.001) and freedom of disabling seizures in the last two years (p = 0.06). On the other hand the cause of TLE became a predictor in the setting of these two outcomes (p = 0.04 and p = 0.009, respectively). Conclusions: A presurgical history of depression appears to predict the peristence of auras after an antero-temporal lobectomy in patients that become free of diabling seizures. The pathogenic mechanisms that mediate thsi phenomenon are yet to be identified. 1 Keith W. MacDougall, 1 Jorge G. Burneo, 1 Richard S. McLachlan, 1 Andrew G. Parrent, and 1 David A. Steven ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada ) Rationale: In many patients being considered for epilepsy surgery, a standard pre-surgical evaluation consisting of a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional neuro-imaging and a neuropsychological assessment is sufficient to identify the epileptogenic zone. When this evaluation cannot identify the epileptogenic focus, invasive intracranial electrodes are often required. Although there is considerable data about the outcome of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, most of these investigations examine all patients (with and without invasive recordings) together. This purpose of this study was to specifically examine patients who underwent invasive EEG and to determine how many of these patients eventually underwent resective surgery. In those who had surgery, we wished to examine the eventual outcome. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts for all patients admitted to the London health Sciences Centre Epilepsy Monitoring Unit between January 2000 and July 2004 for intracranial electrode monitoring. Surgical outcomes were reported using the Engel classification. We used a multivariate analysis to determine which factors if any were associated with successful surgery. Results: There were 103 subdural electrode implantations performed by our two epilepsy surgeons in 100 patients. Of these, 78 patients went on to have resective surgery. Temporal lobectomy was performed in 39 (50%) patients. One-year follow-up was available on 66 of the 78 patients (85%). Thirty patients (45%) realized an Engel I outcome at 1 year. An additional 20 (30%) had their seizure frequency significantly reduced. Predictors of an Engel I outcome included younger age (p < 0.0001) and having a temporal lobectomy (adjusted OR = 4.17; CI = 1.12 ? 12.8). Factors that did not significantly affect outcome included the duration, area, and location of electrode coverage, the presence of a pre-operative lesion or the final pathology. Conclusions: Excellent results from eventual resective surgery can be achieved in the subset of patients needing invasive recordings. Younger patients with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to have the highest likelihood of seizure freedom. The need for bilateral or multilobar electrodes did not negatively affect prognosis. 1 Taketoshi Maehara, 1 Tadash Nariai, 1 Toshiya Momose, 1 Chihiro Hosoda, 2 Kenji Ishii, 2 Kiich Ishiwata, and 1 Kikuo Ohno ( 1 Neurosurgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental Universuty, Tokyo, Japan ; and 2 Positron Medical Cente, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan ) Rationale: With the advent of intraoperative navigation systems, structural lesions disclosed by MRI can now be removed more easily and accurately. But in cases receiving epilepsy surgery, the seizures can only be stopped by removing the surrounding epileptogenic areas together with the lesions themselves. To accomplish this, we need to functionally detect peri-lesional epileptogenic areas during surgery. Our group recently introduced a method of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and C11-flumazenil (FMZ) PET co-registration as a reference for the detection of epileptogenic areas during image-guided epilepsy surgery for patients with organic lesions. In this study we investigated the clinical role of multimodal navigation epilepsy surgery using FDG-PET and FMZ-PET. Methods: We studied a series of 10 patients who suffered from intractable epilepsy and were found to have organic lesions on MRI. All of the subjects underwent FDG-PET and FMZ-PET studies before their operations. Surgical specimens demonstrated cavernous angiomas in 2 patients and benign tumors in 8 (3 low-grade astrocytomas, 2 DNTs, 2 gangliogliomas, and 1 monomorphous angiocentric glioma). The lesions were located in the mesial temporal lobe (mT) in 6 patients and in the extra-mesial-temporal lobe (extra-mT) in 4. Our first steps were to examine the relationships between the organic lesions and hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET, and then to compare the FDG-hypometabolic areas and low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET. Next, we performed intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) in and around the hypometabolic areas to examine the epileptogenicity of the hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET and the low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET. Results: 1) The hypometabolic areas on FDG-PET were much wider than the low-uptake areas on FMZ-PET in 8 cases, and slightly wider in 3 cases. 2) Spikes on intraoperative ECoGs were recorded in the hypometabolic areas in all 6 of the mT cases. 3) The hypometabolic areas were much wider than the ECoG-spiking areas in 2 of the 4 extra-mT patients, and slightly wider in the other 2. ECoG-spiking areas were wider than the low-uptake areas on FMZ. 4) Four of the 6 mT patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy and the other 2 underwent lesionectomy along with anterior temporal resection. The extra-mT patients underwent lesionectomy along with resection of any ECoG-spiking areas which exhibited hypometabolism on FDG-PET and low-uptake on FMZ-PET. 5) All 10 patients became seizure-free during follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 24 months. Conclusions: The use of multi-modal navigation surgery by FDG-PET and FMZ-PET in combination with intraoperative ECoG may become an important method for focus resection in epileptic patients with organic lesions, especially in patients with extra-mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. 1 Michiharu Morino, 1 Yumiko Urano, 1 Masaki Yoshimura, and 1 Kenji Ohata ( 1 Neurosurgery, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan ) Rationale: Although selective amygdalohippocampectomy was developed in epilepsy surgery to spare unaffected brain tissue minimizing the cognitive consequences of temporal lobe surgery, several previous studies have shown that it was equivocal whether selective amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable epilepsy could lead to a better memory outcome or not. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of selective surgery to short-term memory outcome in patients of intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampampectomy (TSA). Methods: The 51 patients received comprehensive neuropsychological testing of verbal and nonverbal memory, attension, and delayed recall before and 1 months after unilateral TSA. Results: Significant improvements in verbal memory and delayed recall were found particularly for the right resected group. For right TSA, the outcome of verbal memory was not related to hippocampal pathology, however, the risk for a nonverbal memory decline was increased when patients had non hippocampal sclerosis. After left TSA, there were no significant decline and it indicated that all aspects of memory were preserved after surgery although the risk for a verbal memory decline was increased of patients without hippocampal sclerosis. Memory before and 1 month after TSA Right TSA p values Left TSA p values Preop. 1MP Preop. 1MP Memory Verbal 74.9 (14.5) 87.1 (18.5) p < 0.001 77.8 (18.5) 73.8 (16.1) NS Non verbal 81.0 (17.5) 87.2 (16.1) NS 90.8 (17.6) 92.1 (21.1) NS General 73.3 (14.8) 84.6 (18.1) p < 0.001 78.9 (18.6) 76.2 (17.3) NS Delayed Recall 72.0 (15.9) 78.8 (20.0) p = 0.0015 75.2 (19.8) 72.4 (17.6) NS Attension 83.7 (16.6) 86.8 (16.7) NS 91.2 (16.4) 90.8 (20.8) NS Cells provide the mean standardized scores with the standard deviations in parentheses.

Conclusions: The results indicate that left TSA can lead to preserve the memory function, particularly right TSA can lead to a significant improvements in memory functions. 1 William Murphy, 1 Terry Myles, 1 Walter Hader, 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 Lorie Hamiwka, 1 Elaine Wirrell, 1 Paolo Federico, 1 Nathalie Jette, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Reports on the diagnostic accuracy of structural MRI in detecting putative lesions in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery vary substantially, and are probably influenced by MRI protocols, types of lesions, and expertise. Using histopathology as the gold standard, we assess the overall sensitivity and specificity of structural MRI in an unselected cohort of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, and provide post-tests probabilities for negative and positive studies. Methods: In a retrospective cohort of consecutive cases undergoing resective epilepsy surgery, we identified those who had histopathological tissue examination,ie., the gold standard. MRIs protocols contained a combination of general and epilepsy-specific sequences, and experts and non-experts performed MRI interpretation. The presence or absence of a putative lesion on structural MRI, using epilepsy specific protocols, was compared with the presence or absence of a histopathological lesion. We obtained sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), positive and negative likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities using a range of plausible pre-test probabilities. We also obtained 95% confidence intervals around each estimate. Factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy were assessed when the sample size allowed. Results: Of 135 consecutive patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery, 117 had MRI and histopathological analyses. Histopathological abnormalities occurred in 104 patients (prevalence of 89%), of whom the MRI found a lesion in 93, yielding a false negative rate of 11%, and a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI = 83%, 95%). Of 13 patients with normal histopathology, the MRI showed a lesion in eight, with a false positive rate of 62%, and a specificity of only 38% (95% CI = 12%, 64%). The likelihood ratios for a positive and a negative MRI were 1.44 (low) and 0.3 (medium-high), respectively. Indicating that in this analysis, the MRI seems to be more useful when negative, because its false positive rate was too high. When the chance of finding a lesion is 50%, a positive MRI increases the probability to only 59%, and a negative MRI decreases is to 22%. Conclusions: In unselected patients undergoing epilepsy surgery Structural MRI has a sensitivity of almost 90% and a specificity of only 38%. The causes for the high false positive rate of MRI in our cohort are explored. Reference Von OJ, Urbach H, Jungbluth S, et al.

Chung, 3 Erin C. Prenger, 1 Harold L. Rekate, 2 Iman Feiz-Irfan, and 1 John F. Kerrigan ( 1 Pediatric Neuroscience, Barrow Neurological Institute/St. Joseph's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ ; 2 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ; and 3 Neuroradiology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: Hypothalamic hamartomas (HHs) are rare developmental abnormalities of the inferior hypothalamus that often cause refractory, symptomatic, mixed epilepsy. Multiple surgical approaches have been described. We present a series of 39 patients where a transcortical, transventricular, endoscopic resection was performed. Methods: Forty-two patients with refractory epilepsy underwent surgical resection of HH between October 2003 and April 2005 at our institution, i.e. all patients with more than 12 month follow-up. All patients underwent endoscopic resection and were prospectively studied. Neurosurgery was performed with the endoscope held by an articulated pneumatic arm and tracked with a frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system. Data collection and follow-up was performed by personal interview. Three patients were excluded because they underwent combined surgical approaches (subfrontal and transcallosal). Results: The average age of the patients was 15.8 years (range 8 months to 55 years). There were 24 males. All 39 patients had very frequent seizures, usually multiple types. The average number of each patient's total daily seizures was 18.2 (range 0.1?192) and an average of 2.2 seizure types each. 33 (85%) patients had trademark gelastic seizures at the time of surgery. The patients were on an average of 2.0 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 25 patients had either cognitive and/or behavioral impairment. Postoperative MRI demonstrated 100% resection and disconnection of the HH from the hypothalamus in 12 patients. There were no mortalities. Significant morbidity was limited to one patient with residual hemiparesis. Two patients were lost to follow-up. At latest follow-up (average 20.1 months (range 13 to 28 months)), 18/37 (48.6%) patients were seizure-free, 26/37 (70.3%) patients had >90% reduction in their seizures and another 8/37 (21.6%) of patients had 50?90% seizure reduction. Fourteen patients were off all AEDs. Twenty-five (67.6%) patients reported either improved cognition and/or behavior. The percentage of disconnection trended toward seizure freedom (p = 0.069). The percentage of resection did not significantly correlate with seizure freedom (p = 0.11). In an endoscopic resection group of 33 patients, the average length of post-surgical hospital stay was 5.8 days (SD = 3.1) as compared to 18 patients who underwent transcallosal resection and stayed for 8.7 days (SD = 4.7). This overall difference i.e. shorter hospital stay amongst the endoscopically resected patients was statistically significant (p < 0.03). Conclusions: Endoscopic resection of HH is safe and effective for the treatment of seizures. Its efficacy appears to be comparable to transcallosal resection of HH, however with significantly shorter patient recovery time post-operatively. 1 Tomonori Ono, 1 Keisuke Toda, 1 Shiro Baba, 1 Hiroshi Baba, and 2 Kenji Ono ( 1 Neurosurgery, National Nagasaki Medical Center, Omura, Nagasaki, Japan ; and 2 Yokoo Hospital, Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan ) Rationale: Surgery for bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (Bi-TLE), herein defined as seizures arising independently from both temporal lobes, has been demonstrated to have poor efficacy. However, lateralized MRI abnormality and a preponderance of interictal spikes on EEG have been identified as factors for good surgical outcome. Ictal EEG findings are also a decisive factor for determining the resection side. Predominant ictal onset side (PIOS) is considered to be a direct measure of laterality of ictogenisity, however, this has yet to be quantitative analyzed. In this study, we reviewed our surgical series of Bi-TLE patients and determined the correlation between quantitatively assessed PIOS and postoperative outcome. Methods: We analyzed data from 23 patients with Bi-TLE who had undergone anterior temporal lobectomy. Patients' ages at the time of the operation ranged from 14 to 55 years (mean 31.2 years). Diagnoses of Bi-TLE were confirmed using subdural electrode recordings, and the side of resection was determined by PIOS. Postoperative seizure outcome was assessed using Engel's outcome classification between 9 and 161 months (mean 80 months) after surgery. Percentages of ictal onset side calculated on the basis of all recorded seizures and other clinical characteristics were correlated with postoperative seizure outcome. Results: Regarding postoperative seizure outcome, 9 patients (39.1%) were class I, 8 patients (34.8%) were class II, and 6 patients (26.1%) were class III. The following items were found to be statistically significant factors for good surgical outcome: 1) no history of severe encephalitis (p = 0.03), 2) higher percentage of PIOS (class I vs. class II-III, 87.6 ± 3.1% vs. 73.7 ± 3.3%, p = 0.009), and 3) lateralized lesion (p = 0.01), or absence of bilateral abnormalities on MRI (p = 0.02). Furthermore, multivariate analyses showed that factors 1) and 2) were independent predictors of good outcome. Conclusions: Surgery for Bi-TLE results in a greater reduction of seizures if preoperative evaluations show good predictive factors. In particular, when the percentage of PIOS is greater than 85%, a more favorable outcome can be obtained. 1 Andre Palmini, 1 Eliseu Paglioli, 1 Jaderson Costa, 1 Caroline Torres, 1 Jose Victor Martinez, 1 Eduardo Portela, 1 Helio F. Silva-Filho, 1 Eduardo Paglioli, 1 Mirna Portuguez, 1 Jose-Rubiao Hoeffel-Filho, 1 Ligia Coutinho, 1 François Dubeau, and 1 Frederick Andermann ( 1 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Pontificia Universidade Católica do RS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; and Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada ) Rationale: Incomplete resections are not uncommon in surgery for epilepsy due to FCD, however, the dynamics of long-term surgical outcome following these resections have not been investigated in detail. We report on the variable patterns of seizure recurrence following incomplete resections for FCD and relate these to the histopathologic type. Methods: Forty-two children and adult patients with FCD identified through MRI and/or confirmed on histopathology were followed for a mean of 54 months. In 25, a complete resection of the dysplastic tissue was not possible in a first operation. They all underwent preoperative evaluation and surgery was guided by acute ECoG and cortical electrical stimulation. Residual lesion was identified either at the end of operation or at post-op MRI. The degree of seizure control was evaluated periodically, and classified according to Engel's outcome scale. FCD lesions were classified histopathologically in types I, IIA, and IIB. Results: Three recurrence patterns were identified: (i) in 6 patients, seizures recurred within 7 days of operation, with higher frequency and intensity than in the preoperative period. Three needed ICU admission for status epilepticus; (ii) 9 presented recurrent seizures during the first post-op month and continued seizing with similar frequency as before surgery over the years or until reoperation. Finally (iii) 10 patients had a post-op seizure free interval between 3 months and 2 years, following which seizures recurred. Histopathologic types IIA and IIB were similarly represented in all 3 recurrence patterns. Conclusions: Lasting seizure freedom was incompatible with incomplete lesion resections in FCD types II A and B. Interference with inhibitory networks associated with dysplastic lesions may explain the patterns of running up of seizure frequency and intensity, particularly early post-resection severe deterioration leading to status epilepticus.

Jobst ( 1 Neurosurgery  Class II- 3 (14%); Class III- 2 (10%); Class IV- 3 (14%) Conclusions: Interhemispheric intracranial monitoring electrodes are a safe and effective tool in epilepsy surgery. 1 Fortino Salazar, 2 Imad Najm, 3 Prakash Kotagal, 1 Ann Warbel, and 1 William Bingaman ( 1 Neurosurgery/Epilepsy Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; 2 Neurology/Adult Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 3 Pediatric Neurology/Epilepsy, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Subdural grids (SDG) have been increasingly used in the evaluation of some patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. In a small number of patients the placement of SDG is not followed by a surgical resection. There is a paucity of data about these patients and the causes behind the lack of success in their invasive evaluation. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review the data on patients who were evaluated at our center with SDG. Methods: Adult and pediatric patients who underwent the placement of SDG, followed by prolonged video-EEG monitoring but did not have resective surgery were identified from the Cleveland Clinic database and their medical records were reviewed. A total of 233 patients underwent SDG placement between January 1997 and June 2005. The placement of SDG and prolonged invasive recordings did not lead to resective surgery in 29 (12%) patients who were included in this review. Mean age was 25 years (7 were < 18 years old). There were 15 males and 14 females. Average duration of seizures was 15 years. The MRI was interpreted as normal in 12 patients, other MRI findings included malformation of cortical development, schinzencephaly and focal brain atrophy. All patients had PET studies and when indicated a Wada test. The number of electrodes used varied between 56 and 160. Average monitoring duration was 8 days (between 4 and 19). Results: Reasons for NOT pursuing surgical treatment were: a) Identification of multiregional or non-localizable epileptogenic foci (12 pts), b) presence of epileptogenic foci in eloquent cortex (8 pts), c) lack of adequate coverage of the suspected ictal onset zone (5 pts), or d) the lack of seizure recording after SDG (2 pts). In two patients the evaluation was terminated because of surgical complications. Following the SDG evaluation, 6 patients had VNS implanted and 5 others are considering this option. Three patients are considering another invasive evaluation, one had a resective surgery at a later time, and 7 patients are only considering medical treatment. Conclusions: Approximately 12% of patients were not suitable candidates to undergo surgical resection. The two most common reasons were involvement of eloquent cortex and evidence of diffuse epileptogenic zone. It is important to refine or develop better ways to identify this group of patients prior to implantation, such as the use of fMRI, MEG and sophisticated EEG to avoid costly and risky procedures. 1 Kostas N. Fountas, and 1 Joseph R. Smith ( 1 Department of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Georgia, Macon, GA ) Rationale: Implantation of subdural strip and grid electrodes represents a common methodology in the invasive evaluation of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Although in the vast majority of cases their implantation is safe, the occurrence of implantation-associated complications can be occasionally troublesome. The purpose of our current communication is to identify the most commonly occurred complications and calculate their frequency in our institution. Methods: In a retrospective study, 185 patients (104 males and 81 females) undergoing subdural strip/grid electrode implantation during a 20-year period, were examined. Their age ranged between 16 and 48 years, while their mean age was 23.6. AdTech (AdTech, Racine,WI,USA) strip and grid electrodes were used in all our cases. The anatomical location of implantation were:26 implants in orbito-frontal area, 41 in mesial frontal,14 in mesial occipital, 13 in antero-basal area, 44 in interhemispheric areas while 180 in convexity areas (4 temporo-polar, 83 parietal, 17 occipital and 76 temporal). The monitoring period ranged from 2?25 days (mean 10.8 and median 7 days). Results: The most commonly occurred complication in our series was the development of post-operative epidural hematoma in 3/185 (1.6%) patients, requiring emergent surgical evacuation. In 2/185 (1.1%) cases transient aphasia occurred, which was spontaneously resolved. A surgical subdural hematoma developed in 2/185 (1.1%) while in another 2/185 (1.1%) an infection occurred. Interestingly, in 2 patients (1.1%) significant brain edema was post-operatively evident; one of these patients was conservatively managed with no further consequences while the other one succumbed despite aggressive management of his intracranial hypertension. Finally, one patient developed post-operatively stiff lung syndrome secondary to aspiration and eventually expired. Another interesting observation in our series was the recording of non-habitual seizures in 5/185(2.7%) patients. Conclusions: Subdural electrode complications although rare can be troublesome and occasionally disastrous. Knowledge, early identification and prompt management of potential complications can minimize the risks associated with the surgical implantation of subdural electrodes. 1,2 William O. Tatum IV, 2 Kumar Anthony, 2 Leanne Heriaud, 1,2 Selim R. Benbadis, 2 Adele Haber, and 1,3 Fernando L. Vale ( 1 Neurology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ; 2 Neurology, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ; and 3 Neurosurgery, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: Epilepsy Surgery is a standard of care in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Intracranial electrodes can help identify surgical candidates when discordant information is present from the extracranial evaluation. We analyzed our experience with intracranial electrodes over 6 years. Methods: Two-hundred and fifty-eight resective epilepsy surgeries were performed from 2000?2006, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 years (range 2?65 months). Twenty-nine females and 21 males with a mean age of 29.4 years were implanted using an electrode array based upon the results of a standardized, non-invasive, pre-surgical evaluation. All patients were implanted at a single tertiary care epilepsy center between 2000?2006 by one neurosurgeon. Discordant information following a non-invasive evaluation including scalp-based video-EEG monitoring was obtained in each case. Resective surgical procedures, implanted array, and outcome were assessed. Outcome was reported as seizure-free, seizure improved (>50% of baseline), and no improvement, and was based upon information obtained at the time of last contact. Results: Fifty epilepsy patients (19.4%) were implanted with intracranial electrodes. Twenty-four patients (48%) had bitemporal placement, 15/50 (30%) were unilateral, and 11/50 were bilateral-extratemporal (22%). Thirty-seven (74%) underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and 13/50 (26%) were rejected as surgical candidates. Seizure freedom or improvement was noted in 9/14 (64.3%) implanted with unilateral electrodes, 14/24 (58.3%) with bitemporal electrodes, and 4/10 (40.0%) with bilateral-extratemporal electrodes. Resections were temporal in 27/37 (73.0%), and extratemporal in 10/37 (27%) including frontal in 6/37 (12.5%), multi-lobar in 2/37 (5.4%), parietal in one (2.7%), and occipital in one. At last follow-up, 21/27 (81.4%) of the temporal resections were either seizure free (33.3%) or seizure improved (48.1%). Only 5/27 (13.5%) failed temporal surgery, compared with 3/8 (37.5%) extratemporal resections. MRI demonstrated an abnormality in 19/50 (38%) with neuronal migrational disorders accounting for the most common cause. The presence of a lesion did not have a more favorable outcome (8/19; 42.9%) than those with cryptogenic causes (18/29; 62.1%) (p = 0.24, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: Most epilepsy patients requiring intracranial electrodes will be candidates for resective surgery. Bitemporal electrode placement for lateralization, and temporal resections were the most frequent surgeries performed. Patients implanted only with bitemporal electrodes, were not more likely than those with a lateralized array to benefit from resective surgery. Those with lesional epilepsy had no more favorable outcome than those with a cryptogenic etiology in our series. 1 Samuel Wiebe, 1 Walter Hader, 1 Neelan Pillay, 1 Terry Myles, 1 Lorie Hamiwka, 1 Elaine Wirrell, 1 Paolo Federico, 1 Nathalie Jette, and 1 William Murphy ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: There is a notion that patients whose epilepsy is associated with a putative lesion have better surgical outcomes than those without such lesions. However, cases are often selected and other prognostic often remain unexplored. We explore seizure outcomes in unselected cases of lesional versus non-lesional epilepsy surgery, as well as the variables that impact outcomes in the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive, unselected cases assessed post-surgical seizure freedom at the time of last follow-up in patients whose MRI showed and in those in whom it did not show putative lesions. We used survival analyses for the main comparison and single and multivariate analyses to explore factors that may influence outcome, such as age, duration of epilepsy, etiology, type of surgery and location of surgery. Results: Of 113 consecutive patients, 91(81%) had putative MRI lesions. An equal proportion (70%) of lesional and non-lesional cases had temporal lobe surgery. Patients without lesions were significantly more likely to have a family history of epilepsy (p = 0.03) and they had a trend towards a younger age at surgery. Two years after surgery 57% of lesional and 36% of non-lesional cases were seizure free (p = 0.07). As compared with temporal lesional cases, extratemporal lesional cases were younger at presentation (20 vs 38 years) and at surgery (17 vs 35 years) (p < 0.01), and their seizure free rate was lower (not significant). Preoperative deficits were more frequent in non-lesional extratemporal than in temporal cases. Of patients with frontal resections, most were non-lesional (p = 0.02). Conclusions: In unselected patients undergoing epilepsy surgery those without MRI lesions have overall poorer seizure outcomes, are younger (especially extratemporal cases), more often have a family history of epilepsy, and more often have frontal lobe epilepsy. 1 Charles M. Zaroff, 1 Deepak Madhavan, 2 Alexis Arzimanoglou, 2 Florence Renaldo, 1 Josiane LaJoie, 1 Howard L. Weiner, 3 Eva Andermann, 4 Frederick Andermann, 4 Francois Dubeau, 4 Andre Olivier, 4 Alexei Yankovsky, 5 David N. Franz, 5 Jennifer Leonard, 6 Mary Connolly, 7 Greg D. Cascino, and 1 Orrin Devinsky ( 1 Department of Neurology, NYU Medical Center, New York, NY ; 2 Child Neurology  3 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery and Human Genetics, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada ; 4 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada ; 5 Department of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; 6 Division of Neurology, Vancouver BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada ; and 7 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ) Rationale: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is associated with medically refractory epilepsy. Epilepsy surgery, with the goal of resecting epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure relief, has become a viable therapeutic option in TSC. The purpose of the current study is to determine factors associated with seizure relief postoperatively in TSC patients utilizing multicenter data. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with TSC following surgery for relief of epilepsy was performed from multiple centers. Seventy subjects were analyzed. We studied patient characteristics (presence/absence of mental retardation, age at TSC diagnosis), electrophysiological characteristics (seizure onset age, ictal/interictal focality), seizure type (i.e., presence/absence of infantile spasms), tuber number, electrophysiological/neuroimaging concordance, surgical variables (age at surgery, surgical method, and number of stages), and postoperative residual dominant tuber as determined by neuroimaging. Data were analyzed for all 70 subjects as a whole and for subjects assessed two years or less postoperatively and more than 2 years postoperatively. Results: 27/70 subjects were seizure free (Engel Class I). Subjects with ictal multifocality, mental retardation, and discordant EEG/MRI data were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. However, only associations between seizure freedom and age at seizure onset, history of infantile spasms, and interictal focality were significant at all postoperative durations. The mean age at seizure onset was 2 years in seizure free subjects compared to 7 months in those with persistent seizures. Only 5/32 subjects with a history of infantile spasms were seizure free postoperatively. Focal interictal discharges were seen in 85% of seizure free subjects versus 32% of subjects with persistent seizures. The number of tubers was significantly associated with poor outcome when measured less than 2 years postoperatively. Conclusions: In patients experiencing seizure freedom following surgery for epilepsy in TSC, ictal focality, normal development, and concordant electrophysiological and neuroimaging data are common findings. However, similar features can also be observed in subjects with postoperative seizures. The current study suggests that later age at seizure onset, no history of infantile spasms, interictal focality, and fewer cortical tubers may be determining factors in seizure freedom. 1 Carolina R. Almeida, 2,3 Kette D. Valente, 2 Silvia Vincentiis, 4 Juan Castro, 4 Hung T. Wen, 1 Renato L. Marchetti, 1 Wagner F. Gattaz, and 1 Elida B. Ojopi ( 1 Laboratory of Neuroscience, Psychiatry Institute, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 2 Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Psychiatry Institute, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 3 LIM 21, Psychiatry Institute, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 4 Neurosurgery, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is one of the most common medically intractable epilepsy syndromes and its pathogenesis remains obscure. The polymorphisms of single nucleotide (SNPs), alterations in a single nucleotide of DNA sequence, when non-synonymous, are capable of cause changes in protein's structure and have been studied in association studies. Recent studies demonstrated controversial results about the relationship between gene polymorphism and epilepsy. Several association studies involving more than 30 genes involved in Mesial Temporal Sclerosis (MTS) are described. However, it remains the uncertainty in associations and the imperfection in replications. The objective of this study is the molecular characterization of MTS. Methods: Thirty patients with MTS, well characterized by MRI, were pared by sex and age with 30 controls without family history of neurological or psychiatric disorders to be genotyped. The authors investigated, through search of new DNA SNPs, susceptibility genes to developmental of MTS. Initially, more than 100 genes coding to ionic channels and other genes related to neuronal migration and neurogenesis were evaluated. From these, 82 genes were selected. These genes were previously described in association studies of epilepsy or studies of families. To the moment, we found 20 non-synonymous polymorphisms in 11 different genes. Results: In the initial experimental analysis, 14 SNPs find in 5 different genes were evaluated. The data show that for the first 30 patients, 8 SNPs were confirmed in 5 different genes (EFHC1, ME2, BRD2, BDNF and TMEM1). Conclusions: The number of patients and controls limited the statistical power of the ongoing study. Knowledge of these SNPs and their effect on genes involved with MTS may be important to help a better understanding of complexes pathways that characterize the neuronal hyperexcitability and the development of new strategies for treatment and diagnosis.

Minassian ( 1 Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ; and 2 Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada ) Rationale: Protein transduction domains (PTDs) may be capable of transducing full-length fusion proteins across plasma cell membranes and the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). They are therefore considered a promising tool for the development of protein therapy aimed at the central nervous system. In this study we analysed the characteristics of TAT-PTD genetically fused to cystatin B (CSTB), the protein responsible for the Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). Methods: A PCR product containing the EPM1 coding region was cloned into the pRSET vector containing the TAT-PTD sequence. A control protein was assembled by insertion of EPM1 cDNA into this vector, followed by removal of TAT-PTD. TAT-PTD-CSTB and CSTB were expressed in bacterial cells, purified and transduced into COS-7 cells and human lymphoblasts. Whole cell lysates and cellular fractions were obtained for study by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Transduced (and control) cells were also used for analysis through immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: Initial results pointed to an apparent time and concentration-dependent transduction of TAT-PTD-CSTB. However, careful investigation demonstrated that the nuclear localization of TAT-PTD-CSTB was an artifact of fixation and that the fusion protein was adhered to the plasma membrane. Conclusions: TAT-PTD-CSTB does not penetrate the cells. For this reason, even if TAT-PTD is likely able to cross the BBB, the fusion of this protein to CSTB cannot be used as a form of replacement of the intracytoplasmic protein missing in ULD. Importantly, we discuss precautions to avoid false-positive results when working with TAT-PTD for protein therapy of neurological diseases. 1,2 Anna-Kaisa Anttonen, 2 Erika Ahonen, 3 Eija Gaily, 3 Elina Liukkonen, 4 Marjo-Riitta Aine, 5 Eila Herrgård, 3 Liisa Metsähonkala, 6 Heikki Rantala, 2 Auli Sirén, and 2 Anna-Elina Lehesjoki ( 1 Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland ; 2 Folkhälsan Institute of Genetics and Neuroscience Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland ; 3 Department of Pediatric Neurology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland ; 4 Department of Child Neurology, Lapland Central Hospital, Rovaniemi, Finland ; 5 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland ; and 6 Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: Mutations in SCN1A are associated with many epilepsy syndromes such as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Mutations in SCN2A2 have been described in benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures and GEFS+ but to date only one SCN2A2 mutation has been associated with intractable epilepsy. We evaluated the contribution of SCN1A and SCN2A2 mutations to infantile onset intractable epilepsy in Finnish patients. Methods: SCN1A and SCN2A2 were screened for mutations in 33 patients, 21 of which had a clinical suspicion of SMEI. We amplified all exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCN1A and SCN2A2 from genomic DNA and sequenced the PCR products with an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. Sequences were analyzed using the Sequencher 4.5 program. Results: We found six different de novo mutations in SCN1A: One nonsense, two splice site, one frameshift-causing and two missense mutations that change highly conserved amino acids. Two of the mutations were previously described. The clinical presentation in three of the mutation positive patients is SMEI. Two patients have borderline SMEI and one has a milder phenotype with normal cognitive development. We also found one previously undescribed de novo missense mutation of a conserved amino acid in SCN2A2 in a patient with infantile onset epilepsy and episodic ataxia. None of the mutations were observed in 192 control chromosomes. Conclusions: Our findings are compatible with previous findings showing that de novo SCN1A mutations are a major cause of SMEI. SCN2A2 mutations are found only in a small subset of infantile onset intractable epilepsy. 1 Christie Barker-Cummings, 1 W. Allen Hauser, and 1 Ruth Ottman ( 1 Sergievsky Center and Epidemiology Department, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: Epilepsy and febrile seizures are complex disorders with both distinct and overlapping genetic influences. Febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy (individual comorbidity). In addition, each disorder aggregates in families, and an increased risk of each disorder has been reported in the relatives of probands with the other. No single study has comprehensively examined the contributions of shared and distinct genetic influences to these observations. We aimed to evaluate the overlapping genetic contributions to epilepsy and febrile seizures by studying patterns of co-occurrence, within individuals and within families, in a large genetic epidemiologic study. Methods: The study population comprised 2279 full siblings of 879 probands with epilepsy from the Epilepsy Family Study of Columbia University. Data on febrile seizures were obtained by interview of at least one of the proband's parents. We evaluated the risks of epilepsy in siblings without febrile seizures, and febrile seizures in siblings without epilepsy, in relation to the proband's febrile seizure history and family history of febrile seizures and epilepsy in other first-degree relatives. We considered four types of family history: epilepsy alone, febrile seizures alone, both epilepsy and febrile seizures, and neither. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute rate ratios [RRs] and 95% confidence intervals [CI] for epilepsy, and logistic regression to compute odds ratios [ORs] for febrile seizures. Results: Epilepsy risk in siblings was not associated with a history of febrile seizures in the proband (RR = 0.5, CI 0.17?1.35). As expected, epilepsy risk was associated with a family history of epilepsy in other relatives (RR = 3.6, CI 1.78?7.47). Epilepsy risk was not associated with a family history of febrile seizures alone (RR = 1.4, CI 0.47?3.85), but was strongly associated with a family history of both febrile seizures and epilepsy (RR = 8.9, CI = 3.92?20.05). The risk of febrile seizures in siblings was associated with a history of recurrent febrile seizures in the proband (OR = 2.3, CI 1.17?4.60), but not with a history of a single febrile seizure in the proband. As expected, febrile seizure risk was associated with a family history of febrile seizures (OR = 4.3, CI 2.54?7.39). Febrile seizure risk was also associated with a family history of epilepsy alone (OR = 2.3, CI 0.99?5.16). As in the analysis of epilepsy, febrile seizure risk was strongly associated with a family history of both epilepsy and febrile seizures (OR = 6.1, CI 2.46?15.18). Conclusions: These results provide evidence for familial clustering of epilepsy and febrile seizures that is not attributed to individual comorbidity of the two disorders. Familial clustering was strongest in families containing multiple individuals with epilepsy. The findings are reminiscent of the syndrome GEFS+, which has previously been described only in highly selected pedigrees.

A beneficial effect of transdermal nicotine has been reported in one single case. We aimed to investigate the influence of tobacco habits on seizure activity in two families with ADNFLE. Methods: Interviews focusing on the pattern of nicotine intake and seizure activity were performed in 22 adult mutation carriers belonging to two ADNFLE pedigrees with different mutations in the gene coding for the nAChR α4 subunit. Results: Ten of 14 tobacco consumers were seizure free, whereas all seven non-smokers with manifest ADNFLE had persistent seizures. In several patients, remissions and fluctuations of epileptic symptoms clearly appeared to correspond to changes in tobacco habits. Furthermore, one pharmacoresistant patient who had recently begun treatment with transdermal nicotine had experienced improvement. Conclusions: Tobacco appears to be an environmental factor which influences the course of ADNFLE. An inactivation of the mutant nAChRs by desensitization during chronic nicotine exposure may explain the beneficial effect. In pharmacoresistant patients with ADNFLE, treatment with transdermal nicotine should be considered, weighing efficacy against potential long-term harmful effects. Prospective studies are needed.

Of seven studies reporting association tests between variation in ABCB1 and response to anti epileptic drugs (AEDs), three showed positive association, while four did not. Two papers showed association in a case control design, suggesting ABCB1 variation is related to seizure susceptibility. We report the first association study on a cohort of patients and controls from the US and Canada. Methods: Genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) c1236t and c3435t was performed using TaqMan assays. Samples were collected at 7 sites and all subjects (ages 3?70) were recruited according to local institutional review board policies. Blood samples were obtained and most are available as cell lines from the Coriell Institute. Both markers were typed in 297 generalized patients (70 AED resistant), 253 focal patients (88 AED resistant) and 184 controls, all of European ancestry. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was checked and alleles tested for association using chi square tests. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype effects were calculated using likelihood ratio and CHAPLIN respectively. AED response was defined as one year of seizure freedom since last checkup. Results: All markers were in HWE and the SNPs were in strong LD, p = 1 ? 10?3. Single marker analyses showed a lack of association for drug response or seizure susceptibility. However, an association was observed between AED response and the CC haplotype in generalized patients (p = 0.007). Haplotypes CC and TT were strongly associated with seizure susceptibility comparing all cases to controls p = 1 ? 10?7. Conclusions: We conclude that variation in ABCB1 is weakly associated with AED response in our generalized patients and is strongly associated with seizure susceptibility in all patients. The same haplotpye that confers drug resistance also increases risk for seizures suggesting a relationship between susceptibility and AED response.

Several key shortcomings in the study design of previous studies have been identified such as insufficient sample sizes, insufficient coverage of genes and lack of replication of detected associations. Here we attempt to integrate these factors in to the largest genetic mapping study to date in epilepsy. Methods: Through the establishment of a multinational collaborative effort, a collection of 3107 epilepsy patients phenotyped for the principal seizure and syndrome types and 1797 healthy controls was assembled. Two hundred and seventy nine candidate genes were selected. For each of these genes bioinformatically-inferred functional variants were identified. Tagging SNPs were also selected for 198 of the 297 genes. In total 4608 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate platform across all 4904 participants. Results: Preliminary analyses show an enrichment for significant p values (p < 0.05) but no one p value is strong enough to withstand correction for multiple testing. Conclusions: This result suggests that the data contain a number of risk factors but the effect of any one of these risk factors is marginal. Data analyses will be enhanced by additional genotyping currently ongoing.

Conte, 1 Patricia A.O. Ribeiro, 1 Lourenco Sbragia, 1 Rovilson Gilioli, 1 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia L. Cendes ( 1 Department of Medical Genetics, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Missense mutations in the mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene have been identified to co-segregate with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) patients. In addition, functional studies have demonstrated that expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene induces apoptosis in neurons in culture. However, the exact relationship between mRib72?1/Efhc1 function and epileptogenesis is still unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene in mouse brain in order to investigate its possible role in programmed cell death during development. Methods: Balb/c mice were submitted to programmed mating to obtain animals in different developmental stages. The brains of embryos aged 15, 17 and 18 days old and of neonates aged 1, 7, 14 and 28 days old were subsequently removed. We used brain of three animals for each age studied. After RNA extraction, the relative gene expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 was determined by the real-time PCR technique using TaqMan? assay. GAPD gene expression was used as an endogenous control. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate that the expression of mRib72?1/Efhc1 is higher in embryos than in neonates (p = 0.001), with a progressive decrease from embryos aged 18 days to neonates. Conclusions: The highest expression of the mRib72?1/Efhc1 gene in embryo brains in comparison to neonates suggests that the putative pro-apoptotic role of this gene may be necessary for the correct organization of the central nervous system during its initial phases of development.

Eksioglu and 1 Masanori Takeoka ( 1 Neurology/Epilepsy, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ) Rationale: The Aristaless-related homeobox gene, ARX, is a transcription factor with a crucial role in the development of forebrain, pancreas and testes. Located in the X chromosome (Xp22.13), ARX mutations cause a pleiomorphic array of phenotypes such as mental retardation, lissencephaly, infantile spasms, and abnormal genitalia in males. Based on human genetics and loss-of-function studies in mice, ARX appears to be crucial in the regulation of GABAergic interneuron development and maintenance of circuitry. Ohtahara syndrome consists of epileptic encephalopathy, suppression-burst EEG-pattern and refractory epilepsy with tonic spasms in young infants. Despite reports of neonatal epilepsy, Ohtahara syndrome has not been previously described in infants with ARX mutations. Methods: We describe a boy with Ohtahara syndrome who presents with refractory seizures since day-1-of-life caused by a novel mutation in the ARX-gene. His initial presentation with startle and jerking movements, evolve into brief tonic seizures, refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs including phenobarbital, zonisamide and levetiracetam. Despite a normal MRI, EEG reveals suppression-burst-pattern. He is normocephalic without dysmorphism, except for micropenis and bilateral cryptorchidism, in addition to diffuse hypotonia without weakness. Later, he develops infantile spasms with partial response to vigabatrin. Results: ARX nucleotide sequence analysis, by Athena diagnostics (Worcester, MA), including entire coding regions and intronic sequences of exon-intron splice junctions, revealed that the proband was hemizygous for a novel mutation comprising 1 base pair insertion of C after nucleotide position 1471, resulting in a frameshift at codon 491. Analysis of mother's DNA revealed that she was heterozygous for the same mutation in ARX-gene, hence, demonstrating her as a carrier(City of Hope Clinical Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Duarte, CA). Conclusions: This is the first reported case of Ohtahara syndrome as consequence of a novel mutation in exon 5 of the ARX-gene. Insertion of a C after position 1471 in the ARX gene leads to a frameshift that completely changes the structure of the ARX protein from amino acid 491, affecting the composition of the C terminal end. This leads to the disruption of the aristaless-domain, which is known to play crucial role in central nervous system regionalization with respect to its potential role in transactivation activity. The molecular pathology observed in this novel mutation reflects the complexity associated with ARX protein structure and function. The aristaless domain, localized to exon 5 in the C terminal end of the ARX protein, stands out as an important region in ARX protein signaling. Hence, further genetic/molecular studies are necessary to better understand the function of the aristaless-domain and its association with the Ohtahara syndrome in our patient with this novel mutation. 1,2,3 Marco Fedi, 1,4 Leon Bach, 1,3 Samuel F. Berkovic, 1,3 Ingrid Scheffer, and 1,5 David C. Reutens ( 1 Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia ; 2 Clinical School, The University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia ; 3 Department of Neurology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia ; 4 Department of Endocrinology, Alfred Hospital, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ; and 5 Southern Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: The hypothalamo-pituitary system is innervated by cholinergic fibers and activation of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) modulates the release of anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of nAChRs subunits are linked to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), a syndrome characterized by clusters of nocturnal frontal seizures with no overt endocrinological manifestations. Here we assessed the effect of central cholinergic activation on the release of anterior pituitary hormones in individuals with ADNFLE. Methods: Thirteen subjects with the α4-Ser248Phe mutation (4 male, mean age 43.2 ± 16.8) and 41 healthy volunteers (24 male, mean age 36.2 ± 12.2) were studied. Serum levels of GH, LH, FSH, PRL, TSH, thyroxine and cortisol were measured at baseline, 30 and 60 minutes after infusion of physostigmine. Results: In controls, cholinergic activation increased the serum levels of GH (mean change + 993%, p < 0.001), PRL (169%, p < 0.001) and reduced the levels of FSH (?7.9%, p < 0.002). In contrast, in subjects with the a4-Ser248Phe mutation no changes in the release of these hormones were observed (GH 104% p > 0.2; PRL 5.2%; p > 0.8, FSH ? 0.8% p > 0.2). Physostigmine increased cortisol levels both in controls (p < 0.01) and in subjects with the mutation (p < 0.03). Between subjects repeated measure ANOVA showed a selective difference in the release of GH and PRL (time*group interaction GH p < 0.04; PRL p < 0.01) following administration of physostigmine. Conclusions: The α4-Ser248Phe mutation selectively affects cholinergic-mediated GH and PRL secretion, a finding that may be of pathophysiological significance given the role of somatostatin in experimental models of focal epilepsy. 1 Tracy A.

Sharp ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Neurology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA ) Rationale: Specific genomic profiles have been noted in the blood of patients with various neurological disorders including Down syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, Tuberous Sclerosis, and Tourette syndrome. This study aimed to determine if specific genomic profiles existed in the blood of children with newly diagnosed and untreated idiopathic epilepsy compared to normal children. Methods: Patients with untreated idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), untreated idiopathic partial epilepsy (IPE) or healthy children with no history of epilepsy (NML) were enrolled in this IRB approved study. RNA was extracted from whole blood and gene expression was determined using Affymetrix U133 2.0 PLUS microarray chips. Using microarray expression data, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with epilepsy type (IGE v. IPE v. NML), gender and age (where age was dichotomized over the median of 10 years) was used to identify genes (with a 90% confidence of having false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1) that differentiated between the three groups (IGE, IPE and NML). Pairwise comparisons were performed to identify significantly differentiated genes between groups. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed on the IGE and IPE groups from the genes that differentiated between the three groups. GO classes and parent classes with at least 5 observations in the selected subset and with an Observed vs. Expected ratio of at least 2 were reported. Results: A total of 79 children were enrolled; 21 with IPE, 30 with IGE and 28 NML patients. After adjustment for age and gender, 460 genes (with a 90% confidence of having FDR < 0.1) were differentially expressed among the epilepsy groups. Pairwise comparisons showed: IGE v. NML had 301 significantly differentiated genes, (overall p = 0.002), IPE v. NML had 308 significantly differentiated genes (overall p = 0.003) and IPE v. IGE had 26 significantly differentiated genes (overall p < 0.001). From the 460 genes which differentiated the IGE v. IPE v. NML with FDR < 0.1, two gene ontologies were found in the comparison of IGE v. IPE, where the 61 most significant genes contained no more than 5 false discoveries with 90% confidence. The two gene ontologies were intracellular non-membrane-bound organelle (GO id 0043232) and non-membrane-bound organelle (GO id 0043228) each with Observed vs. Expected ratios of 2.67. Conclusions: Specific genomic profiles exist in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and idiopathic partial epilepsy that differentiate from normal controls and from each other. These profiles may provide insight into the underlying process and may represent an additional tool for proper diagnosis and classification of pediatric epilepsy.

Debakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Mutations of ion channel genes are recognized as an important cause of defined inherited syndromes in epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias. We are reporting preliminary data on the following; (1) the prevalence of cardiac co-morbidities and (2) the frequency and spectrum of genetic variation in the five major genes associated with long QT syndrome in patients with idiopathic epilepsies (IE). Methods: 153 patients with IE were systematically recruited and detailed phenotypic data regarding epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias were collected. DNA samples were analyzed by sequencing across five major LQT genes (SCN5A, KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2). Results: Routine ECG was performed in 41/153 individuals. The study was abnormal in 13/41 (32%) subjects. 9/41 (22%) patients had both an abnormal ECG and a medical history positive for syncope, cardiac palpitations or skipped beats. 2/153 (4%) patients were lost due to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) within one year of follow-up. Interim DNA sequence analysis of the five major LQT genes in the IE population showed that 27% of all the LQT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were exon bound variants of which 45% was represented by protein altering/non-synonymous SNPs (NS-SNPs). NS-SNPs were most commonly found in the SCN5A (33%) and KCNH2 (43%) genes. SCN5A and KCNH2 NS-SNPs were also the most frequent genetic variants found in patients with dual phenotype of cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy. Conclusions: The prevalence of inter-ictal cardiac arrhythmias in our cohort of idiopathic epilepsy patients was similar to the prevalence of ictal arrhythmias cited in the literature [(39%) by Nei et al.Epilepsia.2004;45(4):338?345, and (35%) by Opherk et al. Epilepsy Res.2002;52(2):117?27]. The presence of relatively frequent non-synonymous coding variants in the SCN5A and KCNH2 genes in IE patients with a cardiac phenotype suggests their involvement in the comorbid dual clinical phenotype of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.

We present a young boy with early-onset infantile spasms, severe encephalopathy, tetralogy of Fallot, and bilateral cataract, in whom a deletion at Xp22 comprising the Nance Horan Syndrome (NHS) gene and CDKL5 gene was detected by array-CGH. Methods: Brain MRI, video EEG, metabolic and infectious work-up, karyotype, subtelomeric screening, and array-CGH were carried out in the proband. Results: The boy was diagnosed shortly after birth with a Tetralogy of Fallot, mild facial dysmorphism, extreme hypotonia, and bilateral microphthalmia with microcornea and congenital nucleocortical cataract. At age 7 weeks he developed myoclonic seizures, occurring most frequently post-prandial or during drowsiness. EEGs during wakefulness and sleep were normal. At age 4 months, the seizure pattern was consistent with infantile spasms, but no hypsarrhythmia was seen on EEG. At age 5 months, he developed tonic spasms, sometimes preceded by crying or accompanied by laughter or oral automatisms. A video EEG at age 6 months showed multiple myoclonic jerks without EEG correlate, as well as several tonic spasms characterized by sudden onset low voltage rhythmic diffuse 15 Hz activity followed by generalized slowing. No typical epileptiform activity was seen. Seizures were resistant to treatment with valproic acid, vigabatrine, topiramate, phenobarbital and levetiracetam. At age 10 months, he is severely retarded with no reaction to light stimuli, severe axial hypotonia, and absent midline organization. Additional investigations were normal, except for a de novo deletion of approximately 2.8 Mb at Xp22 including 16 genes of which the only known disease-associated genes are the NHS gene that causes the ophthalmologic abnormalities and the CDKL5 gene that is responsible for the severe epileptic encephalopathy. Conclusions: This is the first description of a male patient with a deletion of the NHS and CDKL5 genes, showing the involvement of CDKL5 in severe epileptic encephalopathy in males. The epilepsy phenotype was characterized by drug-resistant early-onset infantile spasms, tonic spasms and myoclonic jerks, without clear epileptiform EEG correlate.

Butman, 2 Sadat Shamin, and 2 William H. Theodore ( 1 G.H. Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 2 Clinical Epilepsy Section and Diagnostic Radiology Department, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ) Rationale: Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a form of idiopathic lateral temporal lobe epilepsy frequently caused by mutations in the leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene. Subjects with epilepsy in families with LGI1 mutations have not generally been found to have mesial temporal sclerosis or other structural brain abnormalities detected on MRI. However, in one previously reported family with an LGI1 mutation, a lateral temporal malformation was identified in 10 individuals. This result was important because it strongly supported the concept that LGI1 influences risk through a neurodevelopmental mechanism. We attempted to replicate these findings in other families. Methods: We studied 15 subjects (10 affected, 2 clinically unaffected mutation carriers, 3 unaffected non-carriers) from six ADPEAF families, each of which had a different LGI1 mutation. Subjects underwent high-resolution structural MRI on a Philips 3-tesla scanner, including MPRAGe, FLAIR, t1 and t2 sequences, and neuropsychological testing with a special emphasis on language measures. MRIs were analyzed by radiologists blinded to clinical and genetic data. Results: Subjects ranged in age from 20?81 years; nine were male and six female; and education ranged from 13?21 years. These factors were similar in affected and unaffected subjects. We found no evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis, malformations of cortical development, or abnormal gyral patterns in any of the 15 subjects. One affected individual (age 63) had bilateral T2 increases, and two unaffected subjects, neither of whom carried a mutation, had incidental findings thought to be unrelated to epilepsy (a bifrontal white matter abnormality, and marginally lower right temporal neocortical volume). Verbal IQ scores were significantly lower in subjects with epilepsy than in those without epilepsy (ave. 108 vs. 124, p = 0.012). Among subjects without epilepsy, however, verbal IQ was similar in subjects who carried a mutation (ave. = 124) and those who did not (ave. = 125), suggesting that the difference in verbal IQ was more likely to be due to epilepsy or its treatment than to the mutation per se. In contrast, average scores for the oral word association test were lower both in subjects with epilepsy (94) and clinically unaffected mutation carriers (95) than in noncarriers (120) (p = 0.048). Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the previously reported association of LGI1 mutations with a structural brain abnormality detectable on high-resolution MRI. Although the number of subjects tested is small, findings from the oral word association test may reflect an impact of mutations on language function.

Kauffman, 2 Dolores Gonzalez Moron, 1 Damian Consalvo, and 1 Silvia Kochen ( 1 Centro de Epilepsia, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina ; and 2 Neurology Residency, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Previous studies have examined the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the promoter region of Interleukin 1b gene (IL1b ?511T) on Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and Febrile Seizures (FS) susceptibility, but they have been inconclusive. The aims of the present study were to define the role of this polymorphism on TLE and FS susceptibility and to obtain more precise estimates of the risk associated with this genetic variant. Methods: Published studies up to Febuary 2006 of TLE, FS and IL1b ?511T SNP were identified by searches of PubMed, Biosis, Web of Science and Embase databases. Meta-analysis of TLE and FS case-control data were performed to assess the association of IL1b ?511T SNP with TLE, TLE with Hippocampal Sclerosis (TLEHS) and FS. Pooled Odds Ratios were estimated by means of a genetic-model free approach. Quality of Studies included was assessed by a score. Publication Bias was investigated by Egger and Begg tests. Results: A total of 12 studies were included where 7 examined the association with TLE (with a total of 1798 subjects) and 5 examined the association with FS (with a total of 1299 subjects). The data analyzed by the genetic model-free approach indicated that the best model of inheritance is recessive. This model for allele T produced significant results in the TLE sample [fixed effects odds ratio 1.30 (1.01?1.69)] and in the TLEHS sample [fixed effects odds ratio 1.69 (1.26?2.27)] (Figure below), whereas for FS the results were non-significant [fixed effects odds ratio 1.33 (0.95?1.84)]. There was not evidence of Publication bias (Egger and Begg tests non-significant for TLE, TLEHS and FS samples). Quality was heterogeneous between studies. Conclusions: Overall, these findings support a role for IL1b ?511T gene variant in TLE under a recessive mode of inheritance. Further explorations of the involvement of the IL1b gene in the susceptibility to FS, with a greater number of studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to fully establish the role of the IL1b gene in this condition.

In epilepsy, prolonged antiepileptic drugs induce hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) TT type, which induce cerebrovascular disease and congenital fetal abnormalities such as neural tube defects. Because folic acid decreases homocysteine level, folic acid is useful treatment in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.We studied to assess factors that have affects on the decrease of homocysteine levels in epilepsy patients, especially according to single nucleotide polymorphisms. Methods: We prospectively included 75 epilepsy patients admitted at Pundang CHA Hospital between 2002 and 2005. All patients treated with antiepileptic drugs during one year and examined homocysteine levels at two times: initial and last time (one year later). When hyperhomocysteinema (homocysitne > 12?mol/L) was found at initial time, patients were supplemented with daily 400?g folic acid for one year. All patients were divided into two groups; increase group (IG) and decrease group (DG) according to the change of homocysteine levels between initial and last time. Also, all patients examined various polymorphisms, such as MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, methionine synthase A2756G, and thymidylate synthase gene polymorphisms. Results: Among 75 patients, IG was 31 patients and DG was 44 patients. Decrease of homocysteine levels during one year was observed in young age, initial high level of homocysteine, use of folic acid, presence of family history, and semiology of complex partial seizure. There were no significant differences of homocysteine levels according to polymorphisms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that folic acid can cheaply decrease homocysteine levels in epilepsy patients with hyperhomocysteinemia. We recommend administration of folic acid in old epilepsy patients with generalized and symptomatic seizures since homocyteine level did not increase in the young age patients with complex partial seizure and family history. 1 Patrick Kwan, 2 Virginia Wong, 3 Ping W. Ng, 4 Colin H.T. Lui, 5 Ngai C. Sin, 1 Andrew C.F. Hui, 1 Lawrence K.S.

There is wide ethnic variation in the genotype frequencies of this SNP. We investigated whether the association might be observed in ethnic Chinese. Methods: ABCB1 3435 was genotyped in 518 Chinese patients with epilepsy, classified as drug resistant in 221 and drug responsive in 279, and 179 control subjects without epilepsy. Phenotypic definitions were similar to previous studies in Caucasian subjects. Drug resistance was defined as at least 1 seizure per month despite treatment with 2 or more antiepileptic drugs, and drug responsive as seizure free for at least 1 year on treatment. Genotype was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Results: As compared with patients with drug responsive epilepsy, patients with drug resistant epilepsy were more likely to have the TT genotype at ABCB1 3435 than CT or CC genotypes (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 ? 4.1, p = 0.004). The frequency of CC genotype was similar between patients with drug resistant and drug responsive epilepsy. There was no difference in genotype frequencies between the control subjects and the two patient groups. Conclusions: In Chinese patients with epilepsy, ABCB1 3435TT was found to be associated with drug resistance. The results contradict those reported in Caucasian subjects, and highlight the complexity of the potential role of ABCB1 3435 SNP in the pathogenesis of drug resistant epilepsy.

Bazan ( 1 LSU Neuroscience Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA ) Rationale: Experimentally induced epileptogenesis elicits profound changes in early response gene (ERG) expression in the mammalian brain. In these studies we analyzed early (0?6 hr), medium (1?7 da) and long term (2?8 wk) changes in the DNA-binding of transcription factors (TFs) AP1, AP2, Egr1, HIF-1, STAT1, NF-kB, NFIL-6, SP1 and TFIID to target DNA sequences in adult rat hippocampus after a single kainic acid (KA) injection. These TFs are enriched in the immediate promoters of the cFOS and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) ERGs. Methods: To trigger epileptogenesis, male albino Wistar rats were injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg KA using saline as a vehicle. At indicated time points (0, 1, 3, 6 hr; 1, 3, 7 da and 2, 4, 8 wk) rats were sacrificed and hippocampal and cortical cellular and nuclear proteins and total RNA were co-isolated from the same samples. TF-DNA binding was studied using gel shift and super-shift assay; RNA message levels were determined using DNA array analysis, RT-PCR and Northern blots. cFOS and COX-2 protein levels were quantified using Western immunochemistry. Results: Of the TFs examined, AP1, HIF-1, NF-kB and STAT1 binding were found to display oscillatory DNA binding profiles over the short, medium and long term. AP1-DNA binding kinetics strongly correlated with COX-2 gene activation over the short term while NF-kB-DNA binding paralleled COX-2 gene expression at longer time points. Sustained increases in TFIID-DNA binding suggested prolonged de novo induction of transcription from TATA-containing rat hippocampal genes. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that induction of the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic TFs AP1, HIF-1, NF-kB and STAT1, and their binding to specific target DNAs in ERG promoters, drives inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression in a phasic fashion. These data also support the notion of a global re-programming of hippocampal gene expression patterns long after a single KA-induced triggering of epileptogenic events.

An Italian family from Sardinia with sleep-related seizures with prominent fear and wandering is presented. Methods: Clinical information, EEG studies and blood samples were obtained. A genome-wide linkage analysis was performed, followed by electrophysiological studies of transfected HEK293 cells expressing either the newly identified nAChR alpha2 mutant subunit or the wild type receptor. Expression pattern of the genes coding for the alpha2 and 4, and beta2 nAChRs in areas of autoptic human brain was also performed. Results: Ten family members had clusters of seizures during sleep. Mean age at seizure onset was 10 years. The proband had since 6 years of age, clusters of sleep-related brief episodes with awakening, vocalization, fearful expression and movements of the tongue. The remaining individuals had nocturnal clusters of similar episodes including complex motor behaviors such as walking outside the room. The genome-wide linkage analysis showed a locus on chromosome 8p12.3?8q12.3, and a heterozygous missense mutation in the nAChR alpha2 subunit gene (CHRNA2) was detected in all 10 affected individuals. Whole-cell recordings of transfected HEK293 cells showed that the CHRNA2 mutation markedly increased the receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine. The expression pattern of alpha2 mRNA in autoptic human brain exhibited the highest level in the thalamus, but a diffuse expression was detected in the investigated samples. beta2 and alpha4 mRNA were uniformly distributed throughout the samples. Conclusions: CHRNA2 is the third nAChRs gene to be associated with familial sleep-related epilepsies. CHRNA2 mutation causes a complex ictal behavior with prominent fear and wandering. The alpha2 subunit showed the highest expression in the thalamus, hence confirming that mutations in nAChRs genes are involved in the epileptogenesis related to sleep-arousal mechanisms.

Domingues, 1 Rafael B. Marchesini, 1 Neide F. Santos, 2 Eliane Kobayashi, 2 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: The association between temporal lobe epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) has been well established; as well as the use of hippocampal atrophy (HA) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an in vivo surrogate marker of MTS. One of the risk factors associated to MTS is childhood prolonged febrile seizures. We have described a type of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with evident familial recurrence associate with HA but low frequency of febrile seizures. Previous pedigree and complex segregation analyses provided evidence for the presence of a major gene predisposing to HA in familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (FMTLE). The objective of this study was to identify the region harboring the main gene associated with HA in FMTLE by a genome-wide linkage study. Methods: Genome-wide scan was performed using a total of 332 microsatellite markers at ?12cM intervals. An additional 14 markers were genotyped in the candidate region. Two-point and multipoint LOD scores were calculated with the LINKAGE computer package. We assumed an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Results: We identified linkage to chromosome 18p11.3?11.2, with a maximum LOD score of 3.60 at ?= 0.0 for the D18S976 marker in a single family (F-10) with 11 affected individuals with HA. Multipoint and haplotype analyses localized the locus within a 6 cM interval flanked by markers D18S976 and D18S452. No other significantly positive LOD score was detected for this family in the entire genome. Conclusions: This is the first conclusive evidence that HA may be caused by genetic factors, which can have major implications in the study of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MTS and its relationship with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Murai, 1 Ricardo Horiuchi, 2 Daniel Martins, 1 Cláudia Maurer-Morelli, 2 José Camillo Novello, 3 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Biochemical Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 3 Neurology Department, Unicamp, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common and severe type of partial epilepsy, representing ?50% of all adult epilepsy patients and frequently associated with pharmaco-resistance. The relationship between MTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is well established. However, the precise pathogenesis of HS and its relationship with MTLE is not completely clarified. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) is a powerful fractionation method for complex protein mixtures. In difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) based proteomics, the experimental and control samples are labeled with different fluorophores and are run in the same gel, thereby minimizing gel preparation variation. DIGE is one of the few techniques that is capable to perform quantitative proteomics, generating statistical data to differences in protein abundances. Methods: We analyzed the proteome of three hippocampus removed from patients with refratory MTLE who underwent epilepsy surgery. Results: 2DE-DIGE identified 2 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated proteins as determined by Student's T-test (p ≤ 0.01). The observed molecular weight of the spots ranged from 28 to 93 kDa. Conclusions: The identity of these spots will be elucidated by mass spectrometry in order to gain additional information in a global scale about the mechanism of epileptogenesis in MTLE.

Methods: This family was identified through a national French campaign for familial epilepsy. It spans 4 generations and consists of 51 members with 13 affected. The medical history of all members was obtained by personal information and by consulting the medical files of each affected member. All family members gave a written consent to participate and 26 DNA were available for genetic study. Results: Clinical study: All affected members presented FS with CAE in 5 members and TLE in one. All FS stopped before the age of 6 and they recurred less than 4 times. Patients presenting CAE had recorded absences and characteristic EEG with 3 Hz spike waves. FS were simple except in one patient who had a long lasting complex FS (45 minutes) that occurred at 8 months of age. He presented later pharmaco-resistant TLE. He had a left hippocampal sclerosis on brain MRI. All family members have a normal psychomotor development.Genetic study: The FS trait segregates as autosomal dominant trait. The genetic study allowed the exclusion of any linkage with reported loci for FS and FS plus (FS+), especially with the locus of GABRG2 gene on chromosome 5q reported in a family presenting FS+ and absences. A genome wide search with 380 markers allowed us to localize a new gene responsible for FS on 3p. We could not exclude another genomic segment with positive Lodscore (Z = 1.94 at ?= 0.00). All patients presenting further epilepsy (CAE and TLE) shared a common haplotype on this locus in addition to the FS haplotype on 3p. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the genetic heterogeneity of FS. Epilepsy in association with FS could result in this family from an interaction between at least 2 genes: the gene on 3p with a modifier gene.

Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN ; and 3 Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Valid screening methods to identify people with a history of seizures or epilepsy are crucial for epidemiologic studies. They are also essential to identify affected family members in genetic studies. Screening relies on careful history-taking, but it is not clear what questions should be asked, or how accurately they identify affected individuals. Methods: We designed an 8-question screening interview to identify people with a history of seizures. The first question asks, ?Have you ever had, or has anyone ever told you you had, epilepsy or a seizure disorder?? If this question is answered ?no,? it is followed by a second question that asks, ?Have you ever had a seizure, convulsion, fit or spell under any circumstances?? This is followed by six additional questions that screen for symptoms possibly related to seizures (e.g., uncontrolled body movements, unexplained change in mental state, etc.). Subjects who screen positive are given a detailed diagnostic interview to confirm seizure occurrence and obtain additional clinical details. The interview was administered by telephone to 148 subjects with medical record documented incidence of unprovoked seizures from 1935?1994 while residing in Rochester, Minnesota, and 168 age- and sex-matched controls. Interviewers were blinded to case-control status. Results: Sensitivity was defined as the proportion who screened positive (?yes? or ?possible? to any screening question) among those with either epilepsy (n = 124) or an isolated unprovoked seizure (n = 24); specificity was defined as the proportion who screened negative among the controls. Sensitivity was 86% for epilepsy and 75% for isolated unprovoked seizures. Specificity was 92%. Sensitivity was significantly higher for subjects with incidence in 1955 or later than for those with earlier incidence (epilepsy: 89% vs. 71%, isolated unprovoked seizure: 82% vs 0%[0/2]). Among subjects with epilepsy who screened positive, 87% answered ?yes? or ?possible? to the first question (asking about epilepsy or a seizure disorder), 9% to the second question (asking about seizures under any circumstances), and 4% to another question. Among subjects with isolated unprovoked seizures who screened positive, 56% answered ?yes? or ?possible? to the first question and 44% to the second question. Conclusions: This screening instrument is highly effective (89% sensitivity) for identifying people with onset of epilepsy up to 50 years before interview. Subjects are more likely to be missed if they had onset of epilepsy even earlier, or had an isolated unprovoked seizure rather than epilepsy. Further analyses should address the relation of sensitivity to clinical epilepsy features, so that sensitivity can be improved by targeting new questions to particular subgroups.

We noted the presence or absence of developmental delay, type of EEG discharges (focal-mixed or generalized), and presence or absence of metabolic testing. Metabolic studies included: a) Plasma amino acids, biotinidase, lactate/pyruvate, acylcarnitines, ammonia levels, transferring isoelectric focusing, peroxisomal testing, and uric acid; b) CSF amino acids, glucose and lactate/pyruvate levels; and c) Urine organic acids, uric acid and creatine/guanidinoacetate levels. Results: 20% of our patients received some metabolic testing (85/429). Metabolic abnormalities were found in 48% of these patients (40/83), with 31% of these individuals having findings of mitochondrial dysfunction (27/85) with elevations in a) plasma alanine/proline/sarcosine (amino acids); b) plasma lactic acid; and c) urine lactic acid, 3-methyl-glutaconic acid and Kreb cycle intermediates (organic acids). Metabolic abnormalities were most common in those with focal discharges (70%; 21/30), when compared to multi-focal (53%; 8/15) and generalized (40%; 13/32) discharges. Secondary carnitine deficiency (26%, 22/85) and valproate related isolated elevations in plasma glycine (63%, 5/8) were also commonly seen. A single patient with a disorder of creatine metabolism was identified. Only 11% of the patients had CSF analysis done (10/85) with a 30% yield of abnormalities (3/10), including elevations in alanine, glutamate or glutamine. Of 9 patients with seizures but normal development, 6 had metabolic abnormalities identified (66%). Only 17 individuals received their first MRI at our institiution, with 86% (12/14) having structural abnormalities found, and one of these individuals, with a cortical heterotopia, having mitochondrial disease diagnosed. Conclusions: Metabolic abnormalities may represent a significant finding in individuals with epilepsy, especially in those with developmental delays, even despite findings of a focal structural brain abnormality. A systematic approach to the diagnoses of these individuals is needed. A consult with a metabolic specialist is encouraged in these patients if a diagnosis is not known. Disorders of mitochondrial metabolism should be placed high on the differential list. 1 Patricia A.O. Ribeiro, 2 Lourenço Sbragia, 3 Rovilson Gilioli, 4 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Pediatric Surgery, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; 3 CEMIB, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ; and 4 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, S?o Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Mutations in LGI1 gene were described in patients with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy and preliminary functional studies point to a possible involvement of LGI1 with migration and/or neuronal proliferation. However, the precise function LGI1 remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to determine the expression pattern of the Lgi1 gene in mice brain during development and in adult animals. Methods: Programmed mating was carried with Balb/c mice in order to obtain embryos of different ages. The brains of three animals at the following ages were removed: E15, E17, E18 days (E: embryo), P1, P7, P14, P28, P42 and P56 days (P: post-natal). Gene expression assays were carried out using real time PCR with the TaqMan? system. In addition we used an endogenous control (Gapdh gene) and all experiments were performed in duplicates. Results: Lgi1 gene expression was significantly low during the intra-uterine ages increasing gradually until P56 (adult animal). Samples from P28, P42 and P56 presented a seven fold increase in expression as compared to E15 samples. Conclusions: The pattern of Lgi1 gene expression that we observed suggests a predominantly inhibitory function during development of the central nervous system (low expression during embryonic stages). In addition, we may speculate that in more advanced ages, when neurons are already differentiated, its inhibitory function could be also essential, which can be suggested by the high expression in adult mouse brain.

Brodie ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Division of Cardiovascular  median age 34 years, range 14 ? 72 years) who had benefited (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency) from treatment with CBZ monotherapy were included in the analysis. Individuals who did not tolerate the drug and/or those who did not experience significant efficacy were specifically excluded. Common genetic variants in CBZ-related DMEs, including specific cytochrome P450s (CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP1A2) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1), were screened by conventional polymerase chain reaction ? restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) or direct sequencing. Associations were identified and characterised by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses, respectively. Results: All genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). No single clinical characteristic or genetic variant was sufficient to predict CBZ maintenance dose. However, a multiple logistic regression model incorporating patient age at time of optimal seizure control (OR = 1.03, 95%CI 1.00?1.07, p = 0.024), genotype of EPHX1 c.337T>C (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.22?0.87, p = 0.018) and genotype of EPHX1 c.416A>G (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.22?0.98, p = 0.044) demonstrated a significant association with maintenance dose (r2= 0.16; p = 0.009). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that a combination of age and genetic variants of the EPHX1 gene can be used to predict optimal maintenance doses of CBZ. Further investigations are required in an effort to strengthen the predictive value of this observation before its clinical utility can be realistically assessed.

Greenberg ( 1 Biostatistics, Division of Statistical Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY ; 2 Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 3 Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Rationale: In linkage genome scans of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) we found evidence for linkage on chromosome 5p with the juvenile absence phenotype. There are at least two candidate genes in this region: Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) and Programmed cell death 6 (PDCD6). Methods: We examined this region for association with Juvenile Absence Epilepsy (JAE) and Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE), genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around SDHA and PDCD6. We used case-control and family-based association methods to determine the degree of association. Results: We found that CAE is strongly associated with all SNPs tested in the PDCD6 gene (maximum chi-squared = 21.22, p < 0.0001 at rs4957014). JAE, in contrast, was not significantly associated with PDCD6 or any SNPs in the region studied. These results were confirmed in the family-based association analysis. The odds of having CAE if one carries at least one copy of the associated allele at the rs4957014 locus is 3.2 times the odds for an individual without a copy of the allele at this locus (95%CI: 1.91 ? 5.37). Conclusions: Our results suggest that not only does PDCD6 play a role in CAE susceptibility, but that different genes contribute to susceptibility in CAE and JAE; no association was seen in the JAE group. This implies that CAE and JAE cannot necessarily be treated as having the same genetic basis. Although there may be susceptibility genes common to the two (or more) syndromes, treating them as one genetic entity could mask the existence of genes for only one of the syndromes. It is especially interesting that this is at least the second apoptosis gene that appears to be related to a form of IGE. We wish to acknowledge our many collaborators who were critical to this study. Space limitations make it impossible to name them here.

Delgado-Escueta ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, UCLA  2 Neurology, National Autonomous University, Tegucigalpa, Honduras ; 3 University of Sonora, Hermosillo, Mexico ; 4 Neurology, National Instiutute of Neurology  5 Neuropsychiatrics Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; and 6 Pharmacology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ) Rationale: Because GABRB3 deficient mice shows absence like features including EEG characteristics and pharmacological response because atypical absences in Angelman syndrome correlates with deletions which includes GABRB3, and because Transmission Disequilibrium Test showed possible genetic association between GABRB3 and CAE, we screened for mutations in GABRB3 in families with CAE. We detected two heterozygous missense mutations (P11S, S15F) in the alternative signal peptide, exon1a of GABRB3 segregating with CAE affected members of three Hispanic families. The same missense mutations were not present in 34 other probands with CAE and 440 Hispanic healthy controls Here, we report on the functional consequences of these missense mutations. Methods: Expression constructs: We used mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-SPORT 6 into which was cloned exon1?9 of GABRB3 and pFP-N1 [GFP fusion vector]. We amplified the mutation containing Exon1a with designed primers with restriction enzyme sites, and replaced Exon1 in pCMV-SPORT6 with Exon1a with/without mutations. The construct which has the region from exon1a to exon9 without stop codon was amplified from the replaced vector. After digestion, each construct was cloned into pFP-N1. Immunoblot analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs and examined 48 hours post-transfection and homogenized. Protein samples were run on a 10% Tris-HCl gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. After blocking, the filter was processed through sequential incubations with the primary antibody for 1 h, and then with horseradish secondary antibody for 1h. Immunoreactive proteins on the filter were visualized using Typhoon software 9410. Results: Immunoblot studies revealed that both P11S and S15F mutations in exon1a decreased the expression of the protein level when compared with controls. The average densitometric image quantitation was 33%(±0.014) of control for P11S and 69%(±0.14) of control for S15F, normalized to actin density(n = 3). Conclusions: Our results indicate that both P11S and S15F mutations in exon1a decrease expression of protein levels and suggest less trafficking of the nascent peptide from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell membrane. GABRB3 is a main component of GABAR in reticular nucleus of thalamus and expressed transiently in other thalamic nuclei in the perinatal period, decreasing in adult. We speculate that the decreased expression of GABRB3 in developmental brain leads to absence seizures. 1 Simone S. Tsuneda, 1 Fabio R. Torres, 2 Maria A. Montenegro, 2 Marilisa Guerreiro, 2 Fernando Cendes, and 1 Iscia T. Lopes-Cendes ( 1 Medical Genetics, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil ; and 2 Neurology, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in FLN1 gene are responsible for bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH). We identified a novel mutation (1159G>C), in a family segregating BPNH. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which this mutation lead to abnormal FLN1 protein was unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of this new mutation. Methods: Total RNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples, from 2 BPNH patients (mother and daughter) and control individuals. RT-PCR was performed by standard techniques and the cDNA was amplified using specific primers spanning the region containing exon 6 and exon7. Amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T vector, gel-purified and subsequently sequenced, using SP6 and T7 primers. Results: Analysis of the cDNA amplicon demonstrated a different pattern of electrophoretic migration between patients and controls. The sequencing of these fragments showed that amplicons from individuals with BPNH kept the intronic sequence between exons 6 and 7. Conclusions: Our data clearly showed that the molecular mechanism of the mutation 1159G>C is the abolishment of the exon 6 donor splicing, resulting in an alternative stop codon and, possibly, in a truncated protein. Thus an aminoacid substitution, as suggested previously, is not the mechanism involved in the etiology of BPNH sydrome in the patients analysed. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 V. Udani, 2 R. Shukla, 1 P. Munot, 1 L. Iyer, 2 S. Prakash, 1 S. Pujar, and 2 G. Chandak ( 1 Child Neurology  and 2 Genome Research Group, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, India ) Rationale: Cohen syndrome (MIM 216550) is an autosomal recessive disorder with features of psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, joint laxity, progressive retinochoroidal dystrophy, myopia and neutropenia. Characteristic facial features include high-arched or wave-shaped eyelids, a short philtrum, thick hair, and prominent incisors. Clinically homogenous in the Finnish population, non-Finnish patients show considerable variability. Seizures have never been described in Cohen's syndrome. The genetic locus for Cohen syndrome was recently mapped to chromosome 8q and truncating mutations in the COH1 gene were identified. In Finnish patients a founder mutation, C1117fsI1124X has been consistently found while other mutations have been associated with the atypical non-Finnish Cohen's syndrome. One of us (VPU) observed several clinical features of Cohen's syndrome in Indian patients with cryptogenic epilepsy. A pilot study confirmed eight Cohen-like features in a group of children with cryptogenic epilepsy when compared with controls. This prompted us to study the COH1 gene in such patients. Methods: We systematically studied patients with cryptogenic epilepsy and a Cohen-like phenotype for all features of Cohen's syndrome and included only those with at least 5/8 clinical features that we had found to be significant in our previous study. We initially screened for all the reported common mutations and later sequenced all 62 exons of the COH1 gene in this cohort of 24 patients. We also collected DNA from age, sex and ethnically matched controls. Results: We found several novel mutations such as Y413X, A829T and G3407R in the COH1 gene in 8 of 24 patients (33%). Interestingly, we did not find any of the earlier reported mutations including the most common mutation, C1117fsI1142X. The commonest mutation Y413X was identified in 4 patients, of which one was a compound heterozygote with the G3407R mutation. These mutations were not observed in any of the 100 controls. The mutations were mostly observed in the heterozygous condition except in one patient who was homozygous for the G3407R mutation. We could not find any clinical differences in the patients with and without mutations. However the patients with mutated COH1 had a significantly higher number of Cohen's syndome features than those without the mutations. Conclusions: We conclude that novel COH1 mutations are strongly associated with Indian patients of cryptogenic epilepsy with a Cohen ? like phenotype. There is however a possibility of additional mutations in the non-coding regions of the COH1 gene or in other genes.Functional analysis will throw more light on the mechanisms by which these mutations may be causally related to the epilepsy which is a characteristic feature in these patients.

Marques-Dias ( 1 Neurophysiology Laboratory-Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 2 Biology, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; 3 LIM 21 ? Psychiatry, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ; and 4 Pediatrics, USP, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil ) Rationale: Angelman syndrome (AS) results from deletion (DEL), uniparental disomy,imprinting anomalies or UBE3A mutations. Patients determined by DEL have a severer phenotype. In 95% of AS patients caused by DEL,two main classes are found: Class I with breakpoints at BP1 (proximal) and BP3 (distal), and Class II with breakpoints at BP2 (proximal) and BP3 (distal).The remaining 5% have the distal breakpoint at BP4 and BP5.We formerly described that BP1-BP3 patients are more severely affected,on clinical grounds,than BP1-BP2 patients. The study of electroclinical data in these distinct groups of DEL patients has not been done. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the importance of breakpoint on the electroclinical phenotype in patients with DEL. Methods: The authors evaluated 18 DEL patients (6 were Class I; 10 were Class II and 2 were Class III and IV). Diagnosis was made by methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN-SNURF gene and by microsatellite profiling of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region. We characterized epilepsy by history obtained with a questionnaire including:occurrence of epilepsy;age of onset;seizure type;epilepsy aggravated by fever;severity of epilepsy determined by:daily seizures; disabling/injurious seizures;more than 3 seizure types;status epilepticus (SE) and;history of refractory epilepsy. These data were corroborated by medical records, personal contact with previous physicians, and video-EEG monitoring. Patients underwent a mean of 2.6 EEGs. Suggestive EEG patterns for AS were classified according to Boyd et al.and were studied as to morphology, duration, occurrence, frequency, amplitude and distribution. Results: Class I had more daily (p 0.0357) and disabling seizures (p 0.0350). They also presented a higher frequency of SE(p 0.0357). Both groups had similar rates of epilepsy aggravated by fever (p 0.5879); however, in Class I these events evolved to SE(p 0.0357). Polytherapy was more frequent in Class I (p 0.0350), associated with the refractoriness observed in this group.No statistical difference was observed as to age of onset, age of seizure control, seizure type and diversity of seizures presented by these patients. Background abnormalities, interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges were similar in both groups. Suggestive EEG patterns of AS were high in both groups. Occurrence of prolonged and frequent runs of these patterns did not show statistical differences. Conclusions: Epilepsy was more severe and refractory to treatment in patients with large deletions. Therefore, deletion is not a homogeneous group and breakpoint is predictive for epilepsy severity in AS, representing an important factor in parents' counseling. On the other hand, EEG patterns of AS seem to be reliable for diagnosis, despite the breakpoint.

Abramowicz ( 1 Pediatric Neurology, ULB-Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium ; 2 Medical Genetics, ULB-Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium ; 3 Pediatric Neurology, AZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium ; and 4 Pediatric Neurology, UCL-Saint Luc, Brussels, Belgium ) Rationale: Rare, mendelian forms of epilepsy amenable to positional cloning help understand the molecular mechanisms of epilepsy. Methods: Three female patients from two consanguinity loops in a large inbred Morroccan family were investigated for progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). After exclusion of known causes, linkage study and analysis of candidate genes were performed. Results: Epilepsy started between 18 and 24 months of age after normal psychomotor development. Seizure types were multifocal myoclonus affecting limbs and face and aggravated by movements, and febrile generalized tonic-clonic in one patient. EEG showed slow dysrythmia, multifocal epileptiform discharges without reproducible temporal relationship with myoclonus and occasional generalized epileptiform discharges. Photosensibility was present in one patient. Giant somatosensory evoked potentials were not found. Cerebral MR imaging and fundoscopy were normal. In 2 patients, seizures were refractory to anti-epileptic drugs. Evolution was unfavourable in both of them: one patient died from septic shock in the course of a corticosteroids trial, and the other one, now aged 9 years, showed progressive dysarthria, dementia and ataxia with lost independent walking at age 7. Epileptic seizures were controlled under lamotrigine and clonazepam in the third patient, now aged 16 years, who presented profound mental retardation and dysarthria without ataxia. GeneChip analysis of 11K SNPs showed a 15 Mb homozygous haplotype common to the 3 patients. Further analysis using microsatellite markers confirmed linkage of the disease to a 5 cM pericentromeric region of chromosome 7, with a maximum multipoint LOD of 4.2 at D7S663. In silico inspection showed the gene for a Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain homolog, KCTD7, close to D7S663 within the segment. KCTD7 contains a BTB/POZ-type domain and has strong homology with the T1 domain of the voltage-gated potassium channels. Direct sequencing of KCTD7 revealed a C to T transition creating a stop codon in exon 2, homozygous in patients and heterozygous in parents. Conclusions: PME in our patients was associated with a mutation of the KCTD7 gene encoding a putative potassium channel tetramerization domain, consistent with a defect of membrane repolarization.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the genomic alterations that occur in malignant cells, the immune system is increasingly appreciated as a critical axis that regulates the rise of neoplasms and the development of primary tumours and metastases. The interaction between inflammatory cell infiltrates and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment is complex, with inflammation playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes that act as key signalling hubs of the innate immune system. They respond to cellular stress and trauma by promoting activation of caspase-1, a protease that induces a pro-inflammatory cell death mode termed pyroptosis along with the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18. Here, we will briefly introduce inflammasome biology with a focus on the dual roles of inflammasome-produced cytokines in cancer development. Despite emerging insight that inflammasomes may promote and suppress cancer development according to the tumour stage and the tumour microenvironment, much remains to be uncovered. Further exploration of inflammasome biology in tumorigenesis should enable the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer patients.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Summary Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-systemic disorder. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is the biliary manifestation of the disease, often in association with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Hepatic manifestations of IgG4-RD are less well described within the literature. Aim To examine and present an overview of IgG4-RD with a focus on the biliary and hepatic manifestations. Methods An electronic search using Medline was performed. Search items included ?IgG4 multi-system disease, IgG4 associated cholangitis, IgG4 associated liver disease and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)?. Results IgG4-RD is characterised by an IgG4-positive lymphoplasmacytic tissue infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and an obliterative phlebitis. The HISORt criteria may be used to establish the diagnosis and incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach involving histology, radiology, serum IgG4 levels and response to steroid therapy. IgG4-SC is the commonest extrapancreatic manifestation of type-1 AIP, while the hepatic manifestations remain poorly defined. Important differential diagnoses include primary sclerosing cholangitis, secondary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. Current treatment regimens remain ill defined although steroid therapy is used first line unless contraindicated. Patients with relapsing disease or multifocal disease should be considered for azathioprine. Available data would also suggest a role for rituximab. Conclusions IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is a common manifestation of IgG4-related disease which requires a multi-disciplinary approach to establish the diagnosis. Differentiating IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis from other conditions, both benign and malignant, is challenging, but vital. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatic manifestations of IgG4-related disease continues to evolve.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Abstract Developmental and trauma-induced mechanism(s) that modify inflammation and immune responses in blood cells were recently found to be regulated by acetylcholine. Here, we report corresponding blood cell-specific changes in acetylcholinesterase splice variants. Plasmon resonance and flow cytometry using acetylcholinesterase variant-specific antibody probes, revealed a progressive increase in myeloid cell fractions expressing the apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase-S variant from newborns to adult controls and post-delivery mothers. Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R. Peripheral stimuli-induced modulations in acetylcholine regulation may hence reflect blood cell lineage-dependent acetylcholinesterase splice variations.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.
