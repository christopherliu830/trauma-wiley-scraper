AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - A 27-year-old woman presented with a 5?mm papule on her cheek. She had no family history or stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Biopsy showed a diffuse dermal proliferation of spindle cells embedded in a slightly myxomatous stroma which entrapped adnexae. They displayed cytologic atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei and bizarre multinucleated giant cells. No mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed the spindle cells to be S-100 and collagen IV positive, but MART-1 negative. The differential diagnosis included desmoplastic melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and atypical neurofibroma. Both atypical neurofibroma and desmoplastic melanoma are S-100 positive, show variable atypia and can have bizarre multinucleated giant cells. However, the lack of epidermal melanocytic hyperplasia, mitosis and the positive collagen type IV staining, favor nerve sheath differentiation. In neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas may undergo malignant degeneration resulting in MPNST. Whether atypical neurofibroma represents a transitional stage is unknown. Mitotic activity and necrosis strongly suggest MPNST. The biologic potential of cutaneous atypical neurofibroma has not been well studied, but they appear to behave in a benign fashion. This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenge of atypia in neurofibromas and highlights the need for further studies on the behavior of these rare variants.

AB  - Metastasis to the breast from extramammary neoplasms is rare. Such metastatic neoplasms can mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma clinically and histologically, presenting a diagnostic challenge. A 50-year-old woman with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma in clinical remission presented with rapid onset unilateral breast swelling with warmth and erythema. Based upon the clinical presentation, an underlying breast carcinoma was suspected. A punch biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive involvement of the dermal lymphatics. The clinical and histologic differential diagnosis included inflammatory carcinoma secondary to a primary breast carcinoma vs. metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast. To resolve this question, immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors and CDX-2 were performed. CDX-2 is an intestinal homeobox gene that is expressed in intestinal epithelium and tumors with intestinal differentiation including esophageal adenocarcinoma. CDX-2 expression has not been reported in breast carcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CDX-2 but negative for both steroid receptors. The diagnosis of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast was confirmed. This case emphasizes the importance of confirming the tumor lineage in inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. CDX-2 can be a useful tool in establishing a gastrointestinal origin of cutaneous metastases.

AB  - The glomus coccygeum is a vestigial structure related to the canals of Sucquet-Hoyer, an arteriovenous anastomosis surrounded by glomus cells derived from modified smooth muscle and involved in thermoregulation. It is an incidental finding in specimens from the sacral area and may represent a diagnostic challenge to the unaware observer. We present a case of a glomus coccygeum, presenting as a 1.5?mm structure adjacent to a typical pilonidal cyst excised from a 7-month-old boy, that was the subject of a second opinion consultation. The lesion showed small to medium sized clusters of predominantly epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, intercellular borders and plump, round nuclei with fine chromatin. These cells were closely associated with small vascular channels and nerves. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the epithelioid cells expressed vimentin, muscle-specific actin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein, were weakly positive for smooth muscle actin, and negative for desmin, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The endothelial cells of the vascular channels were antibody CD31 positive. Recognition of the histological features of glomus coccygeum is important to avoid confusion with glomus tumor and neural or smooth muscle neoplasms in the sacral area.

AB  - Background: Laminin-5 is a basement membrane constituent that functions as an anchoring filament to integrin-derived hemidesmosomes, and has been detected at the invasive front (tumor-stromal interface) in many types of carcinomas. Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - The patient is an eight-year-old white male with a prior history of a small bowel transplant secondary to gastroschisis and a history of chronic rejection. He was admitted to the hospital to rule out rejection of his second small bowel transplant. During the admission he developed painful erythematous plaques with necrosis and hemorrhagic bullae on his left knee and left neck. Dermatology was consulted and biopsies and tissue cultures were obtained. On H&E there were multiple thick walled non-septate hyphae and the GMS stain showed right angle irregular branching hyphae with an affinity for blood vessels. A further work-up for disseminated disease was negative. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous mucormycosis. The patient underwent extensive surgical debridement and was started on Ambisone and treated for six months with resolution. Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic deep fungal infection. It is the most acute and fatal of all fungal infections. There are multiple associated conditions including immunosuppression. This disease can be controlled with early diagnosis and a combination treatment plan. There are only a few reported cases in the pediatric population.

AB  - Distinguishing among the various melanocytic proliferations remains one of the biggest challenges in dermatopathology. New insights into tumor proliferation may lead to the discovery of helpful immunohistochemical markers. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase which is a core component of the PI3K signalling pathway. Activation of Akt is seen in many human cancers. This study evaluated Akt activation (phospho-Akt) by immunohistochemistry on 18 intradermal nevi, 8 dysplastic nevi, 9 Spitz nevi, and 27 melanomas. Immunostaining was graded 0 (no staining), 1 (slightly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (highly positive). The mean immunostaining scores were as follows: intradermal nevi 1.16, dysplastic nevi 1.25, Spitz nevi 2.11, and melanomas 2.15. Spitz nevi exhibited significant pAkt immunoreactivity. Increased pAkt immunoreactivity is seen in melanomas and Spitz nevi as compared to benign intradermal nevi and dysplastic nevi.

AB  - Paecilomyces, a hyalohyphomycosis, is an uncommon cause of cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Most cases reported have occurred in patients with impaired host defenses or following a surgical procedure, and have proven highly resistant to anti fungal therapies. A 60-year-old man presented with scattered non-healing verrucous lesions as well as ulcers and excoriations on the upper extremities and trunk. The lesion had begun shortly after the patient was scratched by prickly okra. The patient had no underlying health problems and he was on no medication. Histology revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, with papillomatosis with intraepidermal micro-abscess formation. Within the dermis there was a mixed acute and chronic granulomatous infiltrate. With GMS stain numerous pleomorphic yeast forms and pseudohyphael forms were seen. Cultures confirmed Paecilomyces species. The patient was treated with Voriconazole with complete resolution of his lesion. Paecilomyces is an emerging fungal pathogen, which in our immune competent patient manifest as widespread cutaneous disease.

AB  - Porokeratosis is an uncommon cause of clinical change in pigmented lesions. We report two cases of so-called ?collision? lesions, in which the cause of clinical change in melanocytic nevi was porokeratosis. One biopsy was submitted concurrently with a biopsy from another anatomic site, which was a superficial pattern basal cell carcinoma. Both the melanocytic nevus and the basal cell carcinoma contained coronoid lamellae, focal diminution of the granular layer and subjacent dyskeratotic keratinocytes, consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). The melanocytic nevus, from the lower back, was a broad compound melanocytic nevus, associated with elongated, pigmented rete (lentiginous) and small melanocytes in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis (superficial congenital pattern). There was no evidence of external irritation. The second case showed a similar coronoid lamella, focal diminution of the granular layer and dyskeratotic keratinocytes. There was additional parakeratosis away from the parakeratotic column and a lichenoid host response, suggesting external irritation.

AB  - The histopathological changes of herpes simplex, zoster and varicella are considered to be indistinguishable from one another. The clinical setting with adjunctive studies generally clarifies the diagnosis. Vesicular lesions in all 3 conditions can involve epidermal and adnexal epithelium with characteristic cytopathic features. We describe 3 patients with non-vesicular eruptions on the head and neck whose biopsies revealed exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes. All three patients developed typical herpes zoster within days of the biopsy. There is compelling scientific evidence in the literature indicating that, in herpes zoster, the virus is transported from dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia via myelinated nerves to the skin. These terminate at the isthmus of hair follicles and primary infection of follicular and sebaceous epithelium occurs. Secondary spread of infection to the epidermis follows. In contrast, data pertaining to recurrent herpes simplex indicates that axonal transport of the virus from sensory ganglia to the skin is directed primarily to the epidermis, via terminal non-myelinated nerve twigs. The clinical evolution of our 3 cases and scientific data in the literature indicate that exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes, in the setting of a non-vesicular eruption, represents early herpes zoster.

AB  - A 27-day-old female neonate presented with a bleeding growth on the abdomen. The clinical differential diagnosis included pyogenic granuloma and hemangioma. Histology shows an ulcerated, spindled and round cell tumor in the dermis with ill-defined margins that invade the subcutaneous fat. The tumor exhibits a biphasic growth pattern with plump spindled cells arranged in fascicles, as well as epithelioid cells arranged in sheets. Some cells show plasmacytoid features. The tumor cells have pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. Single cell necrosis and mitotic activity is prominent. Myxoid and chondroid stromal changes are focally seen. Immunohistochemical stains show strong positivity for S100 protein, calponin, and, focally, AE1/AE3. Portions of the both the spindled and epithelioid cell components show staining with EMA. Desmin and MSA stains were negative. The tumor does not stain for CD 31, CD 30, CD 45, CD 20, CD 34, CK 20, MART-1, or HMB45. These histologic features are consistent with a cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma. Cutaneous myoepitheliomas are rare tumors of myoepithelial cells which surround eccrine and apocrine glands. While most myoepitheliomas are benign, tumors with high mitotic activity may have a risk for recurrence or metastasis. This is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient described with myoepithelial carcinoma.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

AB  - Nonmyeloablative hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recent alternative to myeloablative HSCT in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as a complication of both types of HSCT. Recently the clinical phenomenon of late-onset (>100 days) acute GVHD has been described following nonablative HSCT. However, there has been no relevant description of the histologic features of GVHD in this setting. We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of 28 cases of acute and chronic GVHD following nonablative HSCT at out institution between 2000 and 2003. Our results support the observation of late onset acute GVHD in nonablative HSCT. The mean onset of acute GVHD was 109.8 days (range 8?410 days). Furthermore, we identified a subset of patients (8/23) in the acute GVHD group with composite histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD. This subset was more likely to develop chronic GVHD as compared to patients with only classic acute GVHD, 87.5% versus 25%, respectively (p?<?0.01). Composite histologic features could serve a a predictor of an increased risk for the development of chronic GVHD. These patients may potentially benefit from more aggressive treatment than patients with histologic features of solely acute GVHD.

AB  - Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma typically presents as solitary, well-circumscribed, firm plaques or nodules. We describe a case of cutaneous leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag on the thigh of a 50-year-old male. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a dome-shaped tumor with interlacing fascicles of smooth muscle with pleomorphism, cellular atypia and multiple mitoses. Malignant tumors may rarely present as a skin tag, and these are most frequently basal cell carcinomas. We are unaware of previously reported leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag. This case suggests that solitary, wide-based, papilloma-like lesions or skin tags should be submitted for histologic examination to rule out malignancy.

AB  - The Src-family tyrosine kinases are modulators of growth-regulatory signals within keratinocytes. The relationship between Src kinases and epidermal neoplasia is unexplored in human biopsies. Keratinocytes express 3 Src kinases: Src, Fyn, Yes. Activation of these kinases corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylation? near the active site, tyrosine 416 of human Src. This study compared the levels of total Src-kinase protein and activated Src kinases within a spectrum of lesions ranging from actinic keratoses (AKs) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An antibody that recognizes an epitope in Src, Fyn, and Yes revealed the total level of Src kinase protein; an antibody specific for the phosphoryated active site tyrosine determined the level of Src kinase activation. The level of Src-kinase expression and activated Src kinases was evaluated in paraffin imbedded sections of AKs, SCC in-situ (SCIS), and SCC containing adjacent unremarkable epidermis. The total level of Src kinase protein in lesions was similar to unremarkable epidermis. The level of Src kinase activation was elevated within approximately one-third of AKs and SCIS, but was increased in over 80% of SCCs. These results demonstrate Src kinases are activated in epidermal neoplasia, and that increased Src kinase activity is associated with the transition from SCIS to SCC.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.
