AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - We report a 48-year-old male who presented with ulcerated plaques and nodules of the lower extremities. Skin biopsies revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate involving the dermis and the subcutis in a lobular and septal pattern. No overt cytological atypia was present. Notably, several features resembling lupus erythematosus were present, including vacuolar interface change and abundant dermal mucin deposition. The patient developed pulmonary nodules, and a lung biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate without overt atypia. The cutaneous and pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates showed similar immunohistochemical profiles: CD3+CD4?CD8+/?CD56+. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma gene with similar migration patterns were identified from both locations. The patient developed fatal hemophagocytic syndrome, involving liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This case is amongst rare reports of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) with systemic involvement.

AB  - Abstract: The splenic marginal zone of adult humans contains B cells, of which most express CD27, an antigen only recently identified as a marker for somatically mutated memory B cells. We investigated whether and to which extent the developing marginal zone in infants and children is populated by either memory (CD27+) or naive (CD27?) B cells. Frozen sections of 32 spleens of infants and children ranging in age from 6 days to 15 years and 6 adult spleens were investigated. The expression of CD27 in combination with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD21, IgM, IgD and ASM-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The marginal zone was already present at 4 months after birth but CD21 expression was observed first after 2 years. CD27-positive marginal zone B cells were observed firstly 2 years after birth and increased in number to adult levels at the age of 5 years. We demonstrated that the MZ of infants and young children is populated by naive B cells, which are replaced by memory B cells in a time frame of 2 to 5 years. Before the age of 2 years, although present, memory B cells appear to be unable to colonize the marginal zone. Because of the absence of memory B cells in the marginal zone, the immune system of a child is not capable to initiate a rapid secondary humoral immune response comparable to the adult immune response.

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - A 38-year-old woman presented with nodules on the face, scalp, ears, hands and elbows. She also developed fevers, chills, fatigue, weakness, myalgia, joint pain, nausea and weight loss of 40 pounds in eight months. Histology revealed large histiocytes with smooth eosinophilic ground glass cytoplasm, consistent with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. She was treated with methotrexate 25?mg IM per week and prednisone 10?mg PO QD, with relief of her symptoms and improvement in her skin. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare histiocytic systemic disease, with facial and hand skin nodules and symmetric arthritis. Pathognomonic signs include ?coral beads? and vermicular erythematous papules bordering nostrils. The histologic hallmark for this disease is a nodular infiltrate of histiocytic cells, including multinucleated giant cells containing an eosinophilic, ground glass cytoplasm. Immunohistiochemistry is positive for CD68 and CD3, and negative for B cell markers as well as Langerhans cell markers. Approximately twenty percent of patients with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis have concurrent malignancy, but there is no one predominant type. The disease usually waxes and wanes for many years, with 30% of patients developing arthritis mutilans. It often regresses approximately seven years after its first appearance.

AB  - A 65 year-old, well-appearing and asymptomatic man presented with a small non-healing ulcer on the right palm present for 6 weeks. He reported a 15 year history of hand and foot ?eczema? treated with topical steroids. Six months earlier his right 4th toe had been amputated for ?infection?, but additional information was not immediately forthcoming. Punch biopsy from the palm demonstrated superficial ulceration, dermal eosinophils and possible cytoplasmic inclusions within keratinocytes, leading to suspicion of parapox infection. Over the ensuing two months his condition deteriorated markedly, and he developed multiple fungated and ulcerated cutaneous nodules. Incisional biopsy of the nodule on the right palm revealed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, and a perivascular infiltrate of medium to large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei and mitoses. These atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, but were negative for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, TIA-1 and EBER in-situ hybridization. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement revealed a clonal population. Retrospective analysis of the amputated toe demonstrated similar features. He declined conventional treatment, and has been reluctant to pursue follow-up. Our case highlights the fulminant course and dense mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with eosinophils often present in peripheral T-cell lymphoma that may complicate diagnosis.

AB  - A 25-year-old man presented with a large, undermined, violaceous ulcer with hemorrhagic crust on his nose for 1 year. It began as a ?pimple?. He had similar lesions on his scalp, abdomen and groin. His sister has Crohn?s and his mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Screening blood tests and CT scans revealed no underlying disease. The clinical impression was pyoderma gangrenosum. Biopsies from the nose and abdomen revealed dense superficial and mid-dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate composed of enlarged, atypical lymphocytes with focal epidermotropism and epidermal necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed the infiltrate was primarily CD3 positive T-cells without deficiency of CD4, CD7 or CD8. CD30, TIA and Granzyme were not detected. A T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected. Flow cytometry was negative. This is a case of pyoderma gangrenosum-like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of cutaneous lymphoma that clinically resembles PG, but histologically and immunohistochemically is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although rare, PG-like ulcers should be added to the list of atypical manifestations of CTCL. This case highlights the need to evaluate all atypical lymphocytic infiltrates thoroughly with immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangement. The diagnosis must be made with caution as proliferative clones of lymphocytes can be found in true PG.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive survey is provided on the application of a random positioning machine (RPM) for studies on gravitational effects on mammalian cells. The RPM is suitable to simulate microgravity conditions and allows performing a high number of on-ground experiments wherein mammalian cells are exposed to reduced gravity. Most of these experiments have been performed either to prove or extend observations made during spaceflights or to develop and prepare new spaceflight experiments. They did not only bring a tremendous number of observations, but they helped to elucidate three dominant cellular pathways that are affected by weightlessness. The apoptotic, the immune-activating and the bone differentiation pathways are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate response and outcome of dogs with multicentric lymphoma treated with single-agent vinblastine as a second rescue. METHODS Medical records from 39 client-owned dogs receiving vinblastine rescue treatment (having relapsed on or following completion of UW-Madison and CCNU/L-asparaginase protocols), between 2005 and 2014, were reviewed for information regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, drug dosage, number of treatments, side effects, response and outcome. RESULTS The median starting dose of vinblastine was 2·6 mg/m2 (1·7 to 2·8 mg/m2), administered weekly until disease progression. Of the 39 dogs treated, 3 dogs (7·7%) achieved a complete remission, 7 dogs (17·9%) achieved a partial response, 18 dogs (46·2%) maintained stable disease and 11 (28·2%) had progressive disease. Ten dogs (25·6%) developed a grade III or IV neutropenia, and 4 dogs (10·3%) developed grade III or IV thrombocytopenia (one dog in both categories). After starting vinblastine, the median progression-free survival was 29·5 days (0 to 77 days) and overall median survival time was 46 days (4 to 250 days). Duration of first remission was identified as a positive predictor of outcome. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Single-agent vinblastine is well tolerated in dogs with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Responses were incomplete and short-lasting.

AB  - Summary Background Staphylococcus aureus has important implications for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). In some patients S. aureus can be eradicated from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, while in others bacterial colonization is persistent. Potential mechanisms and features of these two distinct groups of patients are not known. Objective Accordingly, we studied relationships between the ability to eliminate S. aureus during an anti-inflammatory treatment and selected clinical and immunological features. Methods Quantitative assessment of S. aureus on the skin, in nasal vestibule and throat, serum IgE levels, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, lymphocyte proliferation and phagocyte oxidative burst were determined during the exacerbation and after 4 and 12 weeks of the treatment using topical steroid and oral antihistamine in 34 patients with AD. Results S. aureus was found on the skin of all 34 patients during exacerbation. Disease severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) correlated with the density of bacteria. Treatment with oral antihistamine and topical steroid resulted in a significant alleviation of symptoms, which correlated with the elimination of S. aureus from the skin in 70% of patients. In the remaining 30% of patients, dense (more than 1010/cm2) S. aureus skin colonization, persisted despite the treatment. Patients with persistent S. aureus presented with higher serum IgE levels, lower lymphocyte proliferation in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B, phytohaemagluttinin and anti-CD3. Persistence of S. aureus was more common in men. Conclusions Patients with AD differ in the ability to clear S. aureus from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, which appears to be related to the abnormalities in immunological parameters. Local antibiotic therapy should be considered only in patients with persistent S. aureus colonization.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

AB  - Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alters both specific and nonspecific immune functions, resulting in immunosuppression. Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to improve the adaptive responses of the gut after surgery. The following study investigates the effects of adding short-chain fatty acids to TPN on the immune system after an 80% small bowel resection. Methods: Rats (237 ± 3 g) were infused with either TPN (n = 25) or TPN supplemented with short-chain fatty acids (n = 26) for 3 or 7 days. Hematologic analysis was performed on peripheral blood and splenocytes were isolated to characterize cell phenotypes, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and to estimate proliferative response. Results: The relative percent of T (CD3+) cells increased (p <.05) and the relative percent of macrophages decreased (p <.001, n = 13) in the spleens of the 3-day TPN-fed rats. By day 7, these differences disappeared. The natural killer cells from rats that were supplemented with short-chain fatty acids had higher (p <.0001) cytotoxic activity than the TPN groups at day 3. Mitogenic response did not differ between groups but were depressed compared with sham-treated rats. By day 7, rats on standard TPN had larger (p <.0001) spleens than all other groups. This group also had a higher total white blood cell count because of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (p <.02). Conclusion: Short-chain fatty acids improve components of nonspecific immune responses and may be beneficial in reducing certain aspects of TPNassociated immunosuppression after major surgery.
