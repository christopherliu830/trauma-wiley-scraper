AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.
