AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Summary A minority of injecting drug users, termed exposed uninfected, are resistant to hepatitis C (HCV) infection despite repeated low-dose exposures. We identify for the first time a cohort of blood recipients who remained uninfected despite large-dose exposure to HCV-contaminated blood and characterize immune factors that may confer protection. Of 1340 blood recipients from the English Look Back database who were transfused HCV-contaminated blood, we identified 8 who remained uninfected. In these 8 exposed uninfecteds, we characterized their natural killer (NK) cell populations and HCV-specific T-cell responses. Findings were compared with 10 spontaneous resolvers of HCV infection, 10 patients with chronic HCV infection and 10 healthy controls. Exposed uninfecteds had significantly greater numbers of NK cells with the activating receptor NKp30+ on CD56bright and CD56dim subsets compared with other groups (P < .05). Following interleukin-2 activation, NK cells of exposed uninfecteds had enhanced cytotoxicity that positively correlated with NKp30 expression (P = .02). Differences in NKp80 and KIR2DL3 expression were also observed. HCV-specific T-cell responses were observed in some exposed uninfecteds but of low amplitude. Exposure without infection following transfusion of HCV-contaminated blood is a very rare phenomenon and suggests a high level of resistance to infection. Enhanced NK cell activation and killing, with weak HCV-specific T-cell responses, were observed many years after exposure in uninfected recipients and may contribute to protection from HCV acquisition, although additional protective factors are being sought in this important cohort.
