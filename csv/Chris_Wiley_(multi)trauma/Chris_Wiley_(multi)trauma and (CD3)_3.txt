AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response and immune reactions. In the central nervous system (CNS), IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia and it is upregulated after various insults, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, middle cerebral artery occlusion, excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. To better understand the effects of IL-10 in the normal and injured CNS, we generated transgenic mice (termed GFAP-IL-10Tg) that expressed the murine IL-10 gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Previous studies demonstrated marked changes in the microglial phenotype in these mice under basal conditions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of local astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on glial activation, neuronal degeneration and leukocyte recruitment after axotomy. GFAP-IL-10Tg mice had marked changes in the phenotype of activated microglial cells, as well as in the number of microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. These microglial changes are accompanied by a twofold increase in lymphocyte infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice and around twofold decrease in neuronal cell death at 21 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggested that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 impacted the microglial response and lymphocyte recruitment and culminated in a beneficial effect on neuronal survival.

AB  - Abstract Activation of Ras into the GTP-binding, ?ON? state is a key switch in the neurotrophin-mediated neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, in vitro as well as in vivo. In the current study we explored changes in GTP-Ras levels following facial nerve injury and the ensuing regeneration and the effects of perturbing these changes in vivo using synapsin-promoter mediated neuronal expression of constitutively active Val12H-Ras (synRas). Quantification of GTP-Ras and total Ras revealed a precipitous drop in the relative GTP-Ras levels in the axotomized facial motor nucleus, to 40% of normal levels at 2?days after cut, followed by a partial recovery to 50?65% at 4?28?days. On western blots, control and axotomized nuclei from synRas mutants showed a 2.2- and 2.5-fold elevation in GTP-Ras, respectively, compared with their wild type littermate controls (p?<?5%, anova, TUKEY post-hoc), with the levels in the axotomized synRas nucleus slightly but not significantly above that in the uninjured littermate control (p?=?9.9%). Similar increase was also observed in the pERK but not pAKT targets of the Ras cascade. This moderate elevation of GTP-Ras strongly curtailed post-traumatic neuronal cell death (?65%), the influx of T-cells (?48%) as well as other parameters of neuroinflammatory response. Although synRas did not affect the speed of axonal regeneration or functional recovery it caused a very pronounced increase in central axonal sprouting. These current data emphasize the role of reduced active Ras, and by extension, the reduced overall level of retrograde neurotrophin signalling after axotomy, in mediating post-traumatic cell death and inflammation and in restricting the sprouting response. Moreover, the neuroprotective and central sprouting-enhancing effects of neuronal Val12H-Ras could help promote recovery in CNS injury.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease resulting from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, due to a poorly understood combination of genetic, environmental, and immune factors. The JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) program recovers transplantation quality pancreas from organ donors throughout the USA. In addition to recovery of donors with T1D, non-diabetic donors include those with islet autoantibodies. Donors with type 2 diabetes and other conditions are also recovered to aid investigations directed at the full spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting beta cells. One central processing laboratory conducts standardized procedures for sample processing, storage, and distribution, intended for current and future cutting edge investigations. Baseline histology characterizations are performed on the pancreatic samples, with images of the staining results provided though whole-slide digital scans. Uniquely, these high-grade biospecimens are provided without expense to investigators, working worldwide, seeking methods for disease prevention and reversal strategies. Collaborative working groups are highly encouraged, bringing together multiple investigators with different expertise to foster collaborations in several areas of critical need. This mini-review will provide some key histopathological findings emanating from the nPOD collection, including the heterogeneity of beta cell loss and islet inflammation (insulitis), beta cell mass, insulin-producing beta cells in chronic T1D, and pancreas weight reductions at disease onset. Analysis of variations in histopathology observed from these organ donors could provide for mechanistic differences related to etiological agents and serve an important function in terms of identifying the heterogeneity of T1D.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Background Annually, 2.6 million stillbirths occur worldwide, 98% in developing countries. It is crucial that we understand causes and contributing factors. Methods We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting factors associated with and cause(s) of stillbirth in low- and middle-income countries (2000?13). Narrative synthesis to compare similarities and differences between studies with similar outcome categories. Main results A total of 142 studies with 2.1% from low-income settings were investigated; most report on stillbirths occurring at health facility level. Definition of stillbirth varied; 10.6% of studies (mainly upper middle-income countries) used a cut-off point of ≥22 weeks of gestation and 32.4% (mainly lower income countries) used ≥28 weeks of gestation. Factors reported to be associated with stillbirth include poverty and lack of education, maternal age (>35 or <20 years), parity (1, ≥5), lack of antenatal care, prematurity, low birthweight, and previous stillbirth. The most frequently reported cause of stillbirth was maternal factors (8?50%) including syphilis, positive HIV status with low CD4 count, malaria and diabetes. Congenital anomalies are reported to account for 2.1?33.3% of stillbirths, placental causes (7.4?42%), asphyxia and birth trauma (3.1?25%), umbilical problems (2.9?33.3%), and amniotic and uterine factors (6.5?10.7%). Seven different classification systems were identified but applied in only 22% of studies that could have used a classification system. A high percentage of stillbirths remain ?unclassified? (3.8?57.4%). Conclusion To build capacity for perinatal death audit, clear guidelines and a suitable classification system to assign cause of death must be developed. Existing classification systems may need to be adapted. Better data and more data are urgently needed.

AB  - Oestrus ovis L. (Diptera: Oestridae) is a cosmopolitan agent of myiasis in sheep and goats. The parasitic phase begins after adult females deposit first-stage larvae (L1) into the nostrils of hosts; these larvae develop into L2 and L3 in the nasal and sinus horn cavities. Sneezing and nasal discharges are the major clinical signs in infected animals. The pathogenesis of O. ovis infection is caused by: (a) the trauma resulting from the mechanical action of spines and hooks during larval movement on mucosal membranes, and, more importantly, (b) an allergenic reaction provoked by molecules excreted/secreted by larvae, of which salivary antigens are those mainly recognized by the host's immune system. The recruitment of immune reactive cells increases gradually from the nasal to sinus cavities in infected hosts. Mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes are always more numerous in infected than non-infected animals. Humoral (antibody) systemic response of immunoglobulin G (IgG) usually reaches seroconversion 2?4 weeks post-first infection and the highest levels are observed during the development of L2 and L3 larvae. Local antibody responses include specific IgG, which has been found to negatively correlate with larval survival and development. Hypersensitivity reaction, immunomodulation, immunization trials and mixed infections of O. ovis and helminths are discussed.

AB  - Abstract To investigate ageing-associated changes in cellular immunity, we recruited three groups of healthy subjects based on SENIEUR protocol criteria. In addition, 10 subjects were randomly selected from each group to isolate their T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells; T cell proliferation after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. There were no marked differences in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood T cells, NK cells or B cells among the three groups (P?>?0.05). Also, no significant differences were noted in the numbers of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, or the CD4+/CD8+ ratios (P?>?0.05). After PHA stimulation, T cell proliferation was markedly increased, with the highest level in group C and the lowest level in group A (P?<?0.05). Cytokine-induced killer tumouricidal activities were also dramatically increased, with the highest activity in group C and the lowest activity in group A (P?<?0.05). Our findings suggest that the number of immune cells remains unchanged with advanced age. However, there is a trend for decreased cellular immunity with an increase in age.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Abstract Older people experience skeletal muscle wasting, in part due to impaired proliferative capacity of quiescent skeletal muscle satellite cells which can be reversed by exposure to young blood. To investigate the role of immune cells in muscle regeneration, we isolated lymphocytes from whole blood of young and older healthy volunteers and cultured them with, or without, anti-CD3/CD28 activators to induce release of cytokines, interleukins, and growth factors into the media. The secreted proteins were collected to prepare a conditioned media, which was subsequently used to culture C2C12 myoblasts. The conditioned media from the activated young lymphocytes increased the rate of proliferation of myoblasts by around threefold (P < 0.005) and caused an approximate fourfold (P < 0.005) increase in migration compared with nonactivated lymphocyte control media. These responses were characterized by minimal myotube formation (2%), low fusion index (5%), low myosin heavy chain content, and substantial migration. In contrast, myoblasts treated with conditioned media from activated old lymphocytes exhibited a high degree of differentiation, and multi-nucleated myotube formation that was comparable to control conditions, thus showing no effect on proliferation or migration of myoblasts. These results indicate that secreted proteins from lymphocytes of young people enhance the muscle cell proliferation and migration, whereas secreted proteins from lymphocytes of older people may contribute to the attenuated skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and migration.

AB  - A 12-week-old greyhound had a two-day history of lethargy, inappetence and shifting lameness. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Haematological examination showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and large numbers of atypical mononuclear leucocytes. A diagnosis of acute B cell lymphoblastic leukaemia was made following flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the leucocytes. The owner declined further evaluation and the dog was treated symptomatically with antibiotics. After a brief improvement, the dog's condition deteriorated and it was euthanased four days after initial presentation. The case was unusual because acute lymphoid leukaemia in the dog is most frequently reported in mature animals. This is in contrast to humans, where acute leukaemia is one of the most common childhood cancers.

AB  - Summary.? The formation of inhibitory alloantibodies is, in the postinfectious era, the most severe and costly complication of replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia. The complexity of the immune response to the infused factor becomes more and more obvious as knowledge in the area increases. Antibodies develop as a result of a complex multi-factorial interaction between antigen-presenting cells, T- and B-lymphocytes. Genetic susceptibility of cell surface molecules, such as the major histocompatibility complex, the T-cell receptor and cytokine receptors, as well as various immunomodulatory molecules have a major impact on the outcome. In addition, environmental factors probably influence the risk of inhibitor development. The current concept of inhibitor development is reviewed. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved will facilitate improvement of therapy in the future, and hopefully provide an opportunity to prevent this complication of treatment.
