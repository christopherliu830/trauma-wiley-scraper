AB  - Abstract Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) consist of a diverse group of lymphoproliferative neoplasms with unique patterns of biology, behavior, and differing responses to therapy. A rare subtype of malignancy arising from cells of putative natural killer (NK) origin is being recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity. Viruses including hepatitis C have been reported in association with various types of NHL but not the NK-cell subtype. We hereby report a unique case of a patient with hepatitis C who developed hepatic NK-cell lymphoma and chronic NK-cell leukemia. Interestingly, we observed clinical and radiologic remission of the neoplasm following treatment with anti-hepatitis C therapy. Am. J. Hematol. 78:212?215, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of horses with lymphoma are often nonspecific and dependent on the organ system affected. At the present time, the prognosis for all forms of equine lymphoma is grave, but palliative therapies including surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are available and have been reported with varying degrees of success to improve quality of life and prolong survival time. Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with equine lymphoma are uncommon, and are thought to be the result of soluble polypeptide hormones secreted by tumor cells. Definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be obtained antemortem through identification of neoplastic lymphocytes in tissues, fluids, aspirates, or peripheral blood. Response to chemotherapy is highly variable, with some horses displaying dramatic improvement within 2-4 months of initiating induction protocols and remaining in remission for several months, while others show only modest or no response, regardless of treatment protocol.

AB  - Objective Inflammation is a well-known consequence of surgery. Although surgical debulking of tumor is beneficial to patients, the onset of inflammation in injured tissue may impede the success of adjuvant therapies. One marker for postoperative inflammation is IL-6, which is released as a consequence of surgical injuries. IL-6 is predictive of response to many cancer therapies, and it is linked to various molecular and cellular resistance mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to establish a murine model by which therapeutic responses to photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be studied in the context of surgical inflammation. Materials and Methods Murine models with AB12 mesothelioma tumors were treated with either surgical resection or sham surgery with tumor incision but no resection. The timing and extent of IL-6 release in the tumor and/or serum was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared to that measured in the serum of 27 consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who underwent macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Results MPM patients showed a significant increase in IL-6 at the time MCR was completed. Similarly, IL-6 increased in the tumor and serum of mice treated with surgical resections. However, investigations that combine resection with another therapy make it necessary to grow tumors for resection to a larger volume than those that receive secondary therapy alone. As the larger size may alter tumor biology independent of the effects of surgical injury, we assessed the tumor incision model. In this model, tumor levels of IL-6 significantly increased after tumor incision. Conclusion The tumor incision model induces IL-6 release as is seen in the surgical setting, yet it avoids the limitations of surgical resection models. Potential mechanisms by which surgical induction of inflammation and IL-6 could alter the nature and efficacy of tumor response to PDT are reviewed. These include a wide spectrum of molecular and cellular mechanisms through which surgically-induced IL-6 could change the effectiveness of therapies that are combined with surgery. The tumor incision model can be employed for novel investigations of the effects of surgically-induced, acute inflammation on therapeutic response to PDT (or potentially other therapies).
