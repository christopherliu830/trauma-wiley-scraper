AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to determine the association between prenatal stress and immune function in human adults. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 34 healthy young women whose mothers experienced major negative life events during their pregnancy (Prenatal Stress, PS group, mean age 25, SD?±?4.34 years), and from a female comparison group (n?=?28, CG, mean age 24?±?3.40 years), were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and subsequent cytokine production was measured. A bias for T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production due to an overproduction of IL-4 relative to IFN-? after PHA stimulation was observed in PS subjects. In addition, IL-6 and IL-10 were also significantly elevated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a direct association between prenatal stress exposure and alterations in immune parameters in adult women. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Prostatic inflammation is gaining increasing attention as a potential etiologic factor in prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and CPPS. This study was performed to address the need for a well characterized model of acute prostatic inflammation that may be used to study the effect of acute inflammation on epithelial and stromal cell proliferation, voiding behavior, and neurovascular physiology. METHODS Uropathogenic E. coli 1677 was instilled transurethrally into adult C57BL/6J male mice. Prostates were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days post-instillation and compared to saline-instilled and naïve controls. Time course and severity of inflammation were characterized by the quantity and type of inflammatory infiltrate present, hemorrhage, proliferation, and reactive hyperplasia. RT-PCR was performed to characterize inflammatory mediators including IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-1RA, IL-18, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNFα, and COX-2. RESULTS Inflammation was evident in all lobes of the prostate with the DLP most severely affected. Infection consistently led to a significant increase in neutrophils and macrophages in the early stages of prostate infection, followed by lymphocytic inflammation at the later time points. Inflammation was accompanied by induction of several inflammatory genes, including IL-1 family members, IL-6, and COX-2, and induced a significant increase in epithelial proliferation and reactive hyperplasia in all three prostate lobes. CONCLUSIONS Transurethral inoculation of uropathogenic E. coli 1677 reliably infects the mouse prostate, produces a significant inflammatory response, and induces quantifiable epithelial proliferation and reactive hyperplasia.

AB  - Multiple pathological processes are responsible for renal transplant loss. Development of effective prophylactic regimens requires that risks associated with different outcomes be assessed when several processes act together. A multistate competing risk model that derived multiple endpoint probabilities without averaging impacts of covariates over different outcomes or overestimating fractions of survivors was used to estimate the influence of 16 factors simultaneously on four failure types (acute rejection, chronic rejection, death with a functioning graft and all other causes combined). We analyzed 12?413 non-Black and 5121 Black patients undergoing primary cadaveric kidney transplantation reported to UNOS during 1994?96. Black recipients generally demonstrated higher rates of failure, but the method provided joint probabilities for each failure type and covariate level. To illustrate, a middle-aged Black recipient had probabilities of 6.5%, 5.9%, 2.6% and 6.6% to experience acute rejection failure, chronic rejection failure, death with a functioning graft and other failures, respectively, within 3?years. The corresponding non-Black's chances were 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.6%. The overall 3-year survival equaled 78.4% [100%-(6.5%?+?5.9%?+?2.6%?+?6.6%)] and 88.3% for Blacks and non-Blacks, respectively. The growing complexity of transplantation will benefit from new analytic approaches that accommodate multiple transitions along diverse paths to eventual graft loss or death.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.
