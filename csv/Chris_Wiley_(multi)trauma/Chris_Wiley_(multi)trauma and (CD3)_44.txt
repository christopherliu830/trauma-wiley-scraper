AB  - Abstract Rhinitis is an umbrella term that encompasses many different subtypes, several of which still elude complete characterization. The concept of phenotyping, being the definition of disease subtypes on the basis of clinical presentation, has been well established in the last decade. Classification of rhinitis entities on the basis of phenotypes has facilitated their characterization and has helped practicing clinicians to efficiently approach rhinitis patients. Recently, the concept of endotypes, that is, the definition of disease subtypes on the basis of underlying pathophysiology, has emerged. Phenotypes/endotypes are dynamic, overlapping, and may evolve into one another, thus rendering clear-cut definitions difficult. Nevertheless, a phenotype-/endotype-based classification approach could lead toward the application of stratified and personalized medicine in the rhinitis field. In this PRACTALL document, rhinitis phenotypes and endotypes are described, and rhinitis diagnosis and management approaches focusing on those phenotypes/endotypes are presented and discussed. We emphasize the concept of control-based management, which transcends all rhinitis subtypes.

AB  - Summary This chapter summaries neurological manifestations of disorders of other body systems and outlines some basic elements of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ? the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the humanized antibody ATM-027 in a baseline versus treatment magnetic resonance imaging-monitored study. Expansion of V?5.2/5.3+ T cells has been demonstrated in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain lesions of MS patients. In a phase I study, ATM-027 depleted these cells in peripheral blood and, in parallel, T-cell MBP reactivity and IFN-? expression were reduced. We studied 59 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (47 on ATM-027 and 12 on placebo) stratified for HLA-DR2 status. Monthly intravenous injections were given for 6 months. Individual dose titration was employed to obtain depletion of the target T-cell level and downregulation of antigen receptor density as monitored by flow cytometry. Five monthly magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed before treatment to establish baseline activity, six during treatment, and three during follow-up. Additional immunological assessments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ATM-027. The treatment was safe and well tolerated, inducing consistent suppression of the target cell population. During run-in, active lesions were found in 78.7% (37/47) of patients treated with ATM-027. During treatment, the median number of lesions was reduced by 33% (p = 0.13) independent of DR2 status. The corresponding volume of enhancement was 221 mm3 at baseline, with a reduction of 10% during treatment. Decreased numbers of cells expressing interferon-? messenger RNA, and decreased T-cell reactivity to several myelin antigens were found in ATM-027 treated patients. In conclusion, consistent suppression of V? 5.2/5.3+ T cells was achieved. However, the effect size on magnetic resonance imaging was considerably less than the targeted 60%.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HIV DNA and RNA and the morphologic localization of HIV in the oral cavity of HIV-seropositive subjects. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of saliva, buccal scrapings and buccal biopsies from HIV-seropositive injecting drug users (IDUs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Whole saliva, buccal mucosal scrapings and buccal biopsies were obtained from HIV-seropositive and seronegative IDUs. Presence of HIV DNA and RNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). RT in situ PCR was used to detect HIV tat/rev RNA in buccal mucosal scrapings. Host-cell integrated HIV-proviral DNA in buccal biopsies was detected by in situ PCR. Presence of intact HIV viral particles in buccal scrapings was assessed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: HIV DNA was detected in 40% (18/45) and HIV RNA in 69.2% (25/36) of saliva samples from HIV-seropositive IDUs. Viral particles consistent with HIV were localized in inter-epithelial spaces by electron microscopy. RT in situ PCR revealed the presence of HIV tat/rev RNA in 36% (8/22) of the seropositive samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that epithelial cells can be productively infected by HIV. Epithelial cells in buccal mucosa may acquire HIV in the basal layers through contact with submucosal HIV-positive lymphocytes and/or Langerhans' cells. HIV infection may also spread by inter-epithelial cell contact. As HIV infected cells mature they travel to more superficial layers and are shed into the oral cavity.
