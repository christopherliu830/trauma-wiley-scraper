AB  - Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a recently introduced option for limb replacement and reconstruction of tissue defects. As with other allografts, CTA can undergo immune-mediated rejection; therefore standardized criteria are required for characterizing and reporting severity and types of rejection. This article documents the conclusions of a symposium on CTA rejection held at the Ninth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology in La-Coru?a, Spain, on 26 June 2007, and proposes a working classification, the Banff CTA-07, for the categorization of CTA rejection. This classification was derived from a consensus discussion session attended by the first authors of three published classification systems, pathologists and researchers from international centers where clinical CTA has been performed. It was open to all attendees to the Banff conference. To the extent possible, the format followed the established National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on Consensus Development Programs. By consensus, the defining features to diagnose acute skin rejection include inflammatory cell infiltration with involvement of epidermis and/or adnexal structures, epithelial apoptosis, dyskeratosis and necrosis. Five grades of severity of rejection are defined. This classification refines proposed schemas, represents international consensus on this topic, and establishes a working collective classification system for CTA reporting of rejection in skin-containing CTAs.

AB  - Summary In the 1960s, our predecessors won a historical battle against acute rejection and ensured that transplantation became a common life-saving treatment. In parallel with this success, or perhaps because of it, we lost the battle for long-lived transplants, being overwhelmed with chronic immune insults and the toxicities of immunosuppression. It is likely that current powerful treatments block acute rejection, but at the same time condemn the few circulating donor cells that would have been able to elicit immunoregulatory host responses towards the allograft. Under these conditions, spontaneously tolerant kidney recipients ? i.e. patients who maintain allograft function in the absence of immunosuppression ? are merely accidents; they are scarce, mysterious and precious. Several teams pursue the goal of finding a biomarker that would guide us towards the 'just right? level of immunosuppression that avoids rejection while leaving some space for donor immune cells. Some cellular assays are attractive because they are antigen-specific, and provide a comprehensive view of immune responses toward the graft. These seem to closely follow patient regulatory capacities. However, these tests are cumbersome, and require abundant cellular material from both donor and recipient. The latest newcomers, non-antigen-specific recipient blood transcriptomic biomarkers, offer the promise that a practicable and simple signature may be found that overcomes the complexity of a system in which an infinite number of individual cell combinations can lead possibly to graft acceptance. Biomarker studies are as much an objective ? identifying tolerant patients, enabling tolerance trials ? as a means to deciphering the underlying mechanisms of one of the most important current issues in transplantation.

AB  - Summary In cases of arginine depletion, lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and CD3? chain expression are all diminished. In addition to myeloid suppressor cells, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) also exert T-cell immune suppressive effects through arginase-induced l-arginine depletion, especially during pregnancy. In this study, we investigated how arginase/l-arginine modulates neonatal lymphocyte proliferation. Results showed that the neonatal plasma l-arginine level was lower than in adults (48·1 ± 11·3 versus 86·5 ± 14·6 ?m; P = 0·003). Neonatal PMN had a greater abundance of arginase I protein than adult PMN. Both transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation were responsible for the higher arginase I expression of neonatal PMN. Exogenous l-arginine enhanced neonate lymphocyte proliferation but not that of adult cells. The RNA-binding protein HuR was important but was not the only modulation factor in l-arginine-regulated neonatal T-cell proliferation. l-Arginine-mediated neonatal lymphocyte proliferation could not be blocked by interleukin-2 receptor blocking antibodies. These results suggest that the altered arginase/l-arginine cascade may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to altered neonatal immune responses. Exogenous l-arginine could enhance neonate lymphocyte proliferation through an interleukin-2-independent pathway.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.
