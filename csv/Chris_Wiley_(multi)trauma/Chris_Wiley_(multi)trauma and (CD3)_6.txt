AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Abstract Oligodendroglial cell death and demyelination are hallmarks of neurotrauma and multiple sclerosis that cause axonal damage and functional impairments. Remyelination remains a challenge as the ability of endogenous precursor cells for oligodendrocyte replacement is hindered in the unfavorable milieu of demyelinating conditions. Here, in a rat model of lysolecithin lysophosphatidyl-choline (LPC)-induced focal demyelination, we report that Neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1), an important factor for oligodendrocytes and myelination, is dysregulated in demyelinating lesions and its bio-availability can promote oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. We delivered recombinant human Nrg-1?1 (rhNrg-1?1) intraspinally in the vicinity of LPC demyelinating lesion in a sustained manner using poly lactic-co-glycolic acid microcarriers. Availability of Nrg-1 promoted generation and maturation of new oligodendrocytes, and accelerated endogenous remyelination by both oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell populations in demyelinating foci. Importantly, Nrg-1 enhanced myelin thickness in newly remyelinated spinal cord axons. Our complementary in vitro studies also provided direct evidence that Nrg-1 significantly promotes maturation of new oligodendrocytes and facilitates their transition to a myelinating phenotype. Nrg-1 therapy remarkably attenuated the upregulated expression chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) specific glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix of demyelinating foci and promoted interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by immune cells. CSPGs and IL-10 are known to negatively and positively regulate remyelination, respectively. We found that Nrg-1 effects are mediated through ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptor activation. Our work provides novel evidence that dysregulated levels of Nrg-1 in demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord pose a challenge to endogenous remyelination, and appear to be an underlying cause of myelin thinning in newly remyelinated axons.

Abstract Aim: To compare histopathological characteristics of peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions. Methods: A search was conducted on publications up to July 2010. Studies carried out on human biopsy material and animal experiments were considered. Results: While comprehensive information exists regarding histopathological characteristics of human periodontitis lesions, few studies evaluated peri-implantitis lesions in human biopsy material. Experimental peri-implantitis lesions were evaluated in 10 studies and three of the studies included comparisons to experimental periodontitis. Human biopsy material: the apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate (ICT) was more pronounced in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis and was in most cases located apical of the pocket epithelium. Plasma cells and lymphocytes dominated among cells in both types of lesions, whereas neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages occurred in larger proportions in peri-implantitis. Experimental studies: placement of ligatures together with plaque formation resulted in loss of supporting tissues and large ICTs around implants and teeth. Following ligature removal, a ?self-limiting? process occurred in the tissues around teeth with a connective tissue capsule that separated the ICT from bone, while in peri-implant tissues the ICT extended to the bone crest. Conclusion: Despite similarities regarding clinical features and aetiology of peri-implantitis and periodontitis, critical histopathological differences exist between the two lesions.

AB  - Summary Neuropathic pain remains an extremely challenging condition to manage clinically, with few effective options for analgesia. The hallmark of neuropathic pain is a mixed loss and gain of function in somatosensation and pain, which is secondary to an initiating lesion to the nervous system. Clinical research into the distinctive somatosensory profiles exhibited by individuals with different types of neuropathic pain will soon improve the design of clinical trials that assess the effects of therapeutics on the different dimensions of neuropathic pain. A variety of model systems have been developed to investigate the peripheral and central nervous system pathology seen in clinical pain conditions triggered by traumatic injury, toxic neuropathy and other conditions. The biology illustrated by these models has proven difficult to translate into novel analgesic therapies. But recent evidence for a broader role of the immune system in neuropathic pain provides a new avenue for therapeutic development.

AB  - ABSTRACT? Aims/Background: The anatomic structure of the liver suggests that it is a place of intense trafficking between intra-hepatic and peripheral blood compartment leukocytes. Furthermore, the liver contains a large number of passenger leukocytes that may play a role in the appearance of donor-type microchimerism after transplantation. In this study, we aimed to define the principal lymphocyte sub-populations contained in donor peripheral blood and liver grafts and in normal liver removed during minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Liver biopsies were taken at the time of vascular clampage during liver extraction from donors in a brain dead state (GI: n=14). Normal liver biopsies were removed during minimaly invasive surgery (GII: n=10). Results: We observed evidence of the presence of lymphocytic activation associated with the two major CD8+ lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell populations in the two groups, with a significant increase in TCR ?δ-bearing lymphocyte receptors between normal liver and the liver graft. Conclusions: The presence of activated leukocytes in the graft could have a fundamental role in induction of peripheral tolerance. This activation could be the result of a basic immunological response linked to the interaction of T cells and NK cells, and of secondary activation due to stress and the conditions necessary for organ removal from donors in a brain dead state.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.

AB  - Abstract T cell adaptation is an important peripheral tolerogenic process which ensures that the T cell population can respond effectively to pathogens but remains tolerant to self-antigens. We probed the mechanisms of T cell adaptation using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in which the fate of autopathogenic T cells could be followed. We demonstrated that immunisation with a high dose of myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant failed to effectively initiate EAE, in contrast to low dose MBP peptide immunisation which readily induced disease. The proportion of autopathogenic CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice immunised with a high dose of MBP peptide was not significantly different to mice immunised with a low dose. However, autopathogenic T cells in mice immunised with high dose MBP peptide had an unresponsive phenotype in ex vivo recall assays. Importantly, whilst expression of PD-1 was increased on adapted CD4+ T cells within the CNS, loss of PD-1 function did not prevent the development of the unresponsive state. The lack of a role for PD-1 in the acquisition of the adapted state stands in striking contrast to the reported functional importance of PD-1 in T cell unresponsiveness in other disease models.
