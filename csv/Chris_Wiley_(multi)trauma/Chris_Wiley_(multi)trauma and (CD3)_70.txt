AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Abstract Autoimmune hepatitis emerged during an era when concepts of neonatal immune tolerance, clonal selection of lymphocytes, and ?forbidden clones? of activated immune cells were forming. The diagnosis had to be deduced from circumstantial evidence and by exclusion of other conditions. The goals of this review are to demonstrate how a clinician nonscientist can contribute to the maturation of autoimmune hepatitis and to illustrate the principles of clinical investigation that can be applied broadly to other projects. Autoimmune hepatitis initially had to be distinguished from other diseases, and improvements in the tests for viral and immune markers were instrumental in this regard. Diversification of the clinical phenotype to accommodate acute severe, asymptomatic, elderly, and variant forms enhanced the pertinence of the disease, and the formation of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group standardized the diagnosis, interconnected investigators, and promoted global acceptance of the condition. Subsequent studies refined current corticosteroid-based therapies, identified prognostic markers, assessed genetic predispositions, explored new pharmacological agents, and forecast the emergence of cellular and molecular interventions. Good fortune, stimulating mentors, career dedication, practical goal selection, protocol compliance, compulsive record keeping, personal resilience, and strong collaborations were the bases for progress. Autoimmune hepatitis exemplifies an evolutionary process in the science of autoimmunity and the people committed to its study. Lessons derived from this experience can be far-reaching.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 69?79 Abstract Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The non-specific nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic challenge and concise case definitions are essential for its satisfactory management. Lyme borreliosis is very similar in Europe and North America but the greater variety of genospecies in Europe leads to some important differences in clinical presentation. These new case definitions for European Lyme borreliosis emphasise recognition of clinical manifestations supported by relevant laboratory criteria and may be used in a clinical setting and also for epidemiological investigations.
