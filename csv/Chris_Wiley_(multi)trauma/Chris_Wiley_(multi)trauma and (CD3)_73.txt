AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Summary Initial nonfunction (INF) and biliary complications such as ischemic-type biliary lesion (ITBL) remain two major complications in clinical orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The influence of ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) as a significant risk factor for both complications is widely unquestioned. A new reperfusion technique that reduces I/R injury should lead to a reduction in both INF and ITBL. One hundred and thirty two OLT patients were included in this study and randomized into two groups. Group A underwent standard reperfusion with anterograde simultaneous arterial and portal reperfusion and group B received retrograde reperfusion via the vena cava before sequential anterograde reperfusion of portal vein and hepatic artery. Serum transaminase level as a surrogate parameter for I/R injury and serum bilirubin level as a parameter for graft function were significantly reduced during the first week after OLT in group B. INF rate was 7.7% in group A and 0% in group B (P?=?0.058). ITBL incidence was 4.55% in group A versus 12.3% in group B (P?=?0.053). Retrograde reperfusion seemed to be beneficial for hepatocytes, but was detrimental for the biliary epithelium. The unexplained increased incidence of ITBL after retrograde reperfusion will be focus of further investigation.

AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Bergström needle muscle biopsies have been used by exercise physiologists for over 35 years but have been less accepted by neuromuscular clinicians due to size concerns. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed over 13,500 muscle Bergström needle biopsies done over a 21-year period to determine sampling success, patient/subject experience, and complications. We compared sample yield between two different needles (Bergström vs. UCH), with and without suction modifications. Results: Needle biopsies adequate for histology and enzymology were obtainable from the vastus lateralis, deltoid, biceps brachii, soleus, and medial gastrocnemius muscles, with a success rate of >99.9% and a minor complication rate of 0.15%. Approximately 450 muscle fibers were submitted for histologic assessment; suction modification and use of the Bergström vs. UCH needle were associated with larger sample size (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The suction-modified Bergström needle muscle biopsy technique is safe and provides an adequate sample size for histologic, ultrastructural, DNA, and enzyme analysis. Muscle Nerve, 2011

Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - 1 Ajay Gupta, and 2 Mohamad Mikati ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon ) There is a unique, apparently heterogeneous, group of epilepsy syndromes in children that is characterized by sleep activation of the epileptiform abnormalities with nearly continuous sharp waves seen on the scalp EEG during sleep. These include commonly recognized childhood conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES), and benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). Most of these children have a period of normal development and healthy childhood. Besides presenting with seizures that are often not too difficult to treat, these children have other major cognitive, behavioral and academic difficulties that are disproportionate to the burden of epilepsy and medications used to treat them. It is commonly believed that abnormal electrical activity in sleep per se leads to cognitive, behavioral, and academic difficulties in these children. However, the pathophysiological understanding of this phenomenon of sleep activation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Moreover, there are also controversies regarding terminology, classification, and management of these disorders. Some experts believe that these conditions are distinct disease entities while others hypothesize that they may represent a spectrum of one condition. Similar sleep activation of epileptic discharges has also been reported in some other children with neuroimaging abnormalities in the deep gray nuclei. Some experts believe that the treatment with antiepileptic medications in these children should be titrated to the EEG response in sleep and not to the clinical response of seizures. It is unclear as to how often a sleep EEG should be done, and to what extent aggressive medical treatment and antiepileptic polytherapy be pursued. Use of steroids, recent success with high dose nightly benzodiazepine therapy, and surgical procedure like multiple subpial transactions in the insular regions continue to be controversial due to risk of serious side effects and modest benefits in reported anecdotal case reports and series. The focus of this symposium is to revisit these syndromes to: a) define the clinical spectrum of these conditions; b) formulate the best practices for management in the light of controversies in medical and surgical options; and c) discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and probe future strategies for better treatment. Margret Shouse will show similarities between kindled epileptic kittens and sleep activation of EEG in children with these conditions. She will review the potential mechanisms and generators of EEG activity during sleep, discuss how the cognitive and behavioral sequelae may occur regardless of severe seizure burden. Edouard Hirsch will discuss the available clinical evidence to suggest that these ?disorders may be a clinical spectrum of one condition? and not distinct disease entities. He will also discuss diagnostic criteria and role of neuroimaging. Jim Rivello will review the available evidence, and emphasize the best clinical practices for management in these children. First, he will discuss the goals of treatment i.e. seizure control, behavior improvement, cognition monitoring, and sleep EEG improvement. Second, he will formulate a treatment and follow-up plan with indications for various medical (anti epileptic agents, steroids, nightly benzodiazepenes etc.) and surgical (multiple subpial transactions) options. Each speaker will also formulate an important research question for the future that will improve our understanding of these conditions for devising better treatment methods. Live interaction with the diverse group of audience will also provide a forum to discuss where and how we should move forward with a collaborative effort for advancing our knowledge and treatment of these conditions.
