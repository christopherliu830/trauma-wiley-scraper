AB  - Abstract To facilitate research cooperation among the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, ISAC supported the Epona Cytometry Conference in eastern Hungary near Debrecen and the Hortobágy National Park. This was the first ISAC sponsored conference held in Hungary. The 150 attendees included scientists from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. There was also representation from Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Presentations and posters were of typically high ISAC quality. In addition, the Epona meeting attracted an impressive selection of commercial exhibits that provided contacts and improved the awareness of advanced analytical cytology for the attendees. The Epona conference was organized with Hungarian passion and skill by Professor Sandor Damjanovich, Dr. Jànos Szollosi, and the members of the Biophysics and Cell Biology Department of the Medical School of Debrecen. The Department has been active in cytometry for over 20 years, and in hosting the conference, it also celebrated the 20th anniversary of its installment of the first cell sorter in Eastern Europe. The successful meeting demonstrates that Hungarians are strong contenders for the organization of future ISAC meetings. During my 1999 Fulbright Scholarship in Professor Damjanovich's Department, I traveled extensively and can verify that there are other unique sites in Hungary?Sopron, Pécs, Lake Balaton, and Budapest?for ISAC meetings. The site of the conference was on the Hungarian Puszta or plain near the Hortobágy National Park, which offered tours to observe ?Hungarian Cowboys,? long-horned cattle, twisted-horn sheep, hairy pigs, and water buffalo, which were brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Magyars. Located in beautiful grasslands on the edge of the Park, the Epona Village was an excellent site for the meeting and is distinctly Hungarian. The timing of the conference was dramatic. Hungary was admitted to NATO in April and the Kosovo conflict with Yugoslavia began a few weeks later. During the conference, NATO air raids into Kosovo were being conducted from bases in southern Hungary. There was much concerned discussion among the attendees of the Kosovo situation. All regretted the loss of life, and all shared the hope that creating cooperative projects in science, agriculture, business, and education will lower international tension. In supporting the Epona conference, ISAC contributed importantly to cooperative science.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.
