AB  - Background and Objectives? G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells have long replaced marrow as the major source for allogeneic transplants. Conclusive evidence questioning the long-term safety of G-CSF for donors has not been provided, but the cumulative number of followed donors remains insufficient to rule out rare adverse events. A long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors was therefore performed. Patients and Methods? Two hundred and three successive donors were evaluated pre-apheresis, subjected to G-CSF-mobilization/apheresis, and actively followed for 5?years by the same physicians and laboratories. Follow-up laboratory work included standard biochemical/haematological tests and T-cell phenotyping. Results? Donor epidemiology was typical for reported stem cell donor cohorts. Acute adverse effects of G-CSF and apheresis were mild and transient, consistent with the previous reports. Mean circulating CD34+ cells after nine doses of G-CSF were 124 per ?l. Other biochemical/haematological parameters were also altered, consistent with G-CSF treatment. Spleen enlargement was modest. At first follow-up, all clinical and laboratory parameters had normalized. Leucocyte/lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were the same as during premobilization work-up and remained unchanged throughout. A single severe but likely unrelated adverse event, a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma, was reported. Conclusion? The studies add an observation time of almost 500 donor years to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogeneic donor stem cell mobilization.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate diagnostic utility of aqueous humor analysis in animals with anterior uveitis. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 12) and cats (n = 10). Procedures Examination findings and diagnostic test results including aqueous humor cytology were compared. Results Disease duration prior to aqueocentesis was not significantly different between dogs with idiopathic anterior uveitis and those with an etiologic diagnosis, but was shorter in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) than those with idiopathic uveitis. Microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against them were seldom found in blood/serum; however, serum feline coronavirus titers ≥1:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. Aqueous humor cytology was diagnostic in no cats and two dogs, both with neoplasia. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequent in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis. Cytologically assessed plasma cell number was correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. Clinically detectable hyphema and cytologic erythrocyte number were correlated. However, cytologic cell grades and clinical grade of flare or cell numbers within the anterior chamber were not correlated. Conclusions Aqueous humor cytology permitted diagnosis of neoplasia in dogs with anterior uveitis but was generally not helpful in cats. Poor correlation between clinical and cytologic assessment of cell numbers and type within the anterior chamber dictates that clinical grading should not be the sole criterion for electing to perform aqueocentesis.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD), and retrovirus-induced avian leukoses/sarcoma (L/S) and reticuloendotheliosis. It covers tumors of unknown etiology. The morphology and morphogenesis of MD virus have been reviewed. Several different types of MD vaccines are in common use, both individually and in various combinations. The most widely used products are low-pathogenic serotype 1 MDV, naturally avirulent herpesvirus of turkey (HVT), and serotype 2 viruses. Lymphoid leukosis (LL) has been the most common form of L/S group of diseases seen in field flocks, although myeloid leukosis has become prevalent. LL, a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens affecting primarily the cloacal bursa (bursa of Fabricius) and visceral organs, is the most common form of leukosis that arises from infection with avian leukosis virus (ALV). Eradication of ALV from primary breeding stocks is the most effective means for controlling ALV infection in chickens.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of studies support an unexpected role for immune molecules in regulating healthy brain functions during development and in adulthood. Here we review the roles of specific immune molecules (including cytokines, components of the complement cascade, and members of the major histocompatibility complex class I family and their receptors) in the formation and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of neural?immune interactions, and suggest novel molecular mechanisms that may underlie the modification of glutamatergic synapses in both normal and pathological states.
