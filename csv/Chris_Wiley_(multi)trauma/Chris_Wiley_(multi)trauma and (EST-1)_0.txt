AB  - Abstract Objectives Inca imperial strategies of political and territorial expansion varied across conquered regions depending on local ecology and cultural resistance, and Chachapoya peoples in Peru's forested northeastern Andes were renowned for their rebellions against the invaders. The cliff tombs of Los Pinchudos (AD 1470?1535) present opportunities to use stable isotopes to: (1) explore dietary and mobility patterns from a mortuary community interred at a site attributed to the poorly-known Chachapoya culture during the period of Inca domination, and (2) explore the origins of the individuals as either local or foreign (Inca). Using biochemical tracers, we can help resolve the impact of foreign influence and changes in population and social structure during imperial occupation. Materials and Methods While it is difficult to reconstruct individual life histories from incomplete skeletons, stable isotopic analysis of multiple skeletal tissues provides a direct means of characterizing diet and residential mobility. Values of stable carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and oxygen isotope (δ18O) ratios were determined in bone and dentine collagen and bone and enamel carbonate from 28 samples (11 paired tissues) from males, females, and juveniles from Los Pinchudos. Results Dietary signatures are consistent with a mixed but more C3-based plant and protein-based diet with moderate proportions of terrestrial animals. Oxygen isotopic values demonstrate limited variation between paired tissues, with a few possible nonlocal individuals buried in one particular tomb at the site. Compared to other Andean areas that underwent imperial domination, these data do not demonstrate expected dietary shifts. Discussion These are the first isotopic data from a Chachapoya site and our research shows evidence for minimal non-local presence in this commingled burial assemblage. The regional diet reconstructed at Los Pinchudos (2850 masl) focused on resources of higher altitude tuber crops, beans, and grains (C3) and terrestrial protein rather than on lower elevation grasses such as maize (C4) as in other highland Andean regions under Inca control. During imperial domination, inhabitants of this region appropriated Inca materials goods but continued to construct tombs in the local manner even though a potentially diverse population was occupying them.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine if clinically defined multi-impulsive bulimia (MIB) can be validated using an empirical classification approach. Method: One hundred and twenty-five women who met DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa were interviewed and completed a two-week EMA protocol. Participants who reported at least three highly impulsive behaviors were compared to participants who did not report such impulsive behavior. Also, Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to determine if the MIB classification could be replicated empirically. Results: LCA produced a two-class solution consistent with the traditional clinical approach to MIB classification. In both approaches, MIB was associated with higher levels of anxiety disorders, child abuse, and daily self-damaging behaviors than the non-MIB class. Conclusion: Clinical classification of MIB was empirically supported through LCA. Although the classes failed to differ in bulimic behavior, MIB appears to represent a group of bulimic individuals with significant trauma histories and associated psychopathology. ? 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims In 2005 the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate requiring that level I trauma centers have mechanisms to identify and intervene with problem drinkers. The aim of this investigation was to determine if a multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation enhancements. Design Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n?=?10, patient n?=?409) providers received 1-day workshop training on evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four 30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n?=?10, patient n?=?469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements. Setting Trauma centers in the United States of America. Participants A total of 878 blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). Measurements MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Findings Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of the year after injury (relative risk?=?0.88, 95%, confidence interval?=?0.79, 0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P?=?0.002). Conclusion Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among patients without TBI.

AB  - ObjectiveTo compare prescription data for Australia with drugs ingested in self-poisoning and suicide, to determine which drugs are over-represented. DesignComparison of data on drugs taken in self-poisoning admissions and suicides with Australian prescription drug dispensing data from the Drug Utilization Subcommittee (DUSC). SettingNewcastle and Lake Macquarie, Australia, 1989-1992. SubjectsBetween July 1989 and June 1992, 1159 prescription drugs were taken in overdose. Eighty-three drug-related deaths were investigated by the coroner between 1987 and 1992. On 48 occasions a prescription drug was the primary cause of death. ResultsDrugs over-represented in self-poisoning (relative to Australian prescriptions) included not only those prescribed for psychiatric conditions (antidepressants, neuroleptics and lithium), but also benzo-diazepines, barbiturates and other anticonvulsants. The highest odds ratios for death when adjusted for prescription numbers were for short-acting barbiturates (523.7; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 207-1322), chloral hydrate (58.1; 95% Cl, 18.1-187), colchicine (27.9; 95% Cl, 3.8-202), dextropropoxyphene (20.8; 95% Cl, 8.8-48.9), tricyclic antidepressants (13.3; 95% Cl, 7.2-24.5) and anticonvulsants (11.6; 95% Cl, 4.1-32.2). ConclusionsShort-acting barbiturates, chloral hydrate and dextropropoxyphene have little or no clinical advantage over alternatives and excessive toxicity in overdose. They should be removed from the market. The toxicity of anticonvulsants and colchicine should be con-sidered when they are prescribed, and smaller amounts per prescription may be advisable for high risk patients using these and other toxic drugs.

AB  - Abstract Background and purpose A higher Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score has been shown to predict poor functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and anterior circulation large vessel occlusions undergoing thrombectomy treatment. We attempted to evaluate the value of the THRIVE score in predicting the outcome of thrombectomy treatment in AIS patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO). Methods A total of 68 AIS patients with BAO who underwent thrombectomy treatment from May 2014 to August 2018 were included in the present study. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the predictive value of the THRIVE score for poor functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3), all-cause mortality, and hemorrhage transformation (HT) at 3 months. Results A total of 42 (61.8%) participants experienced poor functional outcomes, 25 (36.8%) patients died from all causes, and 21 (30.9%) patients had HT during the 3-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression showed that a higher THRIVE score was significantly associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] 5.86, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28?14.91, p < .001) as well as all-cause mortality (OR 2.40, 95% CI, 1.32?4.34, p = .004) but not HT (p = .607). The C-statistic of the THRIVE score was significantly larger than that of the NIHSS score for predicting poor functional outcome (AUC = 0.913; cutoff > 5; sensitivity, 88.5%; specificity, 83.3%, p = .007) and all-cause mortality (AUC = 0.768; cutoff > 5; sensitivity, 92.0%; specificity, 65.1%, p = .018). Conclusions A high THRIVE score was independently associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome and all-cause mortality in AIS patients with BAO who underwent thrombectomy treatment. Moreover, the THRIVE score appeared to be a better predictor of clinical outcome than the NIHSS score.

AB  - Summary Ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum is a non-invasive tool that allows reliable estimation of gastric contents. We performed this prospective cohort study in non-elective paediatric surgery to assess whether gastric ultrasound may help to determine the best anaesthetic induction technique, whether rapid sequence or routine. The primary outcome was the reduction of inappropriate induction technique. A pre-operative clinical assessment was performed by the attending anaesthetist who made a provisional plan for induction. Gastric ultrasound was performed in the semirecumbent and right lateral decubitus positions for a qualitative assessment of gastric contents, using a 0?2 grading scale. A final induction plan was made based on this assessment. Immediately after tracheal intubation, gastric contents were suctioned through a multi-orifice nasogastric tube; these were defined as above risk threshold for regurgitation and aspiration if there was clear fluid > 0.8 ml.kg?1, and/or the presence of thick fluid and/or solid particles. Gastric ultrasound was feasible in 130 out of 143 (90%) of children, and led to a change in the planned induction technique in 67 patients: 30 from routine to rapid sequence, and 37 from rapid sequence to routine. An appropriate induction technique was therefore performed in 85% of children, vs. 49% planned after pre-operative clinical assessment alone (p < 0.00001). Our results suggest that gastric ultrasound is a useful guide to the general anaesthetic induction technique with respect to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, in comparison with pre-operative clinical assessment alone.

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 456?468. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00831.x Abstract Vergence eye movements are used to track objects that move in depth in one?s binocular visual field to attain and maintain a fused and single percept. The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - The research focused on mental flexibility versus rigidity in explaining psychological adjustment in the violent conditions of Intifada, and in more peaceful times 3 years later, among 86 Palestinian children. A picture test based on Brunswik (1949) was applied to measure flexible-rigid cognitive style, and neuroticism, self-esteem, emotional disorders, and PTSD were used as outcome variables. Results revealed a moderating role of mental flexibility by showing that children were protected from negative long-term consequences of traumatic events if their perception indicated mental flexibility. However, in the midst of violence mental flexibility was not associated with good psychological adjustment. Mental flexibility was, in turn, determined by environmental and cognitive factors: The more intelligent and the less exposed to traumatic events children were, the higher mental flexibility they showed.

AB  - Abstract. The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare the different mineralized tissues that are found on and around the dental root following treatment of different periodontal pathosis. The material has been compiled from previously published experimental studies on periodontal therapies and trauma treatments. 4 distinctly different appearances of the mineralized tissue layers on the marginal dentin surfaces were described; new cementum, non-attached bone-like tissue, partly attached bone-like tissue and ankylosis preceded by root resorption. It was concluded that, healing in the periodontal/root interface following periodontal therapy may yield different mineralized tissues, depending on a number of host-specific and external factors. The temporal pattern of such healing processes is schematically represented.
