AB  - ObjectiveTo identify trends in the use of opioid drugs for chronic non-cancer pain. DesignReview of three sets of official records ? the record of Schedule 8 (S8) opioid drugs used in Australia, 1984-1995, from the national Department of Health, Housing and Community Services; New South Wales Department of Health statistical summaries of the number of authorities to prescribe S8 drugs for cancer pain and non-cancer pain for each June from 1990 to 1996; and NSW Department of Health patient records for a cohort of patients first prescribed S8 drugs in 1991. Main outcome measuresTotal quantities of opioids used in Australia; numbers of S8 authorities issued in NSW. Outcome measures for the cohort study were the proportion of patients remaining on opioids long-term, the proportion for whom dose escalated over time, and the diagnoses for which opioids were being prescribed. ResultsBetween 1986 and 1995, the amount of oral morphine used in Australia rose from 117 to 578 kg. Use of all other oral S8 opioids combined increased from 93 to 149 kg. ConclusionsThere has been a dramatic increase in opioid prescribing, a substantial proportion of which is for noncancer pain. In a sample of patients being treated for noncancer pain, long term use and dose escalation occurred in one third of cases.

AB  - Objective: To assess the value of routine bone marrow biopsy (8MB) in adult patients less than 65 years of age with suspected idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Design: Retrospective analysis. Data were collected from hospital medical records and laboratory results. Setting: Large tertiary-level metropolitan teaching hospital, Victoria. Participants: Sixty-six patients who had undergone BMB for investigation of isolated thrombocytopenia between January 1992 and May 1997, according to defined eligibility criteria. Results: Sixty-one of the 66 patients had BMB findings consistent with ITP (ie, normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes and other haemopoietic lineages normal). Three of these patients' biopsies incidentally showed reduced or absent iron stores. In the remaining five patients, BMB in four showed mild hypocellularity and the subsequent course in these patients was consistent with chronic ITP. The fifth patient had neutrophil hypersegmentation and giant band cells on 8MB, the cause of which was unclear. The subsequent course in this patient has also been consistent with chronic ITP. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the routine performance of BMB for the diagnosis of ITP is not useful, provided that a thorough clinical history and physical examination are undertaken and that the blood count and peripheral blood smear show no abnormalities apart from thrombocytopenia.

AB  - Summary Osteochondrosis (OC), a disturbance in the process of endochondral ossification, is by far the most important equine developmental orthopaedic disease and is also common in other domestic animals and humans. The purpose of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) at the intermediate ridge of the distal tibia in Norwegian Standardbred (SB) using the Illumina Equine SNP50 BeadChip whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay. Radiographic data and blood samples were obtained from 464 SB yearlings. Based on the radiographic examination, 162 horses were selected for genotyping; 80 of these were cases with an OCD at the intermediate ridge of the distal tibia, and 82 were controls without any developmental lesions in the joints examined. Genotyped horses descended from 22 sires, and the number of horses in each half-sib group ranged from 3 to 14. The population structure necessitated statistical correction for stratification. When conducting a case?control genome-wide association study (GWAS), mixed-model analyses displayed regions on chromosomes (Equus callabus chromosome ? ECA) 5, 10, 27 and 28 that showed moderate evidence of association (P?≤?5???10?5; this P-value is uncorrected i.e. not adjusted for multiple comparisons) with OCD in the tibiotarsal joint. Two SNPs on ECA10 represent the most significant hits (uncorrected P?=?1.19???10?5 in the mixed-model). In the basic association (chi-square) test, these SNPs achieved statistical significance with the Bonferroni correction (P?=?0.038) and were close in the permuted logistic regression test (P?=?0.054). Putative QTL on ECA 5, 10, 27 and 28 represent interesting areas for future research, validation studies and fine mapping of candidate regions. Results presented here represent the first GWAS of OC in horses using the recently released Illumina Equine SNP50 BeadChip.

AB  - Emerging data suggest that the genetic regulation of the biological response to inflammatory stress may be fundamentally different to the genetic underpinning of the homeostatic control (resting state) of the same biological measures. In this paper, we interrogate this hypothesis using a single-SNP score test and a novel class-level testing strategy to characterize protein-coding gene and regulatory element-level associations with longitudinal biomarker trajectories in response to stimulus. Using the proposed class-level association score statistic for longitudinal data, which accounts for correlations induced by linkage disequilibrium, the genetic underpinnings of evoked dynamic changes in repeatedly measured biomarkers are investigated. The proposed method is applied to data on two biomarkers arising from the Genetics of Evoked Responses to Niacin and Endotoxemia study, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored investigation of the genomics of inflammatory and metabolic responses during low-grade endotoxemia. Our results suggest that the genetic basis of evoked inflammatory response is different than the genetic contributors to resting state, and several potentially novel loci are identified. A simulation study demonstrates appropriate control of type-1 error rates, relative computational efficiency, and power. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the general health status of asylum seekers and their access to health services. DesignProspective questionnaire survey. SettingA community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. ParticipantsForty of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. Main outcome measuresResults on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of Northern Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. ResultsMore than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P< 0.001) and serious (P< 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P<0.001). Twenty or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; ConclusionsAlthough a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored.

AB  - The Dayton Peace Accords brought the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an end but left ethnonationalism undefeated and the country divided. The Accords legitimized the wartime entity Republika Srpska, created by ethnic cleansing, yet offered the possibility of reversing ethnic cleansing with Annex VII, which declared the right of those displaced to return to their prewar homes. Implementing Annex VII across ethnonationalist-dominated localities was a struggle of power, capacity, and law over the control of place in postwar Bosnia. This article examines the localized geopolitics of wartime displacement and postwar returns in two contrasting Bosnian counties, Zvornik in eastern Bosnia, and Jajce in central Bosnia. Based on extensive fieldwork in both places, the article documents how the Bosnian wars radically transformed the demographic character and cultural landscape of both places. The postwar effort to implement Annex VII developed as a struggle over place between entrenched local ethnonationalists, multiple international agencies, and displaced persons. In the years following the war, ethnonationalist forces were largely successful in blocking ?minority returns.? In response, the international community had, by 1999, imposed a legal system upon Bosnia's entities that facilitated returns and developed the local capacity to allow returns to (re)take place. Power tilted from localized ethnonationalists to localized internationals, and ethnically cleansed Bosnian places began to see more and more minority returns. Bosnian places, however, will never be as they were before the war. Bosnia remains a broken country.

AB  - ABSTRACT Temporary migrants in the United States face the challenge of adapting to their host society while maintaining a cohesive social network within their newcomer communities. Among the principal factors affecting Mexican migrant social networks is bilingual competence. Most Mexican migrants plan to live in the United States for only a few years, sending money to support their families and communities in Mexico. While in the United States, they work long hours in jobs largely invisible to the public, often alongside other Spanish speakers and with little exposure to English. They have few opportunities and little motivation to integrate into the English-speaking community. In upstate New York, where few people in the host community speak Spanish, Mexican migrants remain largely dependent on English speakers as they negotiate housing, employment, health care, and other basic resources. Lack of English language is a barrier to obtaining local cultural information essential for migrants to navigate these resources successfully. On the other hand, migrants?maintenance of a close-knit transnational social network provides invaluable resources both for those living in the United States and those in Mexico. Young migrant children immersed in English at school with little positive valuation of Spanish are socialized in a network from which their parents are excluded, and risk losing the social capital provided by their Mexican social networks. To maintain and strengthen communal social capital in their transnational migrant communities, these temporary Mexican migrants must preserve their close-knit internal social networks while simultaneously forming social links with outsiders in the host society. In this paper, I examine the interplay of language and social networks in a recently formed Mexican migrant community in upstate New York. I suggest that, despite the challenges Mexican migrants face in obtaining fluent Spanish-English bilingualism, some degree of bilingual competence is well within their reach. The expansion and adaptation of local language programmes in English and Spanish could contribute significantly to migrants?bilingual competence, increasing their communal social capital and facilitating successful adaptation into their host community, as well as reintegration into their sending community.
