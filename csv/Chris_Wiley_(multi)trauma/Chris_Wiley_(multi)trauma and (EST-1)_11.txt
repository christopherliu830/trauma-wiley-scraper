AB  - Abstract A primary interest of the field of infant mental health is in the early conditions that place infants at risk for less than optimal development. The fundamental problem of what constitutes normal and abnormal development is now a focus of developmental psychology, infant psychiatry, and developmental neuroscience. In the second part of this sequential work, I present interdisciplinary data to more deeply forge the theoretical links between severe attachment failures, impairments of the early development of the right brain's stress coping systems, and maladaptive infant mental health. In the following, I offer thoughts on the negative impact of traumatic attachments on brain development and infant mental health, the neurobiology of infant trauma, the neuropsychology of a disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern associated with abuse and neglect, trauma-induced impairments of a regulatory system in the orbitofrontal cortex, the links between orbitofrontal dysfunction and a predisposition to posttraumatic stress disorders, the neurobiology of the dissociative defense, the etiology of dissociation and body?mind psychopathology, the effects of early relational trauma on enduring right hemispheric function, and some implications for models of early intervention. These findings suggest direct connections between traumatic attachment, inefficient right brain regulatory functions, and both maladaptive infant and adult mental health.??2001 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - SUMMARY A total of 482 patients who had had one or more seizures in the first year of life were followed for at least five years (most for more than 10 years). The patients were divided into four groups: febrile convulsions, infantile spasms, status epilepticus and ?other?. Of those with febrile convulsions, 62 per cent developed normally, compared with 14 per cent in the group with infantile spasms, 15 per cent with status epilepticus, and 24 per cent in the ?other? group. Findings on recurrent seizures, epilepsy and mental retardation and/or neurological abnormalities are also reported. Epilepsy developed equally frequently among those with partial and with generalised seizures, but the former more frequently became mentally retarded. The effects of severity of seizures and other factors are discussed. In general, this research confirmed the grave prognosis after seizures during the first year of life, and not only for West syndrome and status epilepticus. The outcome was more favourable when the seizures were cryptogenic or febrile, isolated, with onset in the second six months, generalised, and when the EEG was normal between seizures. RÉSUMÉ Etude longitudinale de 482 cas de troubles convuisvs de la première année Un total de 482 sujets ayant présenté une ou plusieurs crises durant la première année de vie ont été suivis durant au moins cinq ans (la plupart plus de dix ans). Les sujets ont été divisés en quatre groupes, convulsions hyperthermiques, spasmes infantiles, état de mal épileptique et ?autres?. Parmi les sujets à convulsions hyperthermiques, 62 pour cent se sont développés normalement, lc pourcentage étant de 14 dans le groupe de spasmes infantiles, de 15 dans le groupe d'état de mal, et de 24 dans le groupe ?autres?. Les données sur une rechute des crises, I'épilepsie et Ie retard mental et/ou les anomalies neurologiques sont également décrites. I'épilcpsie est apparue également fréquemment en cas de crises focales ou généralisées mais les premières ont donné lieu plus fréquemment à des retards mentaux. Les effets de la gravité. des crises et d'autres facteurs sont discutés. En général. cette recherche confirme le pronostic sévère des crises de la première année de vie et pas uniquement pour le syndrome de West et I'état de mal. Le devenir a été optimal quand les crises étaient essentielles ou fébriles. isolées débutant dans le second semestre, généralisées et quand I'EEG edtait normal entre les crises. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Kontrollstudie an 482 Fällen mit Krampfleiden im ersten Lebensjahr Insgesamt 482 Patienten, die im ersten Lebensjahr ein oder mehr Krampfanfälle hattén, wurden mindestens fünf Jahre (die meisten mehr als 10 Jahre) kontrolliert. Die Patienten wurden in vier Gruppen unterteilt: Fieberkrämpfe, BNS Krämpfe, Status epilepticus und ?andere?. Von den Kindern mit Fieberkrämpfen entwickelten sich 62 Prozent normal, verglichen mit 14 Prozent in der Gruppe mit BNS Krämpfen und 15 Prozent in der mit Status epilepticus und mit 24 Prozent in der Gruppe ?andere?. Befunde über rezidivierende Anfälle. Epilepsie. geistige Retardierung und/oder neurologische Veränderungen werden dargestellt. Kinder mit Fokalanfällen und mit generalisierten Anfällen entwickelten gleich häufig eine Epilepsie. die mit Fokalanfällen jedoch wurden häufiger geistig retardiert. Die Einflüsse des Schweregrades von Anfällen und anderer Faktoren werden diskutiert. Im allgemeinen bestätigte diese Untersuchung die ernste Prognose nach Anfällen im ersten Lebensjahr und zwar nicht nur für das West Syndrom und den Status epilepticus. Das Ergebnis war günstiger, wenn die Anfälle cryptogen oder durch Fieber bedingt, abgeschlossen, in der zweiten Jahreshälfte aufgetreten und generalisiert waren und wenn das EEG zwischen den Anfällen normal war. RESUMEN Seguimiento de 482 casos con convulsiones en el primer año de vida Un total de 482 pacientes que habian tenido una o más convulsiones en el primer año de edad fueron seguidos durante por lo menos cinco años (la mayoria durante más de lo años). Los pacientes fueron divididos, en cuatro grupos: convulsiones febriles, espasmos infantiles, estado epilkético y ?otros?. De los que tuvieron convulsiones febriles, 62 por ciento se desarrollaron normalmente, en comparacion con el 14 por ciento en los grupos con espasmos infantiles 15 por ciento con estado epiléptico. y el 25 por ciento del ?otro? grupo. También se aportan los hallazgos de convulsiones recurrentes, epilepsia y retraso mental y/o anomalías neurológicas. La epilepsia desarrolló con igual frecuencia entre los que tenían convulsiones generalizadas o parciales, pero estos últimos desarrollaban retraso mental con mayor frecuencia. Se discuten los efectos de la gravedad de las convulsiones así como otros factores. En general esta investigación confirma el pronóstico grave tras convulsiones en el primer año de vida y no sólo por lo que respecta al síndrome de West y al estado epileptico. El curso posterior era más favorable cuando las convulsiones eran criptogenéticas o febriles, aisladas, con inicio en el segundo semestre, generalizadas y cuando el EEG era normal entre las convulsiones.

AB  - The present paper is devoted to the description of a model that may support the theoretical integration and the clinical advance of current psychotherapy. On one hand, it reports a narrative review of the common trends of the so-called Third Wave of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and other modern approaches. On the other hand, it defines epistemological tools that may help therapists in understanding such trends. The model comprises five main principles that are explained in terms of theoretical and clinical implications. Further studies are needed in order to prove its clinical effectiveness and extensively report the subsumed therapeutic mechanisms. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - One of the tasks that analysts and therapists face at a certain stage in their career is how to develop a way of psychoanalytic thinking and practising of their own. To do this involves modifying or overcoming the transferences established during their training or early career. These transferences are to one's teachers or training analyst, investing them with authority and infallibility, and to received theory, which is treated as though it were dogma. The need to free oneself from such transferences has been discussed in the literature. There is, however, another kind of transference that the developing therapist also needs to resolve, which has received little attention. This is the transference made on to a key figure in the psychoanalytic tradition. Such a psychoanalytic figure will be seen as the originator of or embodiment of those theoretical ideas to which one becomes attached, and/or as standing behind one's training analyst or seminal teachers who become a representative of that figure. The value of an investigation of one's relationship to a psychoanalytic figure is that it is an excellent medium for revealing one's transference, as the figure in question is not a real person but only exists through his/her writings. The body of the paper consists of an extended example of such an analysis, that of my own transference on to the figure of Winnicott. In this example I illustrate how my evaluation of Winnicott's ideas changed from seeing them as providing answers to all my clinical questions to no longer satisfying me in some areas of my work. This change in my relationship to Winnicott's theory went hand in hand with a modification in my transference on to the figure of Winnicott, from seeing him as endowed with authority and goodness to an appreciation of him as a still sustaining figure but now with limits and flaws. In the final part of the paper several questions arising out of my analysis are posed. Can the pull of writing such an account in terms of dramatic rupture rather than gradual and partial change be avoided? Should my account be regarded purely as a form of self-analysis or does it have anything to say about Winnicott himself and his theory? And do some psychoanalytic figures attract more intense or sticky transferences than others?

AB  - Abstract A multicentre, randomized, blinded study compared the efficacy of pradofloxacin with that of a combination of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of deep pyoderma in dogs. Dogs with clinical lesions of deep pyoderma and a positive bacterial culture were included in the study. At each visit, they were evaluated with lesion, pruritus and general condition scores. Dogs were treated either with pradofloxacin at 3 mg kg?1 once daily or with amoxycillin at 10 mg kg?1 and clavulanic acid at 2.5 mg kg?1 twice daily and evaluated weekly for 3 weeks and every 2 weeks thereafter until 2 weeks past clinical remission. Maximal treatment duration was 9 weeks, and maximal evaluation period was 11 weeks. Of the 56 dogs treated with pradofloxacin (group 1), 48 dogs (86%) achieved clinical remission, four dogs improved, four dogs did not respond and a recurrence of clinical signs was not seen in any patient after 11 weeks. Of the 51 dogs treated with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (group 2), 37 dogs achieved clinical remission (73%), three dogs showed improvement, five dogs showed no response and in six dogs, clinical signs recurred within 2 weeks of cessation of therapy. These results indicate that pradofloxacin is an efficacious therapy comparable to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid for deep bacterial pyoderma in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tracking the dispersal patterns and habitat use of migratory species is necessary to delineate optimal areas for protection, with large sample sizes being more representative of the population. Here, we examine the dispersal patterns of a key Mediterranean loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) breeding population to identify priority foraging sites for protection. Location Zakynthos Island, Greece and the wider Mediterranean. Method We examined the dispersal patterns and foraging sites of 75 adult loggerheads (n = 38 males and 37 females) tracked from the breeding area of Zakynthos Island (Greece) from 2004 to 2011. We then combined our data with published sea turtle literature to identify key foraging sites for protection. Results While both males and females exhibited similar dispersal patterns, about 25% males remained < 100 km of Zakynthos, whereas all females (except one) migrated > 200 km. Integration of our data with the wider literature isolated 10 core sites in proximity to existing protected areas, which could potentially protect 64% of the Zakynthos population, while five sites support individuals from at least 10 other loggerhead breeding populations. Main conclusions Due to the widespread availability of neritic foraging grounds across the Mediterranean, sea turtles from Zakynthos exhibit disparate dispersal patterns. However, protecting only a few objectively defined important sites can encompass a large proportion of the foraging areas used and hence have considerable conservation benefit.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.

AB  - Abstract Infants diagnosed non-organic failure-to-thrive (NOFT) show arrested physical development. The cause of the growth delay and of the accompanying behavioral anomalies is not known, but generally is attributed to maternal deprivation. This study investigated the hypothesis that family hostility was also a contributing factor. NOFT families were compared with maltreating and adequate families and found to be larger and more intact, but characterized by extremely distressed interpersonal relationships and family violence. This result was interpreted as suggesting that NOFT resulted from the stress of both insufficient and inappropriate treatment of the infant. The source of the stress was observed to include the entire family, the members of which were displaying other psychosomatic manifestations of stress.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to develop a diffusion tensor MR imaging pulse sequence that allows whole brain coverage with isotropic resolution within a clinically acceptable time. A single-shot, cardiac-gated MR pulse sequence, optimized for measuring the diffusion tensor in human brain, was developed to provide whole-brain coverage with isotropic (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) spatial resolution, within a total imaging time of approximately 15 min. The diffusion tensor was computed for each voxel in the whole volume and the data processed for visualization in three orthogonal planes. Anisotropy data were further visualized using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm. Finally, reconstruction of fiber-tract trajectories i.e., ?tractography? was performed. Images obtained with this pulse sequence provide clear delineation of individual white matter tracts, from the most superior cortical regions down to the cerebellum and brain stem. Because the data are acquired with isotropic resolution, they can be reformatted in any plane and the sequence can therefore be used, in general, for macroscopic neurological or psychiatric neuroimaging investigations. The 3D visualization afforded by maximum intensity projection imaging and tractography provided easy visualization of individual white matter fasciculi, which may be important sites of neuropathological degeneration or abnormal brain development. This study has shown that it is possible to obtain robust, high quality diffusion tensor MR data at 1.5 Tesla with isotropic resolution (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) from the whole brain within a sufficiently short imaging time that it may be incorporated into clinical imaging protocols.

Yet only a fraction of veterans with PTSD commit violent acts. The goals of this study were to (1) examine the higher-order factor structure of Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) scales in a sample of U.S. military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD; and (2) to evaluate the incremental validity of higher-order latent factors of the PAI over PTSD symptom severity in modeling aggression. The study sample included male U.S. Vietnam (n?=?433) and Iraq/Afghanistan (n?=?165) veterans who were seeking treatment for PTSD at an outpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic. Measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the PAI, and the Conflict Tactics Scale. The sample was randomly split into two equal subsamples (n's?=?299) to allow for cross-validation of statistically derived factors. Parallel analysis, variable clustering analysis, and confirmatory factor analyses were used to evaluate the factor structure, and regression was used to examine the association of factor scores with self-reports of aggression over the past year. Three factors were identified: internalizing, externalizing, and substance abuse. Externalizing explained unique variance in aggression beyond PTSD symptom severity and demographic factors, while internalizing and substance abuse did not. Service era was unrelated to reports of aggression. The constructs of internalizing versus externalizing dimensions of PTSD may have utility in identifying characteristics of combat veterans in the greatest need of treatment to help manage aggressive urges.
