AB  - Abstract Infants diagnosed non-organic failure-to-thrive (NOFT) show arrested physical development. The cause of the growth delay and of the accompanying behavioral anomalies is not known, but generally is attributed to maternal deprivation. This study investigated the hypothesis that family hostility was also a contributing factor. NOFT families were compared with maltreating and adequate families and found to be larger and more intact, but characterized by extremely distressed interpersonal relationships and family violence. This result was interpreted as suggesting that NOFT resulted from the stress of both insufficient and inappropriate treatment of the infant. The source of the stress was observed to include the entire family, the members of which were displaying other psychosomatic manifestations of stress.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to develop a diffusion tensor MR imaging pulse sequence that allows whole brain coverage with isotropic resolution within a clinically acceptable time. A single-shot, cardiac-gated MR pulse sequence, optimized for measuring the diffusion tensor in human brain, was developed to provide whole-brain coverage with isotropic (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) spatial resolution, within a total imaging time of approximately 15 min. The diffusion tensor was computed for each voxel in the whole volume and the data processed for visualization in three orthogonal planes. Anisotropy data were further visualized using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm. Finally, reconstruction of fiber-tract trajectories i.e., ?tractography? was performed. Images obtained with this pulse sequence provide clear delineation of individual white matter tracts, from the most superior cortical regions down to the cerebellum and brain stem. Because the data are acquired with isotropic resolution, they can be reformatted in any plane and the sequence can therefore be used, in general, for macroscopic neurological or psychiatric neuroimaging investigations. The 3D visualization afforded by maximum intensity projection imaging and tractography provided easy visualization of individual white matter fasciculi, which may be important sites of neuropathological degeneration or abnormal brain development. This study has shown that it is possible to obtain robust, high quality diffusion tensor MR data at 1.5 Tesla with isotropic resolution (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) from the whole brain within a sufficiently short imaging time that it may be incorporated into clinical imaging protocols.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - ABSTRACT Non-German accounts of the air war from inside Germany, 1939?1945, offer perspectives and evidence that are very distinct from what most German authors have been able to contribute. Yet they have not been registered in the recent debates about representations of German suffering in testimonies and literature (initiated by W. G. Sebald ten years ago). By looking at five issues specific to non-German writing, the present article proposes to open up the debate to these new voices: (1) Foreign experiences are distinctively sudden, open, ambivalent, dynamic and, by contrast, sharper in perception. (2) International reports are historical documents that have a particular value for understanding contemporary expectations, relative information and shifting judgments on the Allied bombing campaign. (3) Writers like Curzio Malaparte, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Kurt Vonnegut or Marie Vassiltchikov developed rhetorical and poetical means for representing the destruction without succumbing to the faults that Sebald diagnosed in most German writers, who repressed, stylised or banalised it. (4) Unlike many of their contemporary German counterparts, most international authors dealt with the uncanny aesthetics of an air raid without aestheticising it. (5) Finally, the article attempts an explanation for why international witnesses have not been heard in the politicised German debates. Their tendency to overemphasise introspection and moralism over comparative philology and historiography may have made many Germans deaf to the voices of foreigners.

The article argues that the outlines of this project to a large extent shaped the contours of Turkish nationalism then, and that they have hence been constitutive of Turkish nationalism ever since.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the number and causes of deaths of Australian citizens who died overseas in a 12-month period. DesignRetrospective survey of deaths reported to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by Australian embassies, high commissions and consulates for the period July 1992 to June 1993. Data on Australians travelling overseas were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ResultsDuring the year 1992-1993, 2 299 500 Australians travelled overseas for less than 12 months (short term travellers), with an estimated mean trip duration of 6.3 weeks. Another 65 450 left for more than 12 months (long term travellers), and 27 910 left permanently (residents). Of the 421 recorded deaths, 289 were in short term travellers, 108 in long term travellers/residents and 24 in members of work parties. The annual crude mortality rate for short term travellers and work party members was estimated at about 0.1%. Men outnumbered women almost 4:1. Death rates increased with age, reflecting underlying medical problems in older travellers, with heart disease being the leading cause (146 deaths, 35%). Fatal trauma predominated in younger people. Accidents, mainly in traffic, accounted for 77 deaths (18%) and infections for 10 (2.4%), including two cases of malaria. Death rates varied between geographical regions, with New Zealand being the safest destination. ConclusionsThe risk of an Australian dying while travelling overseas is probably little different from that while staying home. The low level of fatal infections may result from preventive measures. Travellers should be aware of the danger of accidents, particularly traffic accidents, while overseas.

AB  - How can we study the ?quality of psychoanalytic treatments?? The authors attempt to answer this question by discussing a naturalistic, multi-perspective and representative follow-up study of psychoanalyses and long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapies. We studied a representative sample (n = 401) of all the patients who had terminated their psychoanalytic treatments with members of the German Psychoanalytical Association (DPV) between 1990 and 1993. Between 70 and 80 per cent of the patients achieved (average 6.5 years after the end of treatment) good and stable psychic changes according to the evaluations of the patients themselves, their analysts, independent psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic experts, and questionnaires commonly applied in psychotherapy research. The evaluation of mental health costs showed a cost reduction through fewer days of sick leave during the seven years following the end of long-term psychoanalytic treatments. The results achieved using non-psychoanalytical instruments are complemented by the richness of the idiosyncratic findings, gained by the psychoanalytic research instruments.

AB  - Summary This chapter probes the nature, effectiveness, and limits of contemporary political film. Although it draws where relevant on theorists such as Badiou and Rancière, it also emphasizes the way in which the films themselves implicitly theorize the current context and how they respond to the implosion of the old leftist project, the emergence of new outsiders, and the instability of contemporary mobilizations. It considers the paradoxical way in which disembodied, globalized forces now play across newly isolated on-screen bodies. It contrasts a politics grounded in dis-identification with one rooted in identities. It tracks the rise of a negatively grounded ethics and of the figure of the victim as obstacles to a more productive cinematic politics and concludes by examining the shift in cinematic representations brought about by the current global crisis.

AB  - The article begins by challenging what is considered to be the relative neglect by child and family social work of the importance for children of school and teachers. Key roles of school in children's lives are conceptualized. School is argued to have potential as an ally for children, a guarantor of basic protection, a capacity builder, a secure base from which to explore the self and the world, an integrator into community and culture, a gateway to adult opportunities and a resource for parents and communities. It is suggested that school can have a special supportive value for children experiencing adversity, including those in state care or under supervision, those whose parents have divorced, and those recovering from abuse or neglect. The implications of the central importance of schools and teachers for child and family social work are discussed with reference to the child as client, work with teachers, work with the wider school and community, and policies in social work agencies and in education and training programmes for social workers and teachers.

AB  - Background and Methods. The infusion of dextran solutions is associated with haemodilution and, under some conditions, with a slight increase in plasma viscosity. To clarify the compound effects of simultaneous haemodilution and plasma viscosity increases on macro- and microhaemodynamics, we investigated the changes in arterial perfusion (radiolabelled microspheres, 15 ?rn ?) and oxygenation (tissue Po2) of vital organs using an animal model of plasma hyperviscosity. In nine splenectomized beagles plasma viscosity was increased step by step from 1.06 (baseline) to 2.14, and 2.99 mPas by infusion of small amounts (4% of total blood volume) of an ultra-high-molecular-weight dextran (50% w/v, mw: 500,000). Results. Despite the significant increase in plasma viscosity, cardiac output as well as specific organ blood flows in heart, brain, liver, and muscle rose steadily with each step of viscosity, while the haematocrit declined from 0.31 to 0.24 and 0.20, respectively. Medians of tissue Po2 in liver peaked at a viscosity of 2 mPa.s and returned to baseline values at 3 mPa.s, whereas in non-working skeletal muscle Po2 values were maximal at 3 mPa.s. Conclusion. These results indicate that the impact of plasma viscosity on the rheological properties of whole blood is completely offset by die concomitant reduction of haematocrit. Thus, the comparatively minor changes in plasma viscosity observed after prolonged use of clinical dextrans and other colloids in no way compromise the perfusion and oxygenation of vital organs.
