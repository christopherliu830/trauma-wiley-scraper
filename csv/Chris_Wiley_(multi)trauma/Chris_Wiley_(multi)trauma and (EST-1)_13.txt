AB  - Abstract:? The term active imagination is sometimes applied rather uncritically to describe all forms of creative activity that take place in depth psychology. Whilst there are many forms of expression that evoke or are evoked by active imagination, they cannot automatically be classed as active imagination. In this article investigation of visualized mental imagery, dreams and art reveals three distinct forms of image-based psychological activity. Integrated and mediated within the transference and countertransference dynamic, it is proposed that the engagement in active imagination reflects and is influenced by the transference. Distinctions between sign and symbol, simple and big dreams as well as diagrammatic and embodied imagery clarify the differences. Examples from clinical practice demonstrate each mode in action within the analytic frame.

PY  - 1996
AB  - Abstract One of the registers of the language of tourism is ?Greenspeak?, a promotional discourse which focuses on the environment and the corresponding motivations of the new green tourist Like the language of tourism itself, Greenspeak is also multi-layered. This paper, while acknowledging that such a language is both pictorial and verbal, concentrates on the latter component The first outer covering or surface layer sees the advertiser luring the eco-tourist through a series of captions or headlines, some of which are accompanied by brief explanatory messages. A perusal of a number of print media advertisements demonstrates an attempt to woo the client by contrasting the simplicity of the destination area with the complexities of an alienated urban existence in the consumer. Travel thus becomes a liberating escape with limitless possibilities. The second layer witnesses Greenspeak's attempt to associate itself with various principles of eco-tourism. At a covert level, however, the eco-explicitness of the message hides the agenda of the promoter, i.e. the exploitation of the periphery by the centre and the appropriation of rural patrimony by outsiders. The third layer shows how Greenspeak tries to convert the themes of conventional mass tourism ('sun', ?sea?, ?sand? and ?sex?) to those of eco-tourism ('nature', ?nostalgia? and ?nirvana?), the latter being separately examined with several examples. However, closer inspection reveals that ?nature?, instead of being presented in its pristine form, is offered as a ?cooked? version of ?raw nature? ? a cultural production of the ?natural?. Furthermore, the sexual imagery it seeks to replace is still present in a discourse of narcissism. Similarly, ?nostalgia? is based on a romantic socially constructed version of reality, one that is underpinned by eco-fundamentalism. Finally, ?nirvana?, which is a Greenspeak substitute for ?paradise?, completes the trilogy. Yet even here, blissful union with nature is largely a flattened and contrived experience.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.
