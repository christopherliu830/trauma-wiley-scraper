AB  - Abstract:? Group process experience for analytic candidates is a neglected dimension of training, and receives little attention in the analytic literature. Jung observed group dynamics, but he never studied them closely, attending instead to the psychology of the individual. Unconscious currents in small groups have been studied by others, most notably by Wilfred Bion, and there are similarities between his theories of the group unconscious and Jung's theories of complexes. Experiential and didactic seminars in group process were added to the analytic curriculum at the C.G. Jung Institute of San Francisco in the early 1990s, leading to changes in the group dynamic of trainees and analysts alike. A discussion of the theories of Bion and Jung are followed by a report on our experiences of facilitating group process for analytic candidates. We give quotes from candidates and analyst members to illustrate the group process and its effects. The need for further study to develop a uniquely Jungian perspective on the unconscious structure and dynamics of the group is suggested.

AB  - In this paper I consider the individual nature of the way a person develops senses of time. I suggest that something of a patient's early, unvoiced, experience is revealed through the temporal rhythms of interaction with the therapist. I refer to development, cycles of experience, metabolism, transgenerational emotions, experiences of beginnings and endings, early interactions with (m)other, together with narrative and its relation to unconscious processes. Experiences of time within the session indicate the nature of the feelings that are being lived, or refused life. I consider the paradox of living in the present and its relation to chronology. Lastly I give an example of the difficulty of timing comments when there is no flow of feeling, which is, itself, a communication.

AB  - This paper is informed by contemporary literature in two fields-neonatal research, on the one hand, and the burgeoning interdisciplinary interest in Moses and monotheism, on the other. The author postulates that a cluster of traumatic events during the first two years of Freud's life compelled him to repeat what could not be remembered. Embedded in charged implicit schema, these affects remained unprocessed in Freud, who alone of all psychoanalysts did not have an analysis, manifesting in an uncanny dread/allure of the ?prehistoric? as a dark and dangerous era relating to the archaic feminine/maternal matrix and fratricidal murderousness. Furthermore, she cites evidence to suggest that for Freud this unconsciously excluded subtext of the preoedipal era became associated with ancient Egyptian and Minoan-Mycenaean cultures, a passionate fascination actualized in his collection of antiquities yet incongruously absent in his theoretical work, with three exceptions-Egyptian allusions in Leonardo's unconscious attachment to his archaic mother; the ?Minoan-Mycenaean? analogy on discovering the pre-oedipal mother shortly after the death of Freud's own mother; and Egypt as cradle of humanity in his uncharacteristically rambling, troubled text of Moses and monotheism. The author sees Freud's conceptual avoidance yet compulsive reworking of the prehistoric matrix as a symptomatic attempt to expose early unformulated representations that ?return to exert a powerful effect.?

AB  - Abstract Recent scholarship has reinvigorated the study of the battlefields of the Western Front. Inspired by these advances and, especially, the advent of an archaeological agenda on the former fields of conflict, this article examines how British soldiers reacted with the landscape and materials which surrounded them. Using archive material to build an ethnographic study, the article investigates violence and death in the battlefield and how the soldiers responded to this hostile environment.

AB  - The post-apartheid period has been marked by a dual relation to memory. On the one hand, the process of reconciliation, nation-building and abolition of the colour line has engaged a definitive rupture with the past. On the other hand, a form of resentment expresses a more ambivalent and painful acknowledgement that the past is still deeply present through racism, inequalities and prejudices. The AIDS crisis both as an objective ? the rapid spread of the infection ? and subjective phenomenon ? the apprehension of the epidemic through controversies ? has revealed this duality. Using Thabo Mbeki's statements on the infection, but also on race relations and national commemorations, I try to analyse beyond the obvious paranoid style a politics of memory which unveils hidden truths. The embodiment of the past thus recovered involves both the historical condition, that is the inscription of social structures in bodies and lives, and the experience of history, understood as the elaboration of representations, discourses and narratives accounting for the course of events. Considered in this light, conspiracy theories become not so much fantasies as factual realities, including genocidal projects under apartheid. The recognition of this unfinished business of time is a necessary step in the construction of a common future.

AB  - ABSTRACT Instrumental conditioning has been implicated in persistence at slot machine gambling, but its specific role remains unclear. Dopamine (DA) mediates aspects of instrumental responding, and D2 antagonists reliably alter this process. This study investigated the effects of the preferential D2 antagonist, haloperidol (3?mg) on reward-related betting behavior in 20 subjects with pathological gambling (PG) and 18 healthy Controls. Hierarchical regression assessed the prospective relationship between Payoff and Bet Size on consecutive trials, along with potential moderating effects of Cumulative Winnings and Phase of game (early/late) under drug and placebo. Payoff predicted Bet Size on the next trial regardless of other factors, consistent with an instrumental view of slot machine gambling. Under placebo, this correlation varied as a function of Winnings and Phase in PG subjects but was strong and invariant in Controls. Under haloperidol, the Payoff?Bet Size correlation in PG subjects resembled the invariant pattern of Controls under placebo. In contrast, the Payoff?Bet Size correlation rose then fell sharply over trials under haloperidol in controls. The correlation of Payoff with Bet Size is remarkable given that there is no actual contingency between winning and betting, and suggests that reward expectancies largely drive slot machine gambling. By blocking inhibitory D2 receptors, haloperidol may have reversed ?tolerance? to monetary reward mediated by increased tonic DA in PG subjects. Disturbance of the Payoff?Bet Size correlation in Controls may reflect indiscriminate reward signaling under haloperidol in subjects with normal DA function. Indirect enhancement of DA transmission may reduce undue reward-related responding in PG subjects.
