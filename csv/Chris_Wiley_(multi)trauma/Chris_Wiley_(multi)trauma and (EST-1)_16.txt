AB  - Abstract The definition of osteoporosis has evolved beyond low bone mineral density to include impaired bone morphology and matrix properties. As such, the subsequent bone density insufficiencies extend beyond the skeletal risks of fracture and have implications for oral health management patients. As our population ages there is a worldwide increase in the risk of decreased bone mineral density and its subsequent morbidity. This makes age an independent risk factor for fracture and decreased bone mineral density. Multiple examinations and diagnostic tests are currently used in combination to develop an algorithm to assess osteoporotic risk. Oral health care professionals should follow these principles and caution should be used in applying a single independent assessment to determine a patient's osteoporotic or bone metabolism risk. Therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis are often divided into nonpharmacological interventions and pharmacological therapies. The periodontist and other oral health care professionals should have a full understanding of the therapeutic options, benefits and implementation of preventive therapies. Bone turnover is a coupled event of bone formation and bone resorption and it is the imbalance of this homeostasis that results in osteoporosis. Based on this uncoupling of bone resorption and formation, osteoporosis or decreased bone mineral density and osteopenia, may be a risk factor for alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. The role of prevention and maintenance with a history of periodontitis and oesteopenia extends beyond biofilm control and should include management of bone mineral density. The chronic periodontal infection in a patient with osteopenia may place the patient at greatly increased risk for alveolar bone loss, gingival recession and root caries. A key component in the management is the oral health professional's knowledge of the interrelationship between skeletal health and periodontal health.

AB  - The status of efforts to indigenize psychology in the Philippines is reviewed. We address progress in four aspects of indigenization: theoretical/conceptual, methodological, topical, and institutional. Much, but not all, of this progress is the result of efforts associated with the indigenous Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology) movement, which emphasizes (a) the development of a Filipino psychology that reflects the unique experiences and orientations of Filipinos, (b) Filipino identity and national consciousness, (c) explicit socio-political considerations, (d) application of psychology to societal problems, (e) the study of less elite Filipinos, (f) interdisciplinary efforts, and (g) the use of indigenous languages in the development and dissemination of indigenous psychology. We note considerable progress, but also controversy, in the selection and interpretation of indigenous concepts and less progress in the formulation of indigenous theories. Existing theories are narrow in scope, only partially specified, and have uncertain heuristic value in generating verifiable predictions. Filipino psychologists have also adapted or further specified Western theoretical frameworks to make them more sensitive to Philippine contextual factors. Many indigenous measures have been developed, but more information is needed on their psychometric properties. Several indigenous research methods have been described and these methods typically emphasize the importance of the researcher-participant relationship. There remain questions about the objectivity and cultural uniqueness of these methods, however, many of which involve (a) unstructured conversations and discussions in lieu of structured interviews, (b) varying degrees of participant observation, or (c) qualitative phenomenological methods. Extensive topical indigenization is evident in studies that focus on everyday Filipinos and Philippine societal concerns. Institutional indigenization is reflected in courses, theses and dissertations, journals, books, conferences, and professional organizations with an indigenous focus. Potential limitations or risks to the indigenous movement include insularity and the limited research culture. Implications of the Philippine case for indigenization efforts in other cultures are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Psychiatric disorders and behaviour problems were found lo be commoner in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in matched comparison groups with tension headache and diabetes as well as in healthy children. Depression, anxiety and low self-esteem were common. Many children denied their problems. This may be due to the type of illness, its social consequences and the embarrassment experienced by the children. Discrepancies were found between the children's and their mothers' replies. These results are discussed in terms of their implication fur paediatric practice.

AB  - The first part of this paper discusses the development of Freud's views on memory from the time of the Project up to the formulation of the second topography. Freud's attempts to match his psychological views with an organic model were necessarily inconclusive, but in the process many innovative ideas about memory can be seen to resonate with recent developments in cognitive neuroscience. A brief discussion of perceptual identity, internal perception and Freud's affect theory introduce the central theoretical idea in the second half of the paper, namely that Identification can be seen as a form of memory. Modern memory theory is linked with the superego, following which the author proposes that internal objects might be renamed ?memory-objects? and that these can be understood in terms of the distinction made in cognitive neuroscience between implicit and explicit memory and between different parts of the brain, in particular the amygdala, the basal ganglia and the hippocampus. Klein's ?memory in feeling? and the views of Fairbairn and Ogden in relation to the dynamic nature of internal objects are briefly discussed. The paper ends with a few comments on the aberrations of memory and some implications of the implicit memory-object system.

AB  - Abstract The Wollemi pine, Wollemia nobilis (Araucariaceae), was discovered in 1994 as the only extant member of the genus, previously known only from the fossil record. With fewer than 100 trees known from an inaccessible canyon in southeastern Australia, it is one of the most endangered tree species in the world. We conducted a comparative population genetic survey at allozyme, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci in W. nobilis, Araucaria cunninghamii and Agathis robusta ? representatives of the two sister genera. No polymorphism was detected at 13 allozyme loci, more than 800 AFLP loci or the 20 SSR loci screened in W. nobilis. In Ag. robusta only one of 12 allozyme loci, five of 800 AFLP loci and none of the 15 SSR loci were variable. For A. cunninghamii, 10 of > 800 AFLP loci and five of 20 SSR loci were variable. Thus low genetic diversity characterizes all three species. While not ruling out the existence of genetic variation, we conclude that genetic diversity is exceptionally low in the Wollemi pine. To our knowledge this is the most extreme case known in plants. We conclude that the combination of small population effects, clonality and below-average genetic variation in the family are probable contributing factors to the low diversity. The exceptionally low genetic diversity of the Wollemi pine, combined with its known susceptibility to exotic fungal pathogens, reinforces current management policies of strict control of access to the pines and secrecy of the pine locations.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the success of strategies ?including replacing petrol with aviation gasoline (avgas) in the fuel supply, and employment and skills-training programs targeting young people ?in reducing petrol sniffing at Maningrida, an isolated Aboriginal community in northern Australia. MethodsA follow-up study of 13 Aboriginals who were non-sniffers, 15 who were ex-sniffers and 27 who were petrol sniffers in 1992 was conducted by questionnaire in 1994, 20 months after intervention strategies were commenced; 11 non-sniffers, 11 ex-sniffers and 18 petrol sniffers, respectively, participated. Main outcome measuresPetrol-sniffing status, changes in employment status, blood lead levels of the participants, and community crime statistics. ResultsAfter intervention strategies in Maningrida, petrol sniffing ceased, with related crime falling markedly. Employment increased significantly among petrol sniffers, from 7% to 63% (x2= 11.53; df= 1; P< 0.001). Only two petrol sniffers were reported to have continued petrol sniffing elsewhere. Apart from one of these individuals, who had recently returned to Maningrida, blood lead levels fell significantly in those with a history of petrol sniffing, indicating they had not continued to sniff avgas, which contains lead additives (0.8 g/L). ConclusionsWhile avgas introduction was a key element in eliminating petrol sniffing, its apparent lack of success as a single intervention elsewhere indicates the importance of widespread community resolve against petrol sniffing and the development of coordinated employment strategies in successfully eliminating the practice and reducing associated social disruption.

AB  - Psychoanalytic theory and practice tend to focus on metaphorical and symbolic mental representations in a way that often pushes aside the importance of a bodily ?presence? possessing qualities that can not and should not be subordinated to the representational structure. By introducing the ?body?container? model, this paper reintroduces the concrete physical body into the psychoanalytic discourse in a more direct way. This clinical?theoretical model links the ?body-ego? (Freud, 1923) to the container idea (Bion, 1962) aiming to creates a new integrative psyche-soma scheme. The ?body?container? experience is available as a subjective realization through a priori psycho-physical forms structured as an envelope and a central vertical axis. These forms are the outcome of our given bodily structure experienced under the ?magnetic? force of object relation. The mental envelope is already discussed in psychoanalytic theory (Anzieu, 1989, 1990; Bick, 1968) and I wish to introduce the characteristics of the vertical axis which I call ?the frontal spine?, emphasizing its constitutional reciprocity with the skin envelope. The proposed model offers new insights into the psycho-physical organization in primitive mental states and may contribute to the understanding of the complementary structural relation between embodied and represented in human experience. Two clinical examples illustrate the therapeutic work relevant to disturbances in the primal psycho-physical space organization at different developmental levels.

AB  - Sometimes the diagnosis of HIV in a child is the first sign that other family members are affected by the virus. The immature immune system of children responds to HIV infection differently to that of adults. Disease progression is rapid in some, but most progress to AIDS at a similar or slower rate than do adults, A lack of developed immunity to various pathogens means that children are at special risk of opportunistic infection, demanding alert clinical management.

AB  - Magic is the continuation of politics by other means. This, at least, has been the case in North Maluku since the political reshuffle that followed the fall of Suharto and the implementation of decentralization in Indonesia. The strategies pursued by the regional elite to obtain lucrative positions in the new landscape opened up by regional autonomy are thus seen to be thwarted by sorcery from political rivals. Following the life and death of Muhammad, a North Malukan political entrepreneur, I show how sorcery plays an integral part in the new politics of democratization in Indonesia. Political sorcery thrives, I argue, in a complex moral economy that mixes local ideas of sociality, political practices of patrimonialism, and global discourses of democracy. Sorcery and corruption are part of the same political imagination, because both speak ambivalently to the problems of power in times of change. Rather than being anathema to democracy, as the new global discourse on transparency would have it, the occult politics of corruption and sorcery are among the means through which a contested form of democracy is conceptualized and implemented in Indonesia.

AB  - Abstract The introduction of insulin therapy for the management of diabetes mellitus is arguably the greatest milestone in the history of modern medicine. ?-cell replacement therapy is the only treatment that reestablishes and maintains long-term physiological normoglycemia. Until recently, successful clinical outcomes of pancreas transplantation for patients with long-standing diabetes were much superior to that of islet transplantation. Significant advances in islet isolation and purification technology, the development of more specific and less diabetogenic immunosuppressants and the prophylactic administration of antiviral agents have rekindled a worldwide interest in islet transplantation. This chapter will review the rationale of islet transplantation and the development of islet isolation and purification. The challenges facing clinical islet transplantation in the twenty-first century will also be introduced.
