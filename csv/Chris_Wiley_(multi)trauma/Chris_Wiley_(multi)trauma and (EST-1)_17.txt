AB  - Australia has been backward in providing safe conditions for workers. Occupational physicians have had to battle indifference, if not active opposition. Political expedience, not science, has tended to determine outcomes.

AB  - Purpose:? Studies out of the United States and United Kingdom show great variability in practices relating to prostatic biopsy. This survey was performed to evaluate current practices in Australia and New Zealand. Methods:? Questionnaires were sent to Australian and New Zealand Urologists and Trainees on the database of the Urological Society of Australasia. Results:? Significant variability exists with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation; analgesic use; number of cores taken; and repeat biopsy practices. Most urologists (91%) perform their own biopsies. 9% refer to another urologist or radiologist. Transrectal biopsy is the favoured approach in 97%. Most urologists (96%) use antibiotic prophylaxis with the quinolone antibiotics being the most commonly used. Only 42% use bowel preparation for their biopsies. Analgesia is used in 79% with equal numbers using sedation and periprostatic nerve block. 77% take 10 cores or more for first biopsy. 28% do not inform their patients of a false negative rate with TRUS biopsy of the prostate. There were 36% and 60% who would not re-biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP respectively. Conclusions:? Prostate biopsy is a commonly performed procedure to diagnose carcinoma of the prostate. Despite significant variability, most Urologists and Trainees in Australia and New Zealand have safe biopsy protocols, given the evidence that is currently available. Evidence supports the use of analgesia and repeating biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP.

AB  - Abstract This article seeks to solve the puzzle of what explains Irish peace policy norm consistency for over three centuries and the recent reversal of these norms. The methodology analyses values and identities in Irish leaders' foreign policy discourses and practices, producing evidence that Irish peace policy norms are consistently: independence and neutrality for Ireland in the cause of peace and security; self-determination; anti-imperialism; third world solidarity; and resistance to famine and slavery. In the early 1900s, after Ireland gained statehood, the addition of: institutional cooperation; a constitutional commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes; armed neutrality; UN peacekeeping; and an explicit subordination of material interests for moral, justice-based norms, made this small postcolonial state an historically-driven Natural Born Peacemaker. Elite-led norm reversals consolidated in the 2000s suggests a vital explanatory relationship with elite corruption and associated specific personality characteristics, and the need to revise elite socialisation theory to incorporate these variables.

AB  - Beginning with the ways in which the use of the couch lends ?depth to the surface? (Erikson, 1954), I explore the topography of the inter- and intrasubjective psychoanalytic situation and process. I suggest that defences are not by definition unconscious but rather can be observed operating at conscious and preconscious levels, particularly under these conditions. A focus on preconscious disavowal provides a window on what has become unconscious repression. As a result of eliciting and then verbalising the operation of such defences with regard to anxieties in the here-and-now transference, declarative memories of increasingly specific childhood fantasies and events begin to hold sway over unmanageable procedural remnants from the analysand's past. With this may even come the possibility of neuronal regeneration, the more generalisable enhancement of declarative and symbolic functions and the sense of identity with which these are associated. Herein may lie one enduring therapeutic effect of the ?talking cure? - putting feelings into words - as one among a variety of psychotherapeutic modalities.

AB  - The underlying concern of this paper is that psychoanalysis as practised today is in danger of losing its specificity and so losing its way. The author suggests this is possible for three reasons: the problem analysts face in responding to the strong emotional demands the great majority of patients necessarily place on them, the unintended consequences of the apparent success of ?here and now technique? and the absence of good clinical theory. The paper mainly discusses the author?s ideas about some core elements of the clinical theory that all psychoanalysts must use when they are working and proposes (at the risk of being facile) some relatively simple heuristics related to them which are meant to be helpful. Recalling Kurt Lewin?s maxim that ?there is nothing so practical as a good theory?, he will suggest that continuous reflection on how one is using theory in daily practice is highly practical, if the theory is good enough. Theory in fact is a necessary ?third? in psychoanalytic practice which, if kept in sufficient working order close enough to clinical experience, provides an ongoing and very necessary check on our sense of reality. But, of course, as a third it can, like reality itself, be the focus of both love and hate with equally problematic consequences. The paper starts with a clinical example of a difficult but apparently successful analysis reaching its end, which will be used throughout the paper to illustrate and elaborate the theoretical ideas set out.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in acute conjunctivitis (non-trachoma) in Australia and to examine the source of transmission. Design: A prospective survey of 400 consecutive patients presenting with acute conjunctivitis to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Emergency Department, Melbourne, from May to November 1991. Patients identified with chlamydial conjunctivitis during the survey period and in the following two months were assessed for concomitant genital infection. Results: Chlamydia was the causative organism in 2% of patients with acute conjunctivitis. Of 15 patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis, 11 presented with disease in one eye only, and the same number had had symptoms for longer than two weeks. Many had been seen previously by experienced ophthalmologists, yet there were long delays in making a definitive diagnosis. Ten of the 12 adult patients who were assessed had signs of concomitant genital tract infection, although none had past or current genital tract symptoms. Serotyping of chlamydial isolates from the genital tract and eye showed concordance in individual patients. Conclusion: Most cases of ocular chlamydia infection have a genital source. Therefore, it is essential that all patients with chlamydial conjunctivitis and their sexual partners are examined and treated for concomitant genital infection.
