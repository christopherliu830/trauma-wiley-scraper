AB  - ABSTRACT. The wealth, variety and seaborne accessibility of Mediterranean societies since late prehistory have made the region's cultural heritage the world's most widely acclaimed. But since the fall of the Roman Empire the Mediterranean has been increasingly disadvantaged, its history compromised, its legacy beleaguered. Two millennia of invasion and rapine, religious vendetta, foreign conquest, imperial dominion and colonial subjugation have left Mediterranean peoples with fewer resources and weaker infrastructures than those of transalpine and transatlantic nation-states. The consequences for the care and control of Mediterranean heritage are parlous. That heritage is both the region's self-defining pride and its economic mainstay, yet a crippling burden to protect and maintain, let alone to interpret and celebrate. It is everywhere beset by natural and human attrition. Weathering and erosion, illicit excavation and pillage, tomb robbery and the international antiquities market exact tolls that legal codes and police forces are all but impotent to stem. Recent social and political trends suggest potential remedies for some of these dilemmas.

AB  - Summary Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Zingiberaceae, which is native to tropical South Asia. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world and possesses high nutritional value. India is the main producer and exporter of turmeric in the world. It is commonly used as a spice for flavoring and also as a natural colorant with a variety of applications, such as its use as a condiment, in cosmetics, and as a dye, besides being a potential source of therapeutically important molecules. Turmeric powder contains 2?8% curcumin, which is the main biologically active phytochemical compound. Moderate genetic variability exists in the crop, and cultivars vary in yield, cropping duration, and quality. Clonal selection has played a significant role in developing several high-yielding varieties. Turmeric is grown under both rain-fed and irrigated conditions. It can also be grown as a component and intercrop with other crops. The crop is harvested seven to nine?months after planting, depending on the cultivar, soil, and growing conditions. The scope of this review includes the taxonomy, morphology, cytology, genetic diversity, and improvement of turmeric. This review highlights research achievements of biotechnology and newfound knowledge in plant genomics, which will result in the development of promising cultivars. Horticultural aspects and postharvest processing of turmeric are also discussed.

AB  - The author takes a renewed look at the constitutive aspects of experience, looking at it as process rather than contents. Recently more psychoanalytic voices are discernible that argue for the complexity and multi-leveled nature of inner experience. Yet the predominant and preeminent psychoanalytic voice has traditionally emphasized the linearity and single-factored nature of experience and all that is based on it: development, object relations, psychopathology, and treatment. The author offers an understanding of experience as stemming from the operation of two contiguous, ongoing modalities of processing internal and external input, and reflecting two polarities of the subject-object experience: of separateness and instrumentality, and of oneness and ongoing being. Such a conceptual reframing of experience harbors multiple implications for understanding subjectivity and inter-subjectivity, inter-relatedness as well as single-person psychology, and the all-important role of an experiential ?goodness-of-fit? in the analytic situation and elsewhere.

AB  - Summary In the 2000s, following the Algerian civil war (known as the Black Decade, and in French as la décennie noire or les années noires, 1990?2005), Algerian women on screen and behind the camera are defining new female roles in society. Post-civil war films today challenge the overdetermined, masculine narratives of post-independent Algerian cinema cultivated immediately after independence in 1962. They also wrestle the art form from the nation's ruling, one party, dogmatic Front de Libération Nationale's (FLN) Master Narrative which dictated the storylines of Algerian cinema for decades, sidelining the inherent ethnic and linguistic diversity of the country. This chapter considers how women have become the linchpin for progress and social change as depicted in Masquerades (2008) by Lyès Salem and Rachida (2003) by Yamina Bachir-Chouikh, as they challenge the construction of the Nation-Image that held them hostage to the patriarchal status quo in the 1970s, 1980s, and even the 1990s.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the estimated death rates associated with alcohol and tobacco use for Australian Aboriginals in Western Australia with those for non-Aboriginals. Method: Deaths attributable to tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were estimated for 1989?1991 with the aetiological fractions method, using data from the Health Department of Western Australia's mortality database. Results: Tobacco smoking was responsible for 15.4% of all deaths and 13.9% of Aboriginal deaths, and alcohol consumption for 5% and 9.2%, respectively. The age-standardised death rates per 100000 person-years for tobacco and alcohol were: Aboriginal males, 271 and 152; other males, 113 and 29; Aboriginal females, 118 and 56; and other females, 32 and 15. Of those who died as a result of tobacco use, 49% of Aboriginal males and 48% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in non-Aboriginal males. For alcohol-related deaths, 62% of Aboriginal males and 70% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 35% and 23%, respectively, in non-Aboriginals. Conclusion: During 1989?1991 tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were responsible for much higher death rates among Aboriginals than among non-Aboriginals in Western Australia.
