AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the clinical and epidemiological features of an outbreak of a viral infection affecting humans and horses. SettingStables in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane. SubjectsAffected horses and humans, and at-risk human contacts. Results: A pregnant mare died two days after arrival from a paddock elsewhere in Brisbane. Eight to 11 days later, illness (depression, anorexia, fever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal discharge) was reported among 17 other horses from the same or an adjoining stable. Fourteen horses died or were put down. Five and six days after the index mare's death, a stable-hand and then a horse trainer, both of whom had had close contact with the sick mare's mucous secretions, developed influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand recovered but the trainer developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis, and died from a cardiac arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A morbillivirus cultured from his kidney was identical to one isolated from the lungs of five affected horses. The two affected humans and eight other horses were seropositive for the infection, which was reproduced in healthy horses following challenge by spleen/lung homogenates from infected horses. There was no serological evidence of infection in 157 humans who had had contact with the stables or the sick horses or humans. ConclusionsA previously undescribed morbillivirus infected a probable 21 horses and two humans; one human and 14 horses died. That no further cases were detected among humans suggests that the virus was of low infectivity. The source of infection remains undetermined.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the estimated death rates associated with alcohol and tobacco use for Australian Aboriginals in Western Australia with those for non-Aboriginals. Method: Deaths attributable to tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were estimated for 1989?1991 with the aetiological fractions method, using data from the Health Department of Western Australia's mortality database. Results: Tobacco smoking was responsible for 15.4% of all deaths and 13.9% of Aboriginal deaths, and alcohol consumption for 5% and 9.2%, respectively. The age-standardised death rates per 100000 person-years for tobacco and alcohol were: Aboriginal males, 271 and 152; other males, 113 and 29; Aboriginal females, 118 and 56; and other females, 32 and 15. Of those who died as a result of tobacco use, 49% of Aboriginal males and 48% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in non-Aboriginal males. For alcohol-related deaths, 62% of Aboriginal males and 70% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 35% and 23%, respectively, in non-Aboriginals. Conclusion: During 1989?1991 tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were responsible for much higher death rates among Aboriginals than among non-Aboriginals in Western Australia.

AB  - The author begins by pointing out that myths have always been powerful vehicles for the projection of ubiquitous unconscious fantasies. Having noted the importance of certain male protagonists of the Greek myths in Freud's theories, she observes that their female counterparts exert an equal fascination and suggests that the Medea myth as recounted by Euripides can be invoked to elucidate a central unconscious fantasy found to underlie the psychogenic frigidity and sterility of several of her female patients. The manifestation of this ?Medea fantasy? is illustrated by a clinical account in which a dream is analysed. The author next summarises the Medea story as told by Euripides and attempts a psychoanalytic interpretation of it. She draws attention to features of the ?unconscious truth? inherent in the myth that were shared by all the members of her group of patients. A case history then shows how the progressive understanding and working through of the Medea fantasy led to a change in the analysand's experience of femininity and enabled her to have children. It is postulated that both early infantile sexual fantasies and repressed memories of early objectrelations traumas such as maternal depression combine with ubiquitous bodily fantasies to produce the unconscious Medea fantasy.

AB  - Abstract The treatment of gastrointestinal cancer and the prognosis of patients with this disease have changed very little over the past several decades. No screening tools have been developed which allow this disease to be surgically treated for cure at an early stage. None of the forms of adjuvant chemotherapy instituted in the months and years after surgical resection of cancer have been successful. We show that resection site recurrence and spread of disease on the peritoneal surfaces are the most common sites for surgical treatment failure. By changing the route of administration and the timing of chemotherapy, the efficacy of drugs now routinely employed in gastrointestinal cancer can be markedly improved. Our early studies suggest that there is a definite change in the natural history of these malignancies when intraperitoneal chemotherapy is administered immediately after surgery. The pharmacology and physiology of drug delivery in the immediate postoperative period are explored. Toxicity studies have been performed in a series of treatment protocols already in use. These protocols need to be subjected to randomized controlled trials in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by a progressive loss of memory, reasoning, judgment, and orientation, by the presence of large numbers of extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, as well as substantial cell loss in the brain. Genetic studies in early onset families have identified mutations in three genes that cause AD, while genetic studies in sporadic AD have identified the apolipoprotein E4 allele as a risk factor for disease. In vitro cell biology and transgenic mouse studies implicate all of these genes in the biology of A? metabolism. A consistent effect of these genetic factors is an increase in A? deposition. Furthermore, cell biology studies have identified targets for possible treatment of AD. Transgenic models are now being used to test the validity of these targets and therapeutic approaches to the treatment of AD.

AB  - Abstract Cell sheet technology enables novel approaches to tissue engineering without the use of biodegradable scaffolds. Cell sheet technology consists of a temperature-responsive culture dish, which enables reversible cell adhesion to and detachment from the dish surface by controllable hydrophobicity of the surface. This allows for a non-invasive harvest of cultured cells as an intact monolayer cell sheet including deposited extra cellular matrices. The monolayer cell sheet can be transplanted to host tissues without using biodegradable scaffolds and sutures. Thick tissue constructs and patterned cell sheets using two or more kinds of cell source are also developed by means of layered cell sheets in vitro. This Progress Report summarizes temperature-controlled cell adhesion-detachment behavior and applications of the cell sheet technology to regeneration of cornea, periodontal ligament, bladder epithelia, oesophageal epithelia, myocardium, and liver.

AB  - Rather than understanding ?lying? or deception as a weapon of the oppressed, I use a Machiavellian and Nietzschean framework to investigate linguistic technologies of power that involve deception in contemporary Sri Lanka. My argument is based on distinct speech events collected in the village of Udahenagama and elite circles in Colombo: youthful flirtations, ritual negotiations with spirits, conversations with government officials and soldiers, a reported presidential diplomatic exchange, and everyday village banter. I highlight how the focus of the deceptive recorded interactions is revelation, rather than concealment, and I thereby propose a supplementary translation of the practice of telling boru, as obvious pretence. Obvious pretence is an important aspect of Sinhala linguistic technologies of power which imbue interdependent micro- and macro-level political spheres. I use Bakhtin's work on tones to describe how ?obvious pretence? intertwines, on the one hand, a tone of domination, aggression, and superiority, and, on the other hand, a tone of accommodation, conflict avoidance, and courtship. An aesthetic of power ? as the power to deceive ? lies in the tension between those two opposing tones, which are encompassed within the single linguistic and pragmatic practice of ?obvious pretence?.
