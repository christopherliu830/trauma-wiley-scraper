AB  - Abstract Migraine has been associated with diseases considered to be related to extracellular matrix disorders?in particular, cervical artery dissection. In this population-based study, we found a highly significant association between migraine and the activity of serum elastase, a metalloendopeptidase degrading specific elastin-type amino acid sequences. Such enzymes are involved in matrix degradation. This association was seen in both sexes and was stronger for migraine with aura. These findings could help in the understanding of why patients with migraine are at higher risk of stroke. Further study is needed to establish whether extracellular matrix abnormalities play a broader role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Ann Neurol 2000;47:648?651

AB  - Progressive brachial and lumbosacral radiculoplexopathies are well known, though infrequent, delayed complications of local irradiation. They present as slowly progressive, generally bilateral but asymmetric, limb weakness mainly affecting distal muscles. The pathogenesis is unknown although some authors supposed an autoimmune process or radio-induced DNA changes. No treatment for this disease is currently available even if some benefits, though transient, have been reported after steroid treatment and more recently, high-dose immunoglobulins (IVIg), suggesting a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis. We previously reported on the beneficial effect of immunotherapies in two patients with postirradiation motor radiculoplexopathy. The first patient had a severe motor lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy starting 20 years after local radiotherapy for seminoma. He became able to walk and run with less waddling and to climb stairs without support after treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. The other patient had severe left brachial and bilateral lumbosacral plexopathies presenting 12 years after toracoascellar and lumbar irradiation for a Hodgkin lymphoma. She improved her right leg strength after one course of IVIg. After one year of continuous steroid therapy the first patient started to progressively deteriorate notwithstanding the subsequent administration of IVIg, resumed courses of steroids, plasma exchanges and azathioprine. The second patient, after one year of continuous IVIg treatment which led to stabilization without further improvement, was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and plasma exchange, with a marginal and transient amelioration followed by progressive worsening that was not halted by the resumption of IVIg. Both patients now suspended any therapy. In conclusion, in both our patients, immune therapies only induced a transient and short-term benefit but did not affect the overall progression of the disease. These findings suggest that even if an immune or inflammatory component, possibly triggered by radiation, may be present in this condition, it does not probably represent the bulk of the pathological process.

AB  - The neuropilins, NP-1 and NP-2, are co-receptors for Sema3A and Sema3F, respectively, both of which are repulsive axonal guidance molecules. NP-1 and NP-2 are also co-receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The neuropilins and their ligands are known to play prominent roles in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation, and blood vessel formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To screen for additional molecular mechanisms by which Schwann cells and fibroblasts contribute to successful PNS axonal regeneration, we used cDNA microarrays (Clontech) to compare expression profile of multiple messenger RNAs in sciatic nerves distal to transection with their levels in normal sciatic nerves. An evocative result of this screen was a 14-fold increase in NP-2 mRNA in the axotomized nerve segments 4 days post-transection. We verified that NP-2 is induced in transected as well as crushed nerve segments by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, and examined the distribution of NP-2 expressing cells in injured sciatic nerves by in situ hybridization. Then, we sought evidences of induction in the injured nerves of the NP-2 ligands, Sema3F and VEGF, and widened our survey to determine whether expression of the functionally related genes, neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and its class 3 semaphorin ligand, Sema3A are also induced in PNS following injury. We showed by in situ hybridization induction of all those genes at four days post-crushed, distally to the lesion. Our results suggest the possibility that the neuropilins and their semaphorin ligands serve to guide, rather than to impede, regenerating axons in the adult PNS.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to toxic substances may induce peripheral and central neurological complications but no cases of acute cranial nerve involvement are reported after single, although massive, exposure to toxic agents. Cranial multineuropathy is an uncommon occurrence. We observed two atypical cases of multinevritis of cranial nerves with mild sensory symptoms at limbs. Both patients had many common features: acute onset, occurrence of neuropraxic block in cranial nerves, and rapid clinical and neurophysiological recovery after corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, the strict time correlation between substance inhalation and acute onset of symptoms suggested a toxic origin of the disease. We emphasize that multinevritis of cranial nerves could be related to acute exposure of toxic substances. Missing this diagnosis could lead to a delay in treatment.

AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - A severe sensory neuropathy, mostly involving large myelinated sensory fibers, characterizes Friedreich ataxia since the early onset. Recently, an involvement of unmyelinated nerve fibers has been observed studying cutaneous innervation by means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. Quantification of epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs) by skin biopsy has been extensively used in the last decade to evaluate small-fiber neuropathies. This minimally invasive procedure, repeatable over time, allows to monitor a neuropathic process. An even less invasive technique is the biopsy of the only epidermis, obtained removing the roof of suction skin blister, sparing basal membrane and vessels. Skin blister, beside a diagnostic tool in sensory neuropathies, is a wound model to study nerve regeneration in human epidermis. The aim of our research was to define the regenerative capability of cutaneous nerve fibers in patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia evaluating time-course and patterns of nerve fibers regeneration. Six patients (4F, 2M, age 19?34) affected by genetically determined Friedreich ataxia were included in our study. In each subject we induced 5 couples of 2?mm blisters on the forearm. At different time points (1?2?3?4 weeks after blister induction) one blister was removed by 3?mm punch skin biopsy and one was reblistered (3-mm blister) and the roof removed. The larger size of these biopsies and blisters allowed at including normal skin immediately adjacent to the blister wound. Epidermal nerve fibers were visualised using antibodies to the pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) on frozen sections from skin biopsies and on the whole blister roofs. Quantification of ENFs was performed on skin sections using digitised images acquired by confocal microscopy (CARV) and Neurolucida software. Blister allowed to have a panoramic and global view of the regenerative process especially of the collateral extension of axons from adjacent normal epidermis, while biopsy allowed to observe the sprouting from the subepidermal neural plexus. Both these phenomena resulted markedly evident in all FA subjects indicating a normal capability of nerve fibers to regenerate. Blister wound probably induces the release of nerve growth factors stimulating nerve regeneration as in normal subjects. At least for the short period of observation (four weeks) nerve fibers maintained this capability challenging the noxa patogena that leads to their loss.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetic neuropathy characterized by a length-dependent degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers. Whereas all authors agree that weakening starts from the intrinsic foot muscles, there is still controversy whether the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) is weak or not in the early stages of the disease. To know this could be important either to understand how the cavus deformity develops or, consequently, to adopt surgical (tendon transfers) and conservative (orthotics, physiotherapy) strategies for prevention or early correction. We measured the power of TA in 110 feet of 62 patients (41 CMT1A, 1 CMT1B, 9 CMT1 without genetic evaluation, 5 CMTX, and 6 CMT2) fitting in the first two stages of the functional classification proposed by Vinci and Perelli. Thirty-one feet were at stage 1 (forefootdrop or mild footdrop: leg-sole angle?>90<?=?100) and 79 at stage 2 (same as stage 1 plus foot rotation on the longitudinal axis: heel angle <0 or >10). Muscle strength was measured by the manual muscle testing and scores according to the Medical Research Council scale. TA power graded 5/5 in 87 (79.1%) feet, 4/5 in 17 (15.5%) and 2/5 in 6 (5.4%). TA was strong (MRC 4/5 and 5/5) in the large majority (94.6%) of the feet in the two earlier stages of the disease. Interestingly, the 6 patients with weaker TA had CMT2. These results support our hypothesis that, in the earliest phase of CMT, foot rotation is due to a stronger and hyperactivated TA, which compensates the footdrop caused by the deficit of the metatarsophalangeal joint stabilization and, in many cases, is not balanced by the weak peroneal muscles.

AB  - Manente and coll. have recently developed an innovative soft hand brace called Manu for conservative treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS); a randomised controlled study showed that this hand brace, if worn at night for one month, is highly efficient in relieving symptoms and functional loss in CTS patients. This study aims at evaluating, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the changes of carpal tunnel in CTS patients and controls wearing Manu, the innovative soft hand brace for CTS. Thirteen subjects (9 with CTS and 4 controls) were enrolled in the study. T1 and STIR sequences were performed using a 0.2 T E-Scan. Some morphologic parameters (tunnel diameters and area, carpus length and nerve signal intensity) were measured at three different scanning levels. Evaluation was carried out before and after the application of the brace. Remarkable differences were recorded in the measurements performed before and after the application of the brace, particularly in the constant increase of front-rear diameter and tunnel shape rounding. These data could explain the lighter symptoms after using the brace. The Manu hand brace increased the carpal tunnel front-rear diameter rounding the tunnel shape, hence the clinical efficacy in CTS.
