AB  - A severe sensory neuropathy, mostly involving large myelinated sensory fibers, characterizes Friedreich ataxia since the early onset. Recently, an involvement of unmyelinated nerve fibers has been observed studying cutaneous innervation by means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. Quantification of epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs) by skin biopsy has been extensively used in the last decade to evaluate small-fiber neuropathies. This minimally invasive procedure, repeatable over time, allows to monitor a neuropathic process. An even less invasive technique is the biopsy of the only epidermis, obtained removing the roof of suction skin blister, sparing basal membrane and vessels. Skin blister, beside a diagnostic tool in sensory neuropathies, is a wound model to study nerve regeneration in human epidermis. The aim of our research was to define the regenerative capability of cutaneous nerve fibers in patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia evaluating time-course and patterns of nerve fibers regeneration. Six patients (4F, 2M, age 19?34) affected by genetically determined Friedreich ataxia were included in our study. In each subject we induced 5 couples of 2?mm blisters on the forearm. At different time points (1?2?3?4 weeks after blister induction) one blister was removed by 3?mm punch skin biopsy and one was reblistered (3-mm blister) and the roof removed. The larger size of these biopsies and blisters allowed at including normal skin immediately adjacent to the blister wound. Epidermal nerve fibers were visualised using antibodies to the pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) on frozen sections from skin biopsies and on the whole blister roofs. Quantification of ENFs was performed on skin sections using digitised images acquired by confocal microscopy (CARV) and Neurolucida software. Blister allowed to have a panoramic and global view of the regenerative process especially of the collateral extension of axons from adjacent normal epidermis, while biopsy allowed to observe the sprouting from the subepidermal neural plexus. Both these phenomena resulted markedly evident in all FA subjects indicating a normal capability of nerve fibers to regenerate. Blister wound probably induces the release of nerve growth factors stimulating nerve regeneration as in normal subjects. At least for the short period of observation (four weeks) nerve fibers maintained this capability challenging the noxa patogena that leads to their loss.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetic neuropathy characterized by a length-dependent degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers. Whereas all authors agree that weakening starts from the intrinsic foot muscles, there is still controversy whether the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) is weak or not in the early stages of the disease. To know this could be important either to understand how the cavus deformity develops or, consequently, to adopt surgical (tendon transfers) and conservative (orthotics, physiotherapy) strategies for prevention or early correction. We measured the power of TA in 110 feet of 62 patients (41 CMT1A, 1 CMT1B, 9 CMT1 without genetic evaluation, 5 CMTX, and 6 CMT2) fitting in the first two stages of the functional classification proposed by Vinci and Perelli. Thirty-one feet were at stage 1 (forefootdrop or mild footdrop: leg-sole angle?>90<?=?100) and 79 at stage 2 (same as stage 1 plus foot rotation on the longitudinal axis: heel angle <0 or >10). Muscle strength was measured by the manual muscle testing and scores according to the Medical Research Council scale. TA power graded 5/5 in 87 (79.1%) feet, 4/5 in 17 (15.5%) and 2/5 in 6 (5.4%). TA was strong (MRC 4/5 and 5/5) in the large majority (94.6%) of the feet in the two earlier stages of the disease. Interestingly, the 6 patients with weaker TA had CMT2. These results support our hypothesis that, in the earliest phase of CMT, foot rotation is due to a stronger and hyperactivated TA, which compensates the footdrop caused by the deficit of the metatarsophalangeal joint stabilization and, in many cases, is not balanced by the weak peroneal muscles.

AB  - Manente and coll. have recently developed an innovative soft hand brace called Manu for conservative treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS); a randomised controlled study showed that this hand brace, if worn at night for one month, is highly efficient in relieving symptoms and functional loss in CTS patients. This study aims at evaluating, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the changes of carpal tunnel in CTS patients and controls wearing Manu, the innovative soft hand brace for CTS. Thirteen subjects (9 with CTS and 4 controls) were enrolled in the study. T1 and STIR sequences were performed using a 0.2 T E-Scan. Some morphologic parameters (tunnel diameters and area, carpus length and nerve signal intensity) were measured at three different scanning levels. Evaluation was carried out before and after the application of the brace. Remarkable differences were recorded in the measurements performed before and after the application of the brace, particularly in the constant increase of front-rear diameter and tunnel shape rounding. These data could explain the lighter symptoms after using the brace. The Manu hand brace increased the carpal tunnel front-rear diameter rounding the tunnel shape, hence the clinical efficacy in CTS.

AB  - Transthyretin-derived familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is the most common form of hereditary amyloidosis, often associated with multisystemic involvement and a poor prognosis. We studied four patients, aged between 43 and 68?yrs, with TTR-FAP. A severe somatic and autonomic polyneuropathy was seen in three patients, whereas one was at onset of the disease. In addition 2/4, aged 43 and 63 years old, had a mild central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Neurophysiological studies showed an axonal polyneuropathy and amyloid deposits were found in all sural nerve biopsies. Combined conventional MRI and proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) were performed in our patients and in 14 age-matched normal controls. Conventional MRI was normal in two patients and showed minimal white matter and subcortical lesions in the other two, who were 63 and 68 years old. Proton MRSI of the periventricular brain regions showed a large reduction in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) resonance intensity (mean NAA/Cr in patients: 2.45?±?0.04; mean NAA/Cr in normal controls: 2.9?±?0.1; p?<?0.003). Our findings suggest that, despite minimal or no abnormalities on conventional MRI, evidence of diffuse axonal damage can be demonstrated in brain of patients with TTR-FAP by proton MRSI examination, even in patients with no or mild CNS involvement.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection there is high prevalence of numerous extrahepatic manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy (PN), in the form of symmetric polyneuropathy, asymmetric polyneuropathy, and multineuropathy, may be associated also with HCV infection and is usually related to mixed cryoglobulinemia (CG). However, some HCV+ patients with PN without CG were recently reported, suggesting a possible direct role of HCV in the pathogenesis of PN. From January 2000 to December 2002 we studied 50 HCV+ patients: 21 with symptomatic CG and 29 with chronic HCV without symptomatic CG (23 without CG, 5 with asymptomatic CG). Particular care was taken to exclude other possible causes of PN. Patients without symptomatic CG were examined before starting combined therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin, if needed. Fifteen patients with symptomatic CG had axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, 6 axonal sensorimotor multineuropathy or asymmetric polyneuropathy. Six HCV+ patients had other causes of PN (1 CIDP, 2 diabetes, 1 CIDP and diabetes, 1 alcoholism, 1 paraneoplastic with anti-Hu antibodies). No HCV+ patients without (symptomatic) CG or other possible causes of PN showed clinical and electrophysiological evidence of PN. Our study casts doubts on the existence of a PN directly caused by HCV and suggests that finding a PN in a HCV+ patient without CG should prompt to search for a different cause of PN.

AB  - We describe a 75-year-old woman affected by ichthyosis since childhood who developed bilateral lower limb distal muscle weakness resulting in foot deformities and gait disturbances during the last decade. Neurological examination showed equinovarus deformity with pied en griffe, distal motor and sensory impairment and areflexia at lower limbs. On upper limbs mild distal motor impairment and atrophy were present. EMG study revealed an axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe, predominantly axonal, neuropathy with many clusters of small myelinated fibers and some degree of chronic demyelination with small onion bulbs. Both her sister and the mother have a clinically similar peripheral neuropathy, but in the absence of ichtyosis. Familial history, prevalent motor lower limbs involvement, middle life onset with slow evolution, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT 2). Nevertheless, biochemistry and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were performed to rule out known causes of axonal peripheral neuropathy. Ichthyosis has been reported to be associated with some neurological disorders characterized by the presence of peripheral neuropathy such as Krabbe leucodystrophy, Refsum disease, and Rud syndrome. To our knowledge no association has been described between CMT2 and ichthyosis. We believe interesting to point out the presence in our family of CMT2 and ichthyosis. Further studies are ongoing to better elucidate this association.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman was referred because of bilateral foot drop, pes cavus and distal muscular atrophy. Electrophysiological studies showed prolonged distal motor latencies and conduction velocities ranging from 33 to 42?m/s in upper limb nerves. A conduction block (P/D area?=?0.4) was present in the wrist elbow segment of median nerve. Her 42-year-old daughter was asymptomatic and neurological examination revealed only absent deep tendon reflex. The 35-year-old son complained of positional paresthesias and had normal examination. The 13-year-old nephew was completely normal. There was no history of pressure palsies. All three proband's relatives showed: 1) normal or slightly slowed motor conduction velocities; 2) slowing of conductions in the above-below elbow segment of both ulnar nerves (difference of velocity with the below elbow-wrist segment ranging from 16 to 25?m/s). Sural nerve biopsy in the proband showed at light microscopy a chronic demyelinating and remyelinating process. On teased-fiber examination virtually all fibers showed myelin thickenings or classical tomacula. Molecular analysis showed neither deletion of the 17p11.2 segment nor mutation of the PMP 22 gene. The sequence of MPZ/PO revealed a 306delA at codon 102 in the proband and three relatives. The mutation was of non-sense type and causes a frameshift with a premature stop codon (Val102fs). Motor conduction velocities in CMT1B are usually <?20?m/s although a predominantly axonal variant with intermediate range conduction velocities has been also reported. Focally folded myelin has been reported in a few CMT1B patients usually, as in our cases, harboring a mutation in the extracellular domain of P0. In conclusion this CMT1B family is electrophysiologically peculiar because of the coexistence of intermediate-normal motor conduction velocities with segmental slowing and conduction block. Focal conduction abnormalities may be pathophysiologically related to tomacula at the paranodal region.

AB  - Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the prototype of post-infectious autoimmune neurological disease. Campylobacter Jejuni is the most frequent pathogen antecedent causing a clinical picture characterized by severe, pure motor axonal involvement with IgG antibodies against GM1, GM1b, GD1a or GalNAc-GD1a gangliosides. As for viral infection, CMV is the most common antecedent associated with demyelinating sensory GBS and anti-GM2 IgM antibody. Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a GBS variant characterized by ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia associated with anti-GQ1b IgG antibody. We describe the case of a 41 year-old man who developed muscle weakness with gait disturbance, paresthesiae and pain at four limbs, taste and voice disturbances 9 days after cutaneous eruption by varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. At hospital admission the clinical evaluation showed ataxia, deep tendon areflexia, hyposthenia at lower limbs, hypophonia and dysgeusia. Examination of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed a slight increase in protein concentration with no concomitant pleocytosis; nerve conduction velocity detected the absence of H reflex. At present antibodies titration against gangliosides is under examination. He underwent plasma exchange treatment and is still receiving acyclovir therapy with clinical recovery. Conclusion: this case underlines the clinical variability of acute polyradiculoneuropathy presenting after viral infections other than those classical described with possible overlapping to GB and MF syndrome and confirms the good response to combined gammaglobulin and acyclovir therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interferon is regarded as a promising treatment option for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. However, sporadic cases of axonal PNP and one case of CIDP after treatment with Interferon (INF) alfa-2a were reported. The objective of this study was to test the onset of PNP in patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS after treatment with INF beta-1b. METHODS: from the OPTIMS trial we have selected 23 patients (9 males, 14 females; mean age 30.5; range 22?50) with diagnosis of relapsing-remitting SM in treatment with INF beta-1b (8?12.000.000 UI). In these patients bilateral motor nerve conduction study (NCS) of peroneal, tibial, median, ulnar nerves and antidromic sensory NCS of sural, median and ulnar nerves were performed according standard techniques. All patients (23/23) were submitted to neurophysiological tests before the treatment (T0), 16/23 (7 drop out) after six months (T1) and after nine months of therapy (T2). RESULTS: at T0 no patient showed electrophysiological signs indicating PNP; after six and nine months of therapy (T1 and T2) no patient submitted to NCS showed alterations in the PNS either. CONCLUSIONS: all tested patients showed absence of electrophysiological signs of PNP as side effects after one year of treatment with high dose of INF beta-1b.

AB  - A wide range of axonal peripheral neuropathies, especially subacute sensory and motor neuronopathies have been reported as remote effect of cancer. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) most often occurs isolated but it may accompany several autoimmune diseases. The association of CIDP and carcinoma is rare and its relevance is still debated. Few cases have been associated with gastrointestinal cancers. This 53-year old man was admitted in December 1989 because of severe extremity weakness after EBV infection. Neurologic examination showed facial paresis, proximal and distal limb weakness, areflexia, distal loss for touch and deep sensibilities. Patient recovered with PE but mild symptoms and signs persisted in the limbs. In June 1997, patient developed acute relapse of his neuropathy after an episode of pneumonia. Electrophysiology, CSF and nerve biopsy were consistent with CIDP. Search for anti-nerve antibodies was negative except for anti-neurofilament IgM. IVIG had partial benefit. During the following four years, patient received IVIG 1?g/Kg monthly; however he continued to experience relapses of the neuropathy often occurring after trivial infections. Laboratory tests (monoclonal IgG; elevated SR and WB count, serum electrophoresis, carcinoembryonic antigen titer) suggested a systemic disease. In September 2001 a rectosigmoidal adenocarcinoma with bladder and liver metastases was discovered on abdominal CT scan and surgically treated. Patient's general and neurologic conditions rapidly deteriorated despite of chemotherapy with fluorouracil and leucovorin. He died on late summer 2002. We outline the unusual association of CIDP and intestinal cancer and the long interval elapsed between neuropathy onset and cancer detection.

AB  - Thalidomide seems to be effective in the treatment of cutaneous forms of lupus erythematosus refractory to other therapies. Peripheral neuropathy is the most severe side effect, but the incidence of neuropathy and its relation to thalidomide doses are still unclear. We prospectively monitored 12 patients treated with thalidomide for cutaneous lupus erythematosus in order to estimate the occurrence of side effects, particularly peripheral neuropathy. A total of 12 female patients, median age 38,6 years (range 26?56), with subacute or chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus were considered. The patients were treated with low dose thalidomide (starting dose 100?mg, tapered to 50?mg/day or 50?mg alternative day) for up to 18 months. The average follow-up period was 8,6 months (range 2?18). Prior to, and regularly during treatment patients underwent neurological evaluation and electrophysiological study of at least 8 nerves in the 4 arms (ulnar, median, sural, peroneal nerves). At recruitment, one patient presented a sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. Of the remaining 11 patients, six did not present electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy, one had a carpal tunnel syndrome and four showed slowing of ulnar nerve velocity at elbow. No patients developed neuropathy neither worsening of electrophysiological parameters during thalidomide treatment. The most common side effect was tremor, always reversible after withdrawing or reducing thalidomide. Paresthesias, somnolence, amenhorrea, constipation were also present. Only one patient had to stop the therapy for the occurrence, 10 days after taking 50?mg of thalidomide, of a severe, stabbing, ?zoster-like? thoracic pain, which disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Started again on thalidomide, the symptoms reappeared and the patient definitely interrupted the therapy with benefit. All the 11 patients who continued on the therapy presented a significant improvement or remission of the cutaneous alterations. These preliminary data seem to indicate that low dose thalidomide is efficacious and tolerable for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Peripheral neuropathy seems not to be a major side effect. A longer follow-up and the study of more patients are needed to confirm the results.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. HNPP is a genetically homogeneous disease with a single disease locus at chromosome 17p11.2-p12. The major cause of HNPP is a 1.5?Mb deletion containing the PMP22 gene, which causes a dosage effect of peripheral myelin protein 22. The deletion is found in 85% of patients with HNPP. A few HNPP patients show smaller deletions, still containing the PMP22 gene. Point mutations in the PMP22 gene are rare cause of HNPP. To date, nine point mutations were reported and all these mutations most likely cause a loss of function of PMP22. We describe a HNPP patient who at the age of 20 years developed muscle weakness and paresthesias. The neurophysiological examination showed a sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy at four limbs. The sural nerve biopsy showed signs of a demyelinating neuropathy with abundance of classical tomacula and mild inflammatory reaction in endo- and epineurial tissues. The CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion of the region 17p11.2 was excluded by Southern blot analysis and pulse field gel electrophoresis. The PMP22 gene was screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. An altered SSCP fragment was observed in the exon 2. Direct sequencing demonstrated a nucleotide substitution in the exon 2-intron 2 junction (c.179?+?1G?C). To define the molecular consequences of this splice site mutation, RT-PCR experiments on the sural nerve biopsy are in progress. The pathophysiological role of this mutation will be discussed in the light of the clinical, neurophysiological and pathological features.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - Symptomatic neuropathy in young patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (t1DM) is rare but subclinical peripheral alterations can be assessed by electroclinical evaluation. This study aimed to assess prevalence of clinical and subclinical peripheral neuropathy in patients with t1DM. Motor and/or sensory nerve conduction studies of both median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial and sural nerves and standard clinical examination of peripheral nervous system were performed in 83 patients (27 females and 56 males) with diabetes onset since five years. The mean age of patients was 19.89 (range 9?28.3) years, the mean disease duration was 9.61(range 4.4?19.3) and the mean age at the onset of diabetes was 9.02 (range 0.8?23.5). Five patients (6.02 %) had both symptomatic (light clinical abnormalities as paresthesias and mild reduction of vibratory sensibility) and electrophysiologic neuropathy and six (7.2 %) with mild abnormal nerve conduction studies were totally asymptomatic (subclinical neuropathy). The majority of symptoms and electrophysiological alterations were found on the lower limbs. Only two patients had a minimal distal neuropathy of median nerve. No patients showed laboratory evidence of early renal complications or systemic hypertension; 5 (6.02 %) had early diabetic retinal abnormalities as microaneurisms, seen by fundus examination. Analysis of sex, age of onset, duration of diabetes, age at the date of electrophysiologic examination, Hemoglobin A1c (mean level of the last two years), association with retinal abnormalities and clinical assessment was performed (Fisher Exact Test, ANOVA). No correlation was found with the age at the onset, retinal abnormalities and glycaemic control index. Peripheral neuropathy was significantly related with patient age at the date of electrophysiological study and duration of t1DM.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.

AB  - Laminin is required for normal peripheral nerve development, as mutations causing absence of laminin-2 cause hereditary peripheral neuropathies (neuropathy of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and dystrophic mouse). We study the laminin receptors, integrins and dystroglycan, that link laminin in the basal lamina to the Schwann cells cytoskeleton. This linkage is defective in an animal model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F, in which the Periaxin/Dystrogycan/DRP-2 complex is disrupted. To study the role of laminin receptors in these peripheral neuropathies, we inactivated the gene for beta1 integrin and dystroglycan specifically in Schwann cells of transgenic mice. alpha6beta1 integrin is present in Schwann cells and their precursors before myelination, the absence of beta1 integrin causes a severe peripheral neuropathy due to the failure of Schwann cells to interact with axons during axonal sorting. Although more severe, this neuropathy is morphologically similar to that of dystrophic mice. In contrast, dystroglycan first appears in Schwann cells after axonal sorting and just prior to myelination (pro-myelinating Schwann cells). In the absence of dystroglycan, mice develop a neuropathy with abnormally folded myelin sheaths, slow conduction velocity and loss of DRP-2, similar to that of periaxin-null mice. These data show that alpha6beta1 integrin and dystroglycan subserve different roles during nerve development, and that they are involved at different steps in the pathogenesis of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F.

AB  - The present study was performed with the aim to compare different clinically-based neurotoxicity scales with a more extended composite scale (Total Neuropathy Scale) already validated in diabetic patients, in order to improve the grading of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity. The features of CIPN were evaluated in a series of women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel? based chemotherapy by clinical examination, neurophysiology and quantitative sensory testing of vibration threshold (VDT); the ECOG, Ajani and NCIC-CTC grades were assessed by a neurologist after clinical examination and the TNS was calculated after additional instrumental examination. At the same time, the treating oncologist, who was blinded as regards the results of the neurological examination, assessed the NCIC-CTC sensory neurotoxicity grade. The correlation existing between the different evaluations was evaluated with the Spearman test on a total of 97 visits. Our results indicate for all the neurotoxicity scales commonly used by oncologists and evaluated in this study a significant correlation with TNS; the interexaminer agreement comparison evaluation evidenced that in several cases the neurologist attributed a higher grade in the NCIC-CTC scale than the oncologist, and this discrepancy was mainly due to a different evaluation of the sensory impairment. In conclusion, the TNS can be used to assess effectively the severity of CIPN and the results of this evaluation can be reliably correlated with the oncological grading of sensory peripheral neurotoxicity; the wider range of TNS values, however, can allow a more accurate grading of the sensory impairment, a feature which can improve the estimate of CIPN changes, particularly in clinical trials; finally, the use of standardized methods of examination of the sensory function (e.g. the semiquantitative measure of vibration sensibility using the 128?Hz tuning fork) may reduce the interexaminer disagreement.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.
