AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Summary Biaryl structures cover all therapeutic areas and the syntheses of these structures are well-established in the literature, which suggests that biaryl groups can be useful templates for the discovery and design of therapeutics with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of protein targets. This chapter reviews the applications of biaryl. Many of the top-selling drugs, such as the blood pressure (BP) regulators, are biaryl structures. The chapter also discusses synthesis of biaryls. Biaryls can be synthesized by one-pot C-H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling sequences. The Negishi cross-coupling reaction is a popular protocol for the preparation of biaryl structures. The chapter tabulates the various Negishi reaction conditions of aryl halides with aryl zincates to afford biaryls under different conditions. The directing groups on arenes play a pivotal role in directing ortho and meta-substituted biaryl products. The chapter lists the plentiful reaction conditions for the arylation of aryl halides with arenes containing directing groups to afford biaryls.
