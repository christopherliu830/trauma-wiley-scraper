AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that the hydatid parasite infecting macropods and dingoes in Queensland is a sylvatic strain of Echinococcus granulosus, distinct from the domestic strain which produces cysts in sheep and humans. Design: Molecular biological techniques were used to compare DNA isolated from hydatid cysts from humans, local macropods and sheep from New South Wales and the United Kingdom, as well as from adult tapeworms in dingoes. Setting: The human cysts were surgically resected from two patients seen with hydati- dosis in Brisbane teaching hospitals over a one-year period. Neither patient had had previous contact with sheep farms. Macropods and dingoes were shot randomly in the localities where the patients presumably acquired their infections. Sheep liver cysts were obtained from abattoirs. Methodology: Studies comprised extraction of DNA from cysts, digestion by a series of restriction endonucleases, slab gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and then hybridisation with defined DNA probes. Polymerase chain reaction, in combination with direct DNA sequencing, was used to compare DNA from cysts and adult worms from dingoes. Results: The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of DNA from all cysts and a defined mitochondrial DNA sequence from all sources were indistinguishable. This finding is significant as both techniques can clearly distinguish between genetically distinct, well characterised strains of E. granulosus. Conclusions: Hydatid cysts are prevalent in some macropod populations and adult worms are common in dingoes. Since there are relatively few sheep-rearing areas in Queensland, contact with wild animals may be the main source of human hydatid infection in this State. The strain of E. granulosus in both patients was genetically indistinguishable from that found in macropods, dingoes and sheep from New South Wales and the United Kingdom. This strongly suggests that the domestic strain of E. granulosus, or a form very close genetically, freely infects Australian wildlife, and argues against the existence of a distinct sylvatic strain. The implications for public health are considerable.

AB  - Abstract Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a large group of viruses (more than 200 types identified) that infect the epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes. The infections can be latent, subclinical, or clinically manifest, causing lesions that range from the benign (warts, papillomas, condylomas) to the malignant. Some of these viruses are responsible for cutaneous warts; a different group of HPVs (types 6 and 11) is responsible for most genital warts. The major importance of HPVs is because 20 types (especially HPV-16 and -18) are regarded as the necessary, if not sufficient, cause of cervical cancer as well as other cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx. Although most sexually active individuals get infected with genital HPVs, most of these infections are transient and innocuous. It is the persistence of the high-risk oncogenic HPVs that leads to malignant transformation. Cancer caused by these viruses is preceded by a precancerous stage whose detection is the basis of cytologic screening (Pap smear) for cervical cancer. Ten years ago HPV vaccines were introduced for the prevention of diseases associated with HPV-16 and -18 and for the prevention of anogenital warts caused by HPV-6 and -11. The introduction of HPV vaccination has been a major advance because it is the first time a vaccine has been able to directly prevent virally induced cancers. When used broadly before the onset of sexual activity, HPV vaccination has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of genital warts and HPV-related cervical lesions. This should be the harbinger of a decline in the rates of cervical and other cancers.
