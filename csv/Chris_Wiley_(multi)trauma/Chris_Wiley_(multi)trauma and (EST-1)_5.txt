AB  - Abstract This study evaluated a bioresorbable barrier with and without decalcified freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) in the treatment of human molar furcations. 14 subjects with paired class II mandibular molar furcation defects participated in the study (8 male and 6 female). The class-II furcation defects were randomly treated with either the resorbable barrier alone or resorbable barrier in combination with decalcified freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA). Gingival recession, probing depth, clinical attachment, and bone fill were measured. 6 months post-treatment measurements were repeated and each site was surgically re-entered. When the resorbable barrier alone was compared to resorbable barrier in combination with DFDBA. probing depth reduction was significantly (p<0.01) in favor of the combination therapy. Vertical bone gain was significant with the combination treatment demonstrating more bone fill (p<0.02). Smoking was also a variable examined in this study. When compared to smokers, non-smokers for both treatment groups revealed greater probing depth reduction, vertical bone gain, and horizontal bone gain. Within the non-smoking group, probing depth reduction was also significantly higher for the resorbable barrier and DFDBA group than the resorbable alone group (p<0.02). These results illustrate that the probing depth reduction is better in the non-smoker and the best in the non-smoker with the combination therapy of resorbable barrier and DFDBA than with resorbable barrier alone.

AB  - Background Postoperative arterial epistaxis and sphenoid sinus stenosis after sphenoidotomies for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and transsphenoidal approaches (TSAs) are uncommon. One potential source of epistaxis after sphenoidotomy is the sphenopalatine artery's posterior septal branch (PSB). PSB injury, in addition to other factors, could increase the risk of sphenoid stenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine incidence of, and risks factors for, the following outcomes after sphenoidotomy: PSB injury; postoperative epistaxis from the injured PSB; and sphenoid stenosis after PSB injury. Methods A single-institution, prospective case series was conducted based on 233 sphenoidotomies performed during ESS (n = 163) and TSAs (n = 70). Outcome measures included intraoperative PSB injury, postoperative epistaxis from the PSB, and sphenoid stenosis. Results The incidence of PSB injury was 17.2% during ESS-related sphenoidotomies, and 5.7% during TSA-related sphenoidotomies (p = 0.010). After PSB injury during ESS- and TSA-related sphenoidotomies (n = 32), there was 1 instance of epistaxis from the PSB (3.1%). Of the 161 ESS-related sphenoidotomies, 6 developed complete or near-complete stenosis (3.7%), which was more likely to occur with smaller anterior sphenoid face dimensions (p = 0.001). PSB injury, revision sphenoidotomy, and other factors did not increase the risk of stenosis. None of the TSA-related sphenoidotomies stenosed completely. Median follow-up was 7 months. Conclusion PSB injury occurred in 17.2% of ESS-related sphenoidotomies and 5.8% of TSA-related sphenoidotomies. After PSB injury, postoperative epistaxis from the PSB was rare (3.1%). After ESS-related sphenoidotomies, sphenoid stenosis was rare (3.7%), and was more likely to occur with smaller sphenoid dimensions, but not with PSB injury or other factors.

AB  - Background: Placement of endosseous dental implants in edentulous areas of the anterior maxilla poses a unique challenge due to variations in the amount of residual alveolar bone. Implant position becomes crucial in cases demanding high esthetic results but possessing minimal ridge width or in cases requiring augmentation. Recent advances in spiral tomography have allowed for more precise planning and placement of endosseous implants in these challenging areas. Methods: The purpose of this report is to describe a series of clinical cases in which spiral tomography was utilized in the planning and placement of endosseous dental implants. Two cases will be described utilizing initial spiral tomographic radiographs for implant planning and surgical guide fabrication, followed by post-insertion tomography to evaluate the results of implant position and inclination. Results: Preimplant spiral tomograms revealed that the initial prosthetic trajectory through the proposed incisal edge of each tooth replacement would result in a final osteotomy site that would compromise the overall thickness of the facial cortical plate. After adjusting for magnification and distortion factors, new prosthetic/surgical trajectories were fabricated into the surgical guide, and this information was utilized to prepare the final implant osteotomy site. This adjustment resulted in 2 mm of residual crestal facial bone postimplant insertion, which became wider at more apical measurements. These findings were verified in the postimplant serial tomograms. Conclusions: Spiral tomography was a valuable adjunct in the treatment planning phases of endosseous dental implant placement especially in cases with minimal crestal width, high esthetic demands, or where exact implant placement is critical for successful treatment outcomes.

AB  - This paper describes some similarities and differences between contemporary approaches to analysis as practised by ?Freudians? and ?Jungians? in London today. It aims to contribute to mutual understanding between different schools of analysis by showing how the analyst?s interventions can only be understood in terms of the theoretical context from which they arise (cf. ?the analyst?s preconscious?, as discussed by Hamilton [1996]). A discussion of five key themes of Jungian theory is followed by an account of clinical work with a patient who enacted her inner world through the use of material objects brought to the consulting room, presenting difficult technical dilemmas concerning boundaries and enactment. The paper aims to shows how these Jungian themes influenced the analyst?s response, particularly in relation to ideas of symbolic transformation, the unknowable nature of unconscious processes and the purposive orientation of the self towards wholeness and integration.

AB  - Summary We aimed to compare the reliability of aspiration via a nasogastric tube with ultrasound for assessment of residual gastric volume. Sixty-one adult patients who were mechanically ventilated and received continuous enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube for >Â 48Â h were included. A first qualitative and quantitative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum was followed by gastric suctioning, performed by an operator blinded to the result of the ultrasound examination. A second ultrasound examination was performed thereafter, followed by re-injection of the aspirated gastric contents (â¤Â 250Â ml) into the stomach. A third ultrasound assessment was then immediately performed. If the suctioned volume was â¥Â 250Â ml, 250Â mg erythromycin was infused over 30Â min. A fourth ultrasound was performed 90Â min after the third. Sixty (98%) patients had a qualitatively assessed full stomach at first ultrasound examination vs. 52 (85%) after gastric suctioning (pÂ =Â 0.016). The calculated gastric volume significantly decreased after gastric suctioning, without a significant decrease in the number of patients with volume â¥Â 250Â ml. Four of the nine patients with calculated gastric volume â¥Â 250Â ml had vomiting within the last 24Â h (pÂ =Â 0.013). The antral cross-sectional area significantly decreased between the third and the fourth ultrasound examination (pÂ =Â 0.015). Erythromycin infusion did not make a significant difference to gastric volume (nÂ =Â 10). Our results demonstrate that gastric suctioning is not a reliable tool for monitoring residual gastric volume. Gastric ultrasound is a feasible and promising tool for gastric volume monitoring in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract The objective of clinical periodontal diagnosis in maintenance patients is to monitor the risk for periodontal disease progression. Risk for progression should be continuously monitored at the patient, tooth and site level at each recall appointment. At the patient level, the significance of systemic diseases, cigarette smoking, compliance with the recall program, loss of support m relation to the patient's age, full mouth plaque and/or bleeding scores, and prevalence of residual pockets are of key importance. At the tooth and tooth-site levels, residual periodontal support, inflammatory parameters and their persistence, presence of ecological niches with difficult access such as furcations, and presence of iatrogenic factors have to be put into proportion with the patient s overall risk profile. The information gathered by clinical monitoring and continuous multilevel risk assessment facilitates an immediate appreciation of the periodontal health status of an individual and the possible risk for further infection and/or disease progression in the dentition and at a particular tooth or site.

AB  - Functional genomic studies were carried out on the inner ear of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar following exposure to a seismic airgun. Microarray analyses revealed 79 unique transcripts (passing background threshold), with 42 reproducibly up-regulated and 37 reproducibly down-regulated in exposed v. control fish. Regarding the potential effects on cellular energetics and cellular respiration, altered transcripts included those with roles in oxygen transport, the glycolytic pathway, the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Of these, a number of transcripts encoding haemoglobins that are important in oxygen transport were up-regulated and among the most highly expressed. Up-regulation of transcripts encoding nicotinamide riboside kinase 2, which is also important in energy production and linked to nerve cell damage, points to evidence of neuronal damage in the ear following noise exposure. Transcripts related to protein modification or degradation also indicated potential damaging effects of sound on ear tissues. Notable in this regard were transcripts associated with the proteasome?ubiquitin pathway, which is involved in protein degradation, with the transcript encoding ubiquitin family domain-containing protein 1 displaying the highest response to exposure. The differential expression of transcripts observed for some immune responses could potentially be linked to the rupture of cell membranes. Meanwhile, the altered expression of transcripts for cytoskeletal proteins that contribute to the structural integrity of the inner ear could point to repair or regeneration of ear tissues including auditory hair cells. Regarding potential effects on hormones and vitamins, the protein carrier for thyroxine and retinol (vitamin A), namely transthyretin, was altered at the transcript expression level and it has been suggested from studies in mammalian systems that retinoic acid may play a role in the regeneration of damaged hair cells. The microarray experiment identified the transcript encoding growth hormone I as up-regulated by loud sound, supporting previous evidence linking growth hormone to hair cell regeneration in fishes. Quantitative (q) reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses confirmed dysregulation of some microarray-identified transcripts and in some cases revealed a high level of biological variability in the exposed group. These results support the potential utility of molecular biomarkers to evaluate the effect of seismic surveys on fishes with studies on the ears being placed in a priority category for development of exposure?response relationships. Knowledge of such relationships is necessary for addressing the question of potential size of injury zones.

AB  - Abstract This study examines a practice which is characteristic of an era of intensifying globalization: As part of a transnational lifestyle, an increasing number of immigrants to North America send infants thousands of miles back to their country of origin to be raised by members of their extended families?a culturally sanctioned tradition. After several years of separation, the children return to the biological parents to attend school in the adopted country, a custom which, according to Western mental health models, could have significant sequelae for attachment relationships and other facets of development. This practice is particularly prevalent among immigrants from the People's Republic of China, but a modified version of it can be found in other groups as well. The work described here is the first phase of a longitudinal project that explores the advantages and potential repercussions, for both infants and parents, of a transnational lifestyle. The current study reviews the decision-making process of a group of Chinese Canadian immigrant parents who are considering a separation from their infants. Preliminary findings show that the expected concerns about disrupting attachment relationships are embedded in more salient considerations of economic need and cultural perspective. These exploratory data exemplify an emergent field of culture-focused research and practice in infant mental health, and support the call for innovative models to situate infant developmental pathways in global and transcultural contexts.

AB  - The concept of repetition compulsion, which has never been fully acknowledged by Kohut and his followers, is re-evaluated in this article within the context of self-psychology. In line with the underlying principles of defensive contact-shunning on the one hand, and non-traumatic empathic failure on the other hand, the repetition can be seen as the twofold expression both of the wish for a new benign relationship and of the dread of traumatic, repeated disappointment. Therefore, early non-traumatic disappointments are initiated by the patient, and role-responded to by significant others. This way, the risk of disillusionment of full-blown expectations is avoided. The repetition compulsion, then, is a complex mechanism: preventive in one part, it protects the vulnerable self from potentially traumatising experiences; thus, it is operated in response to the danger signal of emotional cravings, once the latter are experienced as getting out of hand. Providing novel experiences, in its other part, it can lead to opening the road for change; such curative impact relies on lengthy working through in a safe, empathic, holding environment.

AB  - Abstract Purpose We examined how heterogeneity in the patterns of adolescent experiences of different types and severity of peer victimization is associated with concurrent and longitudinal mental health, substance use, and physical health. Method Data come from a randomly recruited community-based sample of youth (T1 ages 12?18; NÂ =Â 662; 52% female) followed biennially across 10Â years (T6 ages 22?29; nÂ =Â 478; 55% female). Results Using latent class analysis, we identified four classes of adolescent peer victimization: Low victimization (63%), Physical victimization only (15%), Relational victimization only (17%), and Poly-victimization (6%). Youth in the Poly-victimization class reported the most detrimental health consequences in adolescence (e.g., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, illicit drug use, physical symptoms, poor physical self-concept, physical activity) and in young adulthood (e.g., depressive symptoms, sleep problems). Youth in the Relational and Physical victimization classes also reported health problems, some of which persisted into young adulthood. Youth in the Low victimization class reported the fewest health concerns. Conclusions Findings add to our understanding of how different types of adolescent victimization are related to mental health, substance use, and physical health problems both within adolescence and long-term.

AB  - ABSTRACT In light of recent revelations about global ignorance and disbelief regarding the Holocaust, first-hand testimonies acquire fresh significance. Two disparate books frame this discussion of how writings by survivors serve to deepen our understanding of the Shoah. Otto Dov Kulka's memoir, Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death, is a carefully crafted account by a professional historian who survived as a child in Auschwitz. Thomas Trezise's work, Witnessing Witnessing, is an analytical inquiry into the literary and epistemic issues that frame different genres of testimony ranging from video to poetry. Kulka's slender account is situated in the context of other works by survivors, including Saul FriedlÃ¤nder's When Memory Comes, Charlotte Delbo's Auschwitz and After, and a more recent work by Joseph Polak, After the Holocaust the Bells Still Ring. The emphasis in this discussion is upon the challenges that survivors face in articulating horror, especially to readers in the twenty-first century. Trezise's more voluminous work is based upon the literary and philosophical theories of Adorno, Levinas, and Freud, among others. The question raised in this essay focuses upon which of these narrative strategies might work better to convey the complex meanings of the Shoah after the generation of survivors has departed from the historical scene. In the end, the halting words of those who went through the death camps is all we have to counter the ignorance and disbelief spreading around the world. Kulka's book, combining memories, dreams, and art works, fosters an imaginative encounter with inconceivable historical realities. Trezise's theoretical engagement with indexicality and with the phatic function of language helps us to understand the impact of testimonies within the scholarly literature. It does not, however, point a clear path toward conveying the importance of the Holocaust to the public at large. For this purpose, we need books such as Kulka's that enable the generation after the Holocaust to listen to silences embedded in survivor narratives. These silences must be carried forward in time, along with the ethical mandate not to forget the atrocities of the Shoah. If we can embrace this mission, we may be able to diminish the reign of hate running amuck today.
