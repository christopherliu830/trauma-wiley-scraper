AB  - Summary Adverse events (AEs) in medical malpractice, due to their frequency and socioeconomic costs, have gained public and political attention. In the USA, UK and Australia, several studies have been conducted concerning AEs, preventable AEs (PAEs) and negligent AEs (NAEs), but mostly only in hospitalised patients as ambulant medical care data are hardly available. The data of the arbitration committees of the medical councils are well documented and evaluated either locally by the responsible medical chamber or nationwide by the German medical chamber. Lethal cases are a special subgroup and the best available data source is the files of the Institutes of Forensic Medicine. An autopsy is a very efficient method for clarifying medical malpractice claims. Therapeutic misadventure can be classified in many ways. Two examples are given in this chapter. The modern forensic investigation into medical treatment related death uses the knowledge of the clinical liaison service (CLS).

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to describe two epizootics of high mortalities from infection with Streptococcus agalactiae, occurring in captive rays held in a marine display aquarium in south-east Queensland, Australia, in 2009 and 2010. Five different species of rays were affected, including mangrove whiprays (Himantura granulata), estuary rays (Dasyatis fluviorum), eastern shovelnose rays (Aptychotrema rostrata), white-spotted eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari) and blue-spotted mask rays (Neotrygon kuhlii). This report describes the history of both epizootics including collection, quarantine and husbandry of rays, the disease epizootics, clinico-pathological features of the disease, antimicrobial therapy, autogenous vaccine production, and laboratory studies including clinical and histopathology, bacteriology, PCR, molecular serotyping and sequencing of the bacterium S. agalactiae.

AB  - The office of Coroner is a uniquely English institution. Scotland never had coroners. England exported her Coroner to almost everywhere coloured red in the Victorian atlas. The first mention of the Coroner dates from the reign of Alfred the Great. We have no records of that period. The Coroner, as we know him today, dates from September 1194, during the reign of Richard the Lionheart whose interest in England was as a source of money to help finance his obsession with warfare. Much of today?s English legal structure was born in the last decade of the 12th century. The edict that formally established the Coroners was Article 20 of the ?Articles of Eyre? in September 1194. In 1195, Justices of the Peace were established. Ironically, they became the major reason for the decline of the Coroner in later centuries. Coroners originally had to be Knights and men of substance. They were unpaid. Their prime function was to service the Royal Courts of Law, the General Eyre, which circulated slowly around the kingdom. This took so long to return to each county that, unless careful records were kept by the coroners, many cases never came to trial and potential revenue was lost to the Crown. Other activities of the Coroner includes jurisdiction over ?treasure troves?, shipwrecks and catches of royal fish: the whale and the sturgeon. Historically, his most important role, the only one to survive until today, was his role in the investigation of sudden death.

AB  - Basil Kilvington, son of the Rev. James Kilvington, was born in Hartlepool in the North of England on August 6th. 1877. His schooling began in Greenock but in 1888, when he was eleven, the family migrated to Victoria where he attended Camberwell Anglican Boys? Grammar School which had been founded just two years earlier. He must have been a bright and capable student because in 1893, when barely sixteen, he matriculated in the Faculty of Medicine of Melbourne University and graduated M.B., B.S. in 1898 at aged 21. He became a resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital but retained an interest in teaching and research as a tutor at Trinity College. His academic leaning is reflected in his being awarded M.D. in 1901 and M.S. in 1902. Thereafter he had a distinguished career as both a surgeon and researcher particularly in the field of neurology and nerve regeneration. When he died in 1947 aged 70 the obituaries by Sir Albert Coates and others all bear fulsome testimony to a remarkable man. Above all he was a thinker and a man of great compassion and gentleness both in his surgical technique as well as his dealings with his fellow man. He was one of the College?s Founding Fathers and perhaps deserves better recognition.

AB  - Bernard Freyberg was brought to New Zealand as a two-year old boy, educated in Wellington, distinguished himself as a swimmer, began a career as a dentist, then sailed to England. He arrived in time to become part of the Royal Naval Division at the outbreak of the 1914?18 war, won his first DSO at Gallipoli, and his VC in France the following year. He became friendly with J M Barrie, who was his best man when he married in 1922. In the 1939?45 war he commanded the NZ forces in the Middle East and Gallipoli, and was then appointed governor-general of NZ, his term being extended to six years. This paper traces his career with reference to his portraiture.

AB  - Ludwig Wittgenstein was one of the most influential and controversial philosophers of the 20th century. His ideas concerning the foundations of mathematics and the role of language remain of essential importance in these fields, while his eccentricities still warrant popular examination. During World War II, having relinquished his chair in philosophy at Cambridge University, he worked as dispensary porter and as laboratory assistant. In these roles and in association with the MRC Research Unit, initially at Guy?s Hospital, London and latter at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-on Tyne, he was involved in investigations of what was then termed ?wound shock?. These studies were carried out on air-raid and latter industrial accident victims, under the leadership of Grant and Reeves, latter E.G, Bywater. Today, we would recognise the poorly defined clinical syndrome of ?wound shock? as manifestations of hypovolaemia. This entity had been recognised since the trench warfare of the First World War, but it is amazing to realise that as recently as the mid decades of the last century, the understanding of the physiology of injury was so rudimentary that this relationship was not recognised. It is instructive to examine Wittgenstein?s role in discussion of the semantics of the term ?shock?, which persists in causing confusion in the popular mind, as well as his experimental efforts. The development of understanding concerning hypovolaemic shock and crush injuries following the London Blitz shows how recently some of the most basic concepts on which we manage patients have become evident.

AB  - Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is one of the most significant surgical achievements of the 20th century. The contributions of Vineberg, Kolesoz, Favaloro and DeBakey are well known, but the name of Goetz means little to most surgeons. Goetz performed the world?s first successful CABG on May 2, 1960, in Bronx, N.Y. Robert H. Goetz was born in Frankfurt on April 17, 1910 and studied medicine at the University of Frankfurt. In the 1950?s he studied the physiology of the giraffe, whose ability to lift its head from the ground to full height without fainting confounded zoologists, earning him the Vesalius Medal. In 1960 Goetz developed a technique for coronary anastomosis on a beating heart using a tantalum ring on dogs. In an addendum to his article reporting this technique, Goetz announced the successful coronary mammary anastomosis between the right mammary and right coronary on a 38 year old man. The anastomosis was created in just 17 seconds. Before surgery the patient suffered from such debilitating angina that he needed 70 to 90 tablets of GTN a day. He remained pain free for 1 year and died of a posterior wall AMI. Angiogram at autopsy showed the anastomosis to be healed and patent. This was to be the only CABG Goetz completed. Permission to present this case at a meeting of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery was denied, as it was felt that the subject of CABG was unimportant and should be forgotten. In 1982, Goetz retired from surgery and bred prize-winning Angus bulls as a hobby and died on 15 December, 2000, in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was a remarkable academic surgeon with vision that aided the development of one of the most important surgical advances of the last 50 years.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims This study aims to explore the temporal relationship between age of onset of substance use and criminal activity in women convicted of violent crimes as well as to subdivide them into clinically significant groups to which tailored treatment can be guided. Design and Method Of the 353 female inmates randomised for this study, 38 (10.8%) refused to participate and 182 (51.6%) met inclusion criteria. Data were obtained only from substance-abusing female inmates serving a sentence for robbery or homicide in a female penitentiary in Brazil. Participant information was gathered through face-to-face interviews during which alcohol and drug abuse, impulsiveness levels, depressive symptoms, and criminological aspects were investigated. Results . Age of first alcohol and drug use significantly preceded the age of onset of criminal activities in the overall sample. Onset ages of alcohol and drug use problems significantly preceded the beginning of criminal activities in women convicted of homicide only. Latent Class Analysis resulted in two groups: cluster 1 (n?=?122; 67%), early-onset alcohol and drug users; and cluster 2 (n?=?60; 33%), late-onset alcohol and drug users. Higher depression levels, higher incidence of committing robbery and less official history of recidivism were associated with cluster 1 inmates. Discussion and Conclusions The temporal relationship between the onset age of alcohol/drug use problems and age of the beginning of criminal activities can set apart women convicted of robbery from those convicted of homicide. Further, a distinctive therapeutic approach to early- and late-onset offenders may be valuable. [Baltieri DA.

AB  - During and after the Napoleonic wars surgeons in Europe, Britain and America ligated peripheral arteries for symptomatic aneurysms. It is not generally known that five surgeons performed similar operations in early colonial Australia. Andrew Gibson ligated the femoral artery in 1827 and William Bland the innominate in 1832 and 1837, all in Sydney. Edward Bedford ligated the carotid artery in Hobart in 1837 having apparently previously ligated one popliteal artery in a patient in 1835 and his other popliteal in 1837. Colin Buchanan of Port Stephens tied the femoral artery of a patient in Stroud in the Hunter Valley in 1847, possibly the first major operation performed under general anaesthesia in Australia; and somewhat later Frederick Milford in Sydney ligated the femoral artery in St Vincent?s Hospital in 1869, again under general anaesthesia. None of these isolated cases was included in an extensive review article in 1847 by G W Norris of Philadelphia, who recorded no less than 118 ligations of the external iliac and femoral arteries between 1796 and 1842, with an overall mortality of 33 (28%). Bland?s operation in 1832 escaped his scrutiny despite its being reported in The Lancet Volume I 1832/3. It is timely that the work of these pioneer ?vascular? surgeons and their place in the history of vascular surgery in Australia be acknowledged.

AB  - Martinique, an island in the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, and today a d???rtement of France, was throughout the 19th century a much-feared outpost of the French empire. ?This is a region?, wrote one early commentator, ?where the land is shaken by earthquakes, the towns turned upside down by hurricanes, the air poisoned by yellow fever, and the different social classes in a perpetual state of hostility?. The healthcare needs of Martinique?s diverse population were shouldered by a small mix of military surgeons, civilian doctors and local healers. In 1804, Etienne Rufz de Lavison was born to Creole nobility in St Pierre, Martinique?s thriving, cosmopolitan former capital. Sent to mainland France at the age of 13, Rufz studied medicine in Paris before returning to St Pierre, where he spent 20 years as a clinician, scientist and prolific historian. A man of astonishing intellectual curiosity, with a self-confessed ?mania for writing?, Dr Rufz?s publications encompass local surgical techniques, the yellow fever epidemics, snake bites, plantation and slave health, ethnology, island flora, and the effects of climate. An innovative practitioner, he was a pioneer of anaesthesia on the island. Dr Rufz was also a leader in health politics; he inaugurated Martinique?s public hygiene campaigns, led the vaccination committee, established the colony?s first psychiatric hospital, and became mayor of St Pierre. The quintessential Renaissance man, Dr Rufz upheld the belief that good medical practice requires an understanding not only of disease, but of history, people and the natural world. The story of his life and work offers a vivid portrait of early colonial medicine and surgery.

AB  - The teaching of anatomy which began unofficially in Melbourne 150 years ago was formally established with the passing of ?An Act for Regulating Schools of Anatomy? in 1862 by the Victorian government. Armed with this Act, the University of Melbourne founded its medical school later that same year. The development of anatomy teaching and the separation of anatomy from pathology one hundred years ago, is a colourful story in which several local personalities played their part. Commencing in an improvised outbuilding of his home, the first professor, George Halford began teaching anatomy in May 1863, the first such course in Australia. He was followed by Allen, Berry, Wood Jones and many others, each of whom was to make their own contribution. The influence of surgeons including George Adlington Syme was paramount from the beginning and frequently the teaching of students only survived through their efforts. It was Wood Jones, who first drew attention to the negative aspects of the preservative formaldehyde and the artificial descriptions of anatomy which resulted. He warned in 1923, that ?students will one day have to readjust their ideas, since they deal with the living but it is only now that living anatomy has fully taken its place in anatomy learning, through the use of telescopic views and the newer imaging techniques of the living body. From simple beginnings, this department has evolved into a world leader in innovation and its award wining multi-media package An@tomedia has brought the teaching and learning of anatomy into a new dawn.

AB  - From the earliest classical cartographers, belief in the existence of a ?Terra Australis? was widespread. There had to be a great southern land to balance the geography of the world. Inexorable plate tectonics may have separated Australia and Antarctica 45 million years ago but it was only within the last few hundred years that Abel Tasman and James Cook isolated and defined them as separate lands for science, politics and strategy. In 1901, the Australian colonies had just federated and formed a nation, the Commonwealth of Australia. The International Geographical Congress had proclaimed 1901 as ?Antarctica? year. The heroic age of Antarctic exploration was underway. Antarctic medical practice is unique because there is no indigenous population. This review starts with the primitive medicine practiced by doctors on board with Captain James Cook in 1775. The heroic era of Scott, Shackleton, Amundsen and Mawson was followed by a highly mechanized transition period and ends with modern medicine used in permanent stations and research. In Antarctica, we have Earth?s remaining tenuous links with outer space (the last two great frontiers). NASA scientists have used Antarctica to test lunar survival strategies because ?this is as close to lunar conditions as we could get here on Earth?.
