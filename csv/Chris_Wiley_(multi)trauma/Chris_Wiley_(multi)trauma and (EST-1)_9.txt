AB  - From the earliest classical cartographers, belief in the existence of a ?Terra Australis? was widespread. There had to be a great southern land to balance the geography of the world. Inexorable plate tectonics may have separated Australia and Antarctica 45 million years ago but it was only within the last few hundred years that Abel Tasman and James Cook isolated and defined them as separate lands for science, politics and strategy. In 1901, the Australian colonies had just federated and formed a nation, the Commonwealth of Australia. The International Geographical Congress had proclaimed 1901 as ?Antarctica? year. The heroic age of Antarctic exploration was underway. Antarctic medical practice is unique because there is no indigenous population. This review starts with the primitive medicine practiced by doctors on board with Captain James Cook in 1775. The heroic era of Scott, Shackleton, Amundsen and Mawson was followed by a highly mechanized transition period and ends with modern medicine used in permanent stations and research. In Antarctica, we have Earth?s remaining tenuous links with outer space (the last two great frontiers). NASA scientists have used Antarctica to test lunar survival strategies because ?this is as close to lunar conditions as we could get here on Earth?.

AB  - New Guinea was governed by Australia under Mandate from the League of Nations. Information was obtained through review of personnel files in the National Archives, interviews with former residents or family members and from biographies. It was a time when surgery in the separate territories of Papua and New Guinea was conducted by general doctors who were selected often on availability, stability and knowledge of tropical medicine. The two territories had different pay scales and different staffing arrangements. A mix of missionaries, mercenaries and madmen were recruited. These were wild days, plantations and gold rushes, when mavericks such as Errol Flynn were on the loose. It was often alleged surgical incompetence that determined whether someone was regarded as suitable or not. Doris Booth, a nurse and the first white woman prospector, set up a hospital on the Goldfields in 1926. Some MO?s did only a few months filling positions of ?desperate need? whilst others, such as ET Brennan, Backhouse, Dickson and Sinclair made significant contributions. By 1927 Raphael Cilento (1924?29) was Director of Public Health with 9 Medical Officers stationed in Rabaul (2), Kavieng, Madang, Manus, Aitape, Morobe with one travelling and one relieving medical officer. Europeans were treated at the Namanula hospital and natives at the Rapindik Native Hospital (est 1930) at Matiep. Theodore Braun arrived as a Lutheran missionary doctor in 1935 and proved to be a highly competent surgeon. The period ends with the Japanese bombing of Rabaul in 1942 and the controversial evacuation of Dr Alex Price and others from Kieta, Bougainville, aboard the Bilua.

AB  - The colonial past history of the College Gardens site in Melbourne was revealed during the excavations and building of the East Wing, Victorian Training and Education Centre (VTEC). Research has revealed a golden history for this site, which we as Fellows of the College should be proud. The College site continues with its original purpose as a place of learning. The choice of this site as the future RACS Headquarters involved decisions by our Founders. The College Museum plans for the site are progressing, enamel signage displaying the College site?s past history is proposed for the Skills Laboratory Forecourt. This permanent display will provide a linkage between the history of this site to the current role of the VTEC, as a place of continuing education. It is fitting therefore that we look through the gates of that time to our future.

AB  - Dr John Paul Stapp was not only the ?fastest human on earth;? he was also the quickest to stop. In 1954, Dr Stapp attained a then world record land speed of 632?mph (1020?km/h), going from a stand still to a speed faster than a .45 bullet in 5?s on a rocket sled, and then to a dead stop in 1.4?s, all in the name of safety. Stapp pioneered research on the effects of mechanical forces on living tissues during aircraft crashes. Stapp planned a series of tests on humans and set out to develop a harness to hold them. First, he used a dummy to perfect the harness and after 32 sled runs, he was ready to try it out on a human crash test dummy, himself. By 1954, Stapp had volunteered for 29 deceleration and windblast experiments. On his last run he sustained more than 40?g?s. He suffered fractured ribs and wrist, and retinal haemorrhages which left him temporarily blind. Whilst at the Air Force Stapp also began a car-crash study program to investigate fatalities in auto accidents. From this program, safety recommendations for the car industry were established including fastening seats more securely to the car body, improving bumper design and proving the effectiveness of seat belts. Stapp?s work resulted in the 3-point restraint system of today?s belts which has saved millions of lives. Stapp is also credited with coining one of the most famous phrases in history. One of his assistants, Capt E. Murphy, rigged a harness incorrectly yielding no data on the forces Stapp was subjected to. After discovering what happened, Stapp observed, ?If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.? It has been called ?Murphy?s Law? ever since.

AB  - In the Cowlishaw Collection of the College Library, there is a little book by an anonymous author entitled ?Some Sketches of Impostures, Deceptions and Credulity?. In a series if 26 chapters the author covers a variety of subjects including oracles, false messiahs, vampirism, malingering, medical delusions and many others. Two notable examples of impostures and deceptions that played on the credulity of the public and the medical profession were Mary Tofts who claimed to have given birth to rabbits and Joanna Southcott, a self styled prophetess, who believed she had been impregnated by God and would give birth to a messiah. Other examples of impostures were the report of the miraculous bullet, ruses used in malingering and Dr. Graham?s Celestial Bed. All of these had some temporary popularity but were all recognised as falsehoods.

AB  - Martinique, an island in the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, and today a d???rtement of France, was throughout the 19th century a much-feared outpost of the French empire. ?This is a region?, wrote one early commentator, ?where the land is shaken by earthquakes, the towns turned upside down by hurricanes, the air poisoned by yellow fever, and the different social classes in a perpetual state of hostility?. The healthcare needs of Martinique?s diverse population were shouldered by a small mix of military surgeons, civilian doctors and local healers. In 1804, Etienne Rufz de Lavison was born to Creole nobility in St Pierre, Martinique?s thriving, cosmopolitan former capital. Sent to mainland France at the age of 13, Rufz studied medicine in Paris before returning to St Pierre, where he spent 20 years as a clinician, scientist and prolific historian. A man of astonishing intellectual curiosity, with a self-confessed ?mania for writing?, Dr Rufz?s publications encompass local surgical techniques, the yellow fever epidemics, snake bites, plantation and slave health, ethnology, island flora, and the effects of climate. An innovative practitioner, he was a pioneer of anaesthesia on the island. Dr Rufz was also a leader in health politics; he inaugurated Martinique?s public hygiene campaigns, led the vaccination committee, established the colony?s first psychiatric hospital, and became mayor of St Pierre. The quintessential Renaissance man, Dr Rufz upheld the belief that good medical practice requires an understanding not only of disease, but of history, people and the natural world. The story of his life and work offers a vivid portrait of early colonial medicine and surgery.

AB  - Robert Kenneth Wilson was born in Madagascar in 1899, the son of a Scottish missionary doctor. As a boy he was raised by his elder sister and developed a keen interest in natural history. He served in the first world war before studying medicine at Cambridge. He married Gwen Gulliver, an Australian in 1924. They had two sons. In 1926 he gained his FRCSEd and set up practice in London. During the 1930?s he was a court expert in ballistics together with Lord Gerrard Burrard. He wrote a definitive textbook on Automatic Pistols which was published during World War II. In 1933 he took the photo of the Loch Ness Monster which was only admitted to be a hoax in 1992. In 1939 he walked out of his practice, rejoined the Royal Artillery but in 1942 joined the elite SAS. He was decorated in Holland (orange order) and France (croix de guerre) before being parachuted into Borneo with Australian troops in 1945 to serve in Z force with SEMUT 2. In 1950 he went to PNG as the first fully qualified surgeon and was posted to Rabaul (1950?53) and Port Moresby (1953?56). He is remembered by his anaesthetist and nurses as an excellent general surgeon who could turn his hand to anything, though his results with thoracic surgery were probably suboptimal. In addition to surgery he was an expert fisherman and shot. He died in 1969 of oesophageal cancer. He served with distinction in every phase of his life.

AB  - A pioneer in all fields of surgery, Al-Zahrawi developed numerous original techniques as well as instruments. He published the first ever surgical encyclopaedia entitled ?At-Tashrif?. His way of thinking and practice of surgery inspired many subsequent great surgeons. As a result of his imperious work and contribution to surgery, he has been given the title of ?Father of Surgery?, and provided yet another beacon of light in the dark ages. In his many papers and manuals, he describes various operations and procedures which had never been recorded before. Some have described him as the first ever plastic surgeon, notably for his attention to and methods of incision, use of silk thread suture to achieve good cosmesis. He describes what is thought to be the first attempt at reduction mammaplasty for the management of gynaecomastia. He gives detailed descriptions of other basic surgical techniques such as cautery and wound management. The aim of this paper is to highlight and remind us of the invaluable contributions made by this remarkable pioneer in the field of surgery, which have acted a preamble for many techniques and procedures used in the field of plastic surgery.

AB  - Dental pain is among the most prevalent of all pain complaints, and pain Is frequently given as a common reason for both avoiding and seeking dental care. Pain is frequently an essential component in the differential diagnosis of many diseases; however, in the elderly, diagnosis Is more difficult due to a greater frequency of multiple chronic diseases and an altered pain response. It Is important to understand the nature and prevalence of pain In this group, and one should be cautious to avoid the oversimplification that ?pain decreases with age.? Current studies involving the differences in assessing pain and therapeutic pain control between younger and older age groups are discussed. Pain prevalence Is discussed along with herpes zoster, post-herpet-ic neuralgia, flbromyalgia, toothache pain, burning mouth syndrome, and trlgemlnal neuralgia as they relate to the elderly. Pain assessment can be made by means of pain scales and specific open- and closed-ended questions. There Is evidence that some practitioners may be underestimating the severity of pain in the elderly, and thus not prescribing adequate analgesics when indicated. When analgesics are prescribed, a thorough analysis of the patients' current medications and condition should lead to a customized prescription and dosage.

AB  - During the last two decades, the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) has attracted growing interest from psychoanalysts concerned with empirical research. The paper discusses the application of Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational AAI method for assessing the outcome of psychoanalysis. The aim is to demonstrate, through a case presentation, how therapeutic change can be expressed in the AAI. The pre- and post-treatment interviews of one patient, having completed a four-times-a-week psychoanalysis, are presented. It is demonstrated that the detailed discourse analysis of the AAI, based on transcribed tape-recorded interviews, focuses subtle formal elements of language and speech reflecting dominant patterns of affect regulation and object relating. The AAI text analysis provides possibility for coding procedural memory as conveyed by the handling of the relationship to the interviewer, incorporating the dynamic relationship between researcher and subject and thus complying with a methodological prerequisite regarded by many psychoanalysts as necessary for capturing data that are relevant to psychoanalysis. On this background, the method emerges as promising for psychoanalytic outcome studies.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate microbiological and histopathological features of canine acral lick dermatitis (ALD). Microbial characteristics of ALD are poorly described in current literature. If infection is recognized, antimicrobial selection is usually empirical, based on appearance, cytology or surface culture, rather than deep tissue culture. It was hypothesized that cultures obtained from deep tissue would yield different results than predicted by surface culture and cytology, and that isolates from ALD have unpredictable susceptibility patterns showing resistance to antibiotics routinely administered for canine pyoderma. Biopsies were obtained from 31 lesions and submitted for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal culture, and histopathological evaluation. Surface aerobic culture and susceptibility and cytology were obtained for comparison in 22 dogs. Skin scrapings and dermatophyte culture were performed. Bacteria were isolated in 30 of 31 cases. Staphylococcus intermedius was isolated in 58% of deep cultures. Twenty per cent of deep isolates were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species. Forty-eight per cent of cases yielded organisms defined as multidrug resistant on deep culture. Only 57% and 55% of bacteria isolated from tissue culture were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefazolin, respectively. Cytology and superficial cultures did not correlate well with deep cultures. Surface culture predicted deep tissue isolates in eight of 22 cases. Microsporum gypseum was isolated from one dog. Histopathological features included acanthosis, follicular elongation, lymphoplasmacytic dermal inflammation, folliculitis, furunculosis, perihidradenitis, hidradenitis and vertical streaking fibrosis. Lesions associated with ALD warrant tissue bacterial cultures as the majority of cases yielded positive growth of bacteria differing from superficial culture and often resistant to empirical drugs.

AB  - Abstract A 3500-year-old papyrus from ancient Egypt provides a list of treatments for many diseases including ?bite hair loss,? most likely alopecia areata (AA). The treatment of AA remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. In 30 CE, Celsus described AA presenting as scalp alopecia in spots or the ?windings of a snake? and suggested treatment with caustic compounds and scarification. The first ?modern? description of AA came in 1813, though treatment still largely employed caustic agents. From the mid-19th century onwards, various hypotheses of AA development were put forward including infectious microbes (1843), nerve defects (1858), physical trauma and psychological stress (1881), focal inflammation (1891), diseased teeth (1902), toxins (1912) and endocrine disorders (1913). The 1950s brought new treatment developments with the first use of corticosteroid compounds (1952), and the first suggestion that AA was an autoimmune disease (1958). Research progressively shifted towards identifying hair follicle-specific autoantibodies (1995). The potential role of lymphocytes in AA was made implicit with immunohistological studies (1980s). However, studies confirming their functional role were not published until the development of rodent models (1990s). Genetic studies, particularly genome-wide association studies, have now come to the forefront and open up a new era of AA investigation (2000s). Today, AA research is actively focused on genetics, the microbiome, dietary modulators, the role of atopy, immune cell types in AA pathogenesis, primary antigenic targets, mechanisms by which immune cells influence hair growth, and of course the development of new treatments based on these discoveries.
