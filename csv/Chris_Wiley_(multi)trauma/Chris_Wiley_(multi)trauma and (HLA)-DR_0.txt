AB  - Abstract: Bacterial sepsis remains a frequent complication after liver transplantation. We previously reported the results of a pilot study that suggested that low expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is a predictive marker for the occurrence of sepsis. We have studied the value of this marker in an additional cohort of patients, and have analyzed the relation of HLA-DR expression with the use of immunosuppressive agents. 20 adult liver transplantation patients were prospectively monitored during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. All were treated according to standard protocols. The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the effects of incubation of monocytes with prednisolone in vitro on the expression of HLA-DR was determined in 7 healthy volunteers. Seven patients developed bacterial sepsis after a median 15 (range 10?20) days after transplantation. HLA-DR expression was significantly lower in these patients on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation compared with non-septic patients. The percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes was 30% or less, 3 (1?8) days before onset of sepsis. On day 7 after transplantation, HLA-DR expression on 50% or less of monocytes had a positive predictive value for sepsis of 71%, whereas the negative predictive value was 85%. Patients who developed sepsis received significantly more prednisolone. Incubation with prednisolone in vitro lowered the expression of HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is a marker for a high risk of subsequent sepsis in liver transplantation patients. This high risk may be (at least partly) related to the dose of prednisolone.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

AB  - Summary Reduced HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been suggested as a predictive marker of immunosuppression following very high risk surgery, but there are few reports in lower risk surgery. In 32 patients undergoing low to intermediate risk surgery, blood samples were analysed by flow cytometry for HLA-DR expression and numbers in both CD14high and CD14lowCD16+ monocyte subsets. The numbers of CD14high monocytes increased at 24?h (mean (SD), 5.0 (2.2) vs 7.6 (3.9)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01) while CD14lowCD16+ monocytes decreased (0.68 (0.36) vs 0.44 (0.36)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01). HLA-DR expression was significantly reduced in both subsets by 24?h (mean (SD) fluorescent intensity 440 (310) vs 160 (130) for CD14high and 1000 (410) vs 560 (380) for CD14lowCD16+ subsets; p?<?0.01). This reduction of monocyte HLA-DR expression 24?h following lower risk surgery raises questions about the purported clinical utility of this biomarker as an early predictor of postoperative complications. Our results also suggest that surgery induces significant trafficking (i.e. mobilisation, margination and extravasation) of monocyte subsets, and that monocyte HLA-DR depression is the result of a down-regulatory phenomenon (decreased protein expression on each cell) rather than the differential trafficking of monocyte subsets.

AB  - Abstract: Background. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after living lobar lung transplantation (LT). Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on peripheral blood monocytes, have been demonstrated to correlate with risk of infection in surgical, trauma, and adult transplant patients. In addition, interleukin (IL)-10 has been shown to be a negative regulator of HLA-DR expression. This study investigates whether HLA-DR expression and serum IL-10 levels correlate with the development of pneumonia after pediatric LT. Methods. Thirteen LT recipients were prospectively monitored with blood samples obtained pre-LT (baseline) and post-LT weeks 1?4. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA from frozen serum collected at the same time points as monocyte HLA-DR expression. Correlates of pneumonia were abstracted from the medical record. Results. Monocyte HLA-DR expression declined in 11 of 13 patients in the first week post-LT. Two patients without an initial decline and four others whose HLA-DR expression recovered by week 2 post-LT, did not develop pneumonia or other infection or rejection. Pneumonia was observed in seven patients, six of whom failed to recover their monocyte HLA-DR expression by 2 weeks post-LT. Six of seven patients with pneumonia recovered, and one patient died of aspergillosis. During weeks 1?4, a statistically significant difference was seen in the profile of mean monocyte HLA-DR expression levels, analyzed as percent of baseline, between the patients with and without pneumonia (P=0.002). The greatest difference between groups over time was seen from post-LT weeks 1?2 (P=0.003). In addition, when comparing the values at each week, a significant difference was seen between the two groups at post-LT week 2 (P=0.006) and week 4 (P=0.05). Analysis of IL-10 concentrations revealed that the overall difference between the groups (patients with and without pneumonia) was statistically significant (P=0.014), with a paradoxical positive correlation between HLA-DR expression at post-LT week 4 and IL-10 concentrations. Conclusions. Persistent low monocyte HLA-DR expression was associated with the risk of post-LT pneumonia in these patients. This measurement may be useful for monitoring risk of infection and stratifying patients into higher and lower risk groups. Increased IL-10 levels may be protective for infection in this group of patients. At present it is unknown whether the predictive power of HLA-DR expression is indicative of a global defect in monocytic function or a specific abnormality.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To find out if the severity of acute pancreatitis or the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis influences HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Design: Prospective open study. Setting: University hospital, Austria. Subjects: 9 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis in need of operative treatment, 5 patients with mild acute pancreatitis, and 7 healthy volunteers. Interventions: Samples of 5 ml blood were taken daily into endotoxin free tubes at same time points. Surgical treatment for severe acute pancreatitis consisted of blunt necrosectomy, operative lavage, laparostomy, and open drainage. Main outcome measures: Correlation between HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes on the one hand and the severity of acute pancreatitis and operative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis, on the other. Results: In patients with severe acute pancreatitis expression of HLA-DR and CD14 was significantly downregulated both before and after operation (p < 0.0001; ANOVA), compared with patients with mild acute pancreatitis or healthy controls. However the expression of the two cell surface markers was not affected either by the first operation, or by the reoperations. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in acute pancreatitis the expression of cell surface markers on peripheral blood monocytes is related to the severity of disease but is not influenced by operative treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - Abstract Pancreas graft survival is influenced by various donor and recipient factors. Factors that have posed serious problems to pancreas transplantation have included the limited cold ischemia time, early graft thrombosis, and rejection. A limited cold ischemia time not only causes problems in terms of logistics but also implies limitations with regard to HLA matching and organ exchange. Between August 1988 and August 1989 we performed a prospective, nonrandomized European multicenter study to evaluate the effect of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution on pancreas graft survival. In addition, donor and recipient factors were collected and their influence on graft survival analyzed. Overall pancreas graft survival at 1 and 4 years was 67% and 59%, respectively (n= 62). When only simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants were included, the graft survival was 70% and 63% at 1 and 4 years, respectively. The incidence of pancreas graft thrombosis was 8%. Cold ischemia time was not found to significantly influence pancreas graft survival even when it exceeded 12 h. Factors that did were HLA-DR matching, simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation versus pancreas transplantation alone, and ABO blood group matching. We feel that the use of UW solution for pancreas preservation has contributed to improved pancreas graft survival and has reduced early graft thrombosis despite much longer cold ischemia times of over 12 h. Given this and the significant effect of HLA and blood group matching, we conclude that more attention should be paid to preoperative matching and organ exchange in order to further improve pancreas graft survival.

AB  - Summary Characterization of host immune cell parameters prior to treatment is expected to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical outcome as well as to elucidate why some patients fail to respond to immunotherapy. We monitored blood immune cells from 58 patients with non-small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing surgery of the primary tumor and from 50 age-matched healthy volunteers. Complete leukocyte blood count, the number of circulating dendritic cells (DC), HLA-DRlow monocytes and several lymphocytic subpopulations were determined by eight-color flow cytometry. Furthermore, the prognostic value of the immune cell parameters investigated was evaluated by patients? survival analysis. Compared to the control group, blood of NSCLC patients contained more neutrophils resulting in a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), but a lower number of blood DC, in particular of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), natural killer (NK) cells and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, a higher frequency of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and HLA-DRlow monocytes was detected, and smoking had a significant impact on these values. HLA-DRlow monocytes were positively correlated to the number of neutrophils, monocytes and NLR, but negatively associated with the number of pDC and naive CD4+ T cells. The frequency of Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as the ratios of CD4/HLA-DRlow monocytes and HLA-DRlow monocytes/pDC correlated with patient?s overall survival. Next to Treg, HLA-DRlow monocytes and naive T cells represent prognostic markers for NSCLC patients and might be useful for monitoring of patients? responses to immunotherapies in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5?percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3?percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.

AB  - Summary The purpose of this prospective study was to enumerate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)+ cells and measure their function using synthetic oligonucleotides enriched in CG dinucleotide motifs (CpG)-induced proliferation within 48?h after trauma in severely injured patients prone to sepsis. Sixteen consecutive trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS)?>?21 and 16 blood donors (controls) were included in this study. Using two-colour flow cytometry, TLR9 expression was detectable intracellularly and also on the surface of B lymphocytes. The surface expression of TLR9 of B lymphocytes from whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with CpG was significantly increased in B cells of severely injured patients prone to sepsis compared to controls. No significant differences could be observed between CpG-induced proliferation of PBMC of severely injured patients prone to sepsis and controls. As a measure of immunosuppression, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression of monocytes of the trauma patients was significantly diminished compared with controls in PBMC and in whole blood. Immunosuppression in the early phase after trauma seems not to be associated with a disturbed sensing of bacterial DNA.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-10 is one of the most crucial immunoregulatory cytokines. Its short-term effects have been analysed extensively, but little is known about its long-term effects. This is of considerable importance, as high systemic IL-10 levels are present for long periods in patients with persistent viral infections, certain cancers and in critical care patients. Our study investigated the effects of the long-term presence of IL-10 on human peripheral blood monocytes. In vitro, IL-10 treatment of these cells for 7?days induced the development of a novel cell type characterized by unique phenotypical and functional characteristics. These cells showed high HLA-DR expression and low expression of CD86 and other co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. The mRNA levels of both HLA-DR and CD86 were high, but no intracellular accumulation of CD86 protein was observed. With respect to its function, these cells showed strongly diminished tumour necrosis factor-α production following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, strongly diminished allogenic CD4+ T cell stimulatory capacity, and even induced a hyporesponsive state in CD4+ T cells. The phenotype remained stable despite the removal of IL-10. In vivo, we found monocytic cells from patients exhibiting this phenotype after long-term IL-10 exposure. These results complement our knowledge further about the biological effects of IL-10 and may provide an explanation for the sustained immunodeficiency in cases of the persistent presence of systemic IL-10.

AB  - Abstract On May 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized sepsis as a global health priority by adopting a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of this deadly disease. While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, pivotal observations based on clinical flow cytometry indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, some septic patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This paved the way for immunostimulation approaches in sepsis. Clinical flow cytometry permitted this evolution by drawing a new picture of pathophysiology and reshaping immune trajectories in patients. Additional information from cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry and other high-dimensional flow cytometry platform should rapidly enrich our understanding of this complex disease. This review reports on landmarks of clinical flow cytometry in sepsis and how this single-cell analysis technique permitted to breach the wall of decades of unfruitful anti-inflammatory-based clinical trials in sepsis. ? 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Problem? The endocervix is a major target of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, but little is known about the immune repertoire in this tissue, or its response to these common bacteria. Method of study? Using a cytobrush, we isolated cells from the endocervix of 20 women during C. trachomatis infection, and post-antibiotic treatment. Endocervical swabs and blood were taken in parallel. Endocervical cells were enumerated, and endocervical and blood T cells immunophenotyped. Chlamydia trachomatis was genotyped by sequence analysis of the OmpA gene, and quantified by culture. Results? Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes were D, E, F and Ia, and infectious burden varied considerably. Endocervical T cell and neutrophil numbers were highly elevated during infection, with both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets accumulating. Regardless of the presence or absence of infection, the endocervical cell infiltrate was dominated by effector memory T cells, and the numbers of CCR5 and CD103 expressing T cells was significantly higher than in the blood. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) expression by endocervical T cells was significantly increased during infection. Conclusion? The human endocervix exhibits a distinct cellular response to C. trachomatis infection that can be longitudinally evaluated by cytobrush sampling. Infecting organisms can be sampled and analyzed in parallel.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/δ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naïve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.
