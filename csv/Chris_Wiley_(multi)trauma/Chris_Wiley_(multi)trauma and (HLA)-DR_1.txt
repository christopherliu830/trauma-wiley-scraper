AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - Summary This review reports the outcomes of paediatric renal transplantation in the United Kingdom over the last 25 years. UK Transplant Registry data on 3236 paediatric renal transplants performed between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2016 were analysed. Significant improvements in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching have been achieved; 84% of recipients received 000 or favourable (0 DR and 0 or 1 B) mismatched kidneys in 2016 compared with 27% in 1992. The median waiting time has increased from 126 days in 1999 to 351 days in 2016. Tacrolimus replaced ciclosporin in most immunosuppressive regimens after 2002. Renal transplant outcome has improved significantly, mainly because of a reduction in early graft loss. One-year donation after brain death renal allograft survival for those transplanted from 2012 to 2016 was 98%, compared with 72% for those transplanted from 1987 to 1991. Renal allograft survival for first kidney only transplants at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 25 years were 89%, 79%, 65%, 42% and 33% respectively. Superior survival with living donor was maintained throughout the study period with 25-year graft survival at 33% compared with 31% from deceased donor (P < 0.0001). Changes in immunosuppression regimens, improvements in HLA matching and a reduction of cold ischaemia time may in part explain the improvements in graft survival.

AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Summary Critically ill patients display a state of immunosuppression that has been attributed in part to decreased plasma arginine concentrations. However, we and other authors have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of L-arginine supplementation. We hypothesize that, in these critically ill patients, these low plasma arginine levels may be secondary to the presence of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), which express arginase known to convert arginine into nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Indeed, in a series of 28 non-surgical critically ill patients, we showed a dramatic increase in gMDSC compared to healthy subjects (P?=?0·0002). A significant inverse correlation was observed between arginine levels and gMDSC (P?=?0·01). As expected, gMDSC expressed arginase preferentially in these patients. Patients with high gMDSC levels on admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) presented an increased risk of death at day 7 after admission (P?=?0·02). In contrast, neither plasma arginine levels, monocytic MDSC levels nor neutrophil levels were associated with overall survival at day 7. No relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) or simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score or gMDSC levels, eliminating a possible bias concerning the direct prognostic role of these cells. As gMDSC exert their immunosuppressive activity via multiple mechanisms [production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-10, arginase, etc.], it may be more relevant to target these cells, rather than simply supplementing with L-arginine to improve immunosuppression and its clinical consequences observed in critically ill patients.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic splenectomy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term impairment of humoral and cellular immunity. Alternatives to surgery have been developed to minimize or avoid the immediate and/or long-term complications of splenectomy. Herein we investigated the long-term effect of non-operative management (NOM) of the traumatic rupture of the spleen on the distribution of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte populations and cytokine production by T cells. PB samples were drawn from six NOM patients, 13 age-matched adults who had undergone splenectomy after trauma (SP patients) and 31 age-matched controls. Cellular phenotypes and the intracellular production of interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in T cells were determined in whole blood?±?mitogens by flow cytometry. NOM patients did not show any changes in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the distribution of their subsets, compared to the controls. In contrast, SP patients showed a sustained increase in the percentage and/or absolute numbers of lymphocytes, CD8 T cells, activated CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK)?T cells, NK cells and ?δ T cells, and a reduction in naive CD4 T cells. The constitutive or induced cytokine production by T cells of the NOM group was similar to the control group, whereas SP patients had increased percentages of constitutive IL-2- and IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells and IFN-?-producing CD4 T cells. Our findings indicate collectively that the healing process in NOM does not affect the architecture of the spleen to such an extent that it would lead to long-term alterations of the proportions of PB lymphocytes or the T cell cytokine profiles.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Summary The role of the phagocytic function of monocytes and neutrophils in sepsis has been poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the impact of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Thirty-one patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and neutrophils was evaluated during 24?h after admission and the results were correlated to the expression of CD64 on neutrophils and monocytes, CD14 antigen on monocytes, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the patients' survival. A reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils during the first 24?h after admission was a negative predictor for survival. Increased expression of CD64 antigen on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes was favourably correlated to the patients' survival. In multivariate analysis the phagocytic activity of PMNs was the only independent predictor factor for survival. Patients with PMN phagocytic activity <37% had lower expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and worse outcome, while those with phagocytic activity >37% had higher expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and better outcome. Reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils may represent a state of neutrophil inactivation similar to that previously described for monocytes during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract Several lines of evidence suggest that cell injury may occur in malformations of cortical development associated with epilepsy. Moreover, recent studies support the link between neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative mechanisms. We evaluated a series of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD, n?=?26; type I and II) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC, n?=?6) cases. Sections were processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2?-deoxyuridine 5?-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) labeling and immunohistochemistry using markers for the evaluation of apoptosis signaling pathways and neurodegeneration-related proteins/pathways. In both FCD II and TSC specimens, we observed significant increases in both TUNEL-positive and caspase?3-positive cells compared with controls and FCD I. Expression of ?-amyloid precursor protein was observed in neuronal soma and processes in FCD II and TSC. In these specimens, we also observed an abnormal expression of death receptor-6. Immunoreactivity for phosphorylated tau was only found in older patients with FCD II and TSC. In these cases, prominent nuclear/cytoplasmic p62 immunoreactivity was detected in both dysmorphic neurons and balloon/giant cells. Our data provide evidence of complex, but similar, mechanisms of cell injury in focal malformations of cortical development associated with mammalian target of rapamycin pathway hyperactivation, with prominent induction of apoptosis-signaling pathways and premature activation of mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Summary The counter-regulatory mechanisms initiated to limit the overzealous inflammatory process in patients with infectious (sepsis) or non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) led to the concept of ?compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome? (CARS). One major consequence of CARS is the modification of the immune status that could favor the enhanced susceptibility of intensive care patients to nosocomial infections. The expression of surface markers can be modified, and numerous functions of circulating leukocytes are altered in sepsis and SIRS patients, as well as in animal models of sepsis or SIRS. However, this is rather a reprogramming of circulating leukocytes, since there is not a global defect of the immune cells functions.

AB  - Summary It has recently been appreciated that patients with severe sepsis and septic shock suffer from altered innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to an impaired clearance of microorganisms. This explains their difficulty to fight their primary bacterial infection and their propensity to develop superinfections. A depressed immunological surveillance in some of these patients is also responsible for a reactivation of dormant viruses, such as cytomegalovirus. Leukocyte functions are profoundly affected during sepsis. Circulating phagocytes show a marked decrease in their capacity to mount a proinflammatory reaction in response to microorganisms. Monocytes express low levels of major histocompatibility class II molecules. These phenotypic changes are known as ?immune paralysis?. Massive lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis has also been reported in patients dying of sepsis, responsible, at least in part, for the impairment of adaptive responses. This was highlighted by the defective skin tests to common antigens documented already three decades ago in patients with sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may therefore benefit from treatments aimed at stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. The aims of immune stimulation are: (1) to help bacterial killing at the primary focus of infection; (2) to prevent the development of nosocomial infections; and (3) to prevent the reactivation of dormant viruses. Therapeutic strategies based on ?boosting? immune responses with interferon ?, G-CSF, and more recently with GM-CSF have been initiated. Although results of pilot studies are encouraging, these will need to be confirmed in larger clinical studies. As a word of caution, one should not induce deleterious overwhelming inflammatory reactions, and therefore close monitoring of immune and inflammatory responses during immune stimulation therapy is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Coronary angiography (CA) is the gold standard evaluation of coronary artery disease in potential multi-organ donors. This use of iodinated contrast media could lead to contrast-induced acute kidney injury and consequently to delayed graft function (DGF). All patients in France who received a kidney from a 45-70-year-old donor without medical contraindication for cardiac donation and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor were included. Recipients of preemptive kidney transplant or multi-organ transplant, or who died within the first 8 days post-transplantation were excluded. Data were obtained from CRISTAL database. From March 2012 to June 2014, 892 kidneys from 483 donors were transplanted. DGF was reported in 38.9% of the 375 kidney recipients grafted with a kidney from the 217 donors who had CA and in 45.5% of the 440 kidney recipients who received a kidney from the 257 donors without CA. Multivariate analysis showed that CA or repeated injection of iodinated contrast media did not influence the risk of DGF. CA did not increase the risk of primary non-function, the duration of DGF or post-transplantation hospital stay and did not affect the graft function at 1 year. Evaluation of potential multi-organ donors with CA does not affect kidney graft outcomes.

AB  - Abstract To facilitate research cooperation among the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, ISAC supported the Epona Cytometry Conference in eastern Hungary near Debrecen and the Hortobágy National Park. This was the first ISAC sponsored conference held in Hungary. The 150 attendees included scientists from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. There was also representation from Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Presentations and posters were of typically high ISAC quality. In addition, the Epona meeting attracted an impressive selection of commercial exhibits that provided contacts and improved the awareness of advanced analytical cytology for the attendees. The Epona conference was organized with Hungarian passion and skill by Professor Sandor Damjanovich, Dr. Jànos Szollosi, and the members of the Biophysics and Cell Biology Department of the Medical School of Debrecen. The Department has been active in cytometry for over 20 years, and in hosting the conference, it also celebrated the 20th anniversary of its installment of the first cell sorter in Eastern Europe. The successful meeting demonstrates that Hungarians are strong contenders for the organization of future ISAC meetings. During my 1999 Fulbright Scholarship in Professor Damjanovich's Department, I traveled extensively and can verify that there are other unique sites in Hungary?Sopron, Pécs, Lake Balaton, and Budapest?for ISAC meetings. The site of the conference was on the Hungarian Puszta or plain near the Hortobágy National Park, which offered tours to observe ?Hungarian Cowboys,? long-horned cattle, twisted-horn sheep, hairy pigs, and water buffalo, which were brought into the Carpathian Basin by the Magyars. Located in beautiful grasslands on the edge of the Park, the Epona Village was an excellent site for the meeting and is distinctly Hungarian. The timing of the conference was dramatic. Hungary was admitted to NATO in April and the Kosovo conflict with Yugoslavia began a few weeks later. During the conference, NATO air raids into Kosovo were being conducted from bases in southern Hungary. There was much concerned discussion among the attendees of the Kosovo situation. All regretted the loss of life, and all shared the hope that creating cooperative projects in science, agriculture, business, and education will lower international tension. In supporting the Epona conference, ISAC contributed importantly to cooperative science.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.
