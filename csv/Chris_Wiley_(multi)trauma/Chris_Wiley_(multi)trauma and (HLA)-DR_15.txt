AB  - Aims Abnormalities of the hippocampus are associated with a range of diseases in children, including epilepsy and sudden death. A population of rod cells in part of the hippocampus, the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, has long been recognized in infants. Previous work suggested that these cells were microglia and that their presence was associated with chronic illness and sudden infant death syndrome. Prompted by the observations that a sensitive immunohistochemical marker of microglia used in diagnostic practice does not typically stain these cells and that the hippocampus is a site of postnatal neurogenesis, we hypothesized that this transient population of cells were not microglia but neural progenitors. Methods Using archived post mortem tissue, we applied a broad panel of antibodies to establish the immunophenotype of these cells in 40 infants dying suddenly of causes that were either explained or remained unexplained, following post mortem investigation. Results The rod cells were consistently negative for the microglial markers CD45, CD68 and HLA-DR. The cells were positive, in varying proportions, for the neural progenitor marker, doublecortin, the neural stem cell marker, nestin and the neural marker, TUJ1. Conclusions These data support our hypothesis that the rod cells of the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus in the infant hippocampus are not microglia but a population of neural progenitors. These findings advance our understanding of postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus in health and disease and are of diagnostic importance, allowing reactive microglia to be distinguished from the normal population of neural progenitors.

AB  - Abstract Many years of research have resulted in the successful examples of immunotherapies for many diseases including cancers and inflammatory diseases. These new treatments are referred to as biological therapies-such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine therapies. The recent technological advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) development have caused significant investment and interest in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Therefore, this chapter will highlight these new advances in the biological therapy arena.

AB  - Abstract In 2017, 3273 heart transplants were performed in the United States. New listings continued to increase, and 3769 new adults were listed for heart transplant in 2017. Over the past decade, posttransplant mortality has declined. The number of new pediatric listings increased over the past decade, as did the number of pediatric heart transplants, although some fluctuation has occurred more recently. New listings for pediatric heart transplants increased from 481 in 2007 to 623 in 2017. The number of pediatric heart transplants performed each year increased from 330 in 2007 to 432 in 2017, slightly fewer than in 2016. Short-term and long-term mortality improved. Among pediatric patients who underwent transplant between 2015-2016, 4.8% had died by 6 months and 6.2% by 1 year.

AB  - Abstract Each year since 2012, the number of lung transplants has increased, reflecting an increase in the number of donors, improved use of recovered organs, and more candidates being listed for transplant. However, the need for organs continues to outpace available donors. Despite an increase of 126 donors in 2017, 1360 candidates remained on the waiting list at the end of the year, and 326 patients died or became too sick to undergo transplant. Approximately 14,000 individuals were living with a lung transplant in 2017; 9492 were aged 50 years or older, 4075 were aged 18-49 years, and 408 were aged younger than 18 years.

AB  - Abstract The primary goal of US lung allocation policy is to ensure that candidates with the highest risk for mortality receive appropriate access to lung transplant. In 2018, 2562 lung transplants were performed in the US, reflecting a 31% increase over the past 5 years. More candidates are being listed for lung transplant, and the number of donors has increased substantially. Despite an increase of 84 lung transplants in 2018, 365 adult candidates died or became too sick to undergo transplant. In 2018, 24 new child (ages 0-11 years) candidates were added to the lung transplant waiting list. Fifteen lung transplants were performed in recipients aged 0-11 years, three in recipients aged younger than 1 year, two in recipients aged 1-5 years, and ten in recipients aged 6-11 years. Of 27 child candidates removed from the waiting list in 2018, 16 (59.3%) were removed due to undergoing transplant, six (22.2%) due to death, one (3.7%) due to improved condition, and one (3.7%) due to becoming too sick to undergo transplant.
