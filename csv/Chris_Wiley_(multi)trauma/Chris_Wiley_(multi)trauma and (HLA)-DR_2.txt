AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - The influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on transplanted kidney outcome is not well understood. The aim of this one-centre study was to analyse the association between tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interferon-? (IFN-?) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) genotypes and the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and 5-year kidney graft loss. Genotyping was performed in 199 subsequent kidney graft recipients from deceased donors without induction therapy based on polymerase chain reaction method using sequence-specific primers for TNF-α (-308A/G), IL-10 (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C), IL-6 (-174G/C), IFN-? (+874T/A) and TGF-?1 (in codons 10T/C and 25G/C). Genotypes were grouped according to the strength of cytokine expression. During a 5-year follow-up period, 14 patients died with functioning graft and 33 developed graft failure. The analysed polymorphisms were not associated with the incidence of DGF. The frequency of early episodes of AR was significantly associated only with TGF-?1 genotype. There was an association between -174G/C IL-6 gene polymorphism and the death-censored kidney graft survival. The risk of graft loss during 5-year follow-up period was greater by 57% for GG or GC (higher IL-6 production) than for CC carriers. None of the other analysed polymorphisms significantly influenced both patients and kidney graft survival, also in the analysis of the subgroup with human leucocyte antigen-DR mismatch. -174G/C IL-6 genotype of the kidney graft recipient could modulate the rate of graft excretory function deterioration and the risk of graft loss by influencing their constitutional expression.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - HLA alloimmunization induced by pregnancy, multiple transfusions or transplantation is responsible for some of the serious complications seen in patients receiving blood and blood products. These complications are primarily the result of antibody and antigen triggering an acute immunological reaction, which in some cases can be fatal e.g. TRALI. Some adverse reactions are triggered by HLA antibodies present in the patient whereas others are initiated by antibodies or HLA reactive cells present in the transfused product. The introduction of universal leucodepletion for the prevention of vCJD transmission has resulted in a significant reduction in these reactions by eliminating the main source of alloimmunization, but residual cellular components or platelets are still able to activate the immune system and induce the development of HLA reactive antibodies or T cells. However, the use of more sensitive and specific techniques to detect HLA antibodies and antigens has not only improved the investigation of transfusion reactions and their subsequent diagnosis, but it has also facilitated the implementation of a number of measures such as the use of HLA antibody negative products to further reduce their development.

AB  - If stem cells fulfill their therapeutic promise, moving them from the laboratory into the clinic will raise several concerns about justice. One concern is that, for biological reasons alone, stem cell-based therapies might not be available for every patient who needs one. Worse, depending on how we address the problem of biological access, they might benefit primarily white Americans. We can avoid this outcome?although at a cost?by carefully selecting the stem cells we make available.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

AB  - Summary The use of flow cytometry (FCM) in the study of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) is particularly important. It is able to reliably discriminate between true clonal proliferations and the reactive lymphocytosis seen as a response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Before any potentially clonal disorder can be categorized, it is important to have a basic understanding of T and B-cell lymphoid ontogeny. The pattern of surface cluster differentiation (CD) antigen expression indicates the degree of maturity, the possible relationship with the lymph node germinal centre and sometimes the function of the normal cell from which a malignant population is derived. Many lymphoproliferative disorders and exfoliating lymphoid lymphomas can be encountered in clinical practice. These disorders are extremely different in their biological basis, presentation, morphology and immunophenotype. An accurate diagnosis can only be made when all these characteristics are carefully considered together and not assessed in isolation.

AB  - Abstract Objective Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are considered atheroprotective, and low levels have been associated with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS. However, the functional properties as well as homeostasis of Tregs are mainly unknown in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we investigated the composition and functional properties of naïve (n) and memory (m)Tregs in patients with NSTE-ACS and in patients 6?12 months post-ACS. Methods Based on the expression of CD25, FOXP3, CD127, CD45RA, CD39 and CTLA-4, Treg subsets were defined by flow cytometry in whole blood or isolated CD4+ T cells. The functional properties of nTregs and mTregs were examined in terms of proliferative capacity and modulation of cytokine secretion. To understand the potential consequences of Treg defects, we also investigated correlations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine secretion and ultrasound-defined carotid atherosclerosis. Results Both NSTE-ACS and post-ACS patients exhibited reduced levels of nTregs (P < 0.001) compared with healthy control subjects, but without compensatory increases in mTregs. Both nTregs and mTregs from patients showed significantly lower replicative rates and impaired capacity to modulate T-cell proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-10. The Treg defect was also associated with LPS-induced cytokine secretion and increased burden of carotid atherosclerosis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a functional and homeostatic Treg defect in patients with NSTE-ACS and also in stabilized patients 6?12 months after ACS. Moreover, this defect was associated with a subclinical proinflammatory and atherogenic state. We believe that the failure to preserve Treg function and homeostasis reflects a need for immune-restoring strategies in CAD.

The overall objectives of the meeting were to expand ideas, approaches, and collaborations for members of the society by bringing together experts in disciplines relevant to pigment cell research and associated diseases such as melanoma, albinoism, vitiligo, and other diseases of pigment cells. The meeting focused on recent developments in the genetics, novel gene function, gene expression pattern, and post-transcriptional processing of melanocyte specific proteins, melanosome function, melanin structure, and implications of recent basic advances for understanding human pigmentary diseases. These areas have been particularly productive due to recent breakthroughs and rapid progress in microarray gene expression, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and other physical chemical and molecular biotechnologies.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is considered the major cause of death among critically ill patients in the developed world. While there is a general view that this reflects contributions from both the pathogen and the host with respect to an inappropriate inflammatory response, there is a lack of agreement as to the key immune mechanisms. This has been reflected in the diverse range of immunotherapies tested in clinical trials, often with rather marginal effects. The case has been made for a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, the so-called ?cytokine storm?, and for a role of too little immunity through immune paralysis. Apoptosis is implicated as a key mechanism in both this immune paralysis and the multi-organ failure that is a feature of severe sepsis. A number of polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis, including cytokine genes, HLA class II and caspase-12. In this review we focus in particular on the role of group A streptococci in severe sepsis. Here the effect of bacterial superantigens appears to be a correlate of inflammatory activation, although the precise evolutionary role of the superantigens remains unclear.

AB  - Machine perfusion (MP) has been used as the kidney preservation method in our center for over 10 years. The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Anal incontinence is a devastating condition that significantly reduces the quality of life. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of human adipose stem cell (hASC) injections in a rat model for anal sphincter injury, which is the main cause of anal incontinence in humans. Furthermore, we tested if the efficacy of hASCs could be improved by combining them with polyacrylamide hydrogel carrier, Bulkamid. Human ASCs derived from a female donor were culture expanded in DMEM/F12 supplemented with human platelet lysate. Female virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (n?=?14?15/group): hASCs in saline or Bulkamid (3 ? 105/60 ?l) and saline or Bulkamid without cells. Anorectal manometry (ARM) was performed before anal sphincter injury, at two (n?=?58) and at four weeks after (n?=?33). Additionally, the anal sphincter tissue was examined by micro-computed tomography (?CT) and the histological parameters were compared between the groups. The median resting and peak pressure during spontaneous contraction measured by ARM were significantly higher in hASC treatment groups compared with the control groups without hASCs. There was no statistical difference in functional results between the hASC-carrier groups (saline vs. Bulkamid). No difference was detected in the sphincter muscle continuation between the groups in the histology and ?CT analysis. More inflammation was discovered in the group receiving saline with hASC. The hASC injection therapy with both saline and Bulkamid is a promising nonsurgical treatment for acute anal sphincter injury. Traditional histology combined with the 3D ?CT image data lends greater confidence in assessing muscle healing and continuity. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:295?304

AB  - Transplant vasculopathy (TV) represents the main cause of late graft failure and limits the long-term success of organ transplantation. Cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of the concentric and diffuse intimal hyperplasia of arteries of the grafted organ. We recently reported that the mitogenic signaling, evoked in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hmSMC) by the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, implicates neutral sphingomyelinase-2, suggesting a role for sphingolipids in intimal hyperplasia of TV. Here, we investigated whether the mitogenic sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is involved in intimal hyperplasia elicited by W6/32. Studies were done on cultured hmSMC and on an in vivo model of TV, consisting of human mesenteric arteries grafted into SCID/beige mice, injected weekly with W6/32. hmSMC migration and DNA synthesis elicited by W6/32 were inhibited by the sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) inhibitor dimethylsphingosine, the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab and the S1PR1/R3 inhibitor VPC23019. W6/32 stimulated SK1 activity, while siRNA silencing SK1, S1PR1 and S1PR3 inhibited hmSMC migration. In vivo, Sphingomab significantly reduced the intimal thickening induced by W6/32. These data emphasize the role of S1P in intimal hyperplasia elicited by the humoral immune response, and open perspectives for preventing TV with S1P inhibitors.
