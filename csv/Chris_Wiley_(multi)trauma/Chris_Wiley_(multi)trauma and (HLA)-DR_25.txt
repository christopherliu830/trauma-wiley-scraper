Holmes, 2 Jermoe Engel, 3 Yehezkel Ben-Ari, 4 Robert Muller, and 5 John Huguenard ( 1 Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Inmed Institute, Marseille, France ; 4 SUNDY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY ; and 5 Department of Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA ,) The purpose of this symposium is to provide clinicians, basic scientists, and professions in health care with an understanding of the importance of brain rhythms in normal and abnormal brain function. Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - Abstract Most clinically demented elderly patients are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We studied 5 patients clinically characterized by late onset dementia whose brains showed no pathological evidence of Alzheimer's disease, or any other specific neuropathological diagnosis. We found argyrophilic grains, coiled bodies, abundant Alz-50-positive and thioflavine S-negative neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, locus ceruleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and inferior olives, Ultrastructurally, the grains, threads, and tangles were composed of straight tubulofilamentous structures, 25 nm in diameter, similar to those found in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy but different from the paired helical filaments of patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that the late onset dementia with argyrophilic grains syndrome is also characterized by the presence of tangles and threads with the topographical distribution of progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB  - Abstract The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves both genetic-susceptibility and, at least, three sequential environmental-events. The first environmental-event is a maternal-factor, which acts near birth. The second acts subsequently but prior to approximately age 15 years and the third acts long after these first two events have already taken place. Two environmental-events strongly implicated in MS-pathogenesis are vitamin D deficiency and Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection. These factors seem well-suited to the first two environmental-events in this causal chain. If this notion is correct, it is likely that interrupting either of these factors (e.g. the timely supplementation of Vitamin D or the development of an EBV vaccine might be simple and effective methods for achieving primary disease prevention. In addition to these environmental-events, genetic factors are both crucial and complex. More than 110 genomic-regions have now been associated with MS-susceptibility and only a very small fraction of the population is genetically-susceptible. However, the actual genes involved are much more poorly defined than is often thought. For example, it turns out that the well-established association with the DRB1*1501 allele on chromosome 6, is, likely, not due to this allele itself but, rather, to something else that resides on the SNP-haplotype, which usually harbors this allele. Also, despite women being the large majority of MS patients, men are more likely to be genetically-susceptible. Nevertheless, women are more responsive to the changing environmental-exposures, which have occurred recently; thereby accounting for the changes in sex-ratio and MS-prevalence in women, which have been found in many regions.

AB  - Summary For explaining such a fundamental and contradictory phenomenon as self-maintenance of the pool of hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and subsequent choice of differentiation program into this or that hemopoietic lineage, Schofield (1978) put forward a hypothesis on a hemopoietic niche (specialized cell microenvironment). Schofield's paper gave rise to 30-year studies devoted to hypothetic models and various aspects of HSC niche functioning and hierarchy. Detection of close contacts between HSCs and osteoblasts located in the endosteum and adventitial cells of blood vessels made a scientific breakthrough in this field, and the existence of osteoblastic and vascular niches for HSCs has been postulated since 2003. One of the promising directions is the design and modification of materials for control over the fate of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) that will allow stroma of various human and animal organs and tissues to be constructed. However, the discussion about the existence and functioning of MMSCs niche is only developing. The design of artificial materials capable of biomimetical reproducing of the cellular and tissue microenvironment based on ideas and main elements borrowed from wildlife is a main direction in the development of medical materials technology and tissue bioengineering. Scaffold technology is an experimental approach to the search of the stem cell niches. Recent attempts to model the microterritories (niches) for HSCs have been undertaken and the behavior of cells in such structures has been investigated. However, the main quantitative factors involved in the original design of stem cell microterritories remain unknown. It hampers the development of cell biology and tissue engineering. At the modern stage, the topography, hierarchy, and the size of the niches have to be determined, because the definition of the niches as morphological (structural and functional) units (microterritories), which provides the conditions for vital activity of stem cells, implies finite values of its parameters. The aim of the chapter was the critical review of key milestones of the niche concept for HSCs and MMSCs as we understood it. We speculated our definition of the stem cell niche proposed and described certain stages (postulated; morphofunctional; topographical; quantitative; bioengineering) of the niche theory development as well as prospective directions of the niche designing for regenerative medicine were noted.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Abstract: steopetrosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by lack of osteoclast function. Osteopetrosis is found spontaneously in most mammalian species and many transgenic animals have been created, but so far no animal model has been found that genetically corresponds to human malignant autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. The only curative treatment for malignant osteopetrosis is bone marrow transplantation. A review of the literature and preliminary data from IBMTR shows that infants transplanted with marrow from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated volunteer donor have an actuarian five-year survival with a functioning graft of 50?70%, while those transplanted with a T-cell-depleted mismatched marrow have a very poor survival of only about 10%.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lungs are allocated to adult and adolescent transplant candidates (aged ≥ 12 years) on the basis of age, geography, blood type compatibility, and the lung allocation score (LAS), which reflects risk of waitlist mortality and probability of posttransplant survival. In 2014, 2458 active candidates aged 12 years or older, the most of any year, were added to the list; 1949 transplants were performed. Overall median waiting time to transplant for candidates listed in 2014 was 3.7 months. Candidates undergoing lung transplant in 2014 were sicker than ever before with median LAS 44.4. Measures of short-term survival continue to improve; however, long-term survival has plateaued since the implementation of the LAS in 2005; at 5 years posttransplant, 42.4% of recipients had died. In 2014, 30 new active child (ages 0-11) candidates were added to the list; 19 transplants were performed. Incidence of patient death was 7.1% at 6 months and 10.8% at 1 year for transplants in 2013, 29.7% at 3 years for transplants in 2009-2010, and 42.7% at 5 years for transplants in 2007-2008. By age, 5-year patient survival was poorest for recipients aged younger than 1 year.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.
