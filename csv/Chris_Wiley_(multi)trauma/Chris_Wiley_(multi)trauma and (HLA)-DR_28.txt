AB  - As in many aspects of transfusion medicine, practices have developed based on low levels of evidence. Let?s review some assumptions and think how these might change in future:- (1)?Indications. 80% of platelet transfusions are given prophylactically to patients with bone marrow failure, yet no trials have demonstrated the value of prophylaxis over treatment of bleeding alone. (2)?Trigger. A trigger of 10???10?g/l is now accepted. Reducing this further will depend on accurate counting, challenging at this level. (3)?Dose & frequency. The optimum dosing schedule has not been derived by pharmacokinetic studies, but by what can be conveniently manufactured. An adult dose of 3???1011 platelets is accepted, but there is wide variation in practice. (4)?Manufacture. Globally, 3 methods (pooled buffy coats, platelet rich plasma and apheresis) all produce an efficacious product. Although apheresis platelets reduce donor exposure, no functional advantage has been demonstrated. (5)?In vitro assessment of function. A battery of tests is recommended, but only pH has been shown to correlate with posttransfusion survival. (6)?ABO matching. ABO compatible platelets give better increments, and transfusing ABO incompatible plasma can be associated with haemolysis, but ABO matching to patient is often compromised by stock management. (7)?Use of platelet additive solution. A 70:30 mix of PAS:plasma would reduce reactions and perhaps TRALI but this is not standard practice. Is the plasma useful? (8)?CMV safety. Overall, leucocyte depletion alone appears to provide a high degree of protection, but this is not universally accepted. (9)?Assessment of response. 1 and 24?hr increments are standard, but is regression analysis the way forward? (10)?Management of refractoriness. Better HLA and HPA matching is now technically possible. Should these lead to better HLA matching for all? (11)?Is one product for all appropriate? 20% of platelets go to surgical patients who are bleeding. Do they need a product with a different specification?

AB  - Abstract The number of pancreas transplants performed in the United States stabilized over the last 3 years after nearly a decade of steady decline. Numbers of new additions to the list also stabilized during the same period. Notably, the persistent decline in pancreas after kidney transplants also seems to have abated, at least for now. The first full year of data after implementation of the new pancreas allocation system revealed no change in the distribution of organs between simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant and pancreas transplant alone. The percentage of kidneys used in SPK transplants was also unchanged. While a uniform definition of pancreas graft failure was approved in June 2015, it is awaiting implementation. Meanwhile, SRTR will refrain from publishing pancreas graft failure data in the program-specific reports. Therefore, it is difficult to track trends in outcomes after pancreas transplant over the past 2 years. New initiatives by the OPTN/UNOS Pancreas Transplantation Committee include facilitated pancreas allocation and broadened allocation of pancreata across compatible ABO blood types to increase organ utilization.

AB  - Abstract PHAP1 (Putative HLA-DR-associated protein 1), also termed acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32A (ANP32A), Phosphoprotein 32 (pp32) or protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor (I1PP2A), is a multifunctional protein aberrantly expressed in multiple types of human cancers. However, its expression pattern and clinical relevance in human glioma remain unknown. In this study, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated PHAP1 protein was highly expressed in glioma patients, especially in those with high-grade disease. Publicly available data also revealed high levels of PHAP1 were associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. The functional studies showed that knock-down of PHAP1 suppressed the proliferation of glioma cells, while overexpression of PHAP1 facilitated it. The iTRAQ proteomic analysis suggested that stathmin might be a potential downstream target of PHAP1. Consistently, PHAP1 knock-down significantly decreased the expression of stathmin, while overexpression of PHAP1 increased it. Also, the upstream negative regulator, p27, expression levels increased upon PHAP1 knock-down and decreased when PHAP1 was overexpressed. As a result, the phosphorylated Akt (S473), an upstream regulator of p27, expression levels decreased upon silencing of PHAP1, but elevated after PHAP1 overexpression. Importantly, we demonstrate the p27 down-regulation, stathmin up-regulation and cell proliferation acceleration induced by PHAP1 overexpression were dependent on Akt activation. In conclusion, the above results suggest that PHAP1 expression is elevated in glioma patients, which may accelerate the proliferation of glioma cells by regulating the Akt/p27/stathmin pathway.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2018 are notable for (1) continued growth in numbers of new waitlist registrants (11,844) and transplants performed (8250); (2) continued increase in the transplant rate (54.5 per 100 waitlist-years); (3) a precipitous decline in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis-C-related indications; (4) increases in waitlist registrants and recipients with alcoholic liver disease and with clinical profiles consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; (5) increased use of hepatitis C virus antibody-positive donor livers; and (6) continued improvement in graft survival despite changing recipient characteristics such as older age and higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Variability in transplant rates remained by candidate race, hepatocellular carcinoma status, urgency status, and geography. The volume of pediatric liver transplants was relatively unchanged. The highest rate of pre-transplant mortality persisted for children aged younger than 1 year. Children underwent transplant at higher acuity than in the past, as evidenced by higher model for end-stage liver disease/pediatric end-stage liver disease scores and listings at status 1A and 1B at transplant. Despite higher illness severity scores at transplant, pediatric graft and patient survival posttransplant have improved over time.
