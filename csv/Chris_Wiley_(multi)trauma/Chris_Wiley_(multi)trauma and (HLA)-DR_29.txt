AB  - Abstract Despite improvements in medical and surgical treatment of intestinal failure, intestine transplant continues to play an important role. In 2016, a total of 147 intestine transplants were performed, 80 intestine-without-liver and 67 intestine-liver. Over the past decade, the age distribution of candidates waitlisted for intestine and intestine-liver transplant shifted from primarily pediatric to increasing proportions of adults. In 2016, 58.2% of candidates on the intestine list at any time during the year were aged younger than 18 years, with a decrease over time in those aged younger than 6 years and an increase in those aged 6-17 years. Adults accounted for 41.9% of candidates on the list at any time during the year, with a stable proportion of those aged 18-34 years and a decrease in those aged 35 years or older. By age, pretransplant mortality rate was highest for adult candidates at 11.7 per 100 waitlist years and lowest for children aged younger than 6 years at 2.2 per 100 waitlist years. For intestine transplants with or without a liver in 2009-2011, 1- and 5-year graft survival was 72.0% and 54.1%, respectively, for recipients aged younger than 18 years, and 70.5% and 44.1%, respectively, for recipients aged 18 years or older.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung transplants are increasingly used as treatment for end-stage lung diseases not amenable to other medical and surgical therapies. Lungs are allocated to adult and adolescent transplant candidates on the basis of age, geography, blood type compatibility, and the Lung Allocation Score, which reflects risk of wait-list mortality and probability of posttransplant survival. The overall median waiting time in 2012 was 4 months, and 65.3% of candidates underwent transplant within 1 year of listing; however, this proportion varied greatly by donation service area. Unadjusted median survival of lung transplant recipients was 5.3 years in 2012, and median survival conditional on living for 1 year posttransplant was 6.7 years. Among pediatric lung candidates in 2012, 32.1% were wait-listed for less than 1 year, 17.9% for 1 to less than 2 years, 16.7% for 2 to less than 4 years, and 33.3% for 4 or more years. Both graft and patient survival have continued to improve; survival rates for recipients aged 6-11 years are better than for younger recipients. Compared with recipients of other solid organ transplants, lung transplant recipients experienced the highest rates of rehospitalization for transplant complications: 43.7 per 100 patients in year 1 and 36.0 in year 2.
