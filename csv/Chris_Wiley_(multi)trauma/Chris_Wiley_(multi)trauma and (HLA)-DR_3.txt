International Endodontic Journal00, 000?000, 2012. Abstract Aim? To compare cells from normal and inflamed human dental pulps regarding the presence of stem cells, their proliferation and differentiation potential. Methodology? Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from normal (DPSC-N) and inflamed dental pulps (DPSC-I). They were compared in respect to proliferation (MTT assay), morphology and STRO-1 expression. STRO-1-positive cells were subject to proliferation (MTT and CFU counting) and morphological analyses and then submitted to odonto-osteogenic, adipogenic and condrogenic differentiation. Differentiated cells were evaluated concerning morphology and the expression, by qRT-PCR, of BSP, LPL and SOX-9 genes. The amount of mineralized matrix produced after odonto-osteogenic differentiation was compared with quantitative Alizarin Red staining. Results? No difference was observed in the morphology and in the proliferation rate of DPSC-N and DPSC-I either before or after separation of STRO-1-positive cells. These cells represented 0.46% (±0.14) and 0.43% (±0.19) of the cell population from normal and inflamed dental pulps, respectively. Both DPSC-N and DPSC-I were capable of differentiating under the three assayed conditions and presented similar patterns for BSP, LPL and SOX-9 expression. Mineralized matrix production was also compatible. In all the quantitative experiments, differences were found between cells from each patient, either from normal or from inflamed pulps. Nonetheless, there was no statistical difference between these two groups. Conclusion? The morphology, proliferation rate and differentiation potential of DPSC-I were similar to the observed in DPSC-N, thus demonstrating that the inflammatory process did not affect the stem cell properties that were assessed.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell implantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries. In a clinically relevant paradigm, however, the implantation of autologous Schwann cells is problematic and the use of heterogenetic Schwann cells will be required. In the present study we addressed this important issue and analysed the immunogenicity and survival of allogeneic and xenogeneic Schwann cell suspension grafts in a prelesioned CNS fiber tract, the transected postcommissural fornix of the adult Wistar rat. Cultured Schwann cells from Wistar rat or human peripheral nerve were injected either immediately or after a delay into the transection site and the spatio-temporal pattern of leukocyte infiltration and of major histocompatibility antigen expression was characterized and semiquantified with immunocytochemical methods. Our main findings are that (1) invasive cerebral lesions induce the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, but only sparse infiltration of T-lymphocytes, (2) both allogeneic and xenogeneic discordant Schwann cell suspension grafts, from either neonatal or adult peripheral nerve, survive without any overt signs of rejection for up to 10 weeks after implantation; and (3) delayed implantation procedures have no effect on immune responses to allogeneic Schwann cell grafts. These results demonstrate that there is no marked ongoing immune reactions to heterogenetic Schwann cell suspension grafts and that long-term survival of cross-species Schwann cell grafts can be achieved in the absence of any immunsuppressive treatment. Thus the conditions for functional transplantation of Schwann cells across immunological barriers seem to be favourable and will have implications for future cross-species studies, and possibly also for clinical application.

AB  - Insufficient hemodynamics during agonal phase?ie, the period between withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and circulatory arrest?in Maastricht category III circulatory-death donors (DCD) potentially exacerbate ischemia/reperfusion injury. We included 409 Dutch adult recipients of DCD donor kidneys transplanted between 2006 and 2014. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2-with pulse oximetry at the fingertip) and systolic blood pressure (SBP-with arterial catheter) were measured during agonal phase, and were dichotomized into minutes of SpO2 > 60% or SpO2 < 60%, and minutes of SBP > 80 mmHg or SBP < 80 mmHg. Outcome measures were and primary non-function (PNF), delayed graft function (DGF), and three-year graft survival. Primary non-function (PNF) rate was 6.6%, delayed graft function (DGF) rate was 67%, and graft survival at three years was 76%. Longer periods of agonal phase (median 16 min [IQR 11-23]) contributed significantly to an increased risk of DGF (P = .012), but not to PNF (P = .071) and graft failure (P = .528). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that an increase from 7 to 20 minutes in period of SBP < 80 mmHg was associated with 2.19 times the odds (95% CI 1.08-4.46, P = .030) for DGF. In conclusion, duration of agonal phase is associated with early transplant outcome. SBP < 80 mmHg during agonal phase shows a better discrimination for transplant outcome than SpO2 < 60% does.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

AB  - Summary Lack of an accepted definition for ?high immunological risk? hampers individualization of immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation. For recipient-related risk factors for acute rejection, the most compelling evidence points to younger age and African American ethnicity. Recipient gender, body mass, previous transplantation, and concomitant infection or disease do not appear to be influential. Deceased donation now has only a minor effect on rejection risk, but older donor age remains a significant predictor. Conventional immunological markers (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] mismatching, pretransplant anti-HLA alloantibodies, and panel reactive antibodies) are being reassessed in light of growing understanding about the role of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). At the time of transplant, delayed graft function is one of the most clear-cut risk factors for acute rejection. Extended cold ischemia time (≥24 h) may also play a contributory role. While it is not yet possible to establish conclusively the relative contribution of different risk factors for acute rejection after kidney transplantation, the available data point to variables that should be taken into account at the time of transplant. Together, these offer a realistic basis for planning an appropriate immunosuppression regimen in individual patients.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.

AB  - Abstract Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - We aim to investigate the pathological background of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The most recent 545 cases from the Brain Bank for Aging Research (BBAR) were studied, with a mean age of 80.7?years and male?:?female ratio of 324?:?221. Cases with clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) 0.5 were retrieved as the best substitute of MCI. CDR was retrospectively determined from clinical charts. Pathological examinations followed the BBAR protocol (JNEN 2004). Post mortem assessment of CDR was possible for 486 cases, and was 0 in 201 cases, 0.5 in 57 cases and 1?3 in 228 cases. CDR 0.5 group was clinicopathologically classified into 33 cases with degenerative changes, nine cases with vascular changes, four cases with combined degenerative and vascular changes, two with hippocampal sclerosis, two with trauma, one with metabolic disease and six with unremarkable changes. The degenerative group was further subclassified into groups with pure and combined pathology. The former consisted of six cases each with Alzheimer change (AC), argyrophilic grain change (AGC) and neurofibrillary tangle predominant change (NFTC), three each with Lewy body disease change without parkinsonism (DLBC) or Parkinson's disease (PDMCI) and one case with progressive supranuclear palsy. The latter consisted of three cases with AC plus AGC, two with AGC plus NFTC and one each with AC plus DLBC, DLBC plus amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AGC plus DLBC. The pathological backgrounds of patients of class CDR 0.5 were varied and not restricted to AC.

AB  - Abstract? The histological, histochemical and ultrastructural features of fibrous lesions of the oral mucosa containing large, stellate mononuclear and multinucleated cells are described. The cell are present in a spectrum of hyperplastic lesions. The surrounding matrix is distinctive and the cells show myofibroblastic differentiation. These changes are not sufficiently characteristic or unusual in normal or pathological tissues to warrant separation of these lesions as a distinct entity or to include them within groupings of more specialized lesions.
