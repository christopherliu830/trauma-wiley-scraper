AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.
