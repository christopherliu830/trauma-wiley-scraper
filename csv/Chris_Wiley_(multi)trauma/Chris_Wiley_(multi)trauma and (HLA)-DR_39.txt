AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Prospects for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S90?100. This review discussed the results of recent studies that have identified risk factors for the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and have implicated several peripheral and central mechanisms in its pathophysiology. These risk factors and mechanisms of PHN provide a basis for hypothesizing that combining antiviral therapy with analgesic treatment beginning as soon as possible after the onset of herpes zoster would reduce the risk of PHN beyond that achieved by antiviral therapy alone. Conclude this treatment approach would be expected to reduce the risk of PHN in herpes zoster patients by attenuating acute pain and thereby preventing the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract Progressively sophisticated understanding of cellular and molecular processes that contribute to age-related physical deterioration is being gained from ongoing research into cancer, chronic inflammatory syndromes and other serious disorders that increase with age. Particularly valuable insight has resulted from characterization of how senescent cells affect the tissues in which they form in ways that decrease an organism's overall viability. Increasingly, the underlying pathophysiology of ageing is recognized as a consequence of oxidative damage. This leads to hyperactivity of cell growth pathways, prominently including mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), that contribute to a build-up in cells of toxic aggregates such as progerin (a mutant nuclear cytoskeletal protein), lipofuscin and other cellular debris, triggering formation of senescent cellular phenotypes, which interact destructively with surrounding tissue. Indeed, senescent cell ablation dramatically inhibits physical deterioration in progeroid (age-accelerated) mice. This review explores ways in which oxidative stress creates ageing-associated cellular damage and triggers induction of the cell death/survival programs? apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and ?necroapoptophagy?. The concept of ?necroapoptophagy? is presented here as a strategy for varying tissue oxidative stress intensity in ways that induce differential activation of death versus survival programs, resulting in enhanced and sustained representation of healthy functional cells. These strategies are discussed in the context of specialized mesenchymal stromal cells with the potential to synergize with telocytes in stabilizing engrafted progenitor cells, thereby extending periods of healthy life. Information and concepts are summarized in a hypothetical approach to suppressing whole-organism senescence, with methods drawn from emerging understandings of ageing, gained from Cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and anemones) that undergo a unique form of cellular regeneration, potentially conferring open-ended lifespans.

AB  - In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest the efficacy of various skin protection measures in the prevention of hand dermatitis (HD). The aims and objectives of this intervention study was to quantify the efficacy of skin protection (SP) measures and UVB hardening in the prevention of HD. SP measures were compared against UVB hardening in a controlled clinical trial of 94 apprentices. The apprentices were assigned to the intervention arms class-wise. Baker apprentices involved in a previous follow-up study served as an additional historic control group representing no intervention. The apprentices were interviewed and examined in a standardised way at the beginning of the vocational training and at four follow-ups. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured at the back of the hands. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the controls (C)(29.1%) followed by the UVB-group (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7%(95%CI ?8.5 to 28.1) and 15.8%(95%CI ?2.4 to 33.9), respectively. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed atopy (OR?=?4.74, 95%CI 1.12?20.11, p?=?0.035) and skin care (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16?0.86, p?=?0.023) to be independent risk factors. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95%CI 0.17?3.70) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.09?1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. The trends in the clinical results were confirmed by statistically significant differences in TEWL values. Apprentices in the SP group consistently had a lower prevalence of HD compared to the apprentices in the UVB and C group. These trends were reinforced by statistically significant differences in TEWL levels. A multi-centre trial is recommended to confirm the efficacy of SP measures in a larger randomised study.

AB  - Abstract The prevalence of severe dementia in the United States is about 1.3 million cases, of which at least 50 to 60% are of the Alzheimer type. Severe dementia of the Alzheimer type is found rarely in a clearly dominant pattern, although often one or more relatives are affected. Down's syndrome in adults is often associated with Alzheimer changes. The diagnosis is a clinicopathological one; there is a considerable error rate in the clinical diagnosis early in the course of the disease, especially in regard to dementia in depression. The differential diagnosis involves a great many disorders, including multi-infarct dementia, tumors, subdural hematomas, and others. Physiological aspects of Alzheimer's disease include a diffusely slow electroencephalogram, reduced cerebral blood flow, and particular patterns noted on positron emission tomographic scanning. The latter technique has also demonstrated that oxygen extraction is normal in Alzheimer's disease, thus excluding ischemia from possible pathogenetic factors. Morphological changes, that is, the presence of plaques and tangles, are widely distributed in neocortex, paleocortex, and many deep gray areas down through the pontine tegmentum, but largely exclude the basal ganglia, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Numerous plaques without neocortical tangles are found in many demented persons older than 75 years. A severe loss of large neocortical neurons is characteristic of the disease. The chemical nature of the paired helical filaments that make up the neurofibrillary tangle has not yet been ascertained. Neurons are markedly deficient in the basal forebrain nuclei, and this deficiency may account for the severe diminution of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine in the neocortex and palecortex. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are present in normal amounts. Norepinephrine is reduced in some cases, and somatostatin in most. Substance P is low in severe cases. The etiology of the disorder is unknown and the role of aluminum is disputed. Management of patients with Alzheimer's disease is difficult, and neuroleptics are to be used with great caution because of their side effects. Substrate therapy has not been effective; physostigmine improves memory but is not suitable for general use. Trophic factors, gangliosides, and aluminum chelation are being investigated for use in pharmacological intervention.
