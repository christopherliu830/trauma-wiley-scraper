AB  - Summary Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF), a clinical syndrome associated with a dismal prognosis, occurs acutely in patients with chronic liver disease. An important feature of this syndrome is the potential for reversibility if it is recognized early and supportive measures are instituted before multi-organ failure ensues. There have therefore been recent efforts to better define and understand the pathophysiologic basis of the condition so as to aid early diagnosis and management. In this chapter, we aim to review the most recent data on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and management of ACLF.

AB  - Abstract The hematopoietic system consists of: (1) a network of stem and progenitor cells of varying degrees of maturity interacting with other cells that possess supportive and regulatory capacities and (2) vascular stem cell niches with supporting stem cells in their self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and mobilization to the circulation. Recent data suggest that selective expression of organ-specific chemokines promotes the mobilization of bone-marrow-derived pluripotent cells, a process that is essential for tissue vascularization and organ regeneration. Despite intensive investigation, the pathways by which mechanical signals are converted to biochemical responses are not completely understood. Recent studies have suggested that chromatin shifts and cell cycle effects stem cell gene expression, and thus results in changes of its surface receptor expression at different points of the cell cycle machinery, therefore changing cell cycle transit. This review will attempt to discuss new approaches to determine the regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation by underlying the significance of the chaotic dynamics of transcriptional networks within a cell, with a combination of chemokines and cytokines in the environment, and mechanical forces, such as; stretch, strain and laminar flow, all involving both cooperation and competition.

AB  - Abstract The ideal stem cell for use in functional tissue engineering needs to be abundantly available, harvested with minimal morbidity, differentiated reliably down various pathways and able to be transplanted safely and efficaciously. Adult human adipose tissue contains a population of mesenchymal stem cells, termed ?adipose-derived stem cells? (ASC), which seem to fulfil most, if not all, of these criteria. ASC can be harvested readily, safely, and in relative abundance by modern liposuction techniques. They are capable of differentiating into other mesenchymal tissue types, including adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes and osteoblasts. They also show angiogenic properties, with recent evidence of a potential role in healing radiotherapy-damaged tissue, possibly due to their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Similarly, they may have a role in healing chronic wounds, and as such are being investigated in phase 1 trials for their ability to aid healing of recurrent Crohn?s fistulae. Subsequently they have a wide range of potential clinical uses in all fields of surgery. This article reviews the current and potential clinical applications of ASC in relation to surgery, as well as methods for their isolation, differentiation and molecular characterization.

AB  - Abstract This review considers the considerable similarities between periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While the etiology of these two diseases may differ, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are remarkably similar and it is possible that individuals manifesting both periodontitis and RA may suffer from a unifying underlying systemic dysregulation of the inflammatory response. In light of these findings, the implications for the use of disease-modifying medications in the management of these two chronic inflammatory conditions is apparent. Further longitudinal studies and medication-based intervention studies are required to determine just how closely these two conditions are allied.

AB  - Summary Epidemiological studies have failed to show an improvement in graft survival beyond 1?year after kidney transplantation possibly because of an increased number of expanded donors and older recipients. Thus, we performed a case?control study matching patients transplanted in different eras by donor and recipient characteristics. We considered renal transplant recipients included in the database of the Spanish Chronic Allograft Dysfunction Study Group in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002 (n?=?4842). We matched patients from these cohorts considering the following variables: donor and recipient age, cause of donor death, hepatitis C virus, panel reactive antibodies and re-transplantation. We identified a total of 896 patients distributed in four cohorts of 224 matched patients. Between 1990 and 2002, the use of cyclosporin decreased (96%, 94%, 80% and 23% respectively, P?=?0.001), while the use of tacrolimus increased (0%, 1%, 15% and 63% respectively, P?=?0.001) and the prevalence of acute rejection decreased (46%, 37.9%, 20.6% and 15.8% respectively, P?<?0.001). One-year serum creatinine was 1.63?±?0.66, 1.64?±?0.70, 1.44?±?0.52 and 1.38?±?0.75 respectively, P?=?0.001. Graft survival beyond the first year between 1990 and 2002 significantly improved while patient survival did not. Transplant outcome has improved between 1990 and 2002 when donors and recipients of similar characteristics are compared.

AB  - Summary Desensitization protocols are being used worldwide to enable kidney transplantation across immunologic barriers, i.e. antibody to donor HLA or ABO antigens, which were once thought to be absolute contraindications to transplantation. Desensitization protocols are also being applied to permit transplantation of HLA mismatched hematopoietic stem cells to patients with antibody to donor HLA, to enhance the opportunity for transplantation of non-renal organs, and to treat antibody-mediated rejection. Although desensitization for organ transplantation carries an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection, ultimately these transplants extend and enhance the quality of life for solid organ recipients, and desensitization that permits transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells is life saving for patients with limited donor options. Complex patient factors and variability in treatment protocols have made it difficult to identify, precisely, the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of donor-specific antibodies. The mechanisms underlying desensitization may differ among the various protocols in use, although there are likely to be some common features. However, it is likely that desensitization achieves a sort of immune detente by first reducing the immunologic barrier and then by creating an environment in which an autoregulatory process restricts the immune response to the allograft.

We report a case of fatal B. cereus sepsis in a patient with newly diagnosed acute leukemia following resolving neutropenic enterocolitis. Gastrointestinal complaints are common during induction chemotherapy, yet some antimicrobial coverage suitable for generalized neutropenia is not optimal for the eradication of B. cereus. This case demonstrates that, in the neutropenic patient with gastrointestinal complaints or in the setting of resolving neutropenic enterocolitis, it is important to anticipate possible B. cereus infection and sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Background. Nodular fasciitis is a fibroblastic proliferation in which nodules, most commonly appearing on the extremities, develop suddenly and rapidly. Although excisional biopsy is curative, the nodules will often resolve spontaneously; however, the histologic appearance of a pleomorphic spindle cell neoplasm with frequent mitotic figures may raise concern of a more malignant neoplasm and lead to unnecessary and overly aggressive therapy. Methods. A case of nodular fasciitis presenting in an unusual location, intradermally at the lateral canthus, is discussed. Results. Review of the recent literature from other disciplines reveals new insights into the etiology and diagnostic options (fine needle aspiration, tomography, other imaging techniques) for this puzzling disease. Conclusions. When nodular fasciitis occurs in an unusual location, such as on the head and neck or at an intradermal location, it will not present as the deep, mobile, nontender nodule described in the dermatologic literature. Fine-needle aspiration and modern imaging techniques may help in the diagnosis and prevent unnecessary surgery for a self-limited condition.

AB  - Summary Herpes simplex virus (HSV) represents a smart pathogen, which displays both lytic and latent modes of interaction with its natural human host. In order to be optimally equipped for immune evasion and to reply to any attacks of the host during reactivation, HSV has developed a multitude of cleverly devised defence strategies. Dendritic cells (DC) as antigen-presenting cells located at the border zones of the body and the environment have been shown to play a crucial role as one of the first cells interacting with HSV beside epithelial cells, on one hand, and as important controllers of the viral spreading on the other hand. Here, we provide a research update about the interaction of HSV with DC and summarize the latest proceedings in this field.

AB  - Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a recently introduced option for limb replacement and reconstruction of tissue defects. As with other allografts, CTA can undergo immune-mediated rejection; therefore standardized criteria are required for characterizing and reporting severity and types of rejection. This article documents the conclusions of a symposium on CTA rejection held at the Ninth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology in La-Coru?a, Spain, on 26 June 2007, and proposes a working classification, the Banff CTA-07, for the categorization of CTA rejection. This classification was derived from a consensus discussion session attended by the first authors of three published classification systems, pathologists and researchers from international centers where clinical CTA has been performed. It was open to all attendees to the Banff conference. To the extent possible, the format followed the established National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on Consensus Development Programs. By consensus, the defining features to diagnose acute skin rejection include inflammatory cell infiltration with involvement of epidermis and/or adnexal structures, epithelial apoptosis, dyskeratosis and necrosis. Five grades of severity of rejection are defined. This classification refines proposed schemas, represents international consensus on this topic, and establishes a working collective classification system for CTA reporting of rejection in skin-containing CTAs.
