The 37th Annual Meeting for the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes was held in Miami Beach, Florida, USA. The meeting, titled ?Possibilities for Prevention and Diabetes and its Complications?, attracted over 1000 delegates from 52 countries. Fifty-six oral abstracts were presented, along with 294 posters, representing the diversity of research and clinical innovations in the field of pediatric and adolescent diabetes around the world. Abstracts to the Oral and Poster Sessions can be found in a recent supplement of Pediatric Diabetes (1). Here are some highlights from the plenary sessions, symposia, and oral presentations.

AB  - Effective evaluation of skin sensitisation demands that potential contact allergens are identified and the risk of sensitisation amongst exposed populations assessed. Sensitisation hazard is not an all or nothing phenomenon; dose response relationships can be discerned and thresholds identified for induction and elicitation of contact allergy. These parameters, under the heading of potency, are vital for the risk assessment process. The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is an accepted method for the identification of sensitisation hazards (a sensitiser is a chemical that induces a stimulation index 3 or more times that of the concurrent vehicle control). The LLNA has also been used to determine the potency of sensitisers, by derivation of an EC3 value, the estimated concentration of chemical required to induce a stimulation index of 3. At present, various agencies, including in EU and OECD, together with industry bodies, are considering whether and how to adapt these data into regulations which would place sensitisers into one of several potency categories. It is our view, based on an evaluation of over 300 chemicals, that five categories: extreme, strong, moderate, weak and negative represent the optimal approach and is consistent with what is understood regarding the potency of these skin sensitisers in humans. To illustrate this approach, an example dataset of 100 selected organic chemicals is shown, where the accuracy of prediction of human potency is in the region of 90%. This categorisation has utility as a simple guide for risk management strategies as well as representing an important first step in risk assessment.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - In recent years, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) has emerged as a practical option for assessing the skin sensitization potential of chemicals. In addition to accurate identification of skin sensitizers, the LLNA can also provide a reliable measure of relative sensitization potency; information that is pivotal in successful management of human health risks. However, even with the significant animal welfare benefits provided by the LLNA, there is interest still in the development of non-animal test methods for skin sensitization. Here, we have collected a large dataset of chemicals that have been tested in the LLNA, and the activity of which correspond with what is known of their potential to cause skin sensitization in humans. It is anticipated that this will be of value to other investigators in the evaluation and calibration of novel approaches to skin sensitization testing, in particular for the development of in silico methods. Prerequisite for the development of in silico models is always the availability of a large high quality data set, suitable for modeling. This dataset encompasses both the chemical and biological diversity of known chemical allergens, and provides also examples of negative controls. The data are a collection of published and non-proprietary industry data. All materials were tested in standard vehicules following the standard LLNA protocol. It is hoped that this dataset will accelerate the development, evaluation and eventual validation of new approaches to skin sensitization testing.
