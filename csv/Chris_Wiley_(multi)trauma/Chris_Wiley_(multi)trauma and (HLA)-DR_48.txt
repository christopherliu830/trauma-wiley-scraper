AB  - Srcasm, a Src activating and signaling molecule, is a recently discovered substrate of the Src family kinase, Fyn. Although Srcasm can bind downstream signaling molecules, such as Grb2 and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the physiologic role of Srcasm is unknown. Because Fyn is believed to promote keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that Srcasm may also promote keratinocyte differentiation and, thus, antagonize squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine if Srcasm expression was decreased in SCC?s and actinic keratoses (AK). Using immunohistochemisty with a polyclonal affinity-purified anti-Srcasm antibody, we evaluated the expression of Srcasm in parafin imbedded sections of AK, SCC in-situ (SCIS), and SCC from up to 15 different patients each. The expression of Srcasm in these lesions was compared to normal peri-lesional skin of the same biopsy specimen or normal skin from separate biopsies. We found that Srcasm expression was decreased in approximately 50% of the AK and SCC-IS samples and in over 90% of the SCC samples. This increased prevalence of Srcasm downregulation from pre-malignant to less differentiated malignant lesions, supports our hypothesis that Srcasm, by functioning downstream of Fyn, may promote keratinocyte differentiation.

AB  - The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is the most common method used worldwide for routine pathologic evaluation of tissue specimens. Evaluation of cutaneous specimens frequently requires differentiation of elastic fibers, melanin, hemosiderin, fungal elements, mast cells and depositions. For this reason, we used acid-orcein and Giemsa (AOG) stain to evaluate various skin disorders to determine the extent of utility of this infrequently reported stain. As expected, AOG stain functioned well as an elastic fiber stain, highlighting loss of elastic fibers in areas of scar and in disorders such as anetoderma. In pigmentary disorders, AOG stains melanin a dark green to greenish-black pigment while hemosiderin remained yellow-brown to light green color. Fungal hyphae in superficial dermatophytosis and leishmania organisms stained a deep blue. Amyloid stained a ?sky? blue color in macular, lichenoid and nodular amyloid cases. The granules of mast cells stain purple in cases of urticaria pigmentosa and mastocytomas. Dermal mucin stained metachromatic lavender. Due to the multifunctional nature of the AOG stain, this simple technique can improve dermatopathologic diagnosis while decreasing the number of special stains necessary to have available in the laboratory setting.

AB  - Since many studies have shown the discordant diagnoses of melanocytic lesions among pathologists despite the existence of an established histologic criteria, we sought to refine the histologic criteria by finding an additional reliable and reproducible objective histopathologic feature, to aid in the diagnosis of melanoma in situ. We performed a retrospective analysis of 100 cases, histologically diagnosed as melanoma in situ and compared to a study control group consisting of junctional benign melanocytic nevi. The epidermis of all the melanocytic lesions were examined for epidermal effacement. Examination of the epidermis in the study group revealed absence of epidermal effacement in only seven (10%) cases, whereas ninety-three (93%) cases showed absence of rete ridges in some foci, making this an overwhelming majority finding in the cases examined. These results serve as a compelling adjunctive finding that can be used to increase the histologic diagnostic accuracy of melanoma in situ.

AB  - Polypoid lesions arising at ileostomy sites are uncommon and include inflammatory polyps related to prolapse and neoplastic polyps. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is rare and usually occurs in longstanding ulcerative colitis. An 82-year-old woman presented with an erythematous 1.5?cm polyp at the mucocutaneous junction of her ileostomy. Her history is significant for a cystectomy with ileal loop 23 years earlier for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. She had no prior history of ulcerative colitis. Histologically, a polypoid lesion was produced by variable-sized cystic spaces filled with mucin and lined by columnar epithelium with goblet cells. The epithelial cells demonstrated cytological atypia and occasional mitotic figures were observed. Smaller neoplastic glands infiltrated the dermis and scattered, multiple epidermotropic foci were noted. We present an unusual case of a primary mucinous adenocarcinoma with multiple epidermotropic foci arising at an ileostomy site in a patient without a known history of ulcerative colitis. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is a rare occurrence described primarily in the gastrointestinal literature but could easily be unrecognized by a dermatopathologist. Knowledge of this phenomenon may prove helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis.

AB  - We report a 6-month old male infant who presented to our pediatric dermatology clinic with a generalized bullous eruption since three months of age. A sepsis work up performed prior to presentation did not reveal any evidence of infection. Clinical presentation revealed multiple tense bullae in a ?string of pearls? arrangement and multiple erosions on the bilateral upper extremities and trunk. This clinical presentation was strongly suggestive of chronic bullous disease of childhood. Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal complete blood cell count and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus types I and II was negative. Histological sections demonstrated a large space of separation between the epidermis and dermis which was filled by a monomorphous infiltrate composed of round to oval cells with centrally placed nuclei, consistent with mast cells. Leder and c-kit stains were strongly positive confirming the diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis. Direct immunofluorescence did not reveal IgA deposits or any other findings. Treatment included fluocinonide 0.05% cream QAM and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment QHS to active lesions, and silver sulfadiazine 1% cream to erosions. Improvement was noted during follow up examination.

AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - A 27-year-old woman presented with a 5?mm papule on her cheek. She had no family history or stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Biopsy showed a diffuse dermal proliferation of spindle cells embedded in a slightly myxomatous stroma which entrapped adnexae. They displayed cytologic atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei and bizarre multinucleated giant cells. No mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed the spindle cells to be S-100 and collagen IV positive, but MART-1 negative. The differential diagnosis included desmoplastic melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and atypical neurofibroma. Both atypical neurofibroma and desmoplastic melanoma are S-100 positive, show variable atypia and can have bizarre multinucleated giant cells. However, the lack of epidermal melanocytic hyperplasia, mitosis and the positive collagen type IV staining, favor nerve sheath differentiation. In neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas may undergo malignant degeneration resulting in MPNST. Whether atypical neurofibroma represents a transitional stage is unknown. Mitotic activity and necrosis strongly suggest MPNST. The biologic potential of cutaneous atypical neurofibroma has not been well studied, but they appear to behave in a benign fashion. This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenge of atypia in neurofibromas and highlights the need for further studies on the behavior of these rare variants.

AB  - Metastasis to the breast from extramammary neoplasms is rare. Such metastatic neoplasms can mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma clinically and histologically, presenting a diagnostic challenge. A 50-year-old woman with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma in clinical remission presented with rapid onset unilateral breast swelling with warmth and erythema. Based upon the clinical presentation, an underlying breast carcinoma was suspected. A punch biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive involvement of the dermal lymphatics. The clinical and histologic differential diagnosis included inflammatory carcinoma secondary to a primary breast carcinoma vs. metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast. To resolve this question, immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors and CDX-2 were performed. CDX-2 is an intestinal homeobox gene that is expressed in intestinal epithelium and tumors with intestinal differentiation including esophageal adenocarcinoma. CDX-2 expression has not been reported in breast carcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CDX-2 but negative for both steroid receptors. The diagnosis of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast was confirmed. This case emphasizes the importance of confirming the tumor lineage in inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. CDX-2 can be a useful tool in establishing a gastrointestinal origin of cutaneous metastases.

AB  - The glomus coccygeum is a vestigial structure related to the canals of Sucquet-Hoyer, an arteriovenous anastomosis surrounded by glomus cells derived from modified smooth muscle and involved in thermoregulation. It is an incidental finding in specimens from the sacral area and may represent a diagnostic challenge to the unaware observer. We present a case of a glomus coccygeum, presenting as a 1.5?mm structure adjacent to a typical pilonidal cyst excised from a 7-month-old boy, that was the subject of a second opinion consultation. The lesion showed small to medium sized clusters of predominantly epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, intercellular borders and plump, round nuclei with fine chromatin. These cells were closely associated with small vascular channels and nerves. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the epithelioid cells expressed vimentin, muscle-specific actin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein, were weakly positive for smooth muscle actin, and negative for desmin, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The endothelial cells of the vascular channels were antibody CD31 positive. Recognition of the histological features of glomus coccygeum is important to avoid confusion with glomus tumor and neural or smooth muscle neoplasms in the sacral area.

AB  - Background: Laminin-5 is a basement membrane constituent that functions as an anchoring filament to integrin-derived hemidesmosomes, and has been detected at the invasive front (tumor-stromal interface) in many types of carcinomas. Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - The patient is an eight-year-old white male with a prior history of a small bowel transplant secondary to gastroschisis and a history of chronic rejection. He was admitted to the hospital to rule out rejection of his second small bowel transplant. During the admission he developed painful erythematous plaques with necrosis and hemorrhagic bullae on his left knee and left neck. Dermatology was consulted and biopsies and tissue cultures were obtained. On H&E there were multiple thick walled non-septate hyphae and the GMS stain showed right angle irregular branching hyphae with an affinity for blood vessels. A further work-up for disseminated disease was negative. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous mucormycosis. The patient underwent extensive surgical debridement and was started on Ambisone and treated for six months with resolution. Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic deep fungal infection. It is the most acute and fatal of all fungal infections. There are multiple associated conditions including immunosuppression. This disease can be controlled with early diagnosis and a combination treatment plan. There are only a few reported cases in the pediatric population.

AB  - Distinguishing among the various melanocytic proliferations remains one of the biggest challenges in dermatopathology. New insights into tumor proliferation may lead to the discovery of helpful immunohistochemical markers. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase which is a core component of the PI3K signalling pathway. Activation of Akt is seen in many human cancers. This study evaluated Akt activation (phospho-Akt) by immunohistochemistry on 18 intradermal nevi, 8 dysplastic nevi, 9 Spitz nevi, and 27 melanomas. Immunostaining was graded 0 (no staining), 1 (slightly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (highly positive). The mean immunostaining scores were as follows: intradermal nevi 1.16, dysplastic nevi 1.25, Spitz nevi 2.11, and melanomas 2.15. Spitz nevi exhibited significant pAkt immunoreactivity. Increased pAkt immunoreactivity is seen in melanomas and Spitz nevi as compared to benign intradermal nevi and dysplastic nevi.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - Introduction: Most primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas are derived from mature T lymphocytes. We encountered a case of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma with an undescribed phenotypic profile as defined by CD3+, CD8+ lymphocytes that co-expressed CD10, CD20 and CD30. Results: The patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented in 2001 with a thigh mass that was biopsied and held to represent a lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma based on CD10 expression. Two years later the patient developed a recurrence. The pathology showed a large cell lymphoma manifesting a CD8 phenotype although with CD10/CD20 expression. Conclusion: The importance in this case lies in the novel phenotype, namely a mature post thymic T cell lymphoma exhibiting CD10 and CD20 positivity. CD10 expression in primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in the literature is largely limited to two case reports. CD10, a neutral endopeptidase, cleaves proteins with inflammatory or proinflammatory activity released by dying malignant and benign T cells including those of post thymic origin and may also degrade cytokines which inhibit T-cell apoptosis. Another unique aspect of our case was CD20 positivity whereby only a small number of prior citations exist, all with a CD8 phenotype as was the case in our patient.

AB  - Paecilomyces, a hyalohyphomycosis, is an uncommon cause of cutaneous and subcutaneous infections. Most cases reported have occurred in patients with impaired host defenses or following a surgical procedure, and have proven highly resistant to anti fungal therapies. A 60-year-old man presented with scattered non-healing verrucous lesions as well as ulcers and excoriations on the upper extremities and trunk. The lesion had begun shortly after the patient was scratched by prickly okra. The patient had no underlying health problems and he was on no medication. Histology revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, with papillomatosis with intraepidermal micro-abscess formation. Within the dermis there was a mixed acute and chronic granulomatous infiltrate. With GMS stain numerous pleomorphic yeast forms and pseudohyphael forms were seen. Cultures confirmed Paecilomyces species. The patient was treated with Voriconazole with complete resolution of his lesion. Paecilomyces is an emerging fungal pathogen, which in our immune competent patient manifest as widespread cutaneous disease.

AB  - Porokeratosis is an uncommon cause of clinical change in pigmented lesions. We report two cases of so-called ?collision? lesions, in which the cause of clinical change in melanocytic nevi was porokeratosis. One biopsy was submitted concurrently with a biopsy from another anatomic site, which was a superficial pattern basal cell carcinoma. Both the melanocytic nevus and the basal cell carcinoma contained coronoid lamellae, focal diminution of the granular layer and subjacent dyskeratotic keratinocytes, consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). The melanocytic nevus, from the lower back, was a broad compound melanocytic nevus, associated with elongated, pigmented rete (lentiginous) and small melanocytes in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis (superficial congenital pattern). There was no evidence of external irritation. The second case showed a similar coronoid lamella, focal diminution of the granular layer and dyskeratotic keratinocytes. There was additional parakeratosis away from the parakeratotic column and a lichenoid host response, suggesting external irritation.

AB  - The histopathological changes of herpes simplex, zoster and varicella are considered to be indistinguishable from one another. The clinical setting with adjunctive studies generally clarifies the diagnosis. Vesicular lesions in all 3 conditions can involve epidermal and adnexal epithelium with characteristic cytopathic features. We describe 3 patients with non-vesicular eruptions on the head and neck whose biopsies revealed exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes. All three patients developed typical herpes zoster within days of the biopsy. There is compelling scientific evidence in the literature indicating that, in herpes zoster, the virus is transported from dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia via myelinated nerves to the skin. These terminate at the isthmus of hair follicles and primary infection of follicular and sebaceous epithelium occurs. Secondary spread of infection to the epidermis follows. In contrast, data pertaining to recurrent herpes simplex indicates that axonal transport of the virus from sensory ganglia to the skin is directed primarily to the epidermis, via terminal non-myelinated nerve twigs. The clinical evolution of our 3 cases and scientific data in the literature indicate that exclusive folliculosebaceous involvement by herpes, in the setting of a non-vesicular eruption, represents early herpes zoster.

AB  - A 27-day-old female neonate presented with a bleeding growth on the abdomen. The clinical differential diagnosis included pyogenic granuloma and hemangioma. Histology shows an ulcerated, spindled and round cell tumor in the dermis with ill-defined margins that invade the subcutaneous fat. The tumor exhibits a biphasic growth pattern with plump spindled cells arranged in fascicles, as well as epithelioid cells arranged in sheets. Some cells show plasmacytoid features. The tumor cells have pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. Single cell necrosis and mitotic activity is prominent. Myxoid and chondroid stromal changes are focally seen. Immunohistochemical stains show strong positivity for S100 protein, calponin, and, focally, AE1/AE3. Portions of the both the spindled and epithelioid cell components show staining with EMA. Desmin and MSA stains were negative. The tumor does not stain for CD 31, CD 30, CD 45, CD 20, CD 34, CK 20, MART-1, or HMB45. These histologic features are consistent with a cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma. Cutaneous myoepitheliomas are rare tumors of myoepithelial cells which surround eccrine and apocrine glands. While most myoepitheliomas are benign, tumors with high mitotic activity may have a risk for recurrence or metastasis. This is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient described with myoepithelial carcinoma.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.
