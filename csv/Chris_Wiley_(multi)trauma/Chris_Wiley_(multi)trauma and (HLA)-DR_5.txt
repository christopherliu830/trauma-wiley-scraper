AB  - Abstract Studies showed that co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) offered greater therapeutic effects but little is known regarding the effects of human Wharton's jelly derived MSCs on HSC expansion and red blood cell (RBC) generation in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on HSC expansion and differentiation. HSCs were co-cultured with MSCs or with 10% MSCs-derived conditioned medium, with HSCs cultured under standard medium served as a control. Cell expansion rates, number of mononuclear cell post-expansion and number of enucleated cells post-differentiation were evaluated. HSCs showed superior proliferation in the presence of MSC with mean expansion rate of 3.5???108?±?1.8???107 after day 7 compared to the conditioned medium and the control group (8.9???107?±?1.1???108 and 7.0???107?±?3.3???106 respectively, P?<?0.001). Although no significant differences in RBC differentiation were observed between groups at passage IV, the number of enucleated cell was greater compared to earlier passages, indicating successful RBC differentiation. Cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs can be greatly expanded by co-culturing with MSCs without affecting the RBC differentiation capability, suggesting the importance of direct MSC-HSCs contact in HSC expansion and RBC differentiation.

AB  - Abstract Bacterial translocation (BT) is a phenomenon in which live bacteria or its products cross the intestinal barrier. Gut translocation of bacteria has been shown in both animal and human studies. BT and its complications have been shown clearly to occur in animal models, but its existence and importance in humans has been difficult to ascertain. We review the mechanisms of BT and its clinical impact based on the current literature.

AB  - Abstract Four decades after the first isolation and characterization of clonogenic bone marrow stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the laboratory of Dr. Alexander Friedenstien, the therapeutic application of their progeny following ex vivo expansion are only now starting to be realized in the clinic. The multipotency, paracrine effects, and immune-modulatory properties of MSC present them as an ideal stem cell candidate for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In recent years it has come to light that MSC encompass plasticity that extends beyond the conventional bone, adipose, cartilage, and other skeletal structures, and has expanded to the differentiation of liver, kidney, muscle, skin, neural, and cardiac cell lineages. This review will specifically focus on the skeletal regenerative capacity of bone marrow derived MSC alone or in combination with growth factors, biocompatible scaffolds, and following genetic modification.

AB  - Summary. Increasing numbers of children are receiving solid organ transplants namely kidney, liver, heart and lung. Patient survival rates following such transplants are essentially good with much of the success attributable to the development of Cyclosporine A (CyA), an immunosuppressive drug, that minimizes organ rejection. However the gingival overgrowth (GO) associated with the use of CyA is not only disfiguring but in paediatric recipients, may interfere with normal oral development and function. Objective. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge concerning the aetiology, pathogenesis and management of gingival overgrowth. Methods. Literature pertaining to gingival overgrowth is reviewed with particular reference to the paediatric population. Emphasis is placed on summarizing the evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of intervention. Conclusion. CyA undoubtedly causes gingival overgrowth, the effects and levels of which appears to be more severe in younger patients. There is conflicting evidence as to the effectiveness of oral hygiene regimes, antibiotics and surgery in reducing overgrowth. The introduction of an alternative immunosuppressive agent (Tacrolimus) offers potential as it does not appear to cause overgrowth, although research to date is limited by the small sample size of many of the studies. This is an area in which multicentre studies would be of great value.

AB  - To assess cellular immunity in oral lichen planus (OLP), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 19 OLP patients and 30 control subjects. The proportions of circulating CD45RA+ and CD29+ lymphocyte subsets were determined. The proliferative activity of PBMC to the non-specific plant mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) was examined together with the spontaneous proliferative response and the response in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). In the OLP group, the proportion of CD4+CD45RA+ T lymphocytes was significantly less than control subjects and the proportion of CD4+ CD29+ T lymphocytes was increased significantly. The proliferative response to PHA was similar in OLP and controls subjects. Con A-stimulated PBMC proliferation was decreased significantly in the OLP group. Spontaneous PBMC proliferation in patients with non-reticular lesions was significantly less than control subjects. Despite a mildly depressed response in the AMLR in OLP patients, this result was not statistically significant. Results of the phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes indicate a decreased proportion of naive T cells and an increased proportion of primed memory T cells, although the antigen specificity of these memory cells remains to be determined. Results of the functional assays would seem to reflect this phenotypic shift, and as T cells responding to Con A stimulation and in the AMLR possess suppressor-inducer activity, these results may also suggest an association between OLP and defective innate T cell-mediated suppressor circuits.
