AB  - The histology of melanocytic nevi in elderly patients often differs from nevi in younger adults. Our hypothesis was that nevi in patients3 60?yrs would demonstrate histologic patterns different from nevi in younger adults. Biopsies of nevi (n?=?214) from 172 patients3 60?yrs (mean age 69?±?7?yrs) were examined by three dermatopathologists and a consensus diagnosis was rendered. Control specimens (n?=?82) from 58 patients 20?40?yrs (mean age 31?±?5?yrs) were evaluated. Compound melanocytic nevi were commoner in younger patients (37%) versus older patients (12%)(p?<?.0001). Junctional melanocytic nevi were more frequently diagnosed in older patients (10% versus 3%; p?=?.027) and a lentiginous, often heavily pigmented, growth pattern was common (12% of nevi) vs control group (3%; p?=?.028). Atypical (?dysplastic?) nevi had a similar frequency at all ages, however 12/214 nevi in elderly patients (6%) exhibited marked atypia with features suggesting melanoma in-situ. We conclude that benign junctional nevi are relatively common in elderly patients and that a lentiginous, heavily pigmented growth pattern, typically associated with younger patients, is often seen in both junctional and compound nevi in this older age group. This pattern must be differentiated from dysplastic nevus and melanoma in-situ, which they may clinically resemble.

AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition of the skin and muscles, and an underlying malignancy is noted in 10% or more of cases. Clinical features of dermatomyositis include increasing general fatigue and proximal (thighs and shoulders) muscle weakness accompanied by erythematous lesions of the skin. There have been several distinct types of dermatomyositis described. Here we describe a case of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis, which is a rare variant of dermatomyositis. A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a painful erythematous vesicular eruption of the face, trunk and extremities. In addition, edema of the face and fever were observed. Clinically, dermatomyositis was considered because of typical skin rashes (Gottron?s papules, periorbital heliotrope rash and poikiloderma) and serum creatine phosphokinase level of 1,031 IU/L. A skin biopsy was performed. Microscopically, subepidermal vesiculation with marked edema was present. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was also observed in the upper dermis. So far only a few case reports of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis have been reported in the literature. It should be kept in mind that dermatomyositis may present subepidermal vesiculation in order to avoid a misdiagnosis and unnecessary delayed treatment. Furthermore, an internal malignancy should be considered in such a variant of dermatomyositis.

AB  - Background:? Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a condition with known predisposing factors, but of unknown etiology. A variety of opinions exist as to the cause of this condition, without consensus. Design: We reviewed 111 cases of CNH from 103 patients at our laboratory. p53 immunohistochemical staining, which is over expressed in basilar epidermal cells of porokeratosis, was performed in a representative sample of CNH cases. Histologic changes characteristic of porokeratosis were qualified as a 1) parakeratotic column of keratinocytes 2) an attenuated to absent granular layer, and 3) adjacent or underlying dyskeratosis of keratinocytes, present in columns or aggregates. Results: Porokeratosis-like changes were identified in 77 of 111 cases. p53 staining was noncontributory. Conclusion: The presence of these porokeratosis-like changes in 69% of cases is intriguing. It is not clear whether or not this could possibly represent a causative mechanism or, perhaps, an otherwise coincident histologic change. The presence of porokeratosis-like changes in CNH provides a possible hypothesis in relationship to its etiology, at the very least, it could provide some histologic clue as to the presence of this deep dermal process in superficial biopsies.

AB  - A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with a ten-year history of flushing and facial swelling partially responsive to anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial therapies. Progressive edema of the right upper eyelid was recently treated by blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty specimen had a dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes. The granulomas appeared both peri-and intralymphatic with prominent molding. Special stains and polarization studies were negative. To confirm the intralymphatic location of these granulomas we performed immunohistochemical staining with Factor VIII and D2?40. D2?40 is a new monoclonal antibody that reacts with an O-linked sialoglycoprotein found on lymphatic endothelium, fetal testis, and on the surface of testicular germ cell tumors. In recent studies, clone D2?40 has shown staining in lymphatic channel endothelium but not in adjacent capillary. Factor VIII antibody highlighted both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, while D2?40 stained only the lymphatic endothelium and confirmed the intra-lymphatic location of granulomas. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatous lymphangiitis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal type (orofacial granulomatosis). Granulomatous lymphangiitis is characteristic but not completely diagnostic of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. We present the complex differential diagnosis of intralymphatic granulomas and the use of a new monoclonal antibody helpful in verifying their location.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman developed back pain associated with a sacral mass seven years prior to presentation. Biopsy of the sacral mass showed chordoma. The patient underwent two surgical resections because of recurrent disease. She presented after developing a firm, non-tender skin nodule on the left back. Biopsy of the lesion showed a dermal neoplasm composed of nests of cells in a mucinous stroma. There was moderate cytologic atypia of the cells, and occasional mitotic figures were seen. Physaliphorous cells were present. The immunostains S-100, cytokeratin, and EMA were all positive. A diagnosis of metastatic chordoma to the skin or chordoma cutis was made. The patient died 15 months later from complications of metastatic disease. Chordomas are rare, representing only 1?4% of malignant bone tumors, which most often occur in the sacral area. Metastasis to the skin is unusual. In one study, 207 cases of chordoma were evaluated, and only 19 had skin involvement. Chordoma cutis has been described as nodules which are firm, blue domed, cystic-appearing, erythematous, translucent, flesh-colored, and reddish brown. Cutaneous metastasis of chordoma has been reported to the nose, chest, back, thigh, shoulders, left arm, face, neck, and scalp.

AB  - Background: Dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disease syndrome where antibodies to the endothelium of the microvasculature of the skin, muscle and lung are implicated in lesional propagation, is characterized by photodistributed erythema, heliotrope rash, Gottron?s papules, muscle weakness and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Endotheliotropic viruses and underlying neoplasia are among the inciting triggers. Uncommonly drugs, namely the lipid lowering agents, have been implicated in dermatomyositis. Case Report: The patient, a 57-year-old male, developed a photodistributed rash and muscle weakness following treatment with the antifungal medication Lamisil. A skin biopsy was performed, showing an atrophying interface dermatitis with pandermal mucinosis and striking vasculopathic changes including endothelial cell necrosis with denudement and basement membrane zone reduplication. Direct immunofluorescent testing showed prominent staining of C5b-9 along the dermal- epidermal junction and within the vasculature. Conclusion: We have shown a temporal association between use of Lamisil and the development of dermatomyositis. Terbinafine, the active agent in Lamisil, promotes apoptosis of human endothelial cells in culture. Enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis results in the displacement of various cellular antigens creating a state of neo-antigenicity; its attendant sequelae has held to be one of antiendothelial cell antibody formation, a defining pathogenetic event in the evolution of dermatomyositis.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - A 64-year-old white male presented with a three-month history of multiple crusted erythematous nodules on the lower legs. The patient was immunosuppressed on prednisone and tacrolimus secondary to liver transplant. Biopsy revealed a fibrinopurulent crust overlying an interstitial, non-follicular oriented, neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis. PAS and GMS positive septate hyphae were present within the stratum corneum while yeast-like forms with pseudohyphal projections, suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis, were found within the dermis. There was no evidence of follicular rupture or granulomatous inflammation. Subsequent culture grew Trichophyton rubrum confirming the diagnosis of deep dermatophytosis. This case illustrates several histologic differences in deep dermatophyte infection in the immunocompromised host from invasive dermatophyte infection, Majocchi?s granuloma, occurring in the immunocompetent patient. In the immunocompromised patient there is typically the following: no evidence of fungal invasion via a ruptured hair follicle, suppurative inflammation as opposed to granulomatous inflammation, and atypical fungal forms consisting of swollen hyphae and round, yeast-like, arthroconidia, as opposed to the slender hyphae seen in Majocchi?s granuloma. In addition, because of the clinical appearance of the lesions, immunocompromised state of the patients, and atypical fungal forms seen on biopsy, an initial diagnosis of systemic mycosis is often incorrectly made.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.

AB  - Dimorphic fungal infections (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis) can occur in immunocompromised and healthy individuals. Cutaneous involvement is often secondary and may be the presenting sign of systemic disease. These ominous infections are frequently clinically indistinct and their prognosis is influenced by their timely diagnosis and treatment. Morphological differentiation between these organisms is not definitive and tissue cultures represent the diagnostic gold standard in current day practice. However, not uncommonly tissue cultures are not obtained and merely represent an afterthought in seemingly unsuspecting cases. Furthermore, when performed, they may take several days to weeks for completion. In situ hybridization (ISH) utilizing oligonucleotide probes directed against fungal ribosomal RNA represents a rapid and accurate assay for the diagnosis of dimorphic fungi in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We present 7 patients in whom ISH both prospecitively and retrospectively confirmed the presence of a cutaneous infection (2 histoplasmosis, 2 blastomycosis, 1 coccidiomycosis, 2 cryptococcosis). In all of the skin sections analyzed, dimorphic fungi were morphologically apparent but not diagnostically discernable. In summary, ISH represents a valuable tool in the prompt diagnosis of cutaneous deep fungal infections.

AB  - A 37-year-old woman with diagnosis of Sjogren?s syndrome (SS) presented with asymptomatic non-palpable purpura of the lower extremities. Biopsy of a purpuric macule revealed a perivascular and focally nodular lymphocytic infiltrate with large numbers of plasma cells, seemingly around eccrine glands. There was no vasculitis. The histologic findings in the skin were strikingly similar to those of salivary, parotid, and other ?secretory? glands affected in SS. The cutaneous manifestations of SS highlighted in textbooks include xerosis, annular erythema, small-vessel vasculitis, and pigmented purpura. This case illustrates that purpura in skin of patients with SS may be caused by a peri-eccrine plasma-rich infiltrate. The link between hypergammaglobulinemia, auto antibodies, plasma cells infiltration, and development of extranodal B-cell lymphoma in SS remains to be elucidated.

AB  - A 17 year-old boy with a history of Alagille syndrome presented with three-months duration of spontaneous eruption of multple non-pruritic, non-painful papules on the extremities. He also reported seeing ?dark spots? at night. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced and appeared smaller than his age. The skin examination revealed numerous 2?8?mm follicular, keratotic papules on the extensor surfaces of the patient?s arms and legs. H&E preparation of the skin biopsy revealed distention of the upper portion of the follicles with prominent keratotic plugging, as well as focal follicular perforation and acute inflammation. Laboratory examination revealed a vitamin A level of 11, carotene level of less than 2, and retinol binding protein of 2.1. The patient was diagnosed with phrynoderma and initiated on vitamin A therapy. After a two-months course of vitamin A therapy, his serum vitamin A increased to 67, and he had dramatic improvement of the follicular eruption. This is a fascinating case of phrynoderma in a child with biliary dysfunction. The presence of perforating folliculitis on histology is curious, as there are less than 10 documented cases of perforating folliculitis in phrynoderma. This case illustrates the intriguing clinical and pathological presentations of phrynoderma.

AB  - Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common soft tissue sarcoma of adults. We present an unusual case which initially showed features of a pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor (PHAT). The lesion was characterized by abundant plump, eosinophilic cells exhibiting striking nuclear atypia, set in a dense, hyalinized stroma with a prominent, angiectatic vasculature. Rare mitotic figures were identified. These findings were felt to be most consistent with the diagnosis of PHAT. Four months after removal, local recurrence was noted, which demonstrated findings of a high grade MFS, including a cellular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells set in a prominent myxoid stroma. Multiple mitoses, including atypical ones, were present. In light of these findings, the original specimen was reexamined and the diagnosis was revised to high- grade MFS. MFS, especially low-grade lesions, may be confused with several benign lesions. Previous cases mimicking PHAT have not been reported. We describe a unique case of high-grade MFS which initially showed characteristic features of a PHAT, raising the possibility that MFS may occasionally arise in, or have areas that masquerade as, PHAT. It is possible that PHAT, currently considered a benign neoplasm, may actually represent a peculiar form of MFS of low malignant potential.

AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a recessively inherited genodermatosis associated with extreme sun sensitivity, defective repair of several types of sunlight induced adducts in cellular DNA, and numerous, early-onset skin cancers. The dry, rough skin corresponds to progressive cytologic atypia and loss of polarity in the underlying epidermis. Associated with these changes are immune deficiencies against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin cancer. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a DNA synthesis antimetabolite used against several types of cancers. Applied topically in normal subjects it is associated with moderate to severe inflammation in areas where actinic keratoses have arisen followed by ablation of the actinic keratoses which is dependent on the inflammation. We applied 5-FU to the sun-exposed skin of two patients with XP, a 14 year-old light complected black male and a 14 year-old Caucasian female. No inflammation was observed, but marked improvement in the clinical presentation of the skin was seen, as well as an absence of new malignancies. This change was confirmed histopathologically and correlated with normalization of polarity and cytologic changes in the epidermal cells. These histologic findings were quantitated using computerized image analysis. These results may be due to activation of alternative DNA repair pathways in these nucleotide excision repair deficient cells.
