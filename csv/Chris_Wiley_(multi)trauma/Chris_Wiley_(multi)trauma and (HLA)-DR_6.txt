AB  - Abstract Microglia are the immune effector cells of the nervous system. The prevailing view is that microglia are derived from circulating precursors in the blood, which originate from the bone-marrow. Colonisation of the central nervous system (CNS) by microglia is an orchestrated response during human fetal development related to the maturation of the nervous system. It coincides with vascularisation, formation of radial glia, neuronal migration and myelination primarily in the 4th?5th months and beyond. Microglial influx generally conforms to a route following white matter tracts to gray areas. We have observed that colonisation of the spinal cord begins around 9 weeks, with the major influx and distribution of microglia commencing around 16 weeks. In the cerebrum, colonisation is in progress during the second trimester, and ramified microglial forms are widely distributed within the intermediate zone by the first half of intra-uterine life (20?22 weeks). A distinct pattern of migration occurs along radial glia, white matter tracts and vasculature. The distribution of these cells is likely to be co-ordinated by spatially and temporally regulated, anatomical expression of chemokines including RANTES and MCP-1 in the cortex; by ICAM-2 and PECAM on radiating cerebral vessels and on capillaries within the germinal layer, and apoptotic cell death overlying this region. The phenotype and functional characteristics of fetal microglia are also outlined in this review. The need for specific cellular interactions and targeting is greater within the central nervous system than in other tissues. In this respect, microglia may additionally contribute towards CNS histogenesis. Microsc. Res. Tech. 45:359?382, 1999. ? 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 212?219 For many years, the focus of attention in the study of semen has been on spermatozoa, its major cellular component, given their importance in the process of reproduction, and the role of the seminal fluid as their transport medium. More recently, evidence has accumulated of the complexity of seminal fluid, its components that perturb the female reproductive tract in ways promoting both survival of spermatozoa there-in and facilitating the implantation of embryos within the endometrium, hence initiating pregnancy. These same factors, however, may also make the female reproductive tract susceptible to invasion not only by spermatozoa but viruses, playing a significant role in the male-to-female transmission of HIV. Knowledge of the histology, anatomy, and immunology of the male reproductive tract is essential in understanding its role in HIV pathogenesis.

AB  - Tissue-engineered bones (TEBs) constructed with bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on biomaterial scaffolds have achieved good results for bone defect repair in both animal experiments and clinical trials. This has been limited, however, by the source and quantity of BMSCs. We here explored TEBs constructed by placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) and compared their effect for the repair of critical-sized segmental osteoperiosteal defects with TEBs constructed with BMSCs. PMSCs were isolated from rabbit placenta by gradient centrifugation and in?vitro monolayer culturing, and BMSCs were isolated from the hindlimb bone marrow of newborn rabbit. Primary cultured PMSCs and BMSCs were uniformly in a spindle shape. Immunocytochemistry indicated that both types of cells are positive for CD44 and CD105, and negative for CD34 and CD40L, confirming that they are mesenchymal stem cells. BrdU-labeled PMSCs and BMSCs were respectively co-cultured with bio-derived bone materials to construct TEBs in?vitro. Critical-sized segmental osteoperiosteal defects of radii were created in 24 rabbits by surgery. The defects were repaired with TEBs constructed with PMSCs and BMSCs. The results showed that TEBs constructed by both PMSCs and BMSCs could repair the osteoperiosteal defects in a ?multipoint? manner. Measurement of radiography, histology, immunohistochemistry, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin assaying and biomechanical properties have found no significant difference between the two groups at 2, 4, 8 and 12?weeks after the transplantation (P?>?0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that PMSCs have similar biological characteristics and osteogenic capacity to BMSCs and can be used as a new source of seeding cells for TEBs.

AB  - To cite this article: Hammad H, Lambrecht BN. Dendritic cells and airway epithelial cells at the interface between innate and adaptive immune responses. Allergy 2011; 66: 579?587. Abstract Because they can recognize and sample inhaled allergens, dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of adaptive Th2 responses in asthma. It is increasingly clear that DC functions are strongly influenced by a crosstalk with neighboring cells like epithelial cells. Whereas the epithelium was initially considered only as a barrier, it is now seen as a central player in controlling the function of lung DCs through release of innate cytokines-promoting Th2 responses. Clinically relevant allergens, as well as known environmental and genetic risk factors for allergy and asthma, often interfere directly or indirectly with the innate immune functions of airway epithelial cells and DC. A better understanding of these interactions might lead to a better prevention and ultimately to new treatments for asthma.

AB  - Summary Background Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Studies have implicated the immune response, especially monocyte/macrophages as being important in dictating outcome. Aim To investigate changes in the circulating monocytes and other immune cells serially in patients with ALF, relate these with cytokine concentrations, monocyte gene expression and patient outcome. Methods In a prospective case?control study in the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, 35 consecutive patients admitted with paracetamol-induced liver failure (POD-ALF), 10 patients with non-paracetamol causes of ALF and 16 controls were recruited. The peripheral blood monocyte phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry, circulating cytokines quantified by protein array and monocyte gene expression array performed and related to outcome. Results On admission, patients with worst outcomes after POD-ALF had a significant monocytopenia, characterised by reduced classical and expanded intermediate monocyte population. This was associated with reduced circulating lymphocytes and natural killer cells, peripheral cytokine patterns suggestive of a ?cytokine storm? and increased concentrations of cytokines associated with monocyte egress from the bone marrow. Gene expression array did not differentiate patient outcome. At day 4, there was no significant difference in monocyte, lymphocyte or natural killer cells between survivors and the patients with adverse outcomes. Conclusions Severe paracetamol liver failure is associated with profound changes in the peripheral blood compartment, particularly in monocytes, related with worse outcomes. This is not seen in patients with non-paracetamol-induced liver failure. Significant monocytopenia on admission may allow earlier clarification of prognosis, and it highlights a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
