AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Prognostic factors for the occurrence of longterm disability and prolonged sick leave were determined in 182 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. A significant relationship appeared between functional disability (determined by the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire) and sex, age at disease onset, and the number of peripheral joints involved. Using a life-table approach, the probability of prolonged sick leaves was associated with peripheral joint involvement and work that involved carrying heavy loads. Long-term disability was more frequent after work involving exposure to cold conditions (relative risk [RR] = 2.01) and prolonged standing postures (RR = 1.34), while sedentary work (RR = 0.35) and formal vocational rehabilitation programs (RR = 0.57) seemed to protect against long-term disability.

There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - We studied early renal function in 241 consecutive patients who received cadaveric renal transplants at two different transplantation centers (group 1, n?=?90; group 2, n?=?151). Univariate and multivariate analyses of data from group 1 showed a significant correlation between seven donor variables and early renal function after cadaveric renal transplantation. A scoring system was developed from these seven donor variables (cause of death, 0?6 points; history of hypertension, 0?6; final creatinine clearance before procurement, 0?6; age, 0?6; history of diabetes mellitus, 0?3; cold ischemia time, 0?3; and severity of renal artery plaque, 0?3). Data from group 2 were used to validate the donor scoring system and stratify cadaver kidneys on the basis of score: grade A, 0?5 points; grade B, 6?10; grade C, 11?15; and grade D, 16?32. A significant decline in early renal function was observed with increasing donor score and grade of cadaver kidney. In conclusion, a donor scoring system based on information available at the time of procurement can be used to estimate early graft function after cadaveric renal transplantation and may assist in the allocation of marginal organs.

AB  - Summary The multiple processes leading to the clinical use of allograft cells or tissues can only be quality and safety assured if cell collection and tissue recovery aspects are considered robustly. Risks associated with acquisition are reviewed within this chapter to highlight steps that should be taken to provide assurance thathigh standards have been met during cell collection or tissue retrieval. In some respects, the quality (i.e., characteristics, contamination) of the allograft can be dependent on the competency of procurement staff. This is particularly important with regard to the confirmation of the donor's identity and the physical assessment of the donor's body prior to the acquisition of tissue. The requirements for equipment and instruments as well as the environment in which the donation will occur are also explored. The importance of decontamination and preparation of the donor body prior to tissue retrieval is discussed and examples of good practice described. Additionally, differences between living and deceased tissue donation are highlighted, and considerations for collection of cells for therapeutic applications are described. The chapter provides a practical guide to mitigate risks associated with allograft cell collection and tissue retrieval.

AB  - Summary This chapter is a review of what is known about the olfactory function of a range of neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia (SZ). It deals with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, down syndrome, essential tremor, Huntington's disease (HD), and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Some of the other diseases discussed here include Lewy body disease (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy, pure autonomic failure, schizophrenia, spinocerebellar ataxias, temporal lobe epilepsy, and vascular dementia. It is noteworthy that a number of neurological disorders are accompanied by no, or only modest, alterations in smell function. It is important to note that several studies of AD and SZ patients have reported lack of significant effects on odor detection threshold tests, in contrast to highly significant effects on such tests as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT).

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.
