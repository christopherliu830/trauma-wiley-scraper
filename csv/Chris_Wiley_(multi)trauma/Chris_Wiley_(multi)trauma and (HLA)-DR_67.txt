AB  - Abstract Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic progressive liver disease. Its global epidemiology is still not well ascertained and its impact will be confronted with a higher burden in the next decade. Aim: The goal of this study was to develop a tool that can be used to predict the future prevalence of the disease in different countries and, more importantly, to understand the cause and effect relationship between the key assumptions and future trends. Methods: A system approach was used to build a simulation model where each population was modeled with the appropriate inflows and outflows. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the key drivers of future prevalence. Results: The total HCV-infected population in the US was estimated to decline 24% from 3.15 million in 2005 to 2.47 million in 2021, while disease burden will increase as the remaining infected population ages. During the same period, the mortality rate was forecasted to increase from 2.1 to 3.1%. The diagnosed population was 50% of the total infections, while less than 2% of the total infections were treated. Conclusion: We have created a framework to evaluate the HCV-infected populations in countries around the world. This model may help assess the impact of policies to meet the challenges predicted by the evolution of HCV infection and disease. This prediction tool may help to target new public health strategies.

KW  - management and staging of oral Kaposi's sarcoma
PY  - 1997
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplastic disease in patients with disease due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and oral KS (OKS) is the commonest oral neoplasia. OKS has been managed by local excision, intralesional chemotherapy regional radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy. Comparison between studies is difficult as the severity of oral involvement is not well defined in most studies. This paper reviews the approach to the management of OKS and also presents a proposal for the clinical staging of OKS. Clinical staging of OKS will facilitate comparisons of outcomes of treatment of OKS and improve our understanding of the natural history of the neoplasia, which has varied presentation and rates of progression.

AB  - Leukoreduction of blood products is a technique used to prevent leukocyte-induced transfusion reactions. Filters currently used for human blood products achieve at least a 99.9% reduction in leukocyte numbers per unit (450 mL) of blood. Goals of this study were to determine if a prestorage leukoreduction filter could effectively achieve leukoreduction of canine blood and to determine if viability of the leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) product could be maintained after 35 days of storage. Blood collected from each dog was filtered through a leukoreduction filter at either room temperature or after cooling (4°C) for 4 hours. Filtration efficacy was determined by measurement of pre- and postfiltration leukocyte counts. In vitro viability of RBCs was determined by comparing RBC adenosine triphosphate concentration and percent hemolysis before and after the storage period. In vivo viability of stored cells was determined using a biotin-streptavidin-phycoerythrin labeling technique and flow cytometry. Blood filtered within 30 minutes of collection versus blood filtered after cooling had mean reductions in leukocyte numbers of 88.90 and 99.99%, respectively. The mean ATP and hemoglobin concentrations from the in vitro analysis were comparable to those obtained in previously for canine RBC adequately stored for 35 days. The mean in vivo 24-hour survival of the stored RBC was 84.7%. The leukoreduction filter used did not adversely affect in vitro or in vivo viability of canine RBCs. The filter effectively removed leukocytes from blood, with maximal efficiency of filtration achieved with use of cooled blood.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with the various disorders of consciousness, sleep, and conditions requiring neurointensive care support. The role of an intensive care unit is to maintain normal physiological homeostasis while actively treating the underlying cause of any physiological derangement. Neurological complications on the ICU are usually caused by metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, stroke or neuromuscular disorders but multiple complications are common. Sleep medicine is an evolving field with wide variability in knowledge of each individual sleep disorder. The chapter lists the most recent classification that is based on common complaints (insomnia or hypersomnias) as well as presumed aetiological basis (circadian rhythm disorders) or organ system from which problems arise (sleep-related breathing disorders). It also explains the issues involved in determining brain death. The diagnosis of brain death is necessary when withdrawal of artificial life support is considered and if the possibility of organ donation exists.
