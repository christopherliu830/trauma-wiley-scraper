AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on soft tissue are not well characterized. This study utilized a diabetic wound model to examine the effects of PEMF effects on soft tissue healing. Methods: Wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db and wild type C57BL6 mice. Mice were exposed to PEMF (4.5?ms pulse/15?hz) for 8?hrs/day for 14 days. Gross closure was assessed with digital analysis of area changes over time. Histological examination assessed granulation and epithelial gap, cell proliferation (BrdU), and endothelial cell density (CD31). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence or absence of PEMF for 8?hrs and VEGF/FGF2 was measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Results: Mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, db/db: 60%(PEMF) vs. 78%(control), C57BL6: 15% vs. 42%, p?<?0.05) and day 14 (db/db: 21% vs. 55%, C57BL6: 8% vs. 28%, p?<?0.05), with increased granulation and cell proliferation (db/db day 7: 52?±?8 vs. 31?±?5 cells/HPF (200x)). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly higher CD31 density in wounds exposed to PEMF at day 7 (vessels/HPF, db/db: 28?±?4 vs. 17?±?4, C57BL6: 41?±?7 vs. 28?±?6) and day 14 (db/db: 32?±?6 vs. 21?±?5, C57BL6: 48?±?5 vs. 40?±?5). HUVECs in PEMF exhibited 5-fold higher levels of FGF2 compared to controls after 30?min (20.50?pg/ml?±?6.75 vs. 4.25?pg/ml?±?0.75), with no change in VEGF through 8?hrs. Conclusions: PEMF accelerates closure time and endothelial cell proliferation in wound healing. Upregulation of FGF2 in HUVECs exposed to PEMF suggests that release of angiogenic growth factors may explain increased vascular density and accelerated wound closure. Clinical uses include treatment for diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. This work is supported in part by the Alumni Fund, Alumni Association of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (MJC).

AB  - A critical limitation of using retroviral vectors for gene therapy is their inability to infect non-dividing cells. Although, the adenoviral vectors have the advantage of being able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, they elicit inflammatory response, thus making the interpretation of in vivo experiments harder. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral vectors do not have those limitations, however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. To determine if low-oxygen microenvironment affects viral vector-mediated gene transfection, we have used two other viral vectors, Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral constructs in vitro and in vivo to express foreign genes in hypoxic cultured human dermal fibroblasts and ischemic rat wounds. Both cultured normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) human dermal fibroblasts were identically transfected by the AAV vector. A lenti6-LacZ construct was injected onto the periphery of rat ischemic and non-ischemic wound (106 pfu/wound) at the time of wounding. Wounds were harvested at post-operative day 7. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with a in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed without any inflammatory response. No significant difference of transfection efficiency was observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic wounds. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and Lentiviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in both ischemic and non-ischemic cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Epithelialization and vascularization are key elements involved in the repair of cutaneous wounds. One method of regulation for these pathways is expression of a signaling molecule known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which, in turn, is regulated by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). It has been suggested that chronic wounds, which are most commonly located in ischemic tissue among the elderly, may be the result of a loss of function in the VEGF regulation pathway. Using our rat back flap model, which demonstrates the negative influences of age and ischemia on wound healing, we examined the relative expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in aged and young rats at 3,7, and 10 days post-wounding. Four full-thickness biopsy punches (7?mm) were made on the back of each aged and young rat. The rostral wound pair was made ischemic by raising a transverse flap (1.8?cm wide???8?cm length). The caudal wound pair served as a non-ischemic control. Inserting a sterilized polyethylene sheet under both ischemic and nonischemic wounds prevented wound contraction. RNA was extracted from the tissue at the specified time points, and run on Real-Time PCR to determine relative expression of VEGF and HIF-1. Preliminary data suggest that, at the 3 day time point, there is a significant increase in both HIF-1 and VEGF expression in young rats under ischemic conditions and a significant increase in VEGF expression in aged rats under ischemia with a strong (but not significant) trend towards increase in HIF-1 as well. While the rat model does not produce significant differences between aged and young animals, this upregulation under ischemia indicates that HIF-1 and VEGF expression may play a vital role in the early signaling of ischemic wound repair.

AB  - Introduction: Fetal mouse skin wounds heal without scar before gestational day E17. Because scarless repair is inherent to fetal skin and occurs superimposed on skin differentiation, genome-wide gene expression during skin development was tested. Methods: Dorsal skin from BALB/C mice fetuses at E14, E15, E18 and E20 was collected. RNAs from individual fetuses were hybridized to mouse microarrays with 42,000 gene elements. The E14/E18 hybridizations were repeated three times, and the E15/E20 repeated twice with different samples. (?x??=?fold change). Results: Increased genes on E18 and E20 were clustered into several groups: 1) ECMs: type I (2.8x), III (2.3x), VI, and XIV procollagens; 2) Cell surface: integrin beta1 binding protein2 (5.2x), integral membrane protein2A and 2B (avg 3.8x); 3) Proteases: mast cell protease4 (15x) and 5 (24x), MMP23 (3x); 4) Growth factor-related: acidic FGF (3.7x), FGF receptor3 (2.9x), TGF-alpha (2.3x). Decreased genes on E18 and E20 included: 1) Growth factors: TGF-beta2 (0.42x), PDGF-alpha (0.41x), PDGF receptor-beta (0.37x), NGF receptor associated protein (0.18x); 2) Proteases: MMP 11 (0.27x), 14 (0.39x); 3) ECM: fibromodulin (0.5x), Vcam1 (0.22x), keratin18 (0.2x) and 19 (0.46x), collagen XVIII (0.36x). Conclusions: Genes with increased expression at E14, E15 and decreased expression at E18, E20 have possible antifibrotic function. These data identify hundreds of possible anti-fibrotic and pro-fibrotic genes as candidates for further functional analysis as regulators of repair. Supported by NIH DE00463?03

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, there have been a number of studies in Europe on contact sensitivity in patients with chronic leg ulcerations with a frequency of positive patch test results ranging from 40 to 82.5%. The prevalence of sensitization has not been studied in North America. Furthermore, many of the newer dressings and wound care products in the market have not been studied for contact sensitivity in patients with chronic wounds. Objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitivity in patients with history of leg ulcers in two North American study centers, 2) to compare our results to the European studies and to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) database and 3) to help delineate a standard battery of allergens for patch testing in North American leg ulcer patients Methods: 54 patients with an active or past leg ulcer were prospectively entered in the study. The patients were patch tested to both the NACDG Standard series, as well as, a comprehensive supplemental series of 48 allergens including wound care medicaments and dressings. Results: 63% of patients were sensitized to at last one allergen. The most common allergens were Balsam of Peru (29.6%), bacitracin (24.1%), fragrance mix (20.4%), wood tar mix (20.4%), propylene glycol (13.5%), neomycin sulfate (13%), benzalkonium chloride (13%), carba mix (11.1%), nickel sulfate (11.1%) and Duoderm CGF (11.1%). Duoderm CGF was the most allergenic dressing in our study group. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of positive patch tests in patients with past or current leg ulcerations. Using a modified leg ulcer series along with the standard NACDG series is very important in evaluating patients with leg ulcers.

AB  - Introduction: Low-energy laser photostimuation has been reported to affect the proliferative phase of wound healing and stimulate macrophages. Light-emitting diodes (LED) are an efficient, inexpensive source of low energy photons. We propose that LED therapy will stimulate macrophage production of VEGF and NO. Methods: Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells (5???105cells/ml) were treated with or without LPS (10?ng/ml) and IFN-gamma (100?Units/ml) for 24 hours. Cells were divided into groups: 1) control ? no LED, 2) 670?nm, 3) 730?nm, 4) 880?nm, and 5) combination (880?nm/730?nm/670?nm) at 4?J/cm2 per wavelength. Twenty-four hours post-LED, conditioned media was analyzed for VEGF (ELISA) and nitrites (Greiss assay). Proliferation was assessed using BrDU incorporation. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test. Results: In serum-starved cells, proliferation was unchanged by LED. VEGF and nitrite levels were increased in groups 4 (VEGF?=?1057.1?+/??100.3?pg/ml; nitrites?=?11.13?+/? 0.79?uM) and 5 (VEGF?=?1148.9?+/??88.5?pg/ml; nitrites?=?10.72?+/??1.03?uM) compared to control (VEGF?=?812.2?+/??94.8?pg/ml; nitrites?=?7.32?+/??1.92?uM). LPS/IFN decreased proliferation 25 percent at all wavelengths compared to control?+?LPS/IFN (p?<?0.01). Nitrite and VEGF levels were markedly elevated in all five LPS/IFN-treated groups with no appreciable intergroup differences. Conclusions: LPS/IFN stimulation resulted in maximally elevated levels of nitrites and VEGF, possibly masking the effects of LED. Serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells responded to LED treatment at 880?nm and combined wavelengths with increased VEGF and NO production. These results suggest that LED treatment at 880?nm and 880?nm/730?nm/670?nm may upregulate the production of pro-angiogenic factors by macrophages in the wound bed.

AB  - Transforming growth factor ?(TGF?) has both positive and negative effects on cutaneous wound healing. Smad7 acts as a major downstream antagonist of TGF? signaling in keratinocytes and its role in wound healing has not been defined. We have established a Smad7 transgenic mouse line using a keratin 5 (K5) promoter (K5.Smad7) which expresses Smad7 transgene at a mild level (?2 fold of the endogenous Smad7 in the skin). These mice did not have overt skin defects as shown from our previous Smad7 transgenic mice expressing much higher levels of the Smad7 transgene (EMBO J 2002, 21:2580?90). K5.Smad7 mice from the above low expressor line and non-transgenic littermates were subject to 6-mm full-thickness excisional wounding. K5.Smad7 mice exhibited early scab rejection, reduced inflammation, and accelerated re-epithelialization as compared to non-transgenic mice. To further determine the stage-specific effects of Smad7 on wound healing, we generated a transgenic model in which Smad7 transgene expression can be induced in the epidermis and hair follicles (gene-switch-Smad7) by topically RU486 application. Smad7 induction from day 3 to day 7 after excisional wounding reduced inflammatory responses through suppressing expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in gene-switch-Smad7 mice as compared to control mice. Meanwhile, overexpression of Smad7 exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, which correlated with increased expression of metalloproteinases and elevated Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling in the leading epidermal edges in gene-switch-Smad7 wounds compared to control wounds. Smad7 induction from day 7 to day 20 after excisional wounding reduced dermal fibrotic response and angiogenesis in the dermis, resulting in a better tissue repair. We conclude that the effectsof Smad7 on wound healing are likely due to blocking the negative effects of TGF? on cutaneous wound healing.

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem, resulting in both adverse tissue form and function and the goal of therapeutic interventions is to reduce and prevent excessive scarring. We have demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (rAd-p21), inhibited scar formation by blocking cell cycle progression and attenuated cell proliferation at the wound site (Perkins et?al 2002). Recently, we have shown rAd-p21 specific antiproliferative effects on granulation tissue in vivo(Gu, et?al, manuscript submitted). Safety parameters using rAd-p21 for anti-scarring may include effects on wound strength and dehiscence of the wound. We tested effects of rAd-p21 on wound strength in vivo using tensile strength as an endpoint and included comparisons with other clinically relevant antiproliferative agents. Specifically, rAd-p21 at doses from 1???107 to 3.8???1010 particle (PN) per incision was administered intradermally to linear rat incisions and assayed 14?28 days post treatment. rAd-p21 mildly reduced tensile strength at high doses (≥3???1010PN), whereas low to moderate doses (1???107 to 1???1010PN) had no effect. Interestingly, all rAd-p21 treated wounds regained tensile strength indistinguishable from vehicle control, 4 weeks after treatment, suggesting that rAd-p21 wounds recover with time. An adenovirus control vector, not containing a gene (rAd-Empty), showed subtle reduction of tensile strength that was only statistically significant at day 21. This suggests that delivery of rAd-Empty alone in the wound has little effect on wound strength. Triamcinolone at 5?mg/mL/wound, 5-FU at 10?mg/mL/wound, and low doses of MMC did not significantly reduce tensile strength, although high doses of MMC (0.2?mg/mL/wound) severely reduced tensile strength which failed to recover after 28 days. Morphological analysis of all groups revealed necrosis only in the MMC treatment. This data suggests that rAd-p21 may reduce the hyperproliferative status in excessive scar formation with minimal effects on wound strength.

AB  - Introduction: Angiogenesis is thought to be important for granulation tissue formation and for the delivery oxygen and other nutrients to the healing wound bed. We examined whether angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) such as endostatin decrease neovascularization in full-thickness wounds leading to impaired granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure. Methods: Endostatin at tumor-inhibiting doses (20?mg/kg/BID) was injected daily starting three days prior to surgery. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the mouse dorsum using a novel wound healing model developed in our lab. A second experimental group had topical VEGF (10??g/QD) applied to these wounds. Both groups were compared to PBS-treated controls. Wounds were analyzed for closure time, granulation tissue formation, and wound vascularity using CD31. Results: Endostatin-treatment delayed wound closure compared to control mice (17.4d?±?1.51 vs. 12.8?±?0.89, P?<?0.05), resulted in decreased granulation tissue formation at all time points (P?<?0.05), and significantly reduced wound vascularity as measured by CD31+ vessel counts (P?<?0.05). VEGF application to the wound bed of endostatin-treated mice normalized wound closure despite endostatin treatment (13.8d?±?1.1 vs. 17.44d?±?1.51, P?<?0.05). Conclusion: Endostatin impairs wound angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation and delays full-thickness wound closure. Topical VEGF was able to reverse this effect and may represent a novel approach to improve wound healing in patients receiving AI. These findings may have serious implications for patients undergoing AI treatment that require surgery or who have wound healing complications.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.

AB  - The importance of controlling the bioburden in wounds can not be over emphasized. Glycerine based gel sheets have been used extensively to show their bacteriostatic/fungistatic properties. Hoekstra studied animal wounds and compared glycerine dressings with water based dressings and the glycerine showed superior bioburden reduction. Vandeputte showed similar results when comparing hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings and looked at the histology of the wounds to find differences in the quantities of the types of cells present. The reduced scar formation of wounds are thought to be attributed to the influence of the glycerine on the healing process. Hoestra has reported the dramatic reduction in the inflammation reaction soon after application of the glycerine gel dressing. Studies by Oliveria-Gandia, Davis, and Mertz showed the glycerine dressings to be more effective than hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings in reducing bioburden in animal wounds that were inoculated with microbes and also reducing biocounts in appropriate growth medium. Vandeputte conducted a diabetic study(no exclusions) that compared the glycerine dressing (n?=?15) with standard protocol(n?=?14) for diabetic foot wounds, that showed the test dressing to be far superior. He along with thousands of other nurses around the world have reported the use of glycerine dressings on superficial burns to reduce pain, reduce the chance for infection, reduce scar formation, and to protect the wound from friction and pressure. J. Baksa extensively used the glycerine gel sheets in his burn unit not only for the superficial wounds but also for 3rd and 4th degree burns on children as well as after surgical removal of hypertrophic and keloid scars to prevent reoccurrence. T.M. Baum and M.J. Busuito also reported the use of the glycerine dressing for scar prevention and treatment. The glycerine dressing has been used extensively for te treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitals, nursing homes, athletic fields, as well as, under casts, splints and braces. R. Horchner reported a >95% reduction in pressure ulcers in a direct comparison to the control and to hydrocolloids.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is a common complication of diabetes resulting in significant clinical morbidity. The diabetic wound exhibits impaired cellular infiltration and consequently inadequate granulation tissue formation. Additionally, altered patterns of apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the differential gene expression pattern in transgenic diabetic female mice, 5?6 weeks old, in a full thickness cutaneous punch wound model. We assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and differential gene expression pattern at 4th, 7th and 11th day post wounding. Supernatants obtained from diabetic wound tissue homogenates were subjected to zymogram analysis. The data showed that MMPs were expressed at higher level by 4th day post wounding, whereas expression of MMPs were down regulated towards the 11th day post wounding suggesting their role during early phase of wound healing. The pathway specific gene array data demonstrated differential regulation of several growth factors, transcription factors and other related genes such as fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, ID3 and restin respectively. The cytokine/extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), an important component of cellular immunity and inflammation also showed higher expression after 4 days post wounding. The expression of OPN remained at higher level after 11 days post wounding in diabetic mice, whereas the expression were down regulated to basal level in normal wounded animal suggesting that the expression of OPN was concomitant with the extent of healing. Other adhesion molecules such as integrin αV and PECAM-1 were also differentially regulated. Though a single gene may not be solely responsible for any defect or impairment in healing as it is a very tightly controlled and regulated process, however, a detailed study of these gene(s) may shed some light to the delayed healing in diabetic mice.

AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.
