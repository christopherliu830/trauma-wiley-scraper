AB  - High-dose cytoreduction and hematopoietic stem cell infusion form the basis for treatment of hematologic cancers, defects or failure of hematopoiesis, and some solid tumors. As an antitumor therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is superior to autologous HCT by induction of a graft-us-tumor effect. However, recipients of allografts suffer higher transplant-related mortality owing to graft-us-host disease (GVHD). Nutrition support research must recognize that HCT is a heterogeneous modality whose short and long-term outcomes are affected by transplant type, preparative regimens, diagnosis, disease stage, age, and nutritional status. The field of HCT will diversify further as lower dose cytoreduction and mixed chimerism grafts allow expansion of the technique to older patients and to other diseases.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess the safety of a licensed anthrax vaccine (AVA) given to more than 500?000 US military personnel, through review and medical evaluation of adverse events (AEs) reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Methods AEs were summarized by person, vaccine lot, type, frequency and impact. A Delphic approach was used to tentatively assess causality in an effort to detect serious AEs (SAEs) or other medically important AEs (OMIAEs) possibly attributable to AVA. Results The Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee (AVEC) reviewed 1841 reports describing 3991 AEs (9.4 reports/10?000 doses of AVA) that were submitted to VAERS from 1Q1998 through 4Q2001. One hundred forty-seven reports described an SAE or OMIAE, of which 26 were tentatively rated as possible, probable or certain consequences of vaccination (injection-site reaction [12], ?anaphylactic-like reaction? [5] and eight other systemic AEs [1?2 each]). Conclusions This review produced no evidence for an unusual rate of any SAE or OMIAE attributable to AVA. It supported an earlier impression that AVA may cause significant local inflammation and should be administered over the deltoid rather than the triceps to avoid direct or compression injury to the ulnar nerve. The subjects of VAERS reports tended to be older than all recipients of AVA. Females generally had and/or reported AEs more often than males, but transient articular reactions were surprisingly more common in males. Variations in the frequency or severity (as judged by hospitalization and/or loss of duty) of reported AEs did not suggest a significant problem with (1) a particular lot of AVA, (2) recurrent AEs after multiple doses or (3) vaccination of persons with a concomitant illness or those given other vaccines or medications.

AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the features of multiple sclerosis as one understand them today, and reviews current practice in diagnosis and management. Other demyelinating diseases are also reviewed. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults and health care costs result in considerable financial burden to society. The aetiology of multiple sclerosis is complex and cannot be ascribed to a single genetic or environmental factor. The characteristic pathological feature of multiple sclerosis is the focal plaque or lesion. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) lesions show peri-vascular inflammation with prominent complement and immunoglobulin deposition in keeping with a role for humoral immunity. Acute para-infectious encephalopathies are typically monophasic encephalitides characterised by multifocal inflammatory lesions, principally affecting the white matter of the CNS. There are two consistently distinguishable pathological subdivisions: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL).

AB  - Abstract A risk analysis of in utero caffeine exposure is presented utilizing epidemiological studies and animal studies dealing with congenital malformation, pregnancy loss, and weight reduction. These effects are of interest to teratologists, because animal studies are useful in their evaluation. Many of the epidemiology studies did not evaluate the impact of the ?pregnancy signal,? which identifies healthy pregnancies and permits investigators to identify subjects with low pregnancy risks. The spontaneous abortion epidemiology studies were inconsistent and the majority did not consider the confounding introduced by not considering the pregnancy signal. The animal studies do not support the concept that caffeine is an abortafacient for the wide range of human caffeine exposures. Almost all the congenital malformation epidemiology studies were negative. Animal pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the teratogenic plasma level of caffeine has to reach or exceed 60?µg/ml, which is not attainable from ingesting large amounts of caffeine in foods and beverages. No epidemiological study described the ?caffeine teratogenic syndrome.? Six of the 17 recent epidemiology studies dealing with the risk of caffeine and fetal weight reduction were negative. Seven of the positive studies had growth reductions that were clinically insignificant and none of the studies cited the animal literature. Analysis of caffeine's reproductive toxicity considers reproducibility and plausibility of clinical, epidemiological, and animal data. Moderate or even high amounts of beverages and foods containing caffeine do not increase the risks of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation. Pharmacokinetic studies markedly improve the ability to perform the risk analyses. Birth Defects Res (Part B) 92:152?187, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
