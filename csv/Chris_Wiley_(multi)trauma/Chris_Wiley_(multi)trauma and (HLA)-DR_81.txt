AB  - Objective:?To reflect on the establishment and evolution of the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research. Method:?Narrative historical review. Results:?First established as an inpatient research unit in December 1987, the focus of the Centre evolved in concert with the skills of the staff. After the structure was revised in 1996 and 1999, the Centre has evolved into a group with four main research streams ? epidemiology, developmental neurobiology, genetics and policy and economics. Although the group maintains a strong focus on serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia, our policy and economic work has a wider perspective. The Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research is based in an historic mental health service, with laboratories in collaborating universities and institutes. Key lessons learnt by the group along the way relate to the importance of focusing on a restricted range of research topics in order to build a critical mass. Conclusions:?Given a facilitating environment, hospital-based research groups can prosper. Over the last 17 years, a cost-efficient, focused and productive research group has evolved that has made contributions to international research.

AB  - Aim? Variant MNS (vMNS) phenotypes are characterised by the presence of multiple antigens that provoke complex antibody responses. The hypothesis tested was that red cell-agglutinating antibodies of a single specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on peptides representing vMNS antigens. The Vw and Hut/Mut antigens vary only at glycophorin residue 28, Vw methionine-28, Hut and Mut lysine-28. The Mur peptide TYPAHTANEV was aa 33 to 42 of GpMur. For each experiment a 5?ml pool of 4 and 10 sera that agglutinated Mi-positive cells of known MNS-peptide-ELISA activity, was subjected to affinity chromatography on a single peptide. Result? For a serum pool that was strong peptide-ELISA positive with the lysine-28 peptide but was methionine-28 peptide negative, the antibody eluate was lysine-28 pos by ELISA and agglutinated all MUT and HUT pos cells tested but not Vw cells or Mi(a) negative cells. For the MUT antigen the hypothesis that a rbc-agglutinating antibody of a defined specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on a linear peptide representing the antigen was confirmed. In a similar fashion a specific anti-Mur was prepared. However, for one serum pool the antibody eluted from the Mur-column reacted with Hut (MiII) as well as Mur-positive cells, suggesting that Mut.Mur was recognised as a single antigen. Conclusion? Purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies that define vMNS phenotypes may be useful in resolving difficult serological investigations. The complexity of responses to vMNS glycophorins is confirmed by the recovery of an antibody reacting with sequentially adjacent antigens as a single entity.

AB  - Aim? To find incidence of partial D variants in India and classify them by molecular techniques. Method? Partial D variants were identified by screening blood samples of subjects from Western India by using partial D kit (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service). Molecular characterization of partial D variants was performed using multiplex PCR(M-PCR). Result? The incidence of partial D was 0.15% in the population studied. Forty eight partial D variant samples identified by serological studies were classified by M-PCR. 29% of partial D variants identified were of DFR and 14.6% were of DVI category. 77% of partial D variants identified in Indian population were characterized by M-PCR. Fifteen families of partial D variants were studied and ten more individuals of same variant were identified. All partial D variants were of R1r (DCe/dce) phenotype. The family studies showed partial D hybrid (RHD-CE-D) was linked with Ce gene. Conclusion? DFR was most frequently found partial D in Indian population. Majority of partial D variants characterized in Indian population arise due to substitution of part of RHD exon with RHCE equivalent.

AB  - Adherence of red blood cells (RBCs) to vascular endothelium impairs blood flow, decreases oxygen delivery and leads to vaso-occulusion. RBCs are relatively non-adherent however little is known of how changes to RBCs for transfusion during storage may affect their adherence properties. The aim of this study was to monitor adherence of stored RBCs to vascular endothelium under conditions of continuous flow in vitro. Specifically the influence of RBC storage time and leucocyte burden of stored red cell preparations was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Nonleucocyte- reduced, buffy-coat-reduced and leucocyte-filtered RBC products were prepared according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected at multiple time points until product expiry and perfused across an EC monolayer using a parallel flow chamber mounted to an inverted microscope. Perfusion of RBCs was controlled for shear stress and temperature. RBC-EC interactions were recorded using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The number of RBCs adhering to the EC layer progressively increased with product storage time. RBCs from products stored for 28 and 42?days were significantly more adherent than fresher cells. RBCs from products containing leucocytes were also significantly more adherent to the EC layer on days 28 and 42 of storage than RBCs from leucocyte-reduced products. Our findings indicate that product storage time and leucocyte burden increase the adhesion of RBCs to an EC layer. These results may lead to greater understanding of the interaction of transfused RBCs with recipient endothelium and the biological consequences of this adherence.

AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.

AB  - Aim? The aim of the study is to quantitate D antigenic sites on RBC in weak D and partial D variants in Indian population by flowcytometric method. Method? Dantigenic sites were estimated in 48 cases of partial D, eight cases of weak D (identified by serological methods) and normal Rh phenotypes subjects by flowcytometric technique. The indirect immunoflourescence method was employed using thirty epitope specific monoclonal anti-D as primary antibody. The D antigenic sites were calculated using standard RBC with known D antigenic sites. Result? The mean (±I S.D) D antigenic sites per RBC in weak D and partial D were 4503?±?2067 and 6750?±?3426 respectively. In R1R1 phenotype the range of D antigenic sites was 16500?±?2500 and in R1r it was 10600?±?2520. In four cases of weak D sites were in range of 1700 to 3500 and in other four it was 5000 to 7200?D sites/RBC. Among partial D variants DVI had minimum, and DVa had maximum number of D sites. Conclusion? Flowcytometry is a very good tool for demonstrating minor differences in D antigen sites in partial D and weak D when serological methods are not conclusive.

AB  - BloodSafe is a joint initiative between the South Australian (SA) Department of Health, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, hospitals and transfusion service providers. It has successfully established quality assurance programs to improve the safety and quality of blood management practice within the SA health system. BloodSafe began as a project in September of 2002 initially with 12?months funding from the Safety and Quality Council. Four Transfusion Nurse Consultants were appointed across five major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Audit of practice within these hospitals demonstrated three major problem areas- transfusion specimen collection, the decision to transfuse and administration of blood. A further 12?months funding was granted including extension of the project to include a Nurse Educator for the state to introduce initiatives into country and private hospitals. Reaudit of practice after interventions and education demonstrated that the Transfusion Nurse Consultants were effective change agents. In particular red cell use outside the NHMRC/ASBT guidelines fell from 18% to 4%(p?<?0.01) in stable adult orthopaedic patients audited. A number of other important aspects of transfusion practice also showed significant improvement including documentation, consent and administration. Recurrent funding for BloodSafe Transfusion Nurse Consultants was granted by the SA Department of Health from July 2004. Factors contributing to the success of BloodSafe include a multidisciplinary team, Transfusion Nurses of clinical nurse consultant level, demonstration of a clear need for the initiatives, evidence of successful practice improvement, statewide collaboration and interventions, benchmarking across hospitals, and impartiality of the BloodSafe name with acceptance by stakeholders.

AB  - Focus on the risks of viral transmission via transfusion has pushed recognition of other transfusion risks to the background over the last several decades. With reduction in the risks of HCV and HIV to very low levels (well less than 1/million units), productive attention can now be directed toward other risks. Bacterial contamination of platelets represents the largest morbidity and mortality risk faced by a platelet recipient, and the risk of dieing due to a contaminated unit is at least 10- if not 100-times greater than the chance of HIV transmission. Approximately 1 in every 1?4,000 units of platelets can be shown to contain bacteria, and the frequency of fatality due to port-transfusion sepsis is 14/million units transfused. Bacterial contamination is often not recognized clinically, however, because of the situation of the patient. A variety of techniques to limit and detect bacterial contamination are available for implementation. Culturing is used most widely. Checking pH, glucose concentration or preservation of swirling are simple and inexpensive techniques but suffer from lack of sensitivity. The development of immunologic techniques that can be accomplished rapidly may shift the testing to immediately before issuance for transfusion, a time at which any contamination would be easier to detect because of growth during the storage period. Not only will detection techniques improve transfusion recipient safety, but they can lead to cost-savings through extension of the platelet storage period as has already been implemented in several European countries.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been implicated in certain adverse patient outcomes. Immunomodulation may play a central role. The aim of this project was to determine the ability of supernatants and cellular fractions of RBC concentrates to modulate the immune response of allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNCs), particularly monocytes. Non-leucocytereduced, buffy-coat-depleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected on day 1 and fortnightly until product expiry, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant and cellular fractions. On the?day of RBC sample collection, whole blood (WB) and MNCs were prepared from ABO-compatible allogeneic donors. Induction of monocyte CD11b and CD54 was determined by flow cytometry by incubating allogeneic WB with RBC supernatants or cellular fractions, followed by staining with fl uorescently-labelled anti-CD14, anti-CD11b and anti-CD54. Cytokine release was determined by incubating MNCs with RBC supernatants and culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IL-8, TNFalpha; and IL-10. Supernatant and cellular fraction from non-leucocyte-reduced RBC concentrates induced expression of CD11b and CD54 on allogeneic monocytes. Buffy-coatdepleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates had minimal effect on monocyte CD11b or CD54 expression. Cytokine release from MNCs incubated with RBC supernatant suggested a tenuous balance between proinflammatory (IL-8 and TNF alpha;) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) responses. All RBC product types induced cytokine release from MNCs. The results from this study indicate that stored RBC concentrates can modulate allogeneic MNCs. Both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses were evident. Leucocytes in RBC concentrates appear to favour a proinflammatory response by MNCs.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a basis for understanding how and why hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may effectively treat severe autoimmune diseases (ADs) and describes the preclinical studies that have contributed to this understanding. It begins with an overview of how normal antigen-specific immune responses develop, followed by a discussion of why autoimmunity occurs. Thereafter, studies on preclinical models using HCT for the treatment of autoimmune syndromes are presented. The HCT studies are described as they were originally performed using congenic, syngeneic, or pseudoautologous donors with the understanding that all of these graft types serve as models for autologous HCT. ADs arise when immune effector cells cause damage to tissues. The response may be organ specific or systemic, and more than one autoimmune syndrome can exist in an individual. Depletion of host T cells is the most extensively studied mechanism by which allogeneic HCT can alter immune function.

AB  - The regulation of blood, blood product, tissue and gene technology therapies are viewed as critical to protecting the health of Australians. In response to the growing community concerns regarding the ethics, quality and safety of tissue and biological therapy products, the Australian Health Ministers Council, in 2002, recommended the development and introduction of a regulatory framework for tissues and emerging biological therapies. The proposal for tissues and emerging biological therapies parallels the regulation of blood and blood components introduced by the TGA in 2000 following similar ministerial recommendations, policy development and consultation A comprehensive system for the regulation of cellular and tissue based therapies within a proposed trans Tasman framework will be characterised by the following principles: ??All therapeutic products definable as cellular and tissue therapies, including cell-based gene therapy products, will be overseen by the system ??The level of regulation will be classified according to the risks posed by the therapies to the individual and the community. ??The classification system will align regulation of therapies to: ??standards ??standards and GMP ??standards, GMP and pre-market evaluation according to the level of risk. ??All facilities responsible for the manufacture and supply of cellular and tissue based products will be required to register their organisation with the TGA.

AB  - Aim To identify the medical officers responsible for blood transfusion therapy across the ACT. Method? Medical records of patients having transfusions were audited in one tertiary referral hospital, one general hospital and one associated private hospital as part of a quality improvement project. The clinical status patients, reasons for transfusion and laboratory data were extracted and the appropriateness of transfusion was assessed independently by two of the authors. Differences were resolved by consensus. The prescriber was also identified where possible, defined as the most senior clinician recorded in the medical record involved in the decision to transfuse. Result? The prescriber could be determined in 78% of transfusion episodes. In the majority of cases the decision to transfuse was attributed to specialist staff, in all hospitals. Registrars at the tertiary hospital prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (12%) than specialists (18.1%, p?<?0.05). This was not found at the smaller public hospital. After hours resident and registrar staff prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (3%) than other prescribers across the Territory (18.7%, p?<?0.005). Conclusion? Medical practitioners with varying levels of experience make medical decisions in hospitals. Who is responsible for these decisions has not been well studied. Our findings demonstrate specialist involvement in the majority of transfusion decisions. The results favour a ?top down? approach to quality improvement in transfusion, rather than targeting junior medical officers. The findings also have significant implications in understanding the dynamics of clinical decision making in the hospital setting and for the targeting of other quality improvement strategies.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.

AB  - Aim? ARCBS collection sites are located in capital city centres, regional and metropolitan static sites and mobile units. The project aimed to establish a ?donor-centric? collection facility that met evolving donor needs. Methods  (a) the eastern based skew of the existing Pirie Street operation and (b) the demographic profiles of donor and non-donor cohorts, potential sites for further investigation were identified. This process was further enhanced by surveying donors (stakeholder buy in and input) who indicated a preference for a mid-CBD site. This selection was supported by retailing and traffic analysis that reinforced the Currie St. location ? a major street frontage with a transport hub to the western suburbs. ?Guiding Principles? for the design and operation of the centre were developed and stated that the site must; ? have a WOW factor ? make donation easy for donors ? have a modern and professional outlook ? have its own personality ? be creative and bold ? not compete with the existing city site ? cater for a different market segment to existing sites. The Guiding Principles and recommendations from donor focus groups, were used by the architects to develop concept drawings. These were reviewed by the Donor Advisory Committee, and specifications finalised. Furniture, fittings, refreshments and marketing strategies also focussed on the target donor groups and Guiding Principles. Conclusion? A donor focus in the planning, design and development of this centre has produced a facility that currently exceeds collection targets and has been nominated for building industry awards.

AB  - In July 2003, The Royal Women?s Hospital, Melbourne implemented the use of Prophylactic Rh D Immunoglobulin in obstetrics to help reduce the incidence of Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer in December 2002. Successful implementation required the coordinated efforts of a large working party including haematologists, laboratory staff, blood bank, product technicians, CSL, clinical managers, midwives, obstetricians, clerical staff and educators. New practice guidelines, system processes, procedures and staff education needed to be developed and coordinated to support the successful implementation across the Royal Women?s Hospital complex maternity care programme sites. This talk firstly outlines how this implementation was achieved across a complex organisation as is The Royal Women?s Hospital, and the tools that were invaluable in contributing to its consistent success. Examples of materials developed to support staff, from discussion guidelines to materials developed to aid pregnant women to make an informed choice will be shown. The second part of this talk offers an insight into the concerns that pregnant women raise regarding the offering of prophylactic Anti ? D, from a midwifery perspective. What does the consumer think and how can we best serve their needs? What are the practical considerations that help Rh D negative women choose what is best for themselves and their babies? It is hoped that this talk contributes practical information to anyone involved in the delivery of prophylactic Anti-D to pregnant women for the prevention of HDN.

AB  - Bombay phenotype, one of the rare blood group was discovered in India in 1952 by Bhende et al. The frequency of this in Western India is about 1 in 7600. Aim? Our Institute gets referral samples from various hospitals and blood banks with problems in grouping and cross matching for identification of blood group and atypical antibodies. We have identified many Bombay phenotype cases out of these by serological procedures. We undertook molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene on this large series of Bombay phenotypes to see whether the earlier reported mutations on Indian Bombay phenotypes from South Africa and Reunion Island are present in our population or not. Method? Serological confirmations of Bombay phenotypes was done as per standard procedures. Thirty of these serologically confirmed samples were undertaken for molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene. DNA extraction was done from these samples and FUTI(H) gene was amplified by performing nested PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzyme Nae 1 to screen for T 725 G mutation. The digested product was run on agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed. Result? Out of these 30 samples 27 samples were homozygous for T 725 G mutation and one sample was heterozygous for T 725 G mutation which serologically had shown absence of H antigen on red cells and two samples did not show the presence of this mutation. Conclusion? The T 725 G mutation of FUTI(H) gene appears to be the common mutation amongst the Bombay phenotypes detected in India.

AB  - TRALI is a life-threatening complication from the transfusion of a blood product. It is characterised by a clinical constellation of signs and symptoms including dyspnoea, cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, chills and bilateral non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We will discuss its diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment and causative factors. TRALI has been described as a leading cause of transfusion related death. However the incidence of non lethal forms of TRALI is unknown and we will discuss the reasons for this, as well as future directions for the prevention and treatment of this complication.
