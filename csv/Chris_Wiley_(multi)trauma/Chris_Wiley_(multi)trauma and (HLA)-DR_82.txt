AB  - Aim? To find incidence of partial D variants in India and classify them by molecular techniques. Method? Partial D variants were identified by screening blood samples of subjects from Western India by using partial D kit (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service). Molecular characterization of partial D variants was performed using multiplex PCR(M-PCR). Result? The incidence of partial D was 0.15% in the population studied. Forty eight partial D variant samples identified by serological studies were classified by M-PCR. 29% of partial D variants identified were of DFR and 14.6% were of DVI category. 77% of partial D variants identified in Indian population were characterized by M-PCR. Fifteen families of partial D variants were studied and ten more individuals of same variant were identified. All partial D variants were of R1r (DCe/dce) phenotype. The family studies showed partial D hybrid (RHD-CE-D) was linked with Ce gene. Conclusion? DFR was most frequently found partial D in Indian population. Majority of partial D variants characterized in Indian population arise due to substitution of part of RHD exon with RHCE equivalent.

AB  - Adherence of red blood cells (RBCs) to vascular endothelium impairs blood flow, decreases oxygen delivery and leads to vaso-occulusion. RBCs are relatively non-adherent however little is known of how changes to RBCs for transfusion during storage may affect their adherence properties. The aim of this study was to monitor adherence of stored RBCs to vascular endothelium under conditions of continuous flow in vitro. Specifically the influence of RBC storage time and leucocyte burden of stored red cell preparations was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Nonleucocyte- reduced, buffy-coat-reduced and leucocyte-filtered RBC products were prepared according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected at multiple time points until product expiry and perfused across an EC monolayer using a parallel flow chamber mounted to an inverted microscope. Perfusion of RBCs was controlled for shear stress and temperature. RBC-EC interactions were recorded using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The number of RBCs adhering to the EC layer progressively increased with product storage time. RBCs from products stored for 28 and 42?days were significantly more adherent than fresher cells. RBCs from products containing leucocytes were also significantly more adherent to the EC layer on days 28 and 42 of storage than RBCs from leucocyte-reduced products. Our findings indicate that product storage time and leucocyte burden increase the adhesion of RBCs to an EC layer. These results may lead to greater understanding of the interaction of transfused RBCs with recipient endothelium and the biological consequences of this adherence.

AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.

AB  - In July 2003, The Royal Women?s Hospital, Melbourne implemented the use of Prophylactic Rh D Immunoglobulin in obstetrics to help reduce the incidence of Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer in December 2002. Successful implementation required the coordinated efforts of a large working party including haematologists, laboratory staff, blood bank, product technicians, CSL, clinical managers, midwives, obstetricians, clerical staff and educators. New practice guidelines, system processes, procedures and staff education needed to be developed and coordinated to support the successful implementation across the Royal Women?s Hospital complex maternity care programme sites. This talk firstly outlines how this implementation was achieved across a complex organisation as is The Royal Women?s Hospital, and the tools that were invaluable in contributing to its consistent success. Examples of materials developed to support staff, from discussion guidelines to materials developed to aid pregnant women to make an informed choice will be shown. The second part of this talk offers an insight into the concerns that pregnant women raise regarding the offering of prophylactic Anti ? D, from a midwifery perspective. What does the consumer think and how can we best serve their needs? What are the practical considerations that help Rh D negative women choose what is best for themselves and their babies? It is hoped that this talk contributes practical information to anyone involved in the delivery of prophylactic Anti-D to pregnant women for the prevention of HDN.

AB  - Bombay phenotype, one of the rare blood group was discovered in India in 1952 by Bhende et al. The frequency of this in Western India is about 1 in 7600. Aim? Our Institute gets referral samples from various hospitals and blood banks with problems in grouping and cross matching for identification of blood group and atypical antibodies. We have identified many Bombay phenotype cases out of these by serological procedures. We undertook molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene on this large series of Bombay phenotypes to see whether the earlier reported mutations on Indian Bombay phenotypes from South Africa and Reunion Island are present in our population or not. Method? Serological confirmations of Bombay phenotypes was done as per standard procedures. Thirty of these serologically confirmed samples were undertaken for molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene. DNA extraction was done from these samples and FUTI(H) gene was amplified by performing nested PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzyme Nae 1 to screen for T 725 G mutation. The digested product was run on agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed. Result? Out of these 30 samples 27 samples were homozygous for T 725 G mutation and one sample was heterozygous for T 725 G mutation which serologically had shown absence of H antigen on red cells and two samples did not show the presence of this mutation. Conclusion? The T 725 G mutation of FUTI(H) gene appears to be the common mutation amongst the Bombay phenotypes detected in India.

It is characterised by a clinical constellation of signs and symptoms including dyspnoea, cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, chills and bilateral non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We will discuss its diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment and causative factors. TRALI has been described as a leading cause of transfusion related death. However the incidence of non lethal forms of TRALI is unknown and we will discuss the reasons for this, as well as future directions for the prevention and treatment of this complication.

AB  - By comparison with many other procedures in medicine, apheresis for collection of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is a relatively innocuous process. The procedure itself is straightforward, serious adverse effects are rare and many donors experience real benefits. But the apparent simplicity of HPC harvest is misleading as apheresis raises substantial issues of consent, risk assessment and conflict of interest. G-CSF primed apheresis is associated with a number of predictable shortterm risks and unpredictable long-term risks, particularly in those who submit to a second or third donation. Donors are often coerced by the very nature of their relationship to the recipient and by expectations of altruism and are infrequently offered a true choice between bone marrow harvest and peripheral HPC harvest. And, as is the case in solid organ donation, HPC donors may consent to HPC collection for a number of different reasons, some of which may negatively impact upon their experience of apheresis and may give rise to concerns regarding late withdrawal from donation. While these issues are complex enough where competent adults are the donors, they are more difficult again where the ?donor? in not competent, is mentally ill or is a child. In this paper I will review the ethics of apheresis, critique the concept of informed consent and the disproportionate concern with unrelated donors, and consider whether current practices are ethically justifiable.

AB  - Aim? To understand the underlying cause of a cluster of haemolysis-type adverse event (AE) reports received by CSL/ARCBS in patients receiving Intragam? P. Method? The cluster of AE reports were analysed with respect to patient factors (clinical indication, dose, blood group, concomitant medications and blood products, bone marrow reserve), product factors (batch results, production records) and changes in clinical practice (administration protocols, infusion kits). All Intragam P haemolysis related AEs from clinical trials and post-marketing exposure were reviewed, as well as international literature on this subject. Result Sixteen haemolysis type cases were reported to ARCBS/CSL over a 3?month period, ranging from abnormal laboratory test results (positive Coombs test) to clinical symptoms requiring transfusion. Ten of these reports were received in 4?days from 2 Victorian hospitals following the detection of 2 cases, which precipitated a retrospective review that identified additional similar cases. All patients received high dose (doses exceeding 400?600?mg/kg given every 3?4 weeks either in frequency or quantity) and all but one (where evidence suggested an underlying disorder) were of blood group A or AB. Eight patients were recipients of bone marrow transplants. No product or batch related factors or processes likely to have contributed to the haemolysis type AEs were identified. Anti-A and Anti-B titres of all Intragam P batches were investigated and confirmed to be within regulatory approved release specifications and pharmacopoeial limits. Conclusion? Haemolysis type adverse events are a recognised consequence of IVIG administration and are widely discussed in the literature. This investigation has confirmed the association of high dose IVIG in recipients of blood group A or AB and increased risk of haemolysis type adverse events. It also highlighted the possibility of accentuating any consequent anaemia in patients with diminished bone marrow reserve (eg post bone marrow transplant patients). Pre-infusion ABO blood groups should be determined in patients receiving high dose IVIG and their haemoglobin levels monitored in the?days following therapy.

AB  - Since 1980 a register of all blood donors and patients in Western Australia (WA) with clinically significant red cell and platelet antibodies has been maintained by the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS)-Enterprise. The register is updated by ARCBS daily, and prior to 1999 a microfiche version was sent each month to WA transfusion laboratories. In 1999 ARCBS-Enterprise and the Health Department of WA (HDWA) explored the option of transfusion laboratories in public hospitals obtaining immediate electronic access to the register. A secure telnet radio-link was established between a dedicated stand-alone ARCBS server and the HDWA computer network which allowed password protected enquiry-only access to the database by hospital end-users. All end-users are required to sign an agreement to guarantee proper use of the register. The use of this comprehensive database has been successfully incorporated into the pre-transfusion testing protocols of all transfusion laboratories in WA. The benefits of this system include: ??Reduced delay in obtaining phenotyped units for patients with known antibodies. ??Reduced chance of delayed transfusion reactions in patients whose antibody level has fallen below detectable levels. ??A mechanism for ante-natal monitoring and predicting severity of haemolytic disease of the newborn when patients move between care providers during the pregnancy. ARCBS-Enterprise and end-users are passionate about the continuation of this extremely important resource in the future.

AB  - Aim? Borna Virus (BV) is a negative strand RNA virus associated with neurological diseases in animals. An association with human neuro-psychiatric disease has been suggested. The hypothesis investigated was that potentially infectious levels of blood borne BV may be present in humans. Levels of antibody to BV in human and cat sera were studied by ELISA with antigen from infected horse brain, immunofluorescence with infected cells, Western blot and BV epitope peptide-ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies were used in capture ELISAs to measure BV antigen levels (BVAg) in plasma and RT-PCR and sequencing used to investigate relatedness of BV sequences from humans in Australia with European sequences. Result? In 1% of blood donors, free BV antigen was detected in plasma and reactions with BV p24 or p40 antigens confirmed by Western Blot. Circulating immune complexes, antibody to brain-derived antigen and reactions with two of the eight peptides tested were also detected. Strong positive reactions in tests for circulating immune complexes, free plasma antigen and free antibody, were observed in a small number of blood donors. Individuals with high levels of plasma antigen were investigated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Sequence from the p24 region of the Australian human BV genome was 5% different from European reference strains. Conclusion? These data support the hypothesis that a form of BV is endemic in humans in Australia, including potentially infectious levels in blood donors. The extent of difference, in regions other than p24, between BV in Australia and strains infecting animals overseas remains to be clarified.

AB  - Aim? Since 1995, the SCBB has used three protocols to screen CB for contaminating microbes. The protocols differed in the number of culture bottles inoculated and sample volume used. The aim of this study was to compare microbial detection rates for each method. Method? CB units (n?=?9,618) were tested for microbial contamination using BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles (BioMerieux). Of these, 6,836 had 20?ml plasma waste fraction inoculated into adult anaerobic and aerobic bottles (Group A), 365 had 1?ml final stem cell product into an aerobic paediatric bottle (Group B), and 2,417 had 1?ml final product into a paediatric bottle and 10?ml plasma waste fraction into an adult anaerobic bottle (Group C). All bottles were incubated for a minimum of 5?days. Detection rates for microbe contamination were calculated for each group. Result? Microbe detection rates were: Group A ?345/6836 (5.0%), Group B ? 3/365 (0.8%) and Group C ? 66/2417 (2.7%)(p?<?0.0001). Organisms detected by A but not by B (and to a lesser extent C) included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Proprionibacterium. Conclusion? Contamination detection rates differ significantly, depending upon the sample volume and type of culture bottle used. A protocol that uses the recommended sample volume and both anaerobic and anaerobic test bottles is likely to detect the highest number of contaminated units. Testing of a small sample from the final product using only a single paediatric aerobic bottle is likely to miss detection of the majority of anaerobic and some aerobic organisms. Prospective studies to define a standardised method for microbial detection for CB are required.

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.

AB  - The prophylactic use of rhesus immunoglobulin has led to a significant reduction in the incidence of haemolytic disease of the newborn secondary to rhesus alloimmunisation, which now only occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. Despite prophylaxis, antibodies to the D antigen are still the commonest cause of rhesus isoimmunisation. Although now a rare pregnancy disorder rhesus isoimmunisation continues to be a challenging obstetric complication and while the face of this disease has undergone many changes over recent years, the principles of management remain unchanged. Pregnancies at risk of the disease are identified by past obstetric history and the antenatal detection of red cell antibodies with serial measurement of antibody levels. In cases of heterozygous paternity the real risk of fetal disease can be determined using new DNA techniques to determine the fetal blood cell type with tissue obtained from amniocentesis, and now by molecular analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and serum. Sensitised pregnancies are monitored for the development of fetal anaemia. Since its introduction into clinical practise by Liley over 40?years ago, spectral analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis has been the primary method of screening for fetal anaemia. Noninvasive evaluation is now possible with the use of doppler ultrasound to detect changes to fetal blood flow secondary to fetal anaemia, most commonly using the middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound evaluation of fetal haemopoetic organs and for the diagnosis of hydrops. Ultrasound guided intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells remains the treatment for the severely affected fetus. Perinatal survival rates in the non hydropic fetus are reported at over 90% and long term studies have revealed normal neurological outcomes for more than 90% cases.

AB  - Training doctors in transfusion medicine needs a new perspective because the existing knowledge based structure has neither attracted enough doctors nor made the system safer. Safety: Intra-hospital transfusion systems, where most transfusions are delivered by overworked, under skilled PGY1s or PGY2s or nurses, are usually inherently unstable and unsafe. The system itself has to be designed to protect the patient in real hospital life situations. That means competency based training of all staff connected with transfusion and fail safe system design with continuous quality review. Knowledge: The range of knowledge required in a blood centre underscores the difficulty of pigeon holing transfusion medicine in a particular College. More fundamentally, the issue is about what practical benefit the knowledge brings to its owner in terms of jobs or recognition. It includes ?Health assessment of well donors ?Relevant viruses, bacteria and prions, ?Immunology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels and the associated clinical syndromes and their management ?Haematology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels of inflammation and coagulation and the congenital anaemias ?Cytotoxic, immunological or inflammatory effects of chemotherapy and transplantation in malignant haematology ?Resuscitation and immunological or inflammatory conditions in medicine & surgery, with implications for blood products ?Public health particularly for management of public safety, regulatory systems and health economics Transfusion knowledge is broad and often task specific. Developing appropriate task specific experts requires training and research publications to develop credibility and professional networks.

AB  - The use of autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) has increased in Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. A patient, who had a relapse of Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma after a remission of 13?years, required an autologous stem cell transplant. However, he was found to have cold agglutinins. The problem was raised as to whether or not he could have stem cells collected and if they would survive following freezing and storage. A literature search was undertaken and very little information found on stem cell collection in patients with cold agglutinins. Some anecdotal information was reported by colleagues all of which seemed to point to less than favourable outcomes. It was decided to mobilize the patient for stem cell collection and devise a method of collection, storage and transplantation. This paper will give an account of the collection, treatment and progress of the patient, and discuss the procedures involved. It will demonstrate the collaboration between medical, nursing and laboratory staff to achieve a positive patient outcome.

AB  - During their education all Medical Scientists will be exposed at some stage to the intricacies of blood grouping, crossmatching and the investigation of adverse responses to the transfusion of blood and blood products. For some, this exposure engenders fear and trepidation and they cannot wait to get into a discipline that is less demanding and stressful. For others the discipline is a challenge that allows them to use their problem solving skills and to experience the adrenal rush of responding to urgent requests for blood from theater or casualty to help save a bleeding patient. As in all disciplines of Laboratory Medicine, technology, especially information communication technology (ICT), is having a significant impact upon how blood transfusion science is being practiced. However unlike all other disciplines, blood transfusion is also subject to the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Authority which impose a broad range of safety requirements on the products that Medical Scientist work with and release for patients. Whilst some testing technology such as column agglutination and ICT is seemingly simplifying the preparation and release of products for patients, developments in other areas are opening up new challenges. The creation of Cell Therapies laboratories in a number of the major hospitals in Australia is the latest development in transfusion practice. Could the next stage in our progression be the incorpor ation of the hospital blood bank into the Cell and Tissue Therapies Laboratory, where the testing and processing of all cell and tissue products is undertaken under the one coordinating body. This presentation will review the education and training of Medical Scientists at RMIT University for the discipline of Transfusion Science and present a perspective on where future directions in our educational programs might go.

AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.
