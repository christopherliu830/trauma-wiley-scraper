AB  - Covalent binding of hapten to skin protein is required for sensitisation. It has long been postulated that only sensitising chemicals will modify skin protein(s), whereas non-sensitisers and irritants do not. To pinpoint the amino acid residues involved in such modifications, we employed mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics techniques. Known sensitisers, non-sensitisers and irritants were incubated with human serum albumin (HSA). Modified HSA samples were digested by trypsin and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI-MS) analyses were conducted on the digests. Nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) analyses were conducted on modified peptides purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HSA sequence was mapped and modified peptides identified. In HSA samples incubated with non-sensitisers and irritants there was no change compared to HSA incubated without chemical. Modified peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced using ES-MS/MS. Lysine, histidine and cysteine were found to be involved in covalent modifications by the sensitising chemicals used. A double adduct of one sensitiser (MCI) on His 338 of HSA molecule was also identified. More sensitisers need to be investigated to establish similarities between covalent protein modifications of chemically related compounds. The aim is to develop an assay for protein binding ability of chemicals which could form part of a battery of tests needed to replace animal testing for sensitisation potential.

AB  - Risk assessments of chemicals are key issues in our live. Prior to industrialisation, risk assessments based on individual experience, for the allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) for instance, after contact with allergic plants affecting the skin exposed. Today, the risk to get an ADC becomes more and more important, because of increasing contact to new chemicals because of frequent contact with consumer products. Therefore sufficient test systems are required, appropriate to estimate the sensitisation potential of individual chemicals. To be able to predict weak sensitisers, adjuvants were simultaneously injected to test animals to booster their allergic reactions. One of the most well known test method, is the maximisation test in guinea pigs according to Magnusson and Kligman. Regulatory authorities have required this method for chemical classification, as well as for estimating the risk to get sensitised when dermaly exposed. Beside the advantages of these guinea pig studies, the limitations became prominent not only in respect to ethical aspects, but also because of the lack to quantify the sensitisation potency of chemicals. To be able to perform accurate, realistic risk assessments, the knowledge of potency is becoming mandatory, especially when sensitive test methods are used. Based on the possibility to measure the biological response during induction of sensitisation, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) gets popular. Today, this test is officially accepted by regulators to give information on skin sensitisation potential. With the quantitative approach on potency, risk assessment of ACD will become much more reliable and useful for Men.

AB  - When considering the allergenic activity of a compound not only the possibility of bioactivation by skin metabolism but also air activation by autoxidation must be taken into account. Natural compounds (terpenes) easily oxidize at air exposure. They are found in products that are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) i.e. colophony and fragrances. The introduction of oxygen enables the molecules to form antigens with skin proteins via a nucleophilic- electrophilic interaction or via a radical reaction. The latter mechanism seems to be important since the primary oxidation products, the hydroperoxides, are the most potent sensitizers formed. Oxidative decomposition at air exposure resulting in allergenic oxidation products is observed also for other common compounds e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols used as surfactants. It is important to test the patient with the offending compounds for diagnosis of ACD. A negative diagnosis can be due to failure in testing with the correct substances. In the case of air activated compounds, testing should not be performed with the pure substances but rather with the oxidation mixture or the most sensitizing oxidation products (the hydroperoxides). We have in multicenter-studies shown that the common fragrance terpenes, limonene and linalool, are frequent sensitizers when oxidized. This is a challenge in clinical practice since such patch test materials are not easily standardized. Compounds, easily activated at air exposure, should be prevented from oxidative decomposition by addition of antioxidants and proper handling and storage. More research is needed in this area.

AB  - We have previously reported that, with suitable training and experience, skin irritation reactions can be graded visually with a high degree of sensitivity and precision. The objective of the work presented is to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of the grading of skin irritation reactions by subjective visual assessment. In the present work, we have recorded a wide range of relatively minor skin irritation reactions using a high quality digital camera. The skin reactions recorded have then been graded by independent observers according to their appearance on a computer monitor. The results show that very subtle degrees of both erythema and skin dryness can be accurately described by trained skin graders in a reliable and reproducible manner. Examples of the grading scales and sensitivity of scoring will be shown. We conclude that visual scoring, when conducted well, represents a rapid and accurate method for the assessment of minor degrees of skin irritation. The present evidence, taken in combination with previously presented information on bioengineering techniques, leads us to the conclusion that visual assessment is both an adequate and a robust technique, delivering information of the quality necessary for safety assessment of consumer products.

AB  - Objective:? To determine the efficacy of a topical, MAS063D, in managing the clinical signs and symptoms of experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Methods:? Two patches of ICD were created using sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in 20 consenting volunteers. MAS063D was applied to one patch and a vehicle-only control to the other. Measurements were taken at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours as follows: blood flow volume (BFV); skin color (a*); transepidermal water loss (TEWL); patient?s view of itch and visual scoring. Results: The objective measurements of BFV, a* and TEWL all showed statistically significant benefits of MAS063D over the vehicle-only control. BFV and a* were significantly better at all time points (p?=?0.046, p?=?0.045 respectively at 72 hours) and TEWL at 48 and 72 hours (p?=?0.02 at 72 hours). MAS063D demonstrated benefit in the visual scoring of irritant contact dermatitis that was not statistically significant. Patient-assessed itch was low at baseline; significant improvement was neither expected nor demonstrated although a small benefit of MAS063D over vehicle was seen in the mean values. Conclusions:? BFV and a* are both good indicators of local erythema. TEWL is a good indicator of skin integrity. MAS063D therefore demonstrated statistically significant benefit over vehicle on three clinically meaningful outcomes of SLS-induced ICD, and therefore may benefit irritant contact dermatitis.

AB  - Objectives:? To identify substances and tonnage data for use for hair dyes registered in Europe. To predict the sensitization potential of each substance and to rank the substances due to their sensitization potential. Further to group the substances in clusters based on their physical chemical properties with a cluster analysis. Methods:? The Inventory list of Cosmetics Ingredients (INCI), new regulation on cosmetics, tonnage data for use and Toxnet were used to identify and quantify the hair dyes. Salts were disregarded. A QSAR (Qualitative structure-activity relationship) model called TOPS-MODE, based on local lymph node assay (LLNA) data and physical chemical properties were used to predict the sensitization potential and make a cluster analysis. Results:? Out of 315 hair dye substances 229 meet the inclusion criteria. Most of the hair dye substances 75% were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Less were predicted to be weak 22% and only a small part 3% were predicted to be extremely weak or non sensitizing. The 8 most used hair dye substances were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Ppd is the most used hair dye allergy marker but some azodyes were predicted to be more potent than para-phenylenediamine (ppd). Conclusions:? Most hair dye substances are predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers, which explain why some people gets hair dye dermatitis. A patch test series with potent, much used azodyes, might prove useful in diagnosing ppd-negative patients, with hair dye allergy. The cluster analysis grouped the substances which can be helpful choosing substances for clinical patch test.

AB  - Iodopropynylbutyl carbamate (IPBC)is a preservative that has been increasingly used for skin care products and cosmetics within the last years and the first cases of contact sensitization have meanwhile been reported. Therefore, a surveillance for IPBC contact allergy is now necessary. Our study was aimed to find out a suitable test concentration of IPBC for this purpose. The data 8106 patients tested by 23 centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK)in the time from May 2001 to July 2003 with IPBC in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.5% were retrospectively evaluated. Criteria considered to determine the optimal test concentration of IPBC were the reaction index, the positivity ratio, the rate of crescendo reactions, and the relation of IPBC-reactions with MOAHLFA-indices, with irritant reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate, and with positive reactions to the most common standard contact allergens and 4 other preservatives. For statistical evaluations the exact McNemar test was applied and odds ratios were calculated according to the profile likelihood method, as derived from logistic regression analyses. The rate of positive reactions to IPBC increased from 0.5% with IPBC 0.1% to 1.7% with IPBC 0.5%, but there was a problem with sensitivity or specificity with both of these 2 concentrations. Therefore, we focused on IPBC 0.2%(0.8% positive reactions) and IPBC 0.3%(1.3% positive reactions) for further detailed analyses. An evaluation of the related parameters revealed that with IPBC 0.2% as compared to IPBC 0.3% a higher percentage of crescendo reactions, a higher reaction index, a lower number of doubtful reactions, a plausible association of positive reactions with reactions to other preservatives, nd no association with a pronounced skin irritability was found. In conclusion, we recommend to start with IPBC 0.2% for patch testing of all persons with contact dermatitis that may be related to preservatives.

AB  - Objectives:? Contact allergy to grease is a rare cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis and therefore this case is presented. Thin layer chromatograms were used for patch-testing and helped identify the contact sensitizer in the grease. Methods:? Patch-testing, thin layer chromatography and GC-MS. Case report: A previously healthy man working in an industry where brakes for trains were produced presented in the clinic after having developed a rash in the face, on the neck, volar aspects of the arms and dorsum of the hands. The patient's work in part consisted of putting grease on metal parts. The patient was patch-tested with our standard series, a MWF series and materials from work. He tested positively to the grease. A visit to the industry showed a much greater exposure to grease than was suspected. The investigation that followed was performed to identify the sensitizer in the grease. Thin layer chromatography was performed and the patient was tested with chromatograms. Results:? The patient had positive reactions to several allergens in the series including rubber sensitizers of the PPD type and disperse orange 3. A positive reaction was obtained to a spot on the chromatogram of the grease and investigation by GC-MS identified N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as the sensitizer. Conclusions:? This case underlines the importance of patch testing with work materials and visiting the work environment. A rare case of contact allergy to grease was found and patch-testing with thin layer chromatograms helped identify the allergen, N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine. The identification of the allergen was made by GC-MS.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of the study was to get information on the chemical exposure and the prevalence of skin and respiratory symptoms among Finnish machinists. Methods:? A cross-sectional study was carried out on a population of 961 Finnish machinists. Skin and respiratory symptoms, atopy, exposure at work, etc. were inquired by a telephone interview. Working conditions were assessed and the data were combined with the data from the interview. Technical office personnel in the same companies were used as a control group. Results:? A third of the interviewees reported prolonged rhinitis. A fifth had continuous or relapsing hand or forearm dermatitis, cough, phlegm production or eye symptoms. Wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal symptoms, or relapsing low fever were reported by 8?2%. 5% reported having asthma. In total, 35% of the machinists considered the skin or respiratory symptoms as work-related. Conclusion:? This study shows that work-related skin and respiratory symptoms are common among machinists in Finland. Those reporting symptoms have been examined in more detail at FIOH. New results of the statistical analysis and medical investigations will be presented.

AB  - Contact dermatitis among hairdressers is common and is one of the most frequent occupational dematoses due to continual exposure to water, detergents, hair dyes, permanent waves and metal equipment. Use of individual protection systems ? as gloves ? is considered a good measure of prevention. Few data exist about the real permeation resistance (PR) of gloves, also in term of time of PR. We tested two types of djsposable latex gloves different by thickness and density of the manufacture material. We used a permeation cell composed of two separated parts: in the upper part we introduced the hair colouring formulation and in the lower one the collection medium (NaHSO3 1% in water); the two parts were separated by a portion of the glove material. A 100 microL volume of the collection medium was collected and injected onto a HPLC apparatus after 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours. A diode array detector was utilised selecting two wavelengths in the UV range (240 and 275?nm) with a linear concentration gradient up to 60% of methanol/acetonitril mixture. We can simultaneously analyse 9 oxidation dyes and the detection limits were sufficient to determine these substances at very low concentrations. We obtained respectively a breakthrough time less than 24 hours for the lower thickness glove and of over 24 hours for the other one; the latex gloves are suitable for prevent the skin contamination during the preparation of the colourings mixture in the hairdresser activity. The obtained data show those latex gloves, of both thickness, have a very high PR. On the other hand, the use of latex gloves has been associated with the more frequent recognition of immediate-type hypersensitivity responses related to latex products. The prosecution of the study will evaluate the PR of latex-free gloves.

AB  - In dentistry there are many potential allergens and irritants. Patients may have an adverse reaction in minutes, hours or days after dental procedures. Dentists use many metals e.g. mercury in amalgam restorations, which may give an oral lichenoid eruption, and gold, and platinum group metals for inlays, crowns or bridges, which may give allergic reactions. Dentists, for dentures, use acrylate resins extensively and traces of which can give rise to allergic symptoms, though most cases are not ?allergic? in origin. Dental personnel have a high frequency of occupational skin problems and may complain of hand dermatitis or itching, facial eruptions or respiratory symptoms. With regard to oral lichenoid lesions, the proportion of patients allergic to mercury on patch testing varies according to series, from 67% down to 8%. In some cases, the mechanism can be irritant as well as allergic. Gold can cause lichenoid eruption or other changes. The role of palladium is still very difficult to judge. Cheilitis is particularly difficult to investigate, as there are many causes. The aetiology is irritant in 33%, allergic contact dermatitis in 25% and atopic eczema in 20%. Benzoates, antioxidants or flavourings in foods sometimes cause lip swelling. Hand dermatitis is common in dental personnel. Common causes are irritancy, latex contact urticaria, and allergic contact dermatitis to acrylates, Myroxolon, fragrance, thiuram and colophonium. In the investigation of reactions in dental patients many things need to be considered and often the cause is not related to the dental materials suspected.

AB  - Germall 115 and Germall II are well known cosmetic preservatives, widely used as such since the early 1970?s and 1980?s, respectively. This investigation reveals that they have mistakenly been regarded as pure chemical entities with specific structures by the majority of the chemical society. In fact Germall 115 and Germall II both consist of complex mixtures of numerous and fast degradable allantoin-formaldehyde condensation products and may not even contain the conventionally assigned chemical structures of imidazolidinyl urea (Germall 115) and diazolidinyl urea (Germall II). Equilibrium between different structures may be formed in different cosmetic formulations/test materials. This may have led to the discrepancies in the literature: Are the Germalls themselves sensitizers or are the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde release? The identification and structure assignment of (4-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4-yl)-urea (HU) will be presented, as it is the major and chemically stable degradation product of both Diazolidinyl urea and Imidazolidinyl urea. A guinea pig maximization test has been performed to determine the potential of HU to induce delayed contact hypersensibility in guinea pigs. Separate chemically stable TRUE Test patches containing the mixtures have shown clinical efficacy.

AB  - Linalool is one of the most frequently used fragrance chemicals in scented products and a large population is exposed to it. It is therefore important to study the allergenic properties of linalool, and the effect of autoxidation. Objectives:? To study the autoxidation of linalool and identify formed oxidation products, to investigate the impact of autoxidation on the sensitizing capacity and to study the frequency of contact allergy to oxidized linalool among consecutive dermatitis patients. Methods:? Linalool was air-exposed and the degradation followed with GC. Oxidation products were identified with GC-MS and NMR. Pure linalool, 2 different states of oxidized linalool and 3 oxidation products were tested for their sensitizing capacity in the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Consecutive dermatitis patients were patch-tested with oxidized linalool and a fraction of oxidized linalool. Results:? Linalool started to decompose immediately when air-exposed. Several oxidation products were identified among which 3 (2 hydroperoxides and an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) contain structural features that make them potential allergens. LLNA showed that the 3 oxidation products were moderate allergens, and that the sensitizing potential of linalool increased with longer air-exposure times. In the patch-test study positive reactions were observed to oxidized linalool in 1.65% of the patients. Conclusions:? The extensively used fragrance chemical linalool is not allergenic in itself. The autoxidation process that takes place at air-exposure leads to the formation of sensitizing oxidation products. The frequency of consecutive patients reacting to oxidized linalool shows that the experimental findings are clinically important.

AB  - Objectives:? This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between QoL scores for patients with ACD and confounders, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Methods:? A total of 428 subjects with ACD were, at varying times after diagnosis, mailed a QoL questionnaire modified from Skindex-16 to include an additional 5 items pertaining to occupational impact. The QoL scores were analyzed by gender, race, age, and occupation to ascertain factors that impact QoL in subjects with ACD. Results:? Three of the four confounders examined have a significant connection with QoL in patients with ACD. Non-Caucasians had significantly worse QoL scores than Caucasians within the functioning scale, and had more emotional distress secondary to their disease. There were no statistically significant gender-related differences in QoL scores, although females felt a higher degree of embarrassment and depression. Age significantly impacted items within the functioning and occupational scales, with subjects nearing retirement age and older reporting better QoL. In contrast, younger subjects, especially those in the 5th decade, were more likely to have difficulty pursuing daily activities, have more fear that they might need to leave their jobs, and have more concern for their financial futures. Office workers, students, and homemakers were primarily diagnosed with non-occupational ACD, while more industrial, health care and other wet workers suffered from occupationally related ACD. In the analyses of QoL by occupation, industrial workers reported significantly more impaired QoL than subjects in other professions.

AB  - Objectives: Persistent post-occupational dermatitis (PPOD) was mentioned by Wall and Gebauer in 1991 to describe ongoing skin disease precipitated by occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). There has been little formal recognition or clarification of this condition. Methods: Approximately 1600 records from our Occupational Dermatology Clinic were searched to identify likely cases. PPOD was difficult to diagnose as relatively few patients had been reviewed after initial assessment. Results: A number of patients with reasonably clear histories of persistent occupational contact dermatitis were identified, which followed either irritant or allergic occupational contact dermatitis. These included a 57?yr old male who worked with photographic chemicals, a 51?yr old female food handler and a 25?yr old female food handler who were all diagnosed with irritant contact dermatitis and yet experienced persistent dermatitis even after avoiding the irritants that were associated with causing their dermatitis. A 51?yr old process worker allergic to acrylates, a 28?yr old laboratory worker allergic to rubber accelerators and coconut diethanolamide in her hand wash and a 48?yr old epoxy applicator allergic to epoxy resins experienced recurrent dermatitis for years after avoiding their causative allergens, although with gradual decrease in the frequency of outbreaks of dermatitis. Unfortunately, many patients experienced difficulties with workers? compensation because the persistence of their dermatitis was thought by some medical examiners negate its work-relatedness. Conclusion: There needs to be greater recognition and understanding of PPOD. We are planning to follow-up patients from our clinic to better study and define this condition.

AB  - Objective:? A possible contact allergy to herbal teas, in particular those derived from the Asteraceae plant family, was investigated in patients allergic to sesquiterpene lactones (SL). Method:? Twenty patients with a contact allergy to SL were recalled and patch-tested with aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts of 8 different herbal teas based on Asteraceae plants as well as with parthenolide and other SL. Results:? In 18/20 patients with SL allergy there were positive test reactions to the Asteraceae teas, mainly to those based on German chamomile, dandelion and milfoil. Among the SL, parthenolide was the most frequent co-reactor. Conclusion:? Most patients with a contact allergy to SL are allergic to commercial teas derived from the Asteraceae plant family as well.

AB  - Plastic gloves are made of polymers including polyvinylchloride, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene and polyvinylacetate. Additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, UV light absorbers, fungicides, bactericides, flame retardants and colourants are added to the polymer, and these are potential allergens. Contact allergy to plastic gloves is rare. The allergen responsible for the sensitization usually remains unknown. An organic pigment, Irgalite Orange F2G, and bisphenol A have both caused contact allergy from household-type PVC gloves. 1 patient with allergic contact dermatitis from his PVC gloves reacted also to tricresyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate, chemicals known to be used as plasticizers in PVC. A plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), caused 1 case of contact urticaria from the vinyl chloride slip guard of cotton gloves. 1 patient with contact urticaria from his polyethylene gloves reacted to 3 antioxidants, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and di-tertiary butyl phenol of the gloves on scratch testing. We report 3 additional cases of allergic contact dermatitis from PVC gloves due to bisphenol A. 2 of the patients reacted also to para-tertiary butyl catechol, a polymerization inhibitor in PVC. In chemical analysis, the connection between sensitization to para-tertiary butyl catechol and the use of vinyl gloves could not be proven. We analysed 16 brands of disposable PVC gloves for medical use, covering at least 80% of the Finnish market. We found a very small amount of bisphenol A in 1 brand, and no para-tertiary butyl catechol in any of the gloves. However, bisphenol A should be remembered as a possible allergen in PVC gloves.

AB  - Objective:? To assess the cumulative incidence and characteristics of self reported skin disease in hydrotherapists. Methods:? Hydrotherapists, who had completed a hydrotherapy training course answered a questionnaire in reference to newly appeared skin disease. Data were analyzed statistically. Results:? 190 subjects presently working as hydrotherapists were studied. Of them 75.8% were female and 24.2% were male. 80% of the hydrotherapists worked up to 10 000 cumulative hours defined by the formula: working hours per weeks ? number of weeks per year ? years of work in the pool. 85 of the subjects (45%) reported on the development of skin disease for the first time after starting work at the swimming pool. 21 (11.8%) had a preexisting skin disease. The most frequent symptoms included pruritus, burning, stinging, erythematous patches and xerotic skin on the extremities, trunk and folds. A statistically significant relationship between the cumulative working time and the incidence of dermatological pathology compatible with contact dermatitis was found. Conclusions:? The incidence of self reported skin diseases, developing for the first time or due to exacerbation of preexisting dermatological conditions, in hydrotherapists working in swimming pools is high. Statistically significant relationship between the cumulative hours of immersion in the pool and the incidence of the dermatological pathology was observed suggesting a dose response relationship between exposure and effect.

AB  - Skin problems are often regarded as part of the job in wet occupations. Bad habits as not using protective gloves and moisturizers are often justified by the workers and ignored by the management. To change habits at the shop floor, involvement of the whole organisation is necessary. The objective of an intervention in 6 gut-cleaning departments was to implement good habits by establishing a safety management system to manage skin risk. Local teams with representatives from all levels of the organisation were trained to run the process. Each team included 2?5 gut-cleaners, who should embody good habits and supervise their colleagues. Implementation research studies evaluate the understanding and acceptance of the intervention at the workplace and the association of the implementation and the reduction of work related diseases. Data are collected from questionnaires, interviews, written documents, etc. The change after one year in the frequency of eczema on hands and forearms within the past 3 months, varied in the 6 departments from a minor increase to a 2/3 reduction. 3 months after the start of the intervention the gut-cleaners in the team were asked to grade their expectations for success on a scale from 1 to 10; 10 being the optimum. The average grade varied from 4,8 to 10, indicating very different local expectations to the colleagues? acquisition of new habits. Further data and analysis will show if there is a covariance between the local changes in eczema frequency and the degree of implementation.

AB  - Introduction:? A recent survey of the UK printing industry found a prevalence of 11% of occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), much higher than previously identified. Objective:? This pilot study aimed to evaluate risk reduction strategies derived from recommendations of a literature review of preventive intervention studies and a series of focus groups of printers and observations of printers undertaking their normal duties. Methods:? Four interventions were evaluated: (1) Provision of gloves of the correct size/type, plus use of an after-work skin cream; (2) Provision of information; (3) Provision of skin checks; (4) Development of best practice skin care policy. Each intervention was evaluated in two companies over a three-month period, at the end of which printers and managers were interviewed as to the effectiveness and acceptability of each intervention. Results:? Although this pilot study was short, all interventions were acceptable to some extent. The prevalence of frank dermatitis fell over the study period, particularly in intervention (3). Intervention (1) achieved an improvement of awareness in both management and workforce and an increase in the use of both gloves and cream. Intervention (2) highlighted problems of dissemination and the need for relevant information in an appropriate format. However. no single intervention was completely effective. Conclusions:? This qualitative research approach forms an essential first stage to improving understanding of ways in which OCD may be reduced among workers in the printing industry, and points towards the need for further testing of preventive strategies in larger-scale intervention trials, in printing and other industries.
