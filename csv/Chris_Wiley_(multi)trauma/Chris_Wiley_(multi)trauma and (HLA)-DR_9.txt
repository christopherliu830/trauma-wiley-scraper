AB  - Abstract A considerable amount of retrospective data is available that describes putative mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, there is still very little knowledge available that documents the properties of a MSC in its native environment. Although the precise identity of MSCs remains a challenge, further understanding of their biological properties will be greatly advanced by analyzing the mechanisms that govern their self-renewal and differentiation potential. This review begins with the current state of knowledge on the biology of MSCs, specifically with respect to their existence in the adult organism and postulation of their biological niche. While MSCs are considered suitable candidates for cell-based strategies owing to their intrinsic capacity to self-renew and differentiate, there is currently little information available regarding the molecular mechanisms that govern their stem cell potential. We propose here a model for the regulation of MSC differentiation, and recent findings regarding the regulation of MSC differentiation are discussed. Current research efforts focused on elucidating the mechanisms regulating MSC differentiation should facilitate the design of optimal in vitro culture conditions to enhance their clinical utility cell and gene therapy.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this work was the fabrication and characterization of bioactive glass?poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) composite scaffolds mimicking the topological features of cancellous bone. Porous multilayer PLGA?CEL2 composite scaffolds were innovatively produced by a pressure-activated microsyringe (PAM) method, a CAD/CAM processing technique originally developed at the University of Pisa. In order to select the optimal formulations to be extruded by PAM, CEL2?PLGA composite films (CEL2 is an experimental bioactive SiO2?P2O5?CaO?MgO?Na2O?K2O glass developed at Politecnico di Torino) were produced and mechanically tested. The elastic modulus of the films increased from 30 to?>?400?MPa, increasing the CEL2 amount (10?50?wt%) in the composite. The mixture containing 20?wt% CEL2 was used to fabricate 2D and 3D bone-like scaffolds composed by layers with different topologies (square, hexagonal and octagonal pores). It was observed that the increase of complexity of 2D topological structures led to an increment of the elastic modulus from 3 to 9?MPa in the composite porous monolayer. The elastic modulus of 3D multilayer scaffolds was intermediate (about 6.5?MPa) between the values of the monolayers with square and octagonal pores (corresponding to the lowest and highest complexity, respectively). MG63 osteoblast-like cells and periosteal-derived precursor cells (PDPCs) were used to assess the biocompatibility of the 3D bone-like scaffolds. A significant increase in cell proliferation between 48?h and 7?days of culture was observed for both cell phenotypes. Moreover, qRT?PCR analysis evidenced an induction of early genes of osteogenesis in PDPCs. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The use of adult stem cells to regenerate damaged tissue circumvents the moral and technical issues associated with the use of those from an embryonic source. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be isolated from a variety of tissues, most commonly from the bone marrow, and, although they represent a very small percentage of these cells, are easily expandable. Recently, the use of MSC has provided clinical benefit to patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, graft-versus-host disease and myocardial infarction. The cellular cues that enabled the MSC to be directed to the sites of tissue damage and the mechanisms by which MSC then exert their therapeutic effect are becoming clearer. This review discusses the relative therapeutic importance of the ability of MSC to differentiate into multiple cell lineages or stimulate resident or attracted cells via a paracrine mode of action. It also reviews recent findings that MSC home to damaged tissues in a similar, but somewhat distinct, manner to that of leucocytes via the utilisation of adhesion molecules, such as selectins and integrins, and chemokines and their receptors in a manner reminiscent of leucocytes trafficking from the blood stream to inflammatory sites.
