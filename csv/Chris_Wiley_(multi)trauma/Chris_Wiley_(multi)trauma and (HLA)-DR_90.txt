AB  - Introduction:? Cutaneous adverse reactions from topical or systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are frequently described. New cases of adverse reactions from NSAIDs are reported, but the most frequently involved are drugs as ketoprofen or piroxicam. We report a case of photoallergical contact dermatitis from diclophenac with possible cross reaction to aceclophenac. Material and methods:? A 63-year-old-man, allergic to penicillin, developed eczematous lesions on hands and face, after applying a medicament containing diclophenac. Patch test and photopatch test (5?J/cm2) were performed with a photoallergen battery (Chemotechnique diagnostics?), a NSAIDs battery (Aristegui lab.?) and aceclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. Readings were done at 48 and 96 hours in epicutaneous test and at 24 and 72 hours in photoallergic study, following the ICDRG criteria. Results:? The results of photoallergic study were as follows: diclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. and aceclophenac 10% in pet. positive at 24 and 72 hours. The remaining compounds of the NSAIDs battery were negative. Conclusions:? Diclophenac is a NAIDs derived from aryl alcanoic acid group used both topically and systemically in Spain. Some adverse reactions have been reported as exanthema, urticaria, eczema or Steven-Johnson?s syndrome. We have found only two cases reported as photosensitization from diclophenac. In one of them, the clinical lesion was described as a granuloma annular-like and photoallergic study was negative. We report a photocontact dermatitis from diclophenac with positive photopatch test. Photopatch test positive to aceclophenac may be explained as a cross reaction among group.

AB  - Classification and labeling of substances and preparations within the EU is made in accordance with the criteria as written out in Directive 67/548/EEC (?the substances directive?) and Directive 1999/45/EC (?the preparation directive? setting general concentration limits for preparations containing substances classified under 67/548). The basis for the criteria concerning hazard for skin sensitisation is based on practical experience showing that the substance or preparation is capable to induce a sensitization by skin contact in a substantial number of persons (appropriate patch testing or epidemiological data); or where positive tests from appropriate animal testing are available. Recently at the EU level and currently continued at the OECD, there is an expert discussion on the appropriateness to make potency considerations of skin sensitisers. The experts evaluate the possibility to set specific concentration limits for induction skin sensitisers contained in preparations. These limits would then give the possibility to classify such preparations better mirroring the reality than the current general limits given in the preparations directive. The first measure to prevent the hazard when a chemical or preparation fulfills the criteria to be classified as a skin sensitiser, is through the labeling indicating the standardized risk phrase: ?May cause sensitization by skin contact?, which also must be followed with an adequate safety advice. The classification of a substance has further consequences in other legal instruments on EU level leading to additional risk management measures.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to review the European legislation concerning the use of textile dyes. It is known that different dyes of different classes can be sensitizing and cause allergic contact dermatitis for both textile workers and consumers. The European Union has created restraining directives regarding the manufacture and distribution of potentially dangerous products, such as aromatic amines. A specific scientific committee of EU stated that the carcinogenic capacity of some azo dyes is related to chemical releasing of aromatic amines (groups MAK III; A1; A2). In this paper, focus will be centred on the latest European Union Directives in this matter and the prohibition of some azo dyes in textile industry.

AB  - Objective:? To study the usefulness of a trivalent gold salt, gold trichloride (GTC), as a marker for contact allergy to gold. Method: Patients patch test positive or negative to gold sodium thiosulfate (GSTS), 13 subjects of each, were patch-tested with dilution series of GTC and equimolar concentrations of GSTS; each series started at 0.03?mM and contained 5 steps. In order to avoid false positive and false negative test reactions the salts were dissolved in an alkaline buffer and placed on van der Bend? polypropene chambers. The tests were applied for 48?h; reading was blinded and performed on D3 and D7. Results:? Allergic reactions were observed in 9/13 gold-allergic patients with GSTS and in 2/13 with GTC. The sum of positive reactions was 18 with GSTS and 5 with GTC. Primary toxic reactions: 0 with GSTS and 2 with GTC among the gold-allergic patients; and 2 with GSTS and 1 with GTC among the controls. Conclusion:? GTC can elicit positive patch test reactions in patients with gold allergy but to a lesser degree than GSTS. GTC cannot be recommended for patch testing.

AB  - Background:? Several lines of evidence indicate a potential association between oral lichen-reactions and the presence of dental amalgam fillings. Aim:? We examined the relation between oral lichen reaction cases and the site of amalgam fillings in the oral cavity. Methods:? We conducted an observational study in 5 consecutive patients who had OLR and underwent to dental amalgam replacement. The number of total amalgam surfaces and OLR sites were charted. Saliva samples were taken and levels of total mercury were measured by CV-AAS method. Also we did patch-testing with dental series in all patients. Results: Our observational study revealed that oral lichen reactions may not have an association with the physical proximity the mercury tooth fillings. Unexpectedly, we noted a complete remission in patients with OLR (n?=?5). The patients with OLR presented allergies to mercury (n?=?4) or gold (n?=?1). All patients were negative for HCV/HBV and they had not been taking any drug-induced lichenoid mucositis. Findings:? In this case report series no topographical association was found between OLR and the dental amalgam fillings. All OLR cases were in full recovery after total amalgam removal within three months. Saliva mercury concentrations were significantly elevated in all subjects. After amalgam removal the mercury levels were undetectable. We suggest that dental amalgam removal is important therapeutic option in OLR cases even if the lichenoid lesions are not adjacent to dental amalgam restorations.

AB  - Sensitivity to fragrance ingredients is acknowledged as a common and clinically important problem in Europe. Aims of the project: The ?fragrance chemical allergy? project (QLK4-CT-1999-01558) funded by the European Commission under the Quality of Life programme was to increase the safety standard of fragrance compounds and provide more transparency in the data available, and to develop prevention of fragrance chemical allergy in non sensitised (primary prevention) and in already sensitised (secondary prevention) individuals. Primary prevention: A strategy for the rapid identification of sensitizers in complex mixture has been developed and 2 major sensitizers of oak moss, namely atranol and chloroatranol have been identified. Oxidation products, formed during storage and handling of common terpenes, have been shown to be involved in the sensitizing potential of fragrances. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships have been developed for 2 classes of aldehydes often present as perfume ingredients. Major fragrance allergens relevant to hand eczema have been identified. Secondary prevention: A new fragrance mix ?FMII? has been developed as a diagnostic tool for patients allergic to fragrances. An elicitation thresholds methodology has been established and validated with some important new sensitizers. The substitution strategy of sensitizing fragrance chemicals by analogues has been studied in the case of isoeugenol and demonstrated to be non relevant to consumer safety. Expected applications of results: Data generated by this project will be used as basis for decisions to improve consumer safety such as product labelling of the most frequent sensitizing materials, making guidelines for the evaluation of safe concentration limits, making rules of handling and best-before-date and banning of the most sensitizing compounds in consumer products. Participants: University Strasbourg (F), NIWL Stockholm (S), Unilever SEAC (UK), University Copenhagen (DK), University Witten/Herdecke (D), King?s College London (UK), NERI Roskilde (DK), University Odense (DK), University Malmö(S), University Leuven (B).

AB  - Objective:? The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of the perfusion of the contact hypersensitivity response as measured by the laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) technique was associated with immunological parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods:? Urushiol was applied on one of the forearms of volunteers for 48 hours while the other forearm served as a control. Twenty-four hours later, measurements of perfusion of the patch test sites were performed with the LDPI technique. To determine whether there was a correlation with immunological parameters associated with human contact hypersensitivity, suction blisters were produced at the test sites. Blister fluid was removed and examined for the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Results:? There was an extremely close correlation between the magnitude of the contact hypersensitivity response as measured by the imaged perfusion and the level of IL-8 in the blister fluid (r?=?1.00). Compared to subjects with visually positive urushiol reactions, patients who failed to develop urushiol contact hypersensitivity despite repeated exposures to that substance had both greatly diminished perfusion and blister fluid IL-8 levels. Conclusion:? The results indicate that LDPI is a sensitive method of quantifying contact hypersensitivity reactions in humans and that the magnitude of the measurements with this technique correlates extremely well with cutaneous cytokine levels that have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of contact hypersensitivity.

AB  - Background:? Some types of cosmetic products such as creams and soaps are commonly used several times a day, especially in occupational use-situations. Little is known about how the daily frequency of application of an allergen in a product influences the allergic response. Objectives:? This study investigates the allergic responses elicited in pre-sensitised individuals when exposed to a specific amount of allergen applied either in 1 application per day or distributed over 4 applications per day. As model allergen is used the cosmetic preservative methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN). Patients/Methods: 19 contact allergic individuals and 12 controls participated in a double-blind, randomized repeated open application test (ROAT) using two coded aqua/ethanol (80:20) solutions preserved with 100?ppm and 400?ppm MDBGN, respectively. 12?cm2 areas on the lower arms were applied 2 drops either once daily of the 400?ppm solution or 4 times a day for the 100?ppm solution. Results:? Most patients developed dermatitis following application of approximately equal amounts of MDBGN on both arms not distinguishing whether the allergen was applied as a 400?ppm solution once daily or a 100?ppm solution 4 times daily. Controls were negative. Conclusions:? Applications with 400?ppm MDBGN once daily or 100?ppm MDBGN 4 times per day had, in a ROAT study, approximately equal capabilities of provoking allergic dermatitis in agreement with well-known patch test data that dose per unit area is more important than concentration of allergen in the product. This may complicate risk assessment and regulation of cosmetic allergens. Further studies, however, are needed before more general conclusions can be made.

AB  - The existence of seasonal patterns to patch test reactions has been described, but with conflicting causal interpretations. The potential seasonality of patch tests may be due to irritation, changes to skin barrier or changes to immunological functions caused by meteorological fluctuations. For example, increased skin irritability due to cold winter weather and low humidity may cause an increase in irritative/doubtful and weak positive (false positive) reactions. To investigate the extent of the association between weather and patch test results, consecutive patients (N?=?73691) patch tested with the standard series of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) at German or Austrian IVDK (http://www.ivdk.de) centres were matched with weather data collected at a nearby (30?km radius) weather station. Temperature and absolute humidity (AH) on the day of patch test application and the two preceding days were averaged to represent the environment most likely to have influenced the skin condition at the time of testing. The results of 24 standard series substances were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. Half of the standard series substances examined, including fragrance mix, nickel sulphate, and formaldehyde, exhibited evidence of a relationship with meteorological conditions. Fragrance mix and p-Phenylene diamine exhibited the strongest evidence of an association to weather, with the odds of the reactions in all three reaction categories (ir/?, +, ++/+++) increasing during winter conditions. Due to the association between weather and patch test reactivity, the potential effect of meteorological conditions should be considered in the interpretation of patch test reactions.

AB  - Terpenes are among the most widely used fragrances, found not only in fine fragrances but most often incorporated in domestic and occupational products. Terpenes oxidize easily at air-exposure. Our previous studies have proved that limonene, linalool and caryophyllene are not allergenic in themselves but easily form allergenic products due to autoxidation. The aim of this study was to study the frequency and characteristics of allergic reactions in Europe to some oxidized fragrance terpenes. Method:? Consecutive dermatitis patients in six European dermatological centers were patch tested with oxidized terpenes. Questionnaires, standard and additional fragrance patch test materials were used in the diagnosis of fragrance allergy. Results:? Oxidized limonene was tested in 2411, while oxidized linalool, linalool hydroperoxide, oxidized caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide and oxidized myrcene in additional 1511 patients. Of the patients tested 2.6% showed positive reaction to oxidized limonene, 1.3% to oxidized linalool, 0.5% to oxidized caryophyllene and 1 patient to oxidized myrcene. 1.1% of the patients reacted to linalool hydroperoxide, while testing with caryophyllene oxide resulted in few positive Results: 60% of the patients reacting to oxidized terpenes had fragrance related contact allergy and/or positive history for fragrance related dermatitis. Conclusion:? Oxidized limonene and linalool are common allergens in dermatitis patients tested consecutively in Europe. Our results indicate that autoxidation of fragrance terpenes contributes to fragrance allergy to a great extent. This observation emphasises the need of testing with chemicals that patients actually come in contact with and not only ingredients that were originally applied in the commercial formulations.

AB  - Sensitive skin is a neolgism used by consumers for a self-perceived intolerance to environmental factors including skin care products and cosmetics. Consumer complaints focused industry on this concept and dermatology has gradually recognized it also. Identified associations range from endogenous skin disorders to irritant (including sensory) and allergic reactions. Impaired barrier function has been implicated in some instances. The consumer with sensitive skin frequently experiences adverse reactions to cosmetics, but what information is available to help them choose products they can tolerate? To answer this question, a survey is being conducted among cosmetic manufacturers inquiring if they market products for consumers with sensitive skin. They are asked what steps they take in the design of these products to insure tolerance, and what testing is done on these products that may be unique. Does the post-marketing data show these products fulfilled their goal and these cosmetics are well tolerated by this group? The manufacturers are surveyed as to what precautions they regard as important for ?sensitive skin? individuals in choosing and using cosmetics. The results of the survey are incorporated into patient recommendations.

AB  - Aim:? To investigate the risk of adult hand eczema and possible influence on later working life in persons with childhood atopic dermatitis. Method:? After reviewing medical records from the school healthcare in Stockholm regarding individuals born 1960?69, 600 individuals where signs of atopic dermatitis were noted (?cases?) and 600 matched controls without eczema or allergic disease (?controls?) were identified. 405 cases and 378 controls answered a questionnaire regarding past and present skin disease, choice of job, exposure at work and possible change of job due to eczema. Results: Hand eczema was more than 3 times more common among cases, 42%, compared to controls, 13%(p?<?0.001). Hand eczema during the past 12 months was reported by 24% of the cases and 9% of the controls (p?<?0.001). The proportion of individuals working in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema was equal between the groups, as well as exposure to water, detergents, chemicals and hand washing. Among the cases 9% reported change of job due to eczema compared to 2% of controls (p?<?0.001) and sick leave 10% compared to 2%(p?<?0.001). Conclusions: Childhood atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for hand eczema. As the proportion of individuals in jobs with high-risk for hand eczema and the exposure was the same in cases and controls measures preventive measures are important to reduce consequences like sick leave and change of job.

AB  - Objectives:? The strip patch test (SPT), proposed by Spier and Sixt (Hautarzt 1955;6:152?9), is a modification of the patch test (PT). This technique is used to enhance penetration through the stratum corneum for poorly penetrating substances such as medicaments. So far, a standardised procedure is lacking. This multicentre study aims at standardising the SPT procedure. Methods:? A total of 83 healthy volunteers participated. In each subject, we determined the number of strips (A) until the surface became glistening and then calculated the median number of strips in the sample (??=?26). We ascertained the median number of strips in the sample (??=?11) that was necessary to achieve a first statistically significant and medically relevant increase of the TEWL revealing a critical stratum corneum strip depth. For the finally calculated number of strips for each subject (a/A?=?(?/?)?a?=?A???(?/?)), the actual increase in test sensitivity was substantiated employing SLS 0.125% aqueous. Standardisation results:? Perform stripping at one upper part of the back until the surface becomes glistening: gently press a 25?mm diameter adhesive tape downward vertically for about 2 seconds and then remove it in one quick movement at the angle in direction of adherence; continue stripping with a new tape cut on exactly the same skin area. Multiply number of strips by the correction factor (cf?=??/??=?11/26?=?0.4). Perform calculated number of strips likewise on the contralateral site and then apply there the test preparation for 24 hours. Conclusions:? If clinically an allergic contact dermatitis is expected but PT is negative, the SPT might reveal the potential allergen.

AB  - Objective and methods:? To evaluate the importance of occupational colophony exposure among occupational dermatitis patients we analyzed data of occupational dermatitis caused by colophony on the basis of the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) and among the colophony allergic patients studied in the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH)in 1993?2002. Finnish physicians are obligated to report cases of occupational diseases to the FROD. Insurance companies remit patients to FIOH, mainly recommended by company doctors or dermatologists. Results:? Altogether 128 cases (68 females and 60 males) of occupational dermatitis caused by colophony were reported to the FROD since 1993 to 2002 accounting for 3.4% of all occupational allergic contact dermatitis cases and another 67 had it as a second diagnosis. Mean age of the patients was 42 years, being lowest among engineering workers (34 years) Among colophony allergic patients studied in FIOH 46/89 had an occupational dermatitis caused by colophony; 14 of them as a second diagnosis. Engineering, metal working, wood working, agricultural or medical work were most common occupations. Among colophony allergic patients without an occupational dermatitis (22) or an occupational dermatitis caused by other causes (21)working with food materials and agricultural work were most common. Principal causative agents of occupational allergic contact dermatitis from colophony were cutting fluids, soldering fluxes, tall soft soap, adhesives and varnishes. Variable individual sources were occasionally detected. Mean exposure time was 12 years. Conclusion:? Occupational dermatitis caused by colophony is difficult to diagnose, since non-occupational colophony exposure is common.

AB  - The performances of three different questions from The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) were compared with respect to their ability to identify subjects with atopic dermatitis. NOSQ-2002 was used in an intervention study on the prevention of work related skin diseases among gut cleaners. The questions were: ?Have you ever had an itchy rash that has been coming and going for at least 6 months, and at sometime has affected skin creases??(A1), ?Have you ever had eczema on the fronts of the elbow or behind the knees??(S5a), and ?Have you ever had ?childhood? eczema??(S5b). Question A1 is the single UK-working party question on atopic dermatitis; questions S5a & S5b are national atopic dermatitis questions previously used in different Nordic studies. A total of 255 of 622 (41%) gut cleaners answered ?yes? to question A1. Questions S5a and S5b gave rise to 14% and 5% positive answers, respectively. The high frequency of positive answers to question A1 could be due to the occupational exposure of gut cleaners. Their working environment is wet and often involves both forearms and hands, hence often leading to eczema of elbow creases. In conclusion, compared to other Danish studies the UK question seems to lead to over-reporting. Question S5a seems to give a reliable frequency of atopic dermatitis in adult populations at risk for work-related skin diseases.

AB  - Hospital employees and especially nurses have a high frequency of work-related skin diseases. The purpose of the present study was to collect baseline data in order to plan an intervention project with focus on skin problems among different hospital job groups reporting high frequencies of work related skin problems or eczema. Self-administered questionnaires based on a standardized questionnaire for work-related skin diseases and exposure (NOSQ-2002) were used. A total of about 1.900 employees from all job groups at the hospital where invited to participate. Due to anonymous distribution of the questionnaires it was not possible to administer reminders. The overall response rate was 65%. Among the 1.246 respondents the frequency of self-reported eczema within the last year varied between different departments from 7% to 44%. Assessed by job group the eczema frequency varied from 8% to 31%, with the highest frequency found among nurses and assistant nurses.

AB  - Propolis is an ancient remedy well known for its beneficial properties. The aim of our study was to estimate the frequency of sensitization to propolis in our pediatric patch test population. 1255 children, 583 boys and 672 girls, aged from 7 months to 12 years, were patch tested for suspected allergic contact dermatitis with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including propolis. Out of these, 37% were affected by atopic dermatitis. Among the 1255 children tested, 113 (9%), 60 boys and 53 girls reacted to propolis. In subjects reacting to propolis the dermatitis involved the face in 4% of cases, the trunk in 3%, the hands in 2,2%, and the flexural skin folds of the limbs in 1,7%. The wider and wider use of propolis in ?natural products? and biocosmetics, even in the pediatric age, could explain the high frequency of positive patch test responses to propolis we observed.

AB  - It has been demonstrated for a wide range of contact allergens that the degree to which sensitisation is induced is highly dependent on the dose per unit area of material applied to the skin. For a given skin area, the concentration of the contact allergen applied may be conveniently expressed as a percentage. However, although a number of other variables affecting induction have been examined, little attention has been paid to the impact of the duration of skin contact. For example, in the human repeated insult patch test the 9 inductions exposures may be applied for either 24h or for a combination of 48h and 72h, the latter ensuring continuous exposure during the 3 week induction period. Under these latter conditions, it is known that the contact allergen p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitises quite efficiently; historical data with 1% PPD in petrolatum resulted in a sensitisation rate of 47/88 (54%). Applying the same dose per unit area, we examined the impact of reducing the exposure time to 9???5 minutes spaced over the same 3 week period. Under these conditions, PPD sensitised only 2/102 (2%) of subjects. The data suggest that one route to the limitation of the extent of contact allergy would be to limit the duration of skin exposure.
