AB  - Linalool is one of the most frequently used fragrance chemicals in scented products and a large population is exposed to it. It is therefore important to study the allergenic properties of linalool, and the effect of autoxidation. Objectives:? To study the autoxidation of linalool and identify formed oxidation products, to investigate the impact of autoxidation on the sensitizing capacity and to study the frequency of contact allergy to oxidized linalool among consecutive dermatitis patients. Methods:? Linalool was air-exposed and the degradation followed with GC. Oxidation products were identified with GC-MS and NMR. Pure linalool, 2 different states of oxidized linalool and 3 oxidation products were tested for their sensitizing capacity in the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Consecutive dermatitis patients were patch-tested with oxidized linalool and a fraction of oxidized linalool. Results:? Linalool started to decompose immediately when air-exposed. Several oxidation products were identified among which 3 (2 hydroperoxides and an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) contain structural features that make them potential allergens. LLNA showed that the 3 oxidation products were moderate allergens, and that the sensitizing potential of linalool increased with longer air-exposure times. In the patch-test study positive reactions were observed to oxidized linalool in 1.65% of the patients. Conclusions:? The extensively used fragrance chemical linalool is not allergenic in itself. The autoxidation process that takes place at air-exposure leads to the formation of sensitizing oxidation products. The frequency of consecutive patients reacting to oxidized linalool shows that the experimental findings are clinically important.

AB  - Objectives:? This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between QoL scores for patients with ACD and confounders, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Methods:? A total of 428 subjects with ACD were, at varying times after diagnosis, mailed a QoL questionnaire modified from Skindex-16 to include an additional 5 items pertaining to occupational impact. The QoL scores were analyzed by gender, race, age, and occupation to ascertain factors that impact QoL in subjects with ACD. Results:? Three of the four confounders examined have a significant connection with QoL in patients with ACD. Non-Caucasians had significantly worse QoL scores than Caucasians within the functioning scale, and had more emotional distress secondary to their disease. There were no statistically significant gender-related differences in QoL scores, although females felt a higher degree of embarrassment and depression. Age significantly impacted items within the functioning and occupational scales, with subjects nearing retirement age and older reporting better QoL. In contrast, younger subjects, especially those in the 5th decade, were more likely to have difficulty pursuing daily activities, have more fear that they might need to leave their jobs, and have more concern for their financial futures. Office workers, students, and homemakers were primarily diagnosed with non-occupational ACD, while more industrial, health care and other wet workers suffered from occupationally related ACD. In the analyses of QoL by occupation, industrial workers reported significantly more impaired QoL than subjects in other professions.

AB  - Objectives: Persistent post-occupational dermatitis (PPOD) was mentioned by Wall and Gebauer in 1991 to describe ongoing skin disease precipitated by occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). There has been little formal recognition or clarification of this condition. Methods: Approximately 1600 records from our Occupational Dermatology Clinic were searched to identify likely cases. PPOD was difficult to diagnose as relatively few patients had been reviewed after initial assessment. Results: A number of patients with reasonably clear histories of persistent occupational contact dermatitis were identified, which followed either irritant or allergic occupational contact dermatitis. These included a 57?yr old male who worked with photographic chemicals, a 51?yr old female food handler and a 25?yr old female food handler who were all diagnosed with irritant contact dermatitis and yet experienced persistent dermatitis even after avoiding the irritants that were associated with causing their dermatitis. A 51?yr old process worker allergic to acrylates, a 28?yr old laboratory worker allergic to rubber accelerators and coconut diethanolamide in her hand wash and a 48?yr old epoxy applicator allergic to epoxy resins experienced recurrent dermatitis for years after avoiding their causative allergens, although with gradual decrease in the frequency of outbreaks of dermatitis. Unfortunately, many patients experienced difficulties with workers? compensation because the persistence of their dermatitis was thought by some medical examiners negate its work-relatedness. Conclusion: There needs to be greater recognition and understanding of PPOD. We are planning to follow-up patients from our clinic to better study and define this condition.

AB  - Objective:? A possible contact allergy to herbal teas, in particular those derived from the Asteraceae plant family, was investigated in patients allergic to sesquiterpene lactones (SL). Method:? Twenty patients with a contact allergy to SL were recalled and patch-tested with aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts of 8 different herbal teas based on Asteraceae plants as well as with parthenolide and other SL. Results:? In 18/20 patients with SL allergy there were positive test reactions to the Asteraceae teas, mainly to those based on German chamomile, dandelion and milfoil. Among the SL, parthenolide was the most frequent co-reactor. Conclusion:? Most patients with a contact allergy to SL are allergic to commercial teas derived from the Asteraceae plant family as well.

AB  - Plastic gloves are made of polymers including polyvinylchloride, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene and polyvinylacetate. Additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, UV light absorbers, fungicides, bactericides, flame retardants and colourants are added to the polymer, and these are potential allergens. Contact allergy to plastic gloves is rare. The allergen responsible for the sensitization usually remains unknown. An organic pigment, Irgalite Orange F2G, and bisphenol A have both caused contact allergy from household-type PVC gloves. 1 patient with allergic contact dermatitis from his PVC gloves reacted also to tricresyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate, chemicals known to be used as plasticizers in PVC. A plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), caused 1 case of contact urticaria from the vinyl chloride slip guard of cotton gloves. 1 patient with contact urticaria from his polyethylene gloves reacted to 3 antioxidants, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and di-tertiary butyl phenol of the gloves on scratch testing. We report 3 additional cases of allergic contact dermatitis from PVC gloves due to bisphenol A. 2 of the patients reacted also to para-tertiary butyl catechol, a polymerization inhibitor in PVC. In chemical analysis, the connection between sensitization to para-tertiary butyl catechol and the use of vinyl gloves could not be proven. We analysed 16 brands of disposable PVC gloves for medical use, covering at least 80% of the Finnish market. We found a very small amount of bisphenol A in 1 brand, and no para-tertiary butyl catechol in any of the gloves. However, bisphenol A should be remembered as a possible allergen in PVC gloves.

AB  - Objective:? To assess the cumulative incidence and characteristics of self reported skin disease in hydrotherapists. Methods:? Hydrotherapists, who had completed a hydrotherapy training course answered a questionnaire in reference to newly appeared skin disease. Data were analyzed statistically. Results:? 190 subjects presently working as hydrotherapists were studied. Of them 75.8% were female and 24.2% were male. 80% of the hydrotherapists worked up to 10 000 cumulative hours defined by the formula: working hours per weeks ? number of weeks per year ? years of work in the pool. 85 of the subjects (45%) reported on the development of skin disease for the first time after starting work at the swimming pool. 21 (11.8%) had a preexisting skin disease. The most frequent symptoms included pruritus, burning, stinging, erythematous patches and xerotic skin on the extremities, trunk and folds. A statistically significant relationship between the cumulative working time and the incidence of dermatological pathology compatible with contact dermatitis was found. Conclusions:? The incidence of self reported skin diseases, developing for the first time or due to exacerbation of preexisting dermatological conditions, in hydrotherapists working in swimming pools is high. Statistically significant relationship between the cumulative hours of immersion in the pool and the incidence of the dermatological pathology was observed suggesting a dose response relationship between exposure and effect.

AB  - Skin problems are often regarded as part of the job in wet occupations. Bad habits as not using protective gloves and moisturizers are often justified by the workers and ignored by the management. To change habits at the shop floor, involvement of the whole organisation is necessary. The objective of an intervention in 6 gut-cleaning departments was to implement good habits by establishing a safety management system to manage skin risk. Local teams with representatives from all levels of the organisation were trained to run the process. Each team included 2?5 gut-cleaners, who should embody good habits and supervise their colleagues. Implementation research studies evaluate the understanding and acceptance of the intervention at the workplace and the association of the implementation and the reduction of work related diseases. Data are collected from questionnaires, interviews, written documents, etc. The change after one year in the frequency of eczema on hands and forearms within the past 3 months, varied in the 6 departments from a minor increase to a 2/3 reduction. 3 months after the start of the intervention the gut-cleaners in the team were asked to grade their expectations for success on a scale from 1 to 10; 10 being the optimum. The average grade varied from 4,8 to 10, indicating very different local expectations to the colleagues? acquisition of new habits. Further data and analysis will show if there is a covariance between the local changes in eczema frequency and the degree of implementation.

AB  - Introduction:? A recent survey of the UK printing industry found a prevalence of 11% of occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), much higher than previously identified. Objective:? This pilot study aimed to evaluate risk reduction strategies derived from recommendations of a literature review of preventive intervention studies and a series of focus groups of printers and observations of printers undertaking their normal duties. Methods:? Four interventions were evaluated: (1) Provision of gloves of the correct size/type, plus use of an after-work skin cream; (2) Provision of information; (3) Provision of skin checks; (4) Development of best practice skin care policy. Each intervention was evaluated in two companies over a three-month period, at the end of which printers and managers were interviewed as to the effectiveness and acceptability of each intervention. Results:? Although this pilot study was short, all interventions were acceptable to some extent. The prevalence of frank dermatitis fell over the study period, particularly in intervention (3). Intervention (1) achieved an improvement of awareness in both management and workforce and an increase in the use of both gloves and cream. Intervention (2) highlighted problems of dissemination and the need for relevant information in an appropriate format. However. no single intervention was completely effective. Conclusions:? This qualitative research approach forms an essential first stage to improving understanding of ways in which OCD may be reduced among workers in the printing industry, and points towards the need for further testing of preventive strategies in larger-scale intervention trials, in printing and other industries.

AB  - Introduction:? Occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) is very common in the printing industry due to contact with chemicals, paper, and wet work. It can be avoided by adequate protective measures, but the effectiveness of intervention depends heavily on the employer?s and employee?s awareness of this health risk. Objectives:? The study aimed to collect information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of print workers about the risk of OCD and methods of prevention. Methods:? A series of focus groups were held with print workers, health and safety officers and managers to discuss their awareness of dermal risk factors, risk behaviour at work, attitudes to health and safety and options on possible preventive measures. A number of companies were also visited to observe, overtly and covertly, the normal work practices. Results:? OCD was not perceived to be either a major problem or a health and safety priority. There was general agreement about the processes and work practices that could cause skin problems. However, work practices varied considerably and did not always reflect this awareness. There was general concern about the type and availability of personal protective equipment, especially gloves and after-work skin cream. The provision of an occupational health service was generally felt to be inadequate, and no company had a policy in place that specifically addressed skin care. Conclusions:? These findings highlight the urgency to intensify health and safety education on skin care within the printing industry. Recommendations were developed for the evaluation of a series of risk reduction strategies.

AB  - Cultured monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) have been shown to provide a promising alternative for identifying potential sensitisers in vitro. Allergen induced moDC maturation results in elevated expression of the cell surface markers CD83 and CD86. Unfortunately, this increase in CD83 and CD86 expression is not sensitive enough to identify moderate and weak contact sensitisers. In this study, we investigated whether chemokine production by moDC is increased upon maturation and, ultimately, whether chemokine production can be used as a sensitive method to discriminate allergens from irritants. Methods:? MoDC were exposed for 48 hours to allergens (NiSO4, CoCl2, PdCl2, CuSO4, CrCl3, K2Cr2O7, PPDA and DNCB) and irritants (SDS, DMSO, BCl2 and propan-1-ol). CD83 and CD86 expression was analysed by flow cytometric determination and chemokine production (CXCL8, CCL5, CCL17 and CCL20) was determined by ELISA. Results:? Exposure to strong allergens caused up-regulation of CD83 and CD86 expression whereas exposure to irritants did not. Remarkably, increased CXCL8 production by moDC was detected after allergen exposure whereas a decrease in CXCL8 production was observed after irritant exposure. CCL20 production was induced only by NiSO4. CCL5 and CCL17 production was increased upon exposure to both allergens and irritants. Conclusion:? CXCL8 production by moDC can be used to distinguish allergens from irritants. This chemokine is a potentially novel marker for determining the sensitising capacity of a chemical in vitro. Furthermore, our results suggest an important role for CXCL8 in the sensitization phase of ACD.

AB  - Safe exposure limits for the elicitation of fragrance contact allergy have been a subject of research in several EU-funded studies, against the background of high frequencies of contact allergy to certain fragrance ingredients. Elicitation studies can be easily performed in already sensitised individuals, they bear no ethical problems and by using simulated realistic exposures, safe thresholds relevant for exposure can be determined. The challenge in establishing safe thresholds for fragrance ingredients is the many different applications and thus potential exposures to fragrances. Deodorant exposures have been regarded a worst case assumption model for safety assessment and the fragrance ingredients: isoeugenol, hydroxycitronellal and cinnamic aldehyde, have been studied, showing that current exposure to these ingredients in some deodorants exceeds the safe limits for elicitation. Recent investigations show that the impact of fragrance allergy on hand eczema may need to be looked at a different angle, as it appears that it is more the combined exposures to several allergens and irritants that matters than the action of a single ingredient. At the moment, studies are being performed to elucidate whether dose-response patch test data can be used more systematically as the basis of safety assessments. This will make studies even easier and it will be possible to provide data on more allergens than at the present time.

It was the third temporary tattoo (called ?henna? tattoo) done over a 3 month period of school holidays. He was treated with topical corticosteroid and reobserved with an residual hypopigmentation. He was patch tested with our standard series with positive reaction to p-phenylenediamine; later test with ?henna? powder was negative. Temporary ?henna? tattoos are very popular, specially during holidays. Several cases are reported in the literature of sensitization to p-phenylenediamine, contained in the henna tincture, but few of these are pediatric cases. It is important to discouraged the use of these tattoos, due to the consequences that a sensitization to p-phenylenediamine could have in their future.

He tried to use several kinds of analgesic plasters, however he felt itching sensation whenever he used them. He applied a plaster containing ferbinac for his left elbow joint?s pain on April 2003. On the next day, an itching erythema developed on the area where the plaster was applied. He was treated with a difluprednate ointment, and his dermatitis gradually improved. He visited our clinic for precise medical examination for finding out the causative agent of his dermatitis on May 13, 2003. We conducted 48 hours closed patch testing with the plaster he used and it?s ingredients. He reacted positively to the plaster containing ferbinac and crotamiton 5%p that was used for dissolute the active drug. He also reacted positively to a cream containing ketoprofen, however he reacted negatively to ketoprofen 1%p. Crotamoton was also used in the ketoprofen cream.

AB  - Because of its numerous etiologies, foot dermatitis can be difficult to diagnose despite of thorough history and physical examination. The differential diagnoses are challenging and include allergic contact dermatitis, dyshidrosis, juvenile plantar dermatosis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus. Methods:? In the Cutaneous Allergology Unit of the Department of Dermatovenereology of Pedro Hispano Hospital, between 1999 and 2003, 804 patients were observed with suspicion of contact dermatitis. In 9,3% there was a history of recurrent foot dermatitis. All these patients were patch tested with GPEDC standard and shoe series and shoe fragments. Results:? Twenty-five patients revealed shoe contact dermatitis with positive reactions to the series tested, with an average age of 40 years. The dermatitis involved the dorsal aspect of the foot in 20 patients and the volar aspect in 8, the lateral aspects in 4, typically sparing the instep and flexural creases of the toes. The most common allergen were para-tertiary-butylphenol formaldehyde resin ? PTBFR (12 patients-48%), mercapto mix (7 patients-28%), potassium dichromate (24%), mercaptobenzothiazole (24%). Conclusions:? The most common causes of shoe contact dermatitis were glues, followed by rubber components and chromated leather. As in other studies the most common allergen in shoe dermatitis in Portugal is PTBFR in neoprene adhesives. Rubber components (accelerators) were the second more frequent allergen in this study, probably a direct result of improved fixation of chrome and a change in footwear style and chrome sensitivity explains leather allergy. Other causes of foot contact dermatitis are iatrogenic complication, clothing (socks), cosmetics, adhesive tape and professional etiology.

AB  - Disperse blue 106 is one of the most important allergenic textile dyes. We reviewed all the patients that proved to be allergic to this dye, in 10 contact clinics, in Portugal, from 01/2000 to 06/2003. In the first 2 years disperse blue 106 was only tested in suspected cases, while in 2002/2003 it was routinely tested in our standard series. A total of 8957 patients (2797M?+?6160F) were tested; fifty five patients (17M?+?38F)(0.6%) were allergic to the dye, with a significant difference in incidence between the 2 periods (0.2 to 0.9%); a current relevance was found in 38 (69%) patients. In 5 patients the dermatitis was considered occupational. The main localizations were the axillae (25p), the antecubital fossae and the face (13p each), the neck (11p), the feet (8p), the hands and then trunk (7p each). Thirty six out of 44 patients (80%) that were tested with disperse blue 124 were allergic to this dye. Simultaneous reactions to PPDA and to fragrance mix were observed in 12 and 11 patients, respectively. Allergy to other dyes was found in 15 patients. Blouses and skirts were the main offending garments that induced contact allergy. Although both disperse blue 106 and 124 have been reported as frequent sensitizers, it proved not to be such an important allergen in Portugal. However, if tested routinely it can pick up some unexpected relevant allergic patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Patients sensitized to para-phenylenediamine (PPD) have a high degree of patch test reactivity to Disperse Orange 3 (DO3), and a lesser one to Disperse Red 1 and Red 17. Two successive patients positive to PPD, Disperse Red 1 and 17, negative to DO3 were real eye-openers for our considerations about purity of our current allergen DO3. Materials and methods:? We realized comparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC), with DO3 from Chemotechnique?(DO3-Chem) and Trolab?(both extracted from petrolatum), and ?pure? DO3 from two chemical providers. TLC clearly indicated that DO3-Chem was not DO3. HPLC analysis with pure DO3 from Chemotechnique? and comparison of structures by NMR with samples of DO3, revealed that DO3-Chem was Disperse Orange 31 (DO31). In addition, signals through the GERDA network allowed the collection of test materials and observations. Among other members, only 2 used DO3-Chem (from 2 different batches) that was DO31 too, according to TLC Results: According to their data, they observed no or a lower reactivity to DO3 than expected (4 patients DO3-Chem?+?among 23 PPD+ e.g.). Finally, the error was proved to be due to the provider of the dye to Chemotechnique?, who likely deleted the 1 of Disperse Orange 31 on his packaging. Discussion:? Chemical structure of DO31 indicates a possible in vivo hydrolysis into nitroaniline and a second compound, a substituted PPD derivative that clearly does not frequently react in PPD positive patients. Like drugs, patch tests are submitted to post-commercialization controls. In addition to allergens providers who should enhance their quality controls, dermato-allergologists have to be vigilant, and must active networks when they observe a rare bird.

AB  - Local skin memory (LSM) describes the clinical phenomenon of an accelerated and increased inflammatory allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) response upon renewed allergen exposure. This has been ascribed to the local persistence of few, but allergen-specific, T cells. Here, firstly, we characterized effector T cells, and, subsequently, studied which of these cell populations are present at former challenge sites and might contribute to LSM. Peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with nickel sulphate. Cellular phenotypes and chemokine receptor expression profiles were analysed by FACS-staining: CLA together with CD4/CD8, CD45R0/RA, CXCR3, CCR4, CCR6 and CCR10. Skin biopsies were taken at 0, 3 and 21 days after allergen application and analysed for the same markers. Upon nickel-stimulation, amount of CD4+ CLA+ CD45R0+ T cells was increased. Together with CLA, CXCR3, CCR4 and, mainly, CCR10 expression was augmented. CCR6 expression was negative on CLA+ cells. In biopsies from patch tests, cellular infiltrates were present at 3 and 21 days after allergen application. Interestingly at day 21, residing cells were localized at the perivascularity and were characterized as CD4+ CD8? CCR10+ T cells. In conclusion, nickel-activated effector T cells can be characterised as CD4+ CD8? CLA+ memory T cells. They express CXCR3, CCR4 and, in particular, CCR10. After clinical recovery from an ACD reaction, CD4+ CCR10+ memory T cells apparently reside locally. The persistence of these CCR10+ T cells, expressing the appropriate receptor of the skin specific chemokine CCL27, can explain clinically important phenomena such as LSM and flare up reactions.

AB  - Aim:? To investigate the occurrence of hand eczema after 20 years in schoolgirls previously patch-tested to nickel. Methods:? In 1982?83, 960 schoolgirls, aged 8, 11 and 15 years, were investigated for the occurrence of nickel allergy (Larson-Stymne B and Widström L, Contact Dermatitis 1985:13:289?293). The girls were patch-tested and the prevalence of nickel allergy was 9%. Twenty years later, the same individuals have received a questionnaire regarding hand eczema and factors of importance for the development of hand eczema. After two reminders, the response rate was 81%. Results:? In total 17.5% of the girls reported hand eczema after the age of 15. The 1-year prevalence of hand eczema was 12.6%. Of the previously patch-tested schoolgirls who answered the questionnaire, 63 were sensitive to nickel. In this study, the prevalence of hand eczema among those 63 was 16%, compared to 17% in the non-sensitive group (NS). Excluding persons with atopic dermatitis, the prevalence of hand eczema was 12.5% in the nickel-sensitive group, and 10% among the others (NS). 32% of the persons who had had atopic dermatitis reported hand eczema after 15 years of age, compared to 10% of those with no history of atopic dermatitis (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Contact allergy to nickel in early childhood (8?15 years) did not seem to increase the prevalence of hand eczema later in life. The prevalence of hand eczema was increased by a factor of three among those with a history of atopic dermatitis, which is in accordance with earlier reports.

AB  - The aim of the work is to present the incidence and the main reasons for this illness at women who live in very bad and poor conditions, in town and in village. Material and methods:? 137 women were included, who were inspected during the time period of 8 months in 2003. A proper therapy was introduced-per os and in loco, and all of them were controled for 14 days. Results:? All together, 137 women were inspected and they were classified by their age, place of leaving and nationality. The detail anamnesis showed that 80% are housewifes who live in poverty and who are in contact with detergents everyday, becouse they do the dish-washing and the laundry with hands, without any machines. The following therapies were applicated: corticosteroid and antihystaminic therapy per os and corticosteroid therapy in loco. After 14 days, a control look over was made, and they were given the preparation with vitamin A and lanolinum, for 14 days more. All of them were adviced to use protection gloves when they are in contact with detergents, especially for the laundry. Conclusion:? One of the reasons for the appearance of chronic toxic contact dermatitis is the low standard of living when, becouse of the poverty, people can?t use machines and still in the 21th Century they wash the clothes and dishes with hands. The only help at this category of people is to give them advices for using protection gloves.

AB  - Background:? Psoriasis prevalence in the Spanish population is around 1.4%(2000). The last epidemiological enquire of the GEIDC (2001) showed that 55.11% of the patients revised in specialized units presented Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD). Concomitance of both processes has been widely studied being the opinions of the different authors controversial. Palmo-plantar psoriasis seems to be the most frequent type in patients presenting delayed hypersensitivity. Aim and methods:? A retrospective study (2002?2003) of the incidence of ACD in patients previously diagnosed of psoriasis was performed in the allergy unit of our hospital. The aim of our study was to investigate the delayed hypersensitivity among psoriatic patients as well as its clinical relevance in our influence area. 604 consecutive patients were studied. Standard batteries of the GEIDC as well as complementary series (True-Test and Chemotecnique) were performed. Allergen application and posterior evaluation were done according to the ICDRG rules. Results:? We studied 26 patients affected of Psoriasis, (4,3% of total). In contrast to the general population, 9 were female (mean age 49 years) and 17 male (mean age 48,4 years). ACD suggestive lesions were located in the hands of 15 patients, feet in three of them and in 4 patients both. Patch test was negative in 8 cases. The most detected allergens were Nickel and Fragrance-mix. Occupational origin was discussed in 6 cases. Sensitivity to formaldehyde resins was demonstrated in several patients. Medicamentous origin due to ethylendiamine and Peru Balsam was also demonstrated. Comments:? Several revisions about the relationship of ACD and psoriasis have been published in the last years and most of the authors think that there are no differences between healthy, psoriatic and atopic subjects. These studies have focused on adverse drug reactions or standard series of allergens, taking not in consideration an occupational origin. We suggest epicutaneous tests as a reliable method to diagnose ACD in psoriatic patients with chronic and/or refractory lesions in hands.
