AB  - Objective:? In this study the statistical data on occupational dermatoses of Finnish machinists in 1992?2001 were analysed. Methods:? The data were collected from the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) to which physicians are obligated to report all cases of occupational disease. Each case record consists of information on the patient and the employer, date and diagnosis, causative agents, etc. Results:? During the 10-year period, a total of 281 occupational dermatoses of machinists were diagnosed. Dermatoses consisted mostly of irritant contact dermatitis (N?=?144), allergic contact dermatitis (N?=?108) and unspecified contact dermatitis (N?=?21). Only few cases of protein contact dermatitis and contact urticaria as well as occupational acne were reported. The main causes of irritant contact dermatitis were cutting oils and fluids, oils and lubricants, and organic solvents; the commonest inducers of allergic contact dermatitis were formaldehyde, cutting oils and fluids, metals (nickel, chromium and cobalt) and various antimicrobial agents. Conclusion:? Dermatoses were the second commonest occupational diseases of machinists, after hearing loss, and they accounted for 27% of all occupational diseases within the profession. Machinists are a large occupational group (about 19 000 employees; 0.8% of the work force) in Finland, and their dermatoses formed a noteworthy proportion (about 2.6%) of the occupational skin diseases reported during the study period.

AB  - Case report:? A 54-year-old woman, with no family or personal history of atopy, developed skin symptoms and cough after she had been cultivating shiitake mushrooms for 12 months. The patient reported dermatitis on the backs of her hands, fingers and on her wrists, after 1 or 2 days of being in contact with shiitake mushrooms. The skin lesions and cough disappeared entirely during the holidays. Result: Prick tests to common inhalant allergens, molds and flours were negative, with the exception of D. farinae (3?mm). The prick-to-prick test was positive for shiitake gill (3?mm), shiitake stalk (3?mm) and dry shiitake (8?mm?ps). The histamine wheal was 5?7?mm. Control prick tests with shiitake on 5 nonexposed subjects were negative. An open test was performed with shiitake on the flexor side of the upper arm. Within 20 minutes a positive reaction appeared comprising two wheals and flare reactions. Patch test with shiitake gave a strong toxic reaction in 2 days, which continued to diminish on days 3 and 4. Conclusion: Contact urticaria is the clinical skin symptom of immediate allergy, but repeated exposure may lead to protein contact dermatitis. However, our patient has not had urticaria symptoms from shiitake, although the prick-to-prick and open tests were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report of protein contact dermatitis from shiitake in a patient with a positive immediate skin reaction and negative patch test result.

AB  - Objective:? Study permeability of gloves to plant allergens, therefore evaluating glove efficacy for hand protection. Material and methods:? We studied 20 female patients (aged 21?71; mean 45,1 years) with ACD from plants, 10 allergic to diallyl disulfide (DAD) from Allium sativa, 8 allergic to alpha-methylene-gama-butyrolactone (AMGBL) from Alstroemeria ligtu and 2 allergic to primin from Primula obconica. Patch testing was performed applying the allergens, for 24 or 48?h, directly on the skin and over fragments of different gloves: domestic rubber gloves (RG), nitrile latex gloves (NG), vinyl gloves (VG), surgical latex gloves (LG) and polyethylene gloves (PG). Results:? VG, PG or LG gloves offered no protection for these 3 allergens. With RG and NG gloves, DAD reactivity was abolished or significantly reduced, respectively, in 5 and 7 cases. Reactivity to AMGBL wasn?t abolished by any glove material. NG abolished skin reactivity to primin; RG was efficacious only in 1 patient. Conclusions:? Advising gloves in patients with ACD from plants is difficult, as allergen permeability through gloves associated with occlusion may intensify the dermatitis, as occurred during skin testing. Nitrile latex gloves may protect from primin and garlic dermatitis, whereas they are not helpful for manipulating Alstroemeria. Although exposure time in this study is higher than in real life, results show interesting data on glove permeability to these plant allergens and support our patients? complaints that gloves didn?t protect them.

AB  - There is only very limited data on the prevalence of contact allergy, as judged by a positive diagnostic patch test, in unselected, non-clinical populations. We carried out a 48?h patch test to 7 common allergens and to the petrolatum vehicle in a total of 2545 adult volunteers in Bangkok. The patch tests were read at 48?h approximately 1?h after patch removal. Positive results were as follows Ni 27.8%, fragrance mix 2.9%, Cr 2.6%, PPD 2.3%, colophony 2.1%, MI/MCI 1.2% and formaldehyde 0.7%. No reactions were found to petrolatum. The particularly high frequency of reactions to Ni was surprising. However, the large female bias (approximately 75:1) strongly suggested that, despite the absence of a 96?h score, that irritancy did not play a significant part in these reactions. Reaction rates to the other 6 contact allergens appeared to confirm predictions made from the extrapolation of diagnostic patch testing or from previous published studies on smaller population groups. The rates of reaction to these allergens also are likely to reflect the extent of exposure in the Bangkok region. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that over 2% of this adult population appear to be allergic to the cosmetic related allergens PPD and fragrance.

AB  - Objective:? Prevalence of textile dye contact dermatitis (TD-CD) are lacking in many countries. Our aim is to know the frequency of TD-CD in three different areas of Spain. Methods:? 100 patients were tested with Spanish standard series and the five most frequent TD in each city. D. Orange 1, D. Orange 3, D. Blue 35, D. Blue 106, D. Blue 124 were included in Murcia and Seville, and the three last and D. Red 1, D. Red 17 in Santiago. Results:? 23/300 (15 women and 8 men) were positives to one or more TD. D. Blue 124 was the most frequent allergen (18/300), followed by D. Blue 106 (17/300). D. Red 1, D. Red 17 and D. Orange 1 were positives in 2/200. D. Orange 3 and D. Blue 35 were positives in 1/200. Eczema was located on hands in 13 cases. Clinical picture was variable. Origin of sensitization was clothing and occupational. Relevance was obtained in 20/23 cases. Conclusions:? The study confirm an high frequency of disperse dye allergy in Spain with a very different prevalence in the three areas: Seville 14%, Murcia 5% and Santiago 4%, that are probably due to social and cultural factors. We recommend the inclusion of D. Blue 106, D. Blue 124, D. Blue 35, D. Red 1, D. Red 17, D. Orange 1 and D. Orange 3 in standard series in order to detect sensitivity to textile colours that is most frequent than previously suspected.

AB  - There is a need for a diversity of approaches to predictive irritancy testing. In this study we examined the potential for changes in the expression of the nitric oxide generating enzyme, nitric oxide synthase, to act as a marker of skin irritation. Human volunteers were patch tested with sodium lauryl sulphate and dithranol so as to induce acute irritant contact dermatitis. Test and control biopsies were removed at various time points and skin sections immunocytochemically labelled with a range of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the three nitric oxide synthase isoforms, NOS1, NOS2 and NOS3. Quantitative image analysis of keratinocytes and endothelial cells revealed major inconsistencies in the labelling of both normal and inflamed skin between antibodies, including those purported to recognise the same epitope. Of the ten antibodies tested, two, AHP303 and N2643, gave statistically significant changes in NOS2 and NOS3 expression, respectively, in well-established 48?h and 96?h reactions. Importantly, the changes were consistent for both irritants, despite their differing mechanisms of action. Further investigations are needed to assess their suitability as markers of irritation in animal and in-vivo models.

AB  - Easily applicable, cheap, noninvasive and quantitative techniques to measure edema in skin and subcutaneous tissues have not been available. Recently, a new device MoistureMeter-D based on the local measurement of the dielectric properties of the biological tissues was validated in the quantitation of systemic edema in humans. In the present study the MoistureMeter-D was applied to quantitate local skin edema related to skin irritation. The irritation was induced in the volar forearms of 12 healthy volunteers with the topical application of 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) for 6 hours. After induction the volunteers were divided into two groups: the irritation site of group I (six volunteers) had no treatment for the irritation site while for group II (six volunteers) the corticosteroid cream was topically administered on the irritation site. A good correlation was measured between the temporal changes of edema during the three days? follow-up by the ultrasound-measured skin thickness and the edema-specific MoistureMeter-D in group I (p?<?0.001). The reduction of edema in group II by the corticosteroid treatment was consistently measured by both instruments. The coefficient of variation for a single measurement varied between 2 and 3%. The results demonstrate that the MoistuMeter-D is an accurate instrument for the quick quantitative evaluation of local oedema and fluid retention in irritated skin.

AB  - For the pas few years, mainly because of mad cow disease, hydrolysed wheat proteins (HWP) have been used in cosmetics and food as emulsifiers and stabilizers in replacement of bovine collagen. We report here contact urticaria to cosmetics induced by these HWP in 7 patients of which 6 had food allergy to modified gluten and the results of their immunological testing. These cases were regrouped through the french network REVIDAL-GERDA. All 7 women developped contact urticaria immediatly after applying cosmetics (mainly facial cream), from different brands, containing HWP. Six of them had also anaphylactic reactions or urticaria after eating preserved foods or delicatessen which contained modified gluten. Neither had allergic reaction after eating broad or bread. Skin tests were positive with the cosmetics, HWP contained in them and, in case of food allergy, modified gluten. They were negative with natural wheat flour. Despite that, specific IgE to wheat flour were positive in 2 cases. Specific IgE to gluten were positive in 3 patients. Sera were also investigated for their specificity toward wheat proteins and various preparations of gluten. Individual variations of specificity were observed. All sera contained IgE reacting with both hydrolysed peptides and some native flour proteins. It appears that, from the medical history, allergy to cosmetics preceeded food allergy. In view of these elements, may be the use of HWP in cosmetics should be questionned.

AB  - Objective:? The aim was to detect a possible allergen in a patient with eyelid dermatitis. Patient and methods: a non atopic 27-year-old female presented with eyelid dermatitis since 3 months. This dermatitis persisted despite the fact she had stopped the use of make up; she had acrylic artificial nails since 2 months and sometimes used hair dyes;patch tests were performed with Finn Chamber? tests with readings at D2 and D3, according ICDRG criteria, with European standard series, additional series (including toluenesulfonamide formaldehyde resin), cosmetic, acrylates, hairdressing series, in 3 patch test sessions, using Chemotechnique Diagnostics? allergens. Results:? The only positive patch test was coconut diethanolamide (0.5% pet.)++ at D2 and D3. After removal of the shampoo containing this allergen, the dermatitis cleared. Coconut diethanolamide (cocamide DEA), tensioactive synthesized with coconut oil is widely used in shampoos, soaps, shower gels, barrier creams, washing up liquids, metalworking fluids, hydraulic oils. Involvement of eyelids is not frequently described in the literature with this allergen. Conclusion:? Coconut diethanolamide should be added in cosmetic series, and it should be useful to test this allergen in patients with eyelid dermatitis.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate if pigment of a dark patch-test substance may affect assessment of perfusion with the laser Doppler imaging technique. Materials:? 13 subjects who previously patch-tested positive with 25% balsam of Peru in petrolatum were re-tested with the same test substance and petrolatum controls applied directly by transparent foils and with much weaker and less pigmented serial doses tested with polyester squares. Readings of perfusion were performed through the test substances and the transparent foils at time intervals up to 4 days while tests were applied and for 5 days following detachment of tests. The instrument set-up of the LDPI was the same as we have suggested for non-pigmented patch-test substances tested on white skin. Results:? Results show that pigment remnants following detachment of the dark pigmented and pasty test substance containing the petrolatum vehicle were prone to affect perfusion assessments by masking detection of perfusion of parts of test sites. A real masking effect is supported by a similar effect with readings of the same tests while they were applied and by no such observable effect with the petrolatum controls or the non-pasty and much less pigmented squares. Conclusion:? The results show that pigment of patch-test substances may affect perfusion assessments with the instrument set-up suggested for non-pigmented substances.

AB  - That a cosmetic product must not cause damage to human health is enshrined in European legislation. Within the EU, the Scientific Committee for Cosmetic and Non-food Products (SCC NFP) of the Directorate General for Consumer Safety & Health Protection provides independent risk assessments of certain cosmetic ingredients. The evaluations depend largely on the completeness of dossiers submitted by industry. Requirements for submissions are published by the SCC NFP http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/ out242_en.pdf) and cutaneous toxicology, including contact allergy, is only a part of the overall assessment. Opinions adopted by the SCC NFP are published in full (http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/sccp_opinions_en.htm), presented to the Directorate General responsible for the legislation (Enterprise), who are risk managers, and discussed with Member States before the recommendations are included in the annexes of the Cosmetics Directive, if appropriate. The Cosmetics Directive (http://pharmacos. eudra.org/F3/cosmetic/pdf/vol_1en.pdf) contains positive lists of certain ingredient types (including preservatives, UV filters) and only those substances listed may be used. Annex 3 lists substances that may be used under certain conditions (concentration, exposure sites, warnings, age). Increasingly, revision of assessments of risks related to contact allergy have been brought about by epidemiological and robust clinical data (elicitation studies) submitted by dermatologists. As illustrated with the examples of methyldibromo glutaronitrile and Lyral?, rapid responses to protect the consumer are possible when the Commission is provided with appropriate information. Similar examples illustrate failures to predict risks for the induction of contact allergy before the consumer was excessively exposed. In contrast to the above, some permanent hair dye chemicals (for which there is, as yet, no positive list) are important and potent allergens and are permitted only because of the absence of acceptable alternatives and social need. Warnings and recommendations for testing before use have not been validated despite the long history of complaints. The ?damage? experienced by the consumer with an adverse reaction to a hair dye must be balanced against their possible carcinogenic potential. The consumer expects products to be safe. Why do risk assessments fail?

AB  - Study objectives Two studies involving human volunteer subjects have been conducted. These studies compared the ability of several ultra-pure medical grade lanolins (Medilan? range, Croda Chemicals Europe Ltd.) and Petrolatum USP to reduce the signs and symptoms of dry, cracked hands (Study One) and to promote the healing of superficial wounds (Study Two). Methods Study One, a two-week treatment period immediately followed by a 9-day (no treatment) regression period, investigated the signs and symptoms (dryness/scaling, cracking and/or abrasions and pain/itch) of dry, cracked hands. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated separately and their severity scored at the time of observation. A retrospective global assessment of overall improvement from baseline was also recorded using digital 35?mm photographs. Study Two investigated the repair of de-roofed cantharidin-induced blisters. Wound sites were evaluated and ranked on a daily basis. High-resolution photographs (20x) were also taken throughout the study prior to daily treatment. Results summary In Study One, at the end of the two-week treatment period and the 9-day regression period, hands treated with ultra-pure medical grade lanolins were superior to hands treated with Petrolatum USP. In Study Two, and particularly at day 10, it was shown that wounds treated with one type of ultra high purity lanolin were unequivocally superior to those treated with Petrolatum USP. Conclusion Ultra-pure medical grade lanolins have been shown to be superior to White Petrolatum USP in their ability to reduce the signs and symptoms of dry, cracked hands and to promote the healing of superficial wounds.

AB  - Since January 2001, the European surveillance system on contact allergies (ESSCA) has developed a suitable infrastructure with the financial support of EU funding (QLK4-CT-2001?00343 and ?2001?2812), and has started to collect patch test data. These comprise a standardized clinical history and patch test results with the European standard series, contributed by the 12 centres in 8 European countries listed above. So far, with the 2003 data collection not yet completed, 7636 patients? test results have been pooled and analysed; current data pertaining to 2002 and 2003 will be presented. Anamnestic data reflect partly the specialties of some centres (e.g., the % of occupational and hand dermatitis ranging between 6 and 29% and 18 and 56%), partly different selection criteria or possibly also definitions (e.g., 7?32% with underlying atopic dermatitis, 40?69% of patients age 40+). The leading allergen was nickel sulfate (15.7%, age- and sex-standardized), with however, large inter-national variation (the lowest standardized prevalence, 9.7%, was observed in Gentofte, Denmark, where nickel regulation had long been introduced). The prevalence of contact allergy to Myroxylon Pereirae resin (7.8%) has almost reached the frequency found with the fragrance mix (8.3%). In the two centres using the True Test?, both percentages were even lower, which may be indicative of a systematic effect. Within a few years, ESSCA is expected to meet its objective of increased consumer safety by post-marketing surveillance by continuously monitoring contact allergy across Europe.

AB  - Objectives:? To investigate symptoms from the eyes and airways, elicited by perfume and fragrance products and associations between such symptoms and skin prick test reactivity, metacholine bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR), contact allergy, and eczema in a population based sample. Methods:? A questionnaire on mucosal symptoms elicited by fragrance products was mailed to 1189 persons who had participated in a Danish population-based study of allergic diseases in 1997/98. The study included measurement of BHR, skin prick testing, patch testing and history of hand eczema. Results:? The response rate to the questionnaire was 80%. Symptoms from the eyes or airways elicited by fragrance products were reported by 42%. There were no significant associations between these symptoms and skin prick test reactivity. Positive and independent statistical significant associations were found between BHR, perfume contact allergy and hand eczema, and symptoms from the eyes and airways elicited by fragrance products, also when adjusting for nickel contact allergy, age, gender psychological vulnerability, educational level and social class. Conclusions:? Individuals with BHR, hand eczema and/or perfume contact allergy, as opposed to those without, are more frequently and more severely bothered from the eyes or airways after volatile exposure to fragrance products. The lack of association with skin prick test reactivity indicates that IgE mediated allergic mechanisms do not play a major role in the development of these symptoms. Having hand eczema has the greatest impact on reporting mucosal symptoms elicited by fragrance products.

AB  - A new fragrance mix (FM II) with 6 frequently used chemicals was evaluated in consecutive patients patch tested in 6 dermatological centres in Europe. 28% FM II contained 5% Lyral, 1% citral, 5% farnesol, 5% coumarin, 1% citronellol and 10% alpha-hexyl cinnamic aldehyde (AHCA); in 14% FM II the single constituents? concentrations was lowered to 50% and in 2.8% FM II to 10%. Each patient was classified regarding a history of adverse reactions to fragrances: certain, probable, questionable and none. The frequency of positive reactions to the currently used 8% fragrance mix (FM I) and the new mix in 1703 patients was as follows: FM I, 6.6%; 2.8% FM II, 1.3%; 14% FM II, 2.9%; 28% FM II, 4.1%. The number of doubtful/irritant reactions was 7.2% for FM I and ranged from 1.8% to 10.6% for FM II. 8.7% of tested patients had a certain fragrance history. Of these 25.2% were positive to FM I, reactivity to FM II was dose-dependent and ranged from 8.1% to 17.6% in this subgroup. Comparing 2 groups of history ? certain and none ? values for sensitivity (sens) and specificity (spec) were calculated. Sens: FM I, 27.2%; 2.8% FM II, 8.7%; 14% FM II, 15.9%; 28% FM II, 21.5%. Spec: FM I, 96.3%; 2.8% FM II, 99.5%; 14% FM II, 98.7%; 28% FM II, 97.9%. 31/70 (44.3%) patients positive to 28% FM II were negative to FM I. In the group of patients with a certain history a total of 6 patients was found reacting only to FM II. Simultaneous break-down testing with the single constituents produced positive reactions in 54.3% for 28% FM II and 48% for 14% FM II. Lyral was the dominating single constituent with positive reactions (37.1% for 28% FM II, 36% for 14% FM II), followed by citral, farnesol, citronellol, AHCA and coumarin. Chemical analysis for the 6 constituents of FM II was performed on 25 products used by 12 patients being patch test positive to FM II. Lyral was detected in 76% of these products, citral in 16% and AHCA in 8%. In conclusion, the new FM II detects additional patients with contact allergy to fragrances missed by the currently used FM I. The medium concentration, 14% FM II, is probably the most useful one for diagnostic screening.

AB  - Current EU legislation for skin sensitisers is a simple device, which crudely distinguishes between chemicals which possess significant sensitising potential and those which do not. Where a chemical is clearly positive in predictive tests or by human experience, it is classified and labelled R43: May cause sensitisation by skin contact. Use of such a chemical at ?1% in products would require appropriate labelling. Additional labelling requirements in relation to elicitation also exist, or are planned, which variously impact cosmetics, detergents and a wide range of other consumer products. Improvements to this basic system are presently under consideration and largely are focused on a consideration of options to categorise sensitising chemicals according to their potency. Central to this activity has been the demonstration of the utility of the local lymph node assay (LLNA) as a predictor of the human potency of skin sensitisers. Arising from this, both industry (ECETOC) and regulatory bodies in the EU have taken proactive steps to initiate improvement in the existing legislation. However, at a wider regulatory level, the debate currently centres on whether formal validation processes are required to progress potency categorisation at the OECD level, and if so how many categories and with what threshold levels. Political niceties here represent a barrier to progressing improvements in human health protection.
