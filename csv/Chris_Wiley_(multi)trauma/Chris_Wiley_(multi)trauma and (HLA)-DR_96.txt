AB  - A 60-year-old non atopic was referred to our Unit due to the onset of severe eczematous contact dermatitis on the lumbar region, following repeated applications of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) with flurbiprofen for lumbar pain. Patch testing with the SIDAPA (Italian Society of Allergological, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology) standard series, the TTS as is and the constituents of TTS, including flurbiprofen 2% pet., isopropyl myristate 5% pet., polysorbate 80 5% pet., sorbitan sesquioleate 20% pet., peppermint oil 2% pet. and menthol 1% pet. gave a strong positive reaction to TTS, peppermint oil and menthol and a weak reaction to fragrance mix. Allergic contact dermatitis to peppermint oil and its principal constituent (menthol) is rare. Isolated cases of patients with oral symptoms after the use of mentholated cigarettes, toothpaste flavours and fragrances have been reported. Peppermint oil and menthol are used in TTS with anti-inflammatory activity for their anesthetic properties and their vasodilatation effects that aid topical drug penetration. Reapplication of the device to the same site, the irritant action of the vehicle or adhesive, the length of occlusion, associated with warm and humid climates, may promote sensitization to menthol otherwise rarely a cause of contact dermatitis, when used in products designed for a brief contact with the oral mucosa. In contact allergies induced by TTS-treatment patch tests are needed to make a precise identification of the causative agent.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.

AB  - Background:? Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a burning and painful sensation of the mouth and perioral tissues. Despite several research its causes remain unknown. The treatment of BMS continues to be a challenge. This study investigated the relation between allergy to metals and long-term outcomes in 5 patients with BMS. Methods:? We studied 12 consecutive patients who had received a diagnosis of the BMS (ranging in age from 35 to 71). Mean duration of BMS symptoms was 10 months. We did patch-testing in all patients with dental series. We measured the saliva metal concentrations in each subjects. Of the 12 patients studied, 5 had symptoms which appeared to be related to type 3 BMS. Thus, they were assigned to total metals alloy removal procedures because allergic to at least one metal and had high levels of metals in saliva. No subjects had been receiving drug therapy. The primary outcome was the relief of BMS symptoms. Patients were followed for an average of 1.6 years. Findings:? Of the 5 patients who underwent to total metal alloy removal, 4 had a complete remission and one had showed notable improvement of his symptoms. Three patients were allergic to mercury. Two patients showed an allergy to gold. The saliva mercury and gold levels were significantly over the threshold limit. We also noted in three patients a full recovery of systemic dermatologic manifestations associated with BMS. Conclusions:? We believe that our exploratory investigation adds evidence that allergy to dental metals are involved in BMS.

AB  - The hairless guinea pig offers the possibility of performing irritant studies without the use of depilatory agents or clipping. Studies have shown a response to allergens and simple irritants comparable to that of the haired guinea pig. Histoanatomical studies have demonstrated differences in cutaneous structure in the two strains, differences that might influence the response to mild irritants such as topical drug vehicles. The purpose of this study was to compare the usability of hairless (HLGP) and shaved haired guinea pigs (SGP) in tolerability studies of complex topical formulations. The tolerability of 6 selected skin care formulations (SCF), known to cause a differentiated irritative response in HLGP, was studied in 15 male SGP and 15 male HLGP. All animals were treated on a 5???5?cm area on each flank twice daily for 4 consecutive days with SCF. The irritant effects of the SCF were quantified clinically and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and colorimetry (a*-parameter). Both species were able to differentiate between SCF in relation to skin tolerance and although the response pattern was somewhat different in the two species the ranking of the SCF was essentially the same using TEWL and clinical scoring. However, colorimetry was found to be unsuited for the evaluation of cutaneous irritation in the SGP over a period of days as regrowth of fur obfuscated the underlying erythema. In conclusion the HLGP appears to be a more suitable model for tolerability testing of composite formulations.

AB  - Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD) from hydrolysed wheat protein (HWP) is rarely reported in the literature. We describe 2 cases of ACD to this new allergen. Case1- A 39-year-old non atopic woman presented with a dermatitis of the face, mainly eyelids and neck. She had been using a new cosmetic cream for 2 months. The lesions subsided with topical corticosteroids. Patch tests with the standard, cosmetic, fragrance series and with her own products gave positive reactions only to the new cosmetic cream. We also tested all the components of this cream and only HWP gave a doubtful reaction with occlusive tests and positive reaction with ROAT. Case 2 ? A 48-year-old atopic woman presented with a dermatitis of the face and hands for 1 month. She had been using a new cosmetic cream for 11 months and kept using the product without any suspicion. The dermatitis subsided with cetirizine and topical corticosteroids. Patch tests with the standard, cosmetic, fragrance series and her own products revealed positive reactions to the cosmetic cream. Again, testing all the components of the cream, only HWP gave doubtful reactions with occlusive tests and positive reactions with ROAT. Discussion:? In recent years, a number of protein hydrolysates have been introduced into cosmetic manufacture. HWP is being used in cosmetic creams for its moisturizing properties. As far as we know, there is only one previously reported case of ACD induced by this allergen. More cases may be expected.

AB  - Occupational exposure to monoterpenes occurs in saw mills, particle-board plants, carpentry shops and other types of wood-treating industries. The bicyclic monoterpene delta-3-Carene, one of the components of turpentine, may irritate the skin and muceous membranes and prolonged exposure may result in allergic contact dermatitis or chronic lung function impairment. The effects of low concentrations of delta-3-Carene on alveolar macrophages in vitro were examined and a dose-dependent relationship between the cell viability and the delta-3-Carene concentration was found. Little is known about the metabolism of delta-3-Carene in mammalians. In order to determine the toxic potential of this monoterpene we studied the human metabolism of delta-3-Carene in vitro. Therefore we used pooled human liver S9 and human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes. By using GC-MS analysis we found one main metabolite produced at high rates. The structure was identified by its mass spectra. The mass fragmentation indicated hydroxylation in allyl position. After synthesis of the assumed product in a four step reaction, it was characterized as delta-3-Carene-10-ol. There was a clear correlation between the concentration of the metabolite production, incubation time and enzyme concentration, respectively. Kinetic analysis showed that Km and Vmax values for the oxidation of delta-3-Carene by human liver microsomes were 0.39??M and 0.2?nmol/min/nmol P450. It is the first time that delta-3-Carene-10-ol is described as human metabolite of delta-3-Carene.

AB  - Objectives:? To compare the cumulative irritancy potential of adapalene gel, 0.1% to that of tretinoin gel, 0.025% following repeated applications to the skin of human volunteers of different ethnic origins. Methods:? Single center study, randomized, investigator blind, intra-individual, comparison in healthy volunteers, 18 years of age and older. Volunteers were randomized to apply each product daily to one or the other half-face for 21 days. On the forearms products were applied under occlusive conditions for 4 days. Criteria for evaluation were signs and symptoms (erythema, desquamation, dryness, stinging/ burning, pruritus) on the face and on the forearms (irritation, stinging/burning, pruritus, and biophysical measurements: colorimetry-a* and Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)). Overall safety evaluation was based on adverse events information collected throughout the study. Results:? Seventy-three (73) volunteers from 4 ethnic groups (Chinese, European, Indian and Malaysian volunteers) were randomized. On the face the between treatment differences in olerability parameters were similar in all ethnic groups, thus allowing to conclude that adapalene was significantly better tolerated than tretinoin in all ethnic groups. This also allowed us to compare overall irritation susceptibility of different ethnic groups using the sum of clinical sign scores. An overall ethnic effect could be shown (p?<?0.001): Chinese being most susceptible (33.5), followed by Indians (26.9), Malaysians (23.6) and Europeans (14.1). Forearm evaluations showed significantly better tolerability for adapalene than for tretinoin. However in each patient TEWL measurements correlated poorly with clinical assessments. Throughout the study more treatment related adverse events occurred with tretinoin than with adapalene. Conclusions:? ?Adapalene gel, 0.1%showed a better cutaneous tolerability and safety profile than tretinoin gel, 0.025% for all four ethnic groups. An interethnic difference in the irritation susceptibility could be shown.

AB  - Objective:? Recently, several investigators claimed that thimerosal is one of the most irrelevant allergens existing in screening for contact dermatitis. Methods:? 508 patients who were suspected to have allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested at our clinic. They completed a questionnaire including medical, demographic and occupational details. We used the standart tray of Chemotechniqe Diagnostics (MalmÖ, Sweden) and additional series which were case relevant. The relevance of the allergic reaction to thimerosal was scored from 1?6. Results:? ?19 patients (3.7%) had an allergic reaction to thimerosal. Six (31.5%) had a definite relevance and eight (42.1%) had a probable relevance. Only three patients (15.8%) had an irrelevant reaction. SPIN value was 2281. We found a high proportion of mechanics (42.1%) among the patients who had positive reaction to thimerosal (P?<?0.0001). Conclusion:? Although previous reports found thimerosal highly irrelevant, our daily experience being supported by the above data, indicates that positive reactions to thimerosal could be relevant for many patients.

AB  - Objectives:? To investigate the elicitation potency of chloroatranol ? a newly identified allergen in the natural fragrance extract: oak moss absolute. Further to compare chloroatranol and atranol and relate the findings to exposure assessed by chemical analysis. Methods:? A serial dilution patch and repeated open application test was performed in 13 chloroatranol sensitized patients and in 10 healthy controls. Further the relative potency between chloroatranol and atranol in equimolar patch test concentrations was studied and exposure assessed by chemical analysis (liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry) of perfumes on the European Market. Results:? Elicitation occurred in 92%(12/13) to the repeated open application of 5 ppm chloroatranol in ethanol within 14 days of exposure and in none of the controls (p?<?0.001). Patch testing with eqimolar concentrations of chloroatranol and atranol indicated almost similar elicitation potency. Exposure assessment showed that chloroatranol and atranol were widespread in perfumes. Chloroatranol was found at 10 ppm and atranol 74 ppm (90% percentiles). Conclusions:? Chloroatranol and atranol are strong elicitors. The current exposure to these fragrance allergens in perfumes is likely to cause clinical symptoms in sensitised individuals.

AB  - The Dutch government has recently taken initiatives to improve the protection of labourers against diseases which are related to their work, and most especially, to reduce the rapidly increasing number of patients who have to definitely stop working and who, eventually, end up being dependent on social welfare. Firstly, a number of new laws have been adopted which define the responsibilities of both the employers and the employees. Secondly the cooperation is stimulated between the Dermatologist and the Occupational Health Physician of the patient. The latter is (according to law) employed by the employer of the patient and regularly visits the place of work. We now had the opportunity to treat and study both the social, medical and occupational aspects of a patient?s case simultaneously. We decided to eliminate the existing hesitation of consulting or referring, as well as the barriers created by matters of procedure, bureaucracy and waiting lists. In our paper we discuss the above-mentioned laws and regulations, and the way in which cooperation takes place between the doctors. We will present figures showing the effects of this approach on sickleave.

AB  - Aims: To study long-term prognosis of hand eczema and to identify factors of importance for the prognosis. Methods: A cohort of 1238 individuals with verified hand eczema diagnosis was established by a population-based prevalence study in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1982?83. In 1998 a questionnaire was mailed to all individuals with available addresses (n?=?1115). The response ratio was 78%(868/1115). Results: 66% reported periods of hand eczema since 1983, and 44% during the past year. 12% stated continuous symptoms. No significant difference was found between the sexes. 74% of those who reported symptoms after 1983 considered that their hand eczema had improved. Significant differences in the persistence of hand eczema were related to the age at onset of hand eczema, skin atopy, and the extension of eczema at examination. Contact allergy related significantly to occurrence of hand eczema during the year before follow-up. 32% had visited a doctor, 7% reported sick leave periods, 2% sick pension and 3% change of occupation due to hand eczema. Conclusions: In this population-based study, a majority of individuals with hand eczema reported periods of eczema during a 15-year follow-up, implying that hand eczema is a longstanding disease. Young age at onset, history of childhood eczema and extension of the hand eczema were prognostic factors. Hand eczema did entail consequences like change of occupation, sick leave or pension in more than 10% during a 15-year period.

AB  - Since heroin is delivered to a selected group of drug addicts under supervision of nurses in the Netherlands, we reported about several nurses who presented with work-related eczema and positive patch tests to heroin. To investigate the prevalence of heroin contact allergy among all workers in this heroin delivery project, a study was started using questionnaires. Altogether 31 nurses reported work-related complaints out of 100 who returned questionnaires. Besides reports of eczema, mainly of eyelids (probably airborne) and hands, there were mucosal and respiratory complaints. Patch tests were performed in 25 nurses with complaints; in 9 of them a heroin contact allergy could be confirmed. In 6 out of these 9 nurses this was combined with mucosal or respiratory complaints. There were also 6 nurses with mucosal or respiratory complaints without a contact allergy. Contact dermatitis from opioids, such as morphine and codeine, has been documented among opioid industry workers, nurses, doctors, pharmacists, and in patients. In conclusion heroin appears to be a potent contact allergen, causing contact dermatitis. Mucosal and respiratory complaints however, cannot be explained by this contact allergy; they might be caused by a type-1-allergy to heroin, or by a direct histamine liberating effect. Opioids are known histamine liberators causing urticaria, rhinitis and anaphylactoid reactions; therefore intracutaneous tests with heroin are unreliable. In an ongoing research project it will be attempted to detect specific IgE to heroin in the 12 workers with mucosal or respiratory complaints; within the next few months results will be available.

AB  - Capsicum peppers are widespread both in and out the kitchen. ?Human hand? is a contact dermatitis resulting from the direct handling of peppers. Capsaicin also is found in topical agents for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and arthritis. The oleoresin of capsicum is considered a powerfull irritant capable to induce irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunological contact urticaria. A 81 year-old man with a severe itchy macular and papular rash induced by Capsidol? initially located over the shoulder and sudden spread over the thorax is presented. A dense dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate and spongiosis suggested the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Negative open tests and a positive patch test reaction (++ 96 hours) using the trade cream Capsidol?(capsaicin 5%) led us to contact with the Pharmaceutical Company Viñas. They provided us the components of the cream: capsaicin, isopropyl myristate, estearic acid (DERVACID 3148), propylene glycol, glycerin monomyristate (ESTOL3650GMM), AMPHISOL K, Cetyl alcohol (NACOL 16?85), benzyl alcohol, diazolidinyl urea (GERMALL II), p-hydroxybenzoate?methylsodium (NIPAGIN M sódic), p-hydroxybenzoate propyl (NIPASOL M). Capsaicin in benzyl alcohol at 0,075% was open tested with negative results. Only patch test with capsaicin was positive (++) at 48/96 hours and the excipient components at the appropiate concentrations were all negative. Patch test biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. Twenty controls showed negative results. This case is probably an allergic reaction but shows how still remains difficult to distinguish among allergic and irritative cutaneous reactions.

AB  - The current spectrum of contact allergens in metalworking fluids (MWF) is illustrated based on (I) recent patch test data from the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) concerning metalworkers tested in 2002/2003 due to suspected MWF dermatitis, (II) a study on occupational contact allergies performed in the IVDK 1999?2001 (FaSt study), (III) a patch test study in five centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) with components of MWF not routinely tested, and (IV) information from the interdisciplinary task force on allergy diagnostics in the metal branch. Potential allergens are found in various MWF components, mainly in emulsifiers, rust preventing agents, preservatives, and anti-wear-additives. Various special additives also may contain potential allergens. Currently, the most important MWF allergens are: ? oxidation products from resin acids, e.g. abietic acid, in distilled tall oil, a frequently used base material of MWF. Contact allergy to these is detected by patch testing with colophony. ? monoethanolamine, diglycolamine ? used as rust preventing agents and emulsifiers. ? formaldehyde and various formaldehyde releasers, mainly oxazolidine derivatives ? used as biocides. Other biocides, e.g. Methylchloroisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), Benzisothiazolinone (BIT) or Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) are also used in MWF and should hence be tested routinely. While odour masks for MWF are available, little is known about the extent of their usage. However, this allergen source should be considered in cases of fragrance allergy. Cobalt apparently is a relevant MWF allergen only in carbid metal processing.

AB  - Occupationally-induced reactions to medicaments occur in two exposed groups. The group that we discuss consists of employees of pharmaceutical and chemical companies involved in the production of drugs. We describe some patients who developed allergic contact dermatitis to specific drugs. Two of them we related to occupational exposure to simvastatin and other to n-acetyl-cysteina. Also one to diphendiprone. The diagnosis of airborne contact dermatitis was confirmed by patch test in all cases. We will do a review in this aspect on occupational contact dermatitis to foccus attention on the increasing importance of this aspect in pharmaceutical workers.

AB  - For new chemicals introduced into the workplace or marketplace, and which come into contact with the skin, it is necessary, to conduct a thorough skin safety testing and risk assessment program to be certain that the exposures will be well tolerated. One vital risk assessment process involves the determination of allergic skin reactions, referred to as skin sensitization, the clinical manifestation of which is allergic contact dermatitis. The process by which low molecular weight chemicals induce and elicit skin sensitization is dependent on many factors including the ability of the chemical to penetrate the skin, react with protein, and trigger a cell-mediated immune response. Based on our chemical, cellular and molecular understanding of allergic contact dermatitis, it is possible to carry out a quantitative risk assessment. It has been well known for years that chemical allergens display dose-response characteristics regardless of whether the sensitization is induced in an experimental system or in humans. Moreover, it is well known that the critical exposure determinant for evaluating skin sensitization risk is dose per unit area of skin exposed. The skin sensitization testing and risk assessment process for new ingredients and consumer products generally follows a step-wise approach that may involve structure-activity evaluations, analytical assessments, preclinical skin sensitization testing (e.g., the mouse local lymph node assay), confirmatory clinical testing (e.g., the human repeat insult patch test), and benchmarking of resulting data against similar ingredients and product types. Essential elements for conducting a sound risk assessment involve the development of an understanding of the sensitization potential of the contact allergen and the likely dose, nature, extent and duration of exposure. With an understanding of the exposure and potency of the chemical one can assess whether the chemical, under the specific conditions of exposure, ould pose an acceptable or unacceptable risk of induction of skin sensitization. As with any test method or risk assessment approach, it is critical to understand the strengths and limitations so that one can conduct the best assessment possible and assure the skin safety of the chemical under evaluation.

AB  - A 35-year-old woman presented with a 8-month history of scaling, hyperkeratotic and fissured lesions of the fingertips of the first three fingers of both the hands. She referred the healing of the dermatitis during the summer holidays. She was employed in a small firm where she was used to glue together silver components with glass ones of decorative pieces. For this aim, she applied a glue (Loxeal UV 30?20) cured by exposition to UV light coming from a proper lamp. The material safety data sheet (MSDS) indicated that the glue contained hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA). Patch tests performed with the standard SIDAPA series gave negative results; patch tests carried out with an additional one (acrylic adhesive series) showed positive reactions towards glue components (HEMA,HPMA) and towards other acrylates (possible cross-reacting). An inspection performed in the work-place showed that the patient was in contact with the glue not only when she applied it on the components, but particularly when she handled the bottle cap (splashed with the glue) in its opening and closing. After the changing of her occupation, the patient has not presented relapse of the dermatitis. The UV-cured acrylic resins are known for some time to be a frequent cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in dentists and in printing industry. The case reported shows a different exposition source towards these resins, i.e. from UV-cured acrylate adhesive employed for sticking metal pieces with glass ones.

AB  - Background/objectives:? Prevention of hand dermatitis among nurses can be achieved by reduction of wet work exposure. Kwodledge about the amout of wet work in nursing is import implementing hand dermatitis prevention plans. Wet work exposure in nursing can be assessed by questionnaire or observation. Method:? Duration and frequency of wet work activities were assessed by a questionnaire in a population of 1471 nurses.In addition a randomly chosen sample of 53 nurses from this population was observed on duration and frequency of wet work during 112 different morning shifts. Results:? questionnaire: wet work between 26 minutes (at a dialysis ward) and 100 minutes (in nursing homes). For frequency a range between 12 and 21 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts was reported. In nursing homes and regular wards gloves were reported to be used less than once during a shift. Observation:? A duration of wet work of 10 minutes (dialysis ward), 28 minutes (regular ward) and 19 minutes (I.C.-unit) and 45 minutes in a nursing home. Frequency: between 19 and 43 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts. Conclusions:? A questionnaire does not accurately assess the quantity of wet activities; it overestimates the duration of wet work and underestimates the frequency of wet work. On regular wards the exposure to irritants is mainly associated with the frequency of wet hands instead of the duration of wet hands. On specialised care units skin exposure is mainly a matter of occlusion by gloves.

AB  - Introduction:? Nail varnishes are well-known sensitizers, and the most frequent allergen is nowadays tosylamide/formaldehyde resin (TFR). We present 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) due an unusual ingredient. Case reports:? The 1st patient presented with atopic dermatitis that progressively worsened, involving face and neck for several months. The 2nd patient had history of occupational allergy to glutaraldehyde, and presented with head and neck dermatitis. The 3rd patient had severe onycholysis and dermatitis of perionychium, face, neck and décolleté. European standard series was negative in all patients, as was TFR, (meth-) acrylates and cosmetic series when tested. Patch tests with patient?s own varnish(es) were ++, and breakdown identified phthalic anhydride/trimellitic anhydride/glycols copolymer (PTG) as the allergen (tested 1 to 5% pet.). Discussion:? PTG results of condensation of phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, ethylene glycol, and neopentyl glycol monomers. It belongs to the copolymer class, and is used in confection of nail polish and enamels, like TFR or phthalic anhydride/glycerine/glycidyl decanoate copolymer. Our patients had long lasting dermatitis, common in ACD to nail varnishes. Sensitivity was proved by patch testing with patient?s own cosmetics. Allergic contact dermatitis to PTG seems to be rare, but has to be considered particularly in patients with negative standard patch tests. An alternative is the use of tosylamide/formaldehyde-based nail polish.
