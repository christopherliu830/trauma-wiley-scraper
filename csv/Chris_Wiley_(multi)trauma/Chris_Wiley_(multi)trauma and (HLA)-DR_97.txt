AB  - The WHO criteria for drug allergy can be adapted as guidelines for primary sensitisation from consumer products or occupational exposures. In case a person with a formerly healthy skin, develops allergic contact dermatitis after a specific exposure (a product or occupational exposure) has a positive patch test to specific chemical present in the product and ideally a positive either patch test or use test to the product during re-exposure primary sensitisation is likely. Allergic contact sensitisation is a unique toxicological event (e.g. compared to cancer) as there is a direct (time and skin area) correlation between exposure and disease and the basic damage on the individual can be identified by the diagnostic patch test. Primary sensitisation may occur after single exposure to potent allergens, experimental from DNCB, in the US poison ivy, occupational accidental exposure to isothiazolones (in%) or from hair dying with PPD and its derivatives as a flare-up reaction occurring 1?2 weeks after the original exposure. The ongoing epidemic caused by methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDGN) provides unique options for studying primary sensitisation from consumer products as the clinical reactions are often very severe and patch test reaction with the products often exceeds the strength of the standard patch test response. Chemical analysis of the products involved uniformly illustrates the presence of MDGN within the legal permitted concentration. At the start of the epidemic, primary sensitisation was mostly seen from leave on products. After EU actions in 2002 against the use of MDGN in leave on products primary sensitisation from this preservative is now caused by wash off products. This observation is significant as it underscores the effect of specific exposures for primary sensitisation from consumer products but also the fact that primary sensitisation from a moderate to strong hapten is possible from wash off products. The MDGN story has illustrated that human data are pivotal for the current risk assessment ? risk management. No new chemical should be permanently permitted in consumer products before significant post marketing data, collected after stringent criteria, are public available and scrutinised by an independent scientific committee. Human sensitisation data has successfully been used to introduce regulation of nickel exposure from consumer items. The year 2000 EU regulation has been in use in Denmark for more than 10 years. A significant decline in both induction and elicitation of dermatitis from nickel releasing items has been observed. Health economists have calculated that the direct savings from the regulation amount to 1.2 bill Euro over a 20-year period in a population of 5.2. mio individuals. Translated to the whole EU-region substantial gains can be achieved by improving the contact allergy risk assessment ? risk management process.

AB  - Background:? Occupational hand eczema is mainly characterised by bilateral manifestation whereas one-sided hand involvement is unusual. Subject:? We report on a 38-year old dental technician who presented with interdigital skin alterations of the left hand resistant to previous eczematous treatment. Main professional task was the production and processing of plaster or plastic dental models. While handling with dental models like smoothing by the left hand, usually this one was splashed with plaster. On clinical examination the patient showed additionally scaly lesions on the soles. Results:? No sensitisation could be ascertained performing patch and prick tests. By normal IgE-level, no specific antibodies against aeroallergens or occupational allergens such as isocyanates, formaldehyde or latex could be found. Mycological cultures of scaly lesions of the left hand and soles revealed an infection with Trichophyton rubrum. In accordance with the subjective perception, the starch-iodine test showed the left hand more sweating. We diagnosed a ?two feet-one hand syndrome? and achieved healing after local antimycotical treatment. Conclusions:? In case of one-sided, suspicious work-related skin alterations of the hands, a ?two feet-one hand syndrome?(i.e. bilateral plantar tinea in coexistence with a unilateral tinea manuum) should be considered as differential diagnosis. A common explanation for the fungal infection of one hand is the scratching of the already infected soles. However, within occupational fields little is published about the ?two feet-one hand syndrome.? An asymmetric increased palmar sweating and a one-sided chronic professional burden of the hands are discussed as predisposing factors for the unilateral fungal infection.

AB  - This is part of an ongoing effort to investigate how autoxidation affects the sensitzing potential of terpene-based fragrances. We have previously shown that terpenes such as abeitic acid (diterpene), limonene and linalool (monoterpenes) form stable hydroperoxides when oxidized. These hydroperoxides have proved to be strong allergens. Its therefore of special interest to study the connection between formation of hydroperoxides caused by autoxidation of fragrance chemicals during handling and storage and an increased allergenic effect. Objective:? To investigate the autoxidation of caryophyllene (sesquiterpene) and study its effect on the sensitizing capacity. Methods:? Caryophyllene was exposed to air and the autoxidation was monitored by GC and HPLC. The major oxidation products were isolated and their structure determined. The allergenic activity of pure caryophyllene and its oxidation products was investigated in animal assays and clinical testing. Result:? Only 10% of the staring material remained after 20 weeks of air exposure. The major oxidation product was caryophyllene oxide. Substantial amounts of formaldehyde were found in the oxidation mixture. Little or no hydroperoxides were detected in the total oxidation mixture. Caryophyllene oxide and oxidized caryophyllene showed a low sensitizing capacity in animals and very few positive reactions at patch testing. Conclusion:? Caryophyllene is easily oxidized at air exposure. A low allergenic effect is observed in both sensitization studies and clinical testing. This is consistent with our earlier findings that the amount of hydroperoxides is important for the allergenic activity of autoxidized terpenes.

AB  - Introduction:? Cutaneous reactions due to use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are frequently described. In the Contact Unit from the Department of Dermatology of Juan Canalejo Hospital, we compiled all cases studied during 4 years (from 2000 to 2003) to analyze the incidence, frequency and type of reactions derived from NSAIDs use. Material and methods:? We used a NAIDs battery (Aristegui lab.?) on 55 patients with clinical suspicion of adverse reaction from NSAIDs. We performed epicutaneous study on 17 and additional photoallergic study, after UVA irradiation (from 5 to 7,5?J/cm2), on 38 cases. In some cases we patched the drug used by patient as is and/or the active substance provided by the laboratory if it was not included on NSAIDs battery. Readings were done following ICDRG criteria at 48 and 96 hours on patch tests and 24 and 72 hours on photopatch tests. Healthy controls were patched. Results:? 22 patients showed positive test: 15 cases were diagnosed as photoallergic dermatitis (etofenamate 5; dexketoprofen 4; ketoprofen 3; piroxicam 2; diclophenac 2 and aceclophenac 1). Five cases were explained as allergic contact dermatitis (etofenamate 2; fepradinol 2 and phenylbutazone 1) and two cases of fixed drug eruption from piroxicam were found. Conclusion:? In this study we observed that cutaneous reactions due to ketoprofen and piroxicam are still high. It is important to note the high incidence of allergic and photoallergic reactions from dexketoprofen, a recently introduced NSAID, reporting always a cross reaction between ketoprofen and dexketoprofen.

AB  - Commercial dental restorative materials were analysed in order to get information about the occurrence and amounts of sensitizing acrylates and methacrylates. The analytical results were compared to information given in the safety data sheets. Acetone soluble methacrylates of seven bonding materials, eight composite resins and two glass ionomers were identified by gas chromatography with mass selective detection and quantified by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The most frequently occurring methacrylates in the bonding materials were 2-hydroxyethylmetharylate (2-HEMA) in the concentration range 0.3?28% and 2,2-bis(4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy)phenyl)-propane (bisGMA) in the concentration range 21?40%. BisGMA and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) were the most frequently occurring methacrylates in composite resins. Their concentration ranges were 5.8?21% and 3.2?6.7% respectively. The main methacrylate of the two glass ionomers was 2-HEMA (23%) or trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA, 9%). Information about methacrylates was given in the safety data sheets for about half of the products that according to the analysis results contained methacrylates. Safety data sheets need to be improved so that the health risks for dental personnel can be reliably asessed and controlled.

AB  - Objective:? Exposure to adhesives and glues is common in occupation. We here analyse the data of patients with suspected contact dermatitis (CD) from glues recorded within the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK). Methods:? Data recorded between 1996 and 2001 within the IVDK were searched for patients who underwent patch testing because of suspected contact dermatitis from glues. Results:? Overall data of 829 patients were found, among them 336 with occupational skin disease. Allergic CD was diagnosed in 171/336 patients (50.9%), irritant CD in 24.7%. CD was mostly localized on the hands (72.6%), followed by the face (13.4%) and arms (3.9%). By far the most common cause of an allergic patch-test reaction was epoxy resin (EP): 18.2%(age- and sex-standardized proportion of sensitization) reacted to the standard EP based on diglycidylether of bisphenol A. reactive diluents and hardeners which elicited a positive patch-test reaction in >?5% of the patients were phenyl glycidylether and 4,4?diamino diphenylmethane respectively. Cresyl glycidylether was positive in 4.9%. (Meth-)acrylates which showed an allergic patch-test reaction in >= 5% of the patients were 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, BIS GMA and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. Colophony was positive in 8.3% and p-tert-butylphenol formaldehyde resin in 4.1% of the patients respectively. Conclusion:? In our collective allergic CD was nearly 2-fold more frequent than irritant CD in patients with occupational CD from glues, epoxy resin components being the most important allergens.

AB  - To understand the mechanisms involved in immunological tolerance to skin-associated proteins, we have developed trangenic (Tg) mice that express a model self antigen, membrane-bound chicken ovalbumin (OVA), under the control of a keratin 14 (K14) promoter. We have characterized these mice and have shown that their skin serves as an excellent target for CD8+ T cells from OVA-specific T cell receptor Tg (OT-I) mice. When the K14 OVA transgenic mice are crossed with the OT-I mice they no longer serve as targets for the OT-I CD8+ T cells from the OT-I mice. This paradox is due to peripheral tolerance that is exhibited by the double Tg mice. I will discuss these two models and describe studies that are attempting to determine the mechanism of this peripheral tolerance.

AB  - Para-phenylenediamine (PPD), an arylamine dye, is a strong allergen causing allergic contact dermatitis. Cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1beta are key mediators in the initiation of this reaction. Both cytokines are predominantly produced by stimulated monocytes and macroghages. We investigated the responses of PPD and Bandrowski's base (BB), an autoxidation product of PPD in human monocytes. We isolated monocytes from healthy volunteers and incubated them with the allergens. TNF-α and IL-1beta mRNA expression and protein levels were estimated after 45?min, 2?h, 4?h and 24?h after allergen contact. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were measured in cell culture supernatants by ELISA (n?=?7) and mRNA expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. We found that PPD reduced TNF-α protein secretion by 20?69.9%(n?=?6). Further, IL-1beta levels were decreased by 44?98%. The same tendency was found studying IL-1beta and TNF-α mRNA steady state levels (n?=?3; 1?h incubation). These effects were substance-specific and not found for PPD derivatives nor for the autoxidation product BB. These findings suggest that PPD may specifically modify immune responses by directly infering with the cellular proinflammatory cytokine network. This study was supported by the EU.

AB  - The critical factor in determining if an alloy may induce metal sensitisation or elicit allergic contact dermatitis is the release rate of soluble metal ions of allergenic metals at the skin surface. Metals or alloys in direct and prolonged contact with body fluids may result in electrochemical reactions (commonly called corrosion) that release metal ions. Induction or elicitation of metal allergy results if a sufficient amount of metal ions are released and absorbed through the skin where they react with the human immune system. The virtual insolubility of most metals and alloys in aqueous media (including body fluids) limits the bioavailability of metal ions. Several factors influence the rate of corrosion: metal or alloy metallurgical structure, surface films, surface finish, geometry, process history, and composition; body fluid composition, amount, pH, electrolytic properties, dissolved oxygen and other gas content; and the service environment (e.g. temperature, flow rate, etc). A review of recently published studies on metal allergy from a metallurgical perspective provides information that helps explain why certain metals and alloys cause allergic reactions and others (e.g. most stainless steels) do not. This information is useful in predicting what alloys will cause allergic reactions under varying conditions. In order to predict allergic reactions and responses to metals and alloys, metallurgical aspects of ion release should be taken into account. This presentation will increase understanding and interpretation of results of clinical or other scientific studies (e.g. studies in vitro) of reactions and responses to metals and alloys by providing a metallurgical perspective.

AB  - A history of reacting to jewellery contact on the skin is a common symptom of nickel allergy; wearing cheap jewellery is a common cause of nickel sensitization. We analyzed nickel release from 770 white gold jewels with different shape and karatage from the Italian market. Jewels were stored in artificial sweat for 1 week at 30?C and nickel in sweat after the release procedure was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma detection (ICP), according to the European Standard EN1811 ?Reference test method for release of nickel?. Nickel release was above 0,5??g/cm/week in 157 jewels (20,4%), between 0,5??g/cm/week and 0,1??g/cm/week in 163 (21,2%) and below 0,1??g/cm/week in 450 (58,4%). Nickel release was above 0,5??g/cm/week in 132 out of 432 (30,6%) 14 (or lower) karat gold jewels and in 25 out of 338 (7,4%) 18 karat gold jewels suggesting an inverse relationship between nickel release and karatage. However, when comparing jewels with the same karatage, we found no clear relationship between nickel content and nickel release in the 256 items of which the exact alloy composition was known. Data seem to indicate that other factors, besides nickel content, such as ratio between nickel and other elements, presence of grain refiners and homogenization state of the alloy play a crucial role in nickel release.

AB  - Background:? Studies in Gothenburg, Sweden, reported unexpectedly high rates, 0.35?1.66%, of late occurring itching nodules at the site of injection of aluminium containing vaccines. Among 455 children with itching nodules after vaccination, 352 had a positive epicutaneous test to aluminium. When switching to a new booster diphtheria-tetanus vaccine in Sweden these findings warranted a comparative study of local itching nodules that had remained at least 2 months after injection, and of aluminium contact allergy. Methods:? A prospective cluster randomised study was done in 25,232 10-year-olds. Participating schools in each municipality were randomised in a 1/1 ratio to use the old diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT) vaccines, Duplex? or the new vaccine, diTeBooster?. Parental reports 6 months after vaccination were obtained for 22,365 (88%) pupils in 851 schools. Patch testing with aluminium chloride-hexahydrate was performed in 9 children with an itching nodule, 6 children only pruritus and 17 children without any itching nodule after the fourth dose of DT vaccine. Results:? We identified 3?6 children per 10000 with a local itching nodule persisting for at least 2 months. There were no significant differences between the vaccine groups. Contact allergy to aluminium was not detected. Conclusion:? Our findings support the use of the vaccine presently available in the Swedish vaccination program. Continued surveillance of persistent itching nodules after vaccination with different aluminium containing DT and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis toxoid (DTP) vaccines is however warranted.

AB  - Background:? Hydrochloric acid is formed in water solutions of gold trichloride. Hydrochloric acid in contact with aluminium generates hydrogen gas which can reduce and transform trivalent gold to elemental gold. Objective:? To investigate whether patch testing with aqueous gold trichloride can cause false positive (irritant) reactions in patients without contact allergy to gold and false negative reactions in patients with gold allergy. Methods:? 13 patients with and 13 patients without positive patch test reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate were tested with gold trichloride in 2 different vehicles, water and alkaline buffer, using 2 different test techniques, the Finn Chamber technique with aluminium chambers and van der Bend technique with polypropene chambers. Results:? Irritant patch test reactions were obtained with aqueous gold trichloride tested in van der Bend chambers in 10 patients without gold allergy. In gold-allergic patients no positive test reactions were obtained from aqueous gold trichloride in Finn chambers while 2 positive test reactions were obtained from gold trichloride in alkaline buffer tested in van der Bend chambers. Conclusion:? If gold trichloride is patch tested in wrong vehicle and with wrong test technique irritant test reactions may occur which can be misinterpreted as positive allergic reactions in patients without gold allergy as well as negative reactions in patients with gold allergy.

AB  - Objective:? In Sweden ketoprofen has been available for topical applications since 1995. Photoallergic contact dermatitis from ketoprofen has been reported since almost 20 years. Photoallergic contact dermatitis from ketoprofen-containing topical treatment usually includes severe eczematous reactions. Ketoprofen is an NSAID derived from propionic acid. Ketoprofen, fenofibrate and benzophenones are structurally similar. Methods:? Photopatch testing and patch testing with 2 standard series, the ketoprofen-containing gels and their ingredients, fenofibrate and benzophenones. Results:? During the last year 35 patients have been photopatch tested with ketoprofen with very strong photopatch test reactions. 26 patients also had positive reactions to fentichlor. 27 of the ketoprofen ? photoallergic patients had also been photopatch tested with fenofibrate, 17 had positive reactions. 21 had positive reactions to balsam of Peru and 13 to fragrance mix. Conclusion:? Ketoprofen is a strong photosensitizer.

AB  - A 28-year-old female analytical chemist visited our patch test clinic with initially complaints of severe hand dermatitis. Later on she developed rhinitis, bronchial asthma and tightness of the chest. The complaints seemed work related: her condition improved during holidays and on sick leaves. She worked in a laboratory with several platinum salts and used different kinds of gloves (latex, nitril, etc.). Methods:? Patch tests were performed with the European Standard series and prick tests with common inhalant allergens. Patch-, prick- and open patch tests were carried out with various aqueous dilutions of platinum chloride (PtCl2). Results:? Patch tests with 0.01?2% PtCl2 were positive on day 2, 3 and 6, and at 0.001% a follicular reaction was found. The prick-test was already positive at the lowest concentration tested (0.001%). The open patch test, carried out retro-auricular, showed a positive reaction at 1 and 2% PtCl2 after 20?min. Controls in healthy volunteers (n?=?5) were all negative. Discussion:? It is well known that platinum salts can cause type-I hypersensitivity reactions like allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma and urticaria, also referred to as platinosis. Contact dermatitis to platinum salts, however, is very rare. In our patch test clinic, 78 patients were tested between 1987 and 2001 with PtCl2 2%. Only 2 women showed a positive patch test for PtCl2. The patient presented here, stopped working with platinum salts and recovered from all complaints. We interpret our case as occupational type-I and type-IV hypersensitivity to platinum salts with mucosal and dermal manifestations.

AB  - In general, Irritant skin reactions are graded by using visual scoring method for the degree of erythema, edema and scaling. The main disadvantage of this method lacks objectivity and parametric properties. The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative evaluation method by using computerized color image analysis of skin erythema. We have described the objective measurement of the irritant skin responses by using skin surface color determination and compared it with the measurement by using traditional visual scoring method. Using R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue) value and CIE color parameters (L*a*b*) of digital camera image by using the software program, two kind of erythema index (?RG, ?ab) and change in total color (?E*ab) were calculated. ?RG value and ?ab in digital camera image were highly correlated with the degree of erythema than chromameter measurements. And ?ab (difference in color redness (a*) and yellow hue (b*)) with the exception of luminance (L* value) in CIE was well correlated than change in total color (?E*ab). Our data showed that erythema indices (?RG, ?ab) were good parameters for evaluation of skin erythema produced by irritant reaction.

AB  - Axillary dermatitis can be associated with the use of underarm products. However the unique physiology of this region makes assessment of irritation problematic. Furthermore, given the type of products used in the underarm, the friction and occlusive nature of the site, it is necessary not only to concentrate on the area of application ie the area of hair growth, but also to examine the periphery. There is evidence that products tend to move to this area during the day possibly as a consequence of axillary physiology and mechanical effects. Consequent upon these various factors, predicting axillary irritation from acute patch tests on back or arm skin is problematic. In a recent comparison, we found that where approximately 10% of panellists reacted to a formulation by patch test, 50% developed axillary reactions during a 21 day use test. In addition, not all those who reacted in the patch test reacted in the axilla. Predicting axillary effects from repeated open tests seems better but still has challenges; currently we are assessing alternative strategies to permit rapid identification of potential issues without recourse to extended in use tests.

AB  - Small rodent laboratory animals lack the complex cutaneous structure and function of human skin resulting in ?all or none?-responses to mild irritants so that the animals may show a less discriminative reaction pattern compared to human volunteers when studying the tolerability of topical drug formulations. This study compared the tolerance pattern of a 6 composite formulations (SCF A-F) in human volunteers and in hairless guinea pigs (HLGP). The formulations were 2 basic creams (A and B) and 4 composite creams containing either isopropyl palmitate (C), glycerin (D), canola oil (E) or (-)-alfa-bisabolol (F). The tolerability of 6 selected skin care formulations (SCF A-F), known to cause a differentiated irritative response in HLGP, was studied in 15 male SGP and 20 human volunteers. The HLGP were treated twice a day on a 5???5?cm area on each flank with a SCF for 4 consecutive days. The irritant effects of the SCF were quantified by clinical assessment, measurement of trans epidermal waterloss (TEWL) and colorimetry (a*-parameter). In humans the tolerability was evaluated clinically using the chamber scarification test. In HLGP SCF A and C were strong irritants followed closely by E, the remaining formulations were indistinguishable. In human volunteers all formulations were tolerated equally and well with the clinical score rising slightly on the first day and remaining stable thereafter. In conclusion, the HLGP appeared to be too sensitive, as formulations showing irritation in HLGP were well tolerated in a human.
