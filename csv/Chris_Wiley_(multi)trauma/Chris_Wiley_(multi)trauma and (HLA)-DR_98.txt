AB  - p-tert-Butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-F-R) is frequently reported to give positive patch test reactions with uncertain clinical relevance. A possible explanation is deficient knowledge of the sources of exposure. An analytical method for PTBP-F-R could be used to investigate products in the patient?s environment. Most individual PTBP-F-R substance constitute less than 1% w/w of the resin contributing to analytical difficulties. Objective:? To develop an analytical method for PTBP-F-R and to use it to investigate some patients? products. Methods:? 10 identified PTBP-F-R substances in silylated form were used as reference substances in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results:? The recording of ion chromatograms for the 3 largest mass peaks in the MS for each reference substance was used to avoid interference of disturbing substances. Demonstration of a PTBP-F-R substance was defined as the simultaneous detection the 3 defined mass peaks at the expected retention time and with the same relative intensities as found with the corresponding reference substance. A minimum criterion for the demonstration of PTBP-F-R was the demonstration of 3 PTBP-F-R substances. PRBP-F-R was demonstrated in watchstraps, shoes, glues and ECG-electrodes. p-tert-Butylcatechol, a PTBP-F-R substance but also an antioxidant, was demonstrated in: an ECG-electrode, watchstraps, a prosthesis, a protective mask, a glue, an oil for bikes and in a nail polish. Conclusion:? An analytical method for PTBP-F-R was developed, which when applied to products could show the presence of PTBP-F-R substances and PTBP-F-R in products and indicate contact of clinical relevance.

AB  - Phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) is an aromatic reactive diluent used in epoxy resin systems. The sensitizing capacity of PGE, as well as the cross-reactivity between PGE and the most important contact allergens in epoxy resins based on bisphenol A and bisphenol F, i.e. diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and the 3 isomers of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (p,p?-DGEBF, o,p?-DGEBF, and o,o?-DGEBF), were investigated in a guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Statistical significance was calculated with one-sided Fisher?s exact test. PGE was found to be a strong sensitizer (24/24 sensitized animals, p?<?0.001). Induction with DGEBA resulted in a statistically significant number of animals reacting to PGE (p?=?0.006), but when induced with PGE, the animals did not react significantly to DGEBA. When induced with PGE, significant numbers of animals reacted to p,p?-DGEBF (13/24 animals, p?=?0.0011) and o,p?-DGEBF (11/24 animals, p?=?0.004). Induction with p,p?-DGEBF and o,p?-DGEBF resulted in a high number of reacting animals when tested with PGE (23/24 animals, p?<?0.001 for both isomers). No statistically significant cross-reactivity between PGE and o,o?-DGEBF was found. Conclusion: According to our results in the GPMT, sensitization to DGEBA, which is the main constituent in the most common epoxy resin, may result in contact allergy to PGE, whereas sensitization to PGE seldom causes contact allergy to DGEBA. Sensitization to PGE may cause contact allergy to epoxy resins based on bisphenol F.

AB  - Background/objectives:? The health care sector is known for its high prevalence of hand dermatitis, mainly because of the high exposure to wet work in nursing activities. Wet work can be activities with wet skin and activities with glove use (skin occlusion). A prevention program to reduce wet work exposure should be based on knowledge about activities that are components of wet work. We observed the frequency and duration of skin exposures to irritants with nursing activities. Method:? Duration and frequency wet work activities were assessed in parts of the health care sector: 53 randomly chosen nurses were observed during their morning shift. Hand skin exposure to water, soap/detergents and occlusion by using gloves were recorded during 112 different 8-hour morning shifts. Results:? In nursing wet work activities make up 9%(dialysis ward), 16%(regular ward) and 24%(I.C.-unit) of the duration of one shift. On a regular ward duration of wet work is mainly divided into 34% patient washing, 31% glove use and 26% hand washing. These main wet work activities have a short exposure cycle of 1.4?3.6 minutes. Hand washing, excluding the use of hand alcohol, and patient washing (without gloves) form both one third of the frequency of wet work activities. Conclusions:? Wet work activities take up a substantial portion of nursing activities and are characterised by frequent short-term exposures. Effective prevention programs on reducing the risk of hand dermatitis in nursing should primarily focus on the high frequencies of hand washing and patient washing. Using gloves in the procedure of patient washing will reduce the frequency of exposure to water and soap with 24%, at the expense of increasing exposure to occlusion by these gloves.

AB  - Labels on cosmetics with statements such as ?recommended by dermatologists?, ?allergy-tested?, ?hypo-allergenic?, and more recently ?for use on intolerant? or for ?sensitive skin? have become very popular. Indeed, many ingredients are used precisely because of their low irritancy potential. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of contact allergic reactions from such cosmetic products. During the last few months several of these substances have been identified as allergens. Examples are: ? Alkylglucosides, e.g. coco-, decyl-, and laurylglucosides, which are condensation products of the corresponding fatty alcohols with glucose, are widely used as emulsifiers in skin-care products, mild surfactants and cleansing agents, as well as in fragrance products, hair dyes, sunscreens and tanning products. ? Ethylhexylglycerin (syn.: octoxyglycerin) is used as a skin conditioning agent (and for miscellaneous purposes). ? Methoxy PEG-17 and PEG-22/dodecyl glycol copolymers, which are alkoxylated alcohols and synthetic polymers, are used as emulsion stabilizers and suspending and viscosity-increasing agents, and also as skin-conditioning agents. ? Butylene glycol and pentylene glycol are aliphatic alcohols with applications similar to those of propylene glycol, which is considered to be more irritant and allergenic. These agents are widely used in a wide variety of cosmetic products because of their solvent, humectant and antibacterial effects. Butylene glycol is also usd as a fragrance ingredient and as a skin conditioner.

AB  - Background:? PTD, a component of oxidative hair dyes, is a frequent sensitizer in hairdressers. Investigations on the stability of the patch test preparation PTD 1% pet. revealed a decline of the PTD concentration to 0.1% within 6 months, possibly due to a reaction of PTD molecules to dye complexes. This raises the question if the long-term diagnostic quality of the PTD preparation is hampered by chemical changes. Objective:? To systematically compare intra-individually patch test results obtained with three PTD patch test preparations of different age, tested synchronously in a multicenter study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG). Methods:? 3 PTD preparations, produced in January 2002 (batch A), August 2001 (batch B), and April 2001 (batch C), were patch tested in 177 patients from March to December 2002. Patch testing was performed blinded, with respect to the production date. Results:? There were 150 concordant reactions to batch A, B, and C, i.e. 133 negative, 1 doubtful (?), 11 weak positive (+), 3 strong positive (++ and +++), and 2 irritant reactions. In 27 patients, discordant reactions to batch A, B, and C had been observed. Altogether, 22 positive reactions were noted to batch A, and 19 to batch B and C, respectively (difference not significant). There was no clear cut time trend concerning the occurrence of positive or discordant reactions. Conclusions:? Reproducibility of patch test reactions was within a normal range. The chemical changes mentioned above apparently do not affect the diagnostic quality of the PTD patch test preparation.

AB  - Objective:? The first Spanish patch-test study of patients with contact dermatitis was performed in 1977. We aimed to determine the prevalence of hypersensitivity for Spanish standard allergens in patients suspected of contact dermatitis in 2001. Methods:? A total of 3832 patients of 13 dermatological centers were patch-tested with Spanish standard series. Age, gender, occupation, dermatitis site and type, and positive patch test were tabulated. Results:? 2300 female and 1532 male patients, aged 0 to 70 years were observed with contact dermatitis. Origin of eczema was occupational in 16.66% of patients. Eczema was located on hands in 54.34% of cases. Allergic contact dermatitis in 31.02% and irritative contact dermatitis in 15.88% were the most frequent diagnosis. Positive patch tests was observed in 55.11% of patients. Prevalence of positives reaction was obtained with nickel (26.64%), cobalt (9.89%), chrome (8.66%), PPDA (5.27%), thimerosal (5.21%), fragance mix (5.03%), Kathon CG (4.04%) and thiuram mix (2.87%). Conclusions:? The results emphasize that nickel, cobalt, chrome are by far the most common allergens. A increase in the frequency of allergic patch test reactions to nickel has been noted (18,78 in 1977; 26,64 in 2001). However the contact sensitivity to cobalt, chrome and thiuram mix has decreased. Currently, allergy to cosmetics constitutes a significant portion of the cases of contact dermatitis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of contact sensitization to preservatives in a pediatric population and to compare the data to our previous findings referring to the period 1988?1994. From January 1995 to December 2002, 1255 patients aged 7 months-12 years, 583 boys and 672 girls, with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent patch testing with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including 5 different preservatives: methyldibromoglutaronitrile, methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, imidazolidinyl urea, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Of the 1255 children tested, 108 (8.6%), 52 boys and 56 girls, showed positive reactions to 1 or more of the preservatives listed above. In particular, 55 subjects reacted to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, 22 to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, 20 to paraben mix, 17 to formaldehyde, and 13 to imidazolidinyl urea. Among our preservative-positive children, 77% of patients reacted to other haptens of the series, and 44% were affected by atopic dermatitis. In comparison with our previous data referring to the period 1988?1994, a significant increase has been observed in the frequency of positive reactions to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Our findings confirm the importance of patch testing children with preservatives since the wider and wider use of cosmetics in the pediatric age.

Description of clinical cases: Patient S., female, 17 years old, came to dermatologist with complaints on erythema and vesicles, sense of burning on the face during two weeks. The patient works on the market, exposures by sun. As a result of a talk with the patient, new perfume as a possible reason of photoallergic reaction was suspected. The patient was successfully treated by use of ozone therapy: 6 autochemotherapy minor (AHTmin) treatments were applied. By the end of the course crusts and hyperpigmentation only were observed. Patient T., male, 36 years old, suffered from erythema and vesicles, itching and sense of burning on both hands and arms for 3 days. During weekend he had contact with cow-parsnip plant. The patient got 5 AHT minor treatments: clinical recovery was registered. Patient S., 36 years old, frosted his hands two weeks ago. When he came to dermatologist, erythema, vesicles, erosions and crusts on the backs of the hands were observed. Ozone therapy (AHTmin ? 5 treatments plus ozonized water externally) was successfully applied: full recovery was registered. Summary of results:? Different cases of CD were successfully treated by ozone therapy use. Conclusions:? CD provoked by different factors can be cured with ozone.

AB  - It is well known that a subtle balance exists between consumer desire to use hair dyes of various kinds and the sensitizing effects of particular dye ingredients. Of these, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) is the mostly commonly reported contact allergen and which serves as a general model for hair dye allergy. PPD is reported as a strong sensitizer in all predictive tests; it is fairly commonly identified as a contact allergen in diagnostic patch testing, with relevance to hair dye ACD being about 50%. Whilst it may not be possible always to eliminate, or even greatly reduce, the extent to which sensitisation is induced, a final opportunity for limiting the degree of ACD occurs at the elicitation phase. Here, ensuring the extent of skin exposure is below the level at which all except the most strongly sensitized will react can provide clear consumer benefits. To achieve this aim, it is necessary to ensure a full appreciation of the variables impacting the elicitation of ACD exist. To this end, series of investigations of the elicitation of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitization has been conducted. In particular, the impact of duration and frequency of exposure on elicitation has been studied. Using groups of PPD sensitized volunteers, in patch tests and repeated open application tests, we have shown that exposures of only a few minutes are often without consequence in such individuals, except where the exposure is often repeated and/or the individual is highly allergic. With volunteers who were 1+ or 2+ positive to the diagnostic patch test, and where exposure to PPD was at 0.5%?1.0% in a short contact rinse-off hair colouring product, no scalp reactions were experienced. It is our view that the establishment of safe exposure limits to contact allergens should be based wherever possible on a detailed assessment of the risk to sensitized humans.

AB  - A 60-year-old non atopic was referred to our Unit due to the onset of severe eczematous contact dermatitis on the lumbar region, following repeated applications of a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) with flurbiprofen for lumbar pain. Patch testing with the SIDAPA (Italian Society of Allergological, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology) standard series, the TTS as is and the constituents of TTS, including flurbiprofen 2% pet., isopropyl myristate 5% pet., polysorbate 80 5% pet., sorbitan sesquioleate 20% pet., peppermint oil 2% pet. and menthol 1% pet. gave a strong positive reaction to TTS, peppermint oil and menthol and a weak reaction to fragrance mix. Allergic contact dermatitis to peppermint oil and its principal constituent (menthol) is rare. Isolated cases of patients with oral symptoms after the use of mentholated cigarettes, toothpaste flavours and fragrances have been reported. Peppermint oil and menthol are used in TTS with anti-inflammatory activity for their anesthetic properties and their vasodilatation effects that aid topical drug penetration. Reapplication of the device to the same site, the irritant action of the vehicle or adhesive, the length of occlusion, associated with warm and humid climates, may promote sensitization to menthol otherwise rarely a cause of contact dermatitis, when used in products designed for a brief contact with the oral mucosa. In contact allergies induced by TTS-treatment patch tests are needed to make a precise identification of the causative agent.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.
