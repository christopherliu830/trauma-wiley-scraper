AB  - Abstract The concept of focus [Skinner, W., 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113?121], notably operationalized in manufacturing entities like cells and focused factories, has also been adopted by the health care industry. Examples include patient-focused care systems and product/service lines. Despite its longevity, there is a paucity of studies analyzing the focus concept and its link to performance, especially in health care. This research is aimed at enhancing our understanding of how a focus-based approach to organization redesign in health care affects processes and practices, and what operational, clinical, and financial outcomes result from such a change. The research setting is a single case site within a large medical center for which costs for trauma care used to exceed income. Using a structured framework, we document the design and operation of this physically and organizationally integrated Level I trauma care center and compare it to its preceding operation. Its pre- and post-conversion performance is analyzed using symmetric event windows covering three-year periods before and after the focused hospital unit (FHU) was established. Under a sizable increase in workload, we find no change in mortality, moderate improvement in length of stay, and a large improvement in net operating margins. Surprisingly, the latter stem not from reductions in cost but in sharply increased hospital reimbursements. Previous studies of hospital restructuring involving focused patient populations have not conclusively supported a positive link between focus and outcomes. However, this investigation of a specific FHU suggests, conceptually as well as quantitatively, that focus can be an attractive element in health care system design.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate peri-implant soft-tissue conditions and esthetic fulfillment during a 3-year follow-up period following prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and methods: As part of a prospective multi-center study, 152 ITI dental implants were placed in 80 patients in the maxillary anterior region. Fifty-nine crowns (38.82%) were cement retained, while 93 (61.18%) crowns were screw retained. At loading and 3, 6, 12 and 36 months post-loading, modified plaque index (MPI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), keratinized mucosa (KM), gingival level (GL), and esthetic fulfillment were recorded. Results: All patients completed the study and no complications were reported. While statistically not significant at all time points, cement-retained crowns seemed to present a worsening trend in MPI and SBI scores. Interestingly, screw-retained crowns seemed to present an opposite picture, their MPI and SBI scores improved over time. While plaque accumulation, prophylaxis and depth of crown margin significantly affected levels of sulcus bleeding, prophylaxis alone played a key role in reducing plaque accumulation. No soft tissue recession was observed in either cement- or screw-retained crowns up to 3 years post-loading. Esthetic fulfillment survey revealed that patients did not have a preference for crown types; however, dentists favored cement-retained over screw-retained crowns. Conclusions: Peri-implant soft tissues responded more favorably to screw-retained crowns when compared with cement-retained crowns. However, no soft-tissue recession was observed in either type of crowns. Cement-retained crowns were preferred by dentists, while patients were equally satisfied with either type of crowns they received.

AB  - Objectives Adverse life events are associated with increased likelihood of depression and poorer prognosis. Trauma-focused treatments (TFT) appear to be effective in decreasing comorbid depressive symptoms. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a TFT on the memories of aversive events for individuals with a primary diagnosis of depression. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 participants recruited from a 10-day outpatient group programme. All participants showed symptoms of depression with a subgroup (80%) meeting the DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode. Participants received treatment as usual (TAU); three additional individual trauma-focused sessions; or three additional individual assertiveness training sessions. Participants were assessed with regards to depression diagnosis and related symptoms. Results For participants with a major depressive episode, the addition of trauma-focused sessions significantly increased the likelihood of remission when compared to TAU, or additional assertiveness training. While no significant treatment difference was noted in depressive symptom change post-treatment, six weeks after treatment those who received an adjunct treatment were more likely to maintain treatment gains than those who received TAU. Furthermore, at 12-week follow-up, participants who received a TFT reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those who received assertiveness training. Conclusions While differences in outcomes were minimal immediately post-treatment, differences among treatment groups increased over time. Thus, as few as three additional TFT sessions may impact positively on symptom change for people completing a group programme for the treatment of depression. Practitioner points Depression is the greatest cause of disability worldwide. Adverse experiences are linked with an increased likelihood of depression, more severe symptoms and poor treatment outcomes following evidence-based interventions. As few as three trauma-focused sessions can improve treatment outcomes in terms of depression diagnosis and related symptoms for individuals receiving group cognitive behavioural therapy.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Abstract Childhood trauma is associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. Mechanisms for these associations are not well understood because past studies have focused predominantly on populations that have already developed physical and mental health problems. The present study examined the association between childhood trauma and stress-related vulnerability factors in a healthy adult sample (n¬†=¬†79; 68% female, mean age¬†=¬†27.5, SD¬†=¬†6.5). Emotion regulation difficulties were examined as a potential mediator. Participants completed baseline laboratory assessments of reported childhood trauma, emotion regulation difficulties, prior month sleep quality, baseline impedance cardiography, and behavioral tests of executive functioning (EF) and a three-day experience sampling assessment protocol that included sleep diary, reported and objective pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood abuse was significantly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation, self-report and objective pre-sleep arousal, diary-assessed sleep quality, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood neglect was associated with greater pre-sleep arousal and poorer EF-behavioral control. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between childhood abuse and reported pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. In conclusion, history of childhood trauma is associated with a variety of stress-related vulnerability factors in healthy adults that may be viable early intervention targets.

All patients who admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in 3 months (during July?October 2010) were surveyed with Braden scale. Patients who gained higher score of Braden scale were at lower risk for pressure ulcer development compared with the other patients. Braden scale is a useful tool for predicting pressure ulcer development in trauma ICU patients. Also, factors such as age and level of consciousness may influence pressure ulcer development.

AB  - The sequelae of child maltreatment tend to extend current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are more severe after single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe after child maltreatment than after single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more prevalent after single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more prevalent after child maltreatment. The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) assessed PTSD and trauma-related symptoms in 256 children (83 children exposed to single trauma, 173 to child maltreatment). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed trauma-unrelated symptoms. Single-trauma children reported significantly more severe PTSD and trauma-related symptoms. Significantly more severe trauma unrelated symptoms were reported after child maltreatment. A significant relation was found between clinical PTSD and more severe trauma-related symptoms in both samples. Likelihood of children meeting PTSD symptoms after trauma seems to decrease when traumatization becomes more complex. Findings support our assumption that symptomatology of maltreated children extends current PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Animal models of tinnitus allow us to study the relationship between changes in neural activity and the tinnitus percept. Here, guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral noise trauma and tested behaviourally for tinnitus 8¬†weeks later. By comparing animals with tinnitus with those without, all of which were noise-exposed, we were able to identify changes unique to the tinnitus group. Three physiological markers known to change following noise exposure were examined: spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) and burst firing in the inferior colliculus (IC), evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and the number of neurons in the cochlear nucleus containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We obtained behavioural evidence of tinnitus in 12 of 16 (75%) animals. Both SFRs and incidences of burst firing were elevated in the IC of all noise-exposed animals, but there were no differences between tinnitus and no-tinnitus animals. There were significant decreases in ipsilateral ABR latencies in tinnitus animals, contrary to what might be expected with a small hearing loss. Furthermore, there was an ipsilateral?contralateral asymmetry in NOS staining in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) that was only apparent in tinnitus animals. Tinnitus animals had a significantly greater number of NOS-containing neurons on the noise-exposed side, whereas no-tinnitus animals did not. These data suggest that measuring NOS in the VCN and recording ABRs supplement behavioural methods for confirming tinnitus in animals, and that nitric oxide is involved in plastic neural changes associated with tinnitus.

AB  - Abstract Background Adequate nutrition is linked to improved patient outcomes during critical illness. Nutrition care is further enhanced by registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) order-writing privileges, which improve the implementation of nutrition interventions. The purpose of this performance improvement project was to evaluate the effect of RDN order-writing privileges on enteral nutrition (EN) order compliance and nutrition delivery in selected intensive care units (ICUs) at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Methods Patients admitted to selected ICUs from January 23, 2018, to January 25, 2018, were screened for eligibility. Demographic and nutrition data were collected retrospectively from the electronic health record. Percent of energy and protein needs met were calculated. Data were compared with historical internal controls identified prior to RDN order-writing privileges. Results Fifty adult patients (150 EN days) were included in data analysis, with 93 patients (279 EN days) included in historical data. Compared with historical data, cumulative EN order compliance increased by 17% and tube feed infusion rate compliance by 15% post-RDN order-writing privileges. Mean (¬± SD) protein needs delivered significantly increased from 72.1 ¬± 28.6% to 89.1 ¬± 24.8% after RDN order-writing implementation (P < 0.001). Conclusions RDN order-writing privileges improved EN order compliance and significantly improved protein delivery in selected ICUs. Future studies are recommended to confirm these results and determine if other variables besides protein delivery are statistically significant with a larger sample size.

Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

AB  - Abstract A role for CD36 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation and lipid metabolism has been well-documented. However, little is known about the role of CD36 in cerebral ischemia. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that CD36, whose functions have been implicated in other pathological events, is a prototypic inflammatory receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The importance of CD36 as a treatment target is indicated by the fact that many treatment strategies that are effective in experimental models of stroke exhibit little or no efficacy in clinical trials. The failure of clinical trials may be due to the use of animal models of stroke that do not reflect traditional risk factors for stroke in humans. The discussion will be focused on two risk factors, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, that modulate CD36 responses. Blocking the expression and function of CD36 by pharmacological or genetic means will provide insight not only toward identifying CD36 as a novel molecular target but also for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat stroke victims. More importantly, coupling clinically relevant conditions with CD36-mediated ischemic injury may provide an appropriate animal model paradigm and develop a scientific understanding that could lead to clinical translational studies involving human subjects.

AB  - Abstract Background Metamemory is the process of monitoring and controlling one's memory. Improving metamemory may reduce the memory problem in old age. We hypothesized that metamemory training (MMT) would improve cognition in older adults with subjective memory complaints and change the brain region related to metacognition. Method We recruited and randomized older adults to the multi-strategic memory training of 10 weekly 90-min sessions, based on the metamemory concept or usual care. Cognitive tests including the Elderly Verbal Learning Test, Simple Rey Figure Test, Digit Span, Spatial Span, Categorical Fluency, and the Boston Naming Test were done in 201 participants, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 49 participants before and after training. Results A total of 112 in the training group and 89 in the control group participated. The training group had a significant increase in long-term delayed free recall, categorical fluency, and the Boston Naming test. In MRI, the mean diffusivity of the bundles of axon tracts passing from the frontal lobe to the posterior end of the lateral sulcus decreased in the training group. Conclusion These results indicate that the MMT program has a positive impact on enhancing older people? cognitive performance. Improved white matter integrity in the anterior and posterior cerebrum and increased cortical thickness of prefrontal regions, which related to metacognition, possibly suggest that the effects of the MMT would be induced via the enhancement of cognitive control.

AB  - Abstract This report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three-dimensional electrospun constructs. These key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. Both electrospun fibers and multi-channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. Multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. Additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid-walled constructs. The flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176?¬µm and various wall thicknesses. Channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. Geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. In vitro culture with Schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. Finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109:1571?1582. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aim:? While volumetric and metabolic imaging on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients has been intensively performed, few studies using electroencephalograms (EEG) have been done as yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate abnormalities in functional connectivity of cortical networks in PTSD. Methods:? Non-linear interdependence (NI), a measure of bidirectional, non-linear information transmission between two time series, was used. Resting EEG were recorded for 18 PTSD patients and 18 sex-matched healthy subjects on 16 channels with their eyes closed. Results:? The NI patterns in PTSD patients were hemisphere asymmetric: an increase in NI in the fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the left hemisphere (F7, F3, T3, C3, T5 and P3) and a decrease in the fronto-parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere (F4, C4, P4 and O2). The non-linearity of NI in EEG, estimated from the surrogate data method, exhibited an increase in the PTSD patients as compared with that of healthy subjects, particularly in the left hemispheric cortex. Conclusion:? Abnormal functional connectivity in PTSD can be assessed using NI, a measure of multi-channel EEG.

AB  - Summary Serratus anterior plane and pectoral nerves blocks are recently described alternatives to established regional anaesthesia techniques in cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery and trauma. We performed a systematic review to establish the current state of evidence for the analgesic role of these fascial plane blocks in these clinical settings. We identified relevant studies by searching multiple databases and trial registries from inception to June 2019. Study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis and studies were instead qualitatively summarised and stratified by type of surgery and comparator. We identified 51 studies: nine randomised control trials; 13 cohort studies; 19 case series; and 10 case reports. The majority of randomised controlled trials studied the serratus anterior plane block in thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with only two investigating pectoral nerves blocks. The evidence in thoracic trauma comprised only case series and reports. Results indicate that single-injection serratus anterior plane and the pectoral nerves blocks reduce pain scores and opioid consumption compared with systemic analgesia alone in cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac-related interventional procedures and chest trauma for approximately 6?12¬†h. The duration of action appears longer than intercostal nerve blocks but may be shorter than thoracic paravertebral blockade. Block duration may be prolonged by a continuous catheter technique with potentially similar results to thoracic epidural analgesia. There were no reported complications and the risk of haemodynamic instability appears to be low. The current evidence, though limited, supports the efficacy and safety of serratus anterior plane and the pectoral nerves blocks as analgesic options in cardiothoracic surgery.
