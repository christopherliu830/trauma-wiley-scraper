AB  - ABSTRACT Usage of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of acute and chronic wounds has grown exponentially in the past decade. Hundreds of studies have been published regarding outcomes and methods of therapy used for adult wounds. This treatment is increasingly being used to manage difficult-to-treat paediatric wounds arising from congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumour, burns, pressure ulceration and postsurgical complications in children, although relatively few studies have been aimed at this population. Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel was convened to determine appropriate use of NPWT with reticulated open cell foam (NPWT/ROCF) as delivered by Vacuum Assisted Closure? (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI Licensing, Inc., San Antonio, TX) for the treatment of paediatric wounds. The primary objectives of the expert advisory panel were to exchange state-of-practice information on paediatric wound care, review the published data regarding the use of NPWT/ROCF in paediatric wounds, evaluate the strength of the existing data and establish guidelines on best practices with NPWT/ROCF for the paediatric population. The proposed paediatrics-specific clinical practice guidelines are meant to provide practitioners an evidence base from which decisions could be made regarding the safe and efficacious selection of pressure settings, foam type, dressing change frequency and use of interposing contact layer selections. The guidelines reflect the state of knowledge on effective and appropriate wound care at the time of publication. They are the result of consensus reached by expert advisory panel members based on their individual clinical and published experiences related to the use of NPWT/ROCF in treating paediatric wounds. Best practices are described herein for novice and advanced users of NPWT/ROCF. Recommendations by the expert panel may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. Decisions to adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the collaborating medical team, including the surgeon and wound care specialist based on available resources, individual patient circumstances and experience with the V.A.C.? Therapy System.

AB  - Abstract Introduction We describe and provide follow-up for a novel simplified technique permitting dual en bloc (DEB) transplantation of adult organs using single in situ arterial and venous anastomoses. Methods Twenty-two adult DEB transplants were performed at our center between 2001 and 2012, utilizing 44 kidneys en bloc. Results were compared with 20 solitary transplants from expanded criteria donors (ECD) associated with lower terminal serum creatinines and Remuzzi biopsy scores vs DEB group. Adult DEB implants had donor inferior vena cava connected to recipient external iliac vein and ?Y? arterial interposition graft anastomosed to the recipient iliac artery. Ureters were conjoined prior to implantation as a single patch into the recipient bladder. Results Mean operative time was 206±57 minutes in DEB vs 180±30 minutes in single transplants (P<.05). Delayed graft function rate was 23% vs 25% in both groups. At 12-month follow-up, mean serum creatinine was 152±66 ?mol/L vs in 154±52 ?mol/L DEB and single kidney transplant recipients, respectively (P=NS). Three-year overall and graft specific survival were 86% and 84% in the DEB group, respectively (P=NS). Complication rates were similar between groups. Conclusions This DEB renal transplantation technique is safe and effective in adults. By employing techniques used to conjoin organ vasculature ex vivo, the number of in situ anastomoses is reduced, thereby minimizing operative ischemic time and potential for complications associated with extensive vascular dissection.

AB  - Summary Studies investigating the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of surgical-site hemorrhage after kidney transplantation are limited. Patients who underwent a kidney transplant from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2012 (followed until 31 December 2012) at Toronto General Hospital were included in this study. Postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage was defined as a drop in hemoglobin ≥20 g/l over a 24-hour period within 3 days of transplantation, followed by an ultrasound indicating a significant hematoma/collection. A total of 59 of 1203 (4.9%) kidney transplant recipients had postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage. Most cases (89.8%) occurred within 1 day after transplantation. Living donor transplants [OR 0.30 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.55)] and higher recipient BMI [OR 0.54 per 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI (95% CI: 0.30, 0.99)] were associated with a significantly lower risk of bleeding. Chronic preoperative anticoagulant usage led to an increased risk of bleeding but was not statistically significant [OR 1.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 5.88)]. Postoperative hemorrhage was associated with a higher risk of graft loss or death [HR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.60)]. While the incidence of postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage in kidney transplantation is relatively low, it may be associated with an increased risk of graft loss or death.

AB  - Abstract Aim.? This paper is the report of a study to explicate the components of observable behaviour that indicate a potential for violence in patients, their family and friends when presenting at an emergency department. Background.? Violence towards nurses is a contemporary, multifaceted problem for the healthcare workforce globally. International literature identifies emergency departments as having high levels of violence. Method.? A mixed method case study design was adopted, and data were collected by means of 290?hours of participant observation, 16 semi-structured interviews and 13 informal field interviews over a 5-month period in 2005. Thematic analysis of textual data was undertaken using NVivo2. Frequency counts were developed from the numerical data. Findings.? Five distinctive elements of observable behaviour indicating potential for violence in patients, their families and friends were identified. These elements can be conceptualized as a potential nursing violence assessment framework and described through the acronym STAMP: Staring and eye contact, Tone and volume of voice, Anxiety, Mumbling and Pacing. Conclusion.? Staring and eye contact, Tone and volume of voice, Anxiety, Mumbling and Pacing provides a useful, practical nursing violence assessment framework to assist nurses to quickly identify patients, families and friends who have a potential for violence.

AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Summary Sleep disturbance is commonly reported by participants with post-traumatic stress disorder, but objective evidence of poor sleep is often absent. Here we compared self-report and actigraphic evaluations of sleep between veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and controls. Participants reported their sleep retrospectively for the month before the recording night and on the recording night. On the recording night, they wore an Actiwatch-64 and were instructed to press the marker button upon getting into bed, each time they awoke, and at their final awakening. The post-traumatic stress disorder group reported much worse sleep than controls on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for the previous month and somewhat poorer sleep on the recording night. However, on the recording night, neither diary nor actigraphic measures of number of awakenings, total time in bed, nor time lying awake after sleep onset differed between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder. Diary-reported number of awakenings was fewer than actigraphically captured awakenings. These results suggest a memory bias towards remembering worse sleep on the nights before the recording night.
