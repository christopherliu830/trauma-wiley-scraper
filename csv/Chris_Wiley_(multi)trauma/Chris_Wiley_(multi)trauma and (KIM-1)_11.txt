AB  - Summary Sleep disturbance is commonly reported by participants with post-traumatic stress disorder, but objective evidence of poor sleep is often absent. Here we compared self-report and actigraphic evaluations of sleep between veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and controls. Participants reported their sleep retrospectively for the month before the recording night and on the recording night. On the recording night, they wore an Actiwatch-64 and were instructed to press the marker button upon getting into bed, each time they awoke, and at their final awakening. The post-traumatic stress disorder group reported much worse sleep than controls on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for the previous month and somewhat poorer sleep on the recording night. However, on the recording night, neither diary nor actigraphic measures of number of awakenings, total time in bed, nor time lying awake after sleep onset differed between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder. Diary-reported number of awakenings was fewer than actigraphically captured awakenings. These results suggest a memory bias towards remembering worse sleep on the nights before the recording night.

AB  - Objective:? To examine gender differences in a large sample of patients with bipolar illness. Methods:? Exploratory analysis of baseline data from the first 500 patients in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), a multi-center NIMH project. Participants are allowed to have medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and to enter in any mood state, thus making the population more generalizable than many research cohorts. Diagnoses and history were assessed using structured clinical instruments administered by certified investigators. Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, there is no correction of for multiple comparisons. However, we emphasize findings that are statistically significant at the more stringent p?<?0.01 level. Results:? Compared with men, women had higher rates of BPII (15.3% M versus 29.0% F, p?<?0.01), comorbid thyroid disease (5.7% M versus 26.9% F, p?<?0.01), bulimia (1.5% M versus 11.6% F, p?<?.0.01) and post-traumatic stress disorder (10.6% M versus 20.9% F, p?<?0.01). Women and men had equal rates of history of lifetime rapid cycling and depressive episodes. Men were more likely to have a history of legal problems (36% M versus 17.5% F, p?<?0.01). Conclusions:? Potentially important gender differences in certain illness characteristics were found in our study; however, in contrast to other reports, we did not find higher rates of lifetime depressive episodes or rapid cycling in women. Although our study is limited by its retrospective study design, its results are strengthened by our large sample size and use of structured interviews.

AB  - Abstract Designing amorphous systems is challenging because of the broad scope of the task. The design team must integrate various solution elements, such as hardware, software, service, and infrastructure, while resolving the communication challenges among different domain-experts. This research begins with the observation that, at the onset of an amorphous system-oriented project, design teams struggle because they are limited to knowledge of fewer than 4 of the 6 W's (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How); rather than having detailed functional or structural specifications as is the case with hardware or software products. The proposed scenario-based approaches enable design teams to effectively deal with ambiguity and to communicate their ideas among team members and managers, as well as with customers through a common language. Based on the Scenario-based Design for Amorphous Systems, methods such as the Scenario Graph and the Scenario Menu help design teams through the exploration stage of a new system development. A case-study from industry demonstrates how a multi-disciplinary design team extracted high-level functions and requirements from scenarios dealing with an open-ended project theme. The integrated framework of Scenario-based Design for Amorphous Systems guides the design teams in visualizing and organizing scenarios and making decisions in order to define an amorphous system.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report complications and clinical outcome of dogs and cats that underwent fluoroscopic-assisted percutaneous pinning (FAPP) of physeal fractures. Study Design Retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?37) and cats (n?=?4). Materials and Methods Records (August 2007-August 2014) of physeal fractures treated with FAPP in 3 hospitals were evaluated. Data collected included signalment, fracture characteristics (etiology, location, duration, Salter-Harris classification, preoperative and postoperative displacement), surgical information (implant size, surgical duration), and outcome assessment information (functional outcome, radiographic outcome, and complications). Results The majority of animals (92%) were classified as full functional outcome. No significant predictors of functional outcome were identified. The overall complication rate was 15% (n?=?6). Elective pin removal rate was 41% (n?=?17). Goniometry and limb circumference measurements of the affected and contralateral limbs were not significantly different in dogs for which measurements were obtained. Seventeen of 18 animals (16 dogs, 2 cats) measured had bone length changes on follow-up radiographs. Conclusion FAPP is associated with an excellent functional outcome in a narrow selection of fracture configurations, specifically those with minimal displacement and for which anatomical alignment can be achieved with closed reduction.

AB  - Summary This chapter examines gangs and school violence by employing a socioecological framework to highlight the systemic failures that push vulnerable high-risk youth to flee toward gangs. The authors position the individual youth within the various socioecological domains of their peers, family, community, and school to better understand youth gang involvement and school-related violence. To that end, they present the story of Reyes, a vulnerable young man susceptible to gang involvement due to marginalization within the different socioecological paradigms. This chapter concludes with implications for educational practitioners on how to intervene and provide the appropriate resources, programs, and support for gang-involved youth.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and importance of superficial echogenic lesions around cranial sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and neuroimaging studies of 40 neonates who had superficial echogenic lesions around sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Magnetic resonance imaging (n = 18) and computed tomography (n = 2) were performed within 2 weeks after sonography. We correlated sonographic findings with computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings and analyzed them. We also evaluated the associated lesions, neurologic signs, and follow-up changes. Results Sonographically, the superficial echogenic lesions involved both sulci and perisulcal parenchyma in 39 neonates and were located in the frontal and parietal areas around the sagittal suture in 38 neonates. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in 9 neonates, birth trauma in 3 neonates, a mixed pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and trauma in 3 neonates, nonspecific single infarctions in 2 neonates, and lack of a defined lesion in 1 neonate. The associated lesions were subdural hemorrhage (n = 12), epidural hematoma (n = 4), germinal matrix hemorrhage (n = 3), intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 2), and periventricular leukomalacia (n = 1). All epidural hematomas were associated with scalp hematoma, and 2 patients had skull fractures. One neonate with epidural hematoma associated with a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy pattern showed mild spasticity in both ankles until 16 months. Conclusions Superficial echogenic lesions detected around cranial sutures on neonatal sonography may be an indicator of more serious intracranial lesions such as more extensive hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and intracranial hematomas, including epidural hematoma.

AB  - Abstract Whether or not injury to a mammalian sensory nerve produces prolonged discharges is a controversial issue. Because of this controversy and its potential ramifications in both experimental and clinical conditions, we examined discharges in sectioned sensory nerves of the rat. In anesthetized rats, either a dorsal root or a saphenous nerve was isolated by sectioning both proximally and distally. Multi-unit recordings from these isolated nerves showed low levels of prolonged ongoing discharges often lasting for at least 2 hr. Furthermore, results from short-term (1?2 days) survival surgeries indicated that prolonged ongoing discharges could last for days. Sectioning the ventral root produced discharges for only a short period. Various pieces of evidence suggested that the sources of impulse generation are multiple, occurring in the middle of an uninjured axon at a site away from the injury, as well as at the injured site. There is circumstantial evidence which suggests that these prolonged discharges are produced in physiological conditions or at least under normal experimental conditions.

AB  - Background Subdural hygromas are often found bilaterally in spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). They frequently progress to chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs), and if the hematomas are formed, it is difficult to consider SIH as an underlying cause. Whether SIH is underlying or not among the patients presenting bilateral subdural fluid collections (hygromas or CSDHs) is clinically important because the treatment strategy should be different between them. Objectives We designed a retrospective case-control study to figure out differential clinical features of the patients presenting bilateral symptomatic subdural fluid collections owing to SIH. Methods Sixty-two patients with bilateral symptomatic subdural fluid collections were enrolled, and their data on general demographics, clinical courses, radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes were collected. The patients were divided into ?SIH? and ?Non-SIH? groups, and a simple logistic regression analysis was performed to clarify the differences between the groups. The consequent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were performed with the significant predictors. Results Eight patients (13%) were diagnosed with SIH. Young age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.831, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.743-0.929, P = .0012), no underlying disease (OR = 0.062, 95% CI: 0.007-0.544, P = .0121), radiological features of brain sagging (OR = 10.36, 95% CI: 0.912-93.411, P = .0017), pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR = 15.6, 95% CI: 2.088-116.52, P = .0074), and small amount of fluid collections (OR = 0.719, 95% CI: 0.579-0.893, P = .0029) were significantly associated with SIH group. ROC curve analyses were performed in parameters of age and amount of fluid collection and the cut-off values for each parameter were ≤55 years old and ≤22.08 mm, respectively. Patients diagnosed with SIH underwent epidural blood patches and showed good results, except 1 patient who underwent burr-hole trephinations. Conclusion Bilateral subdural fluid collections due to underlying SIH is associated with young age (≤55 years old), no underlying diseases, smaller amount of fluid collections (≤22.08 mm of depth), and radiological findings of brain sagging or pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhages.

Families that engaged experienced more transitions, more traumas, and more difficulties in adjustment. Engagement strategies for multiple-family groups should correspond with the underlying family processes by which refugee families manage transitions, traumas, and adjustment difficulties.
