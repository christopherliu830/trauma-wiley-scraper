AB  - Objective The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its relationship with the demographic variables in an older Korean population were examined. Methods A face-to-face household survey was conducted in five different regions of Korea from June 2008 to August 2008. Among a total of 3074 individuals who were aged more than 65, 1990 participants were interviewed, and the response rate was 64.7%. The diagnosis of RLS was made using an RLS questionnaire. The medical review of systems was assessed by a self-report questionnaire containing 15 items. Depression was diagnosed with the diagnostic section of depressive disorder of the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Results The prevalence of RLS in the older Korean population was 9.5% (men, 7.1%; women, 11.3%). RLS had a significant association with anemia (odds ratio (OR), 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29?2.12; P?<?0.001) and renal diseases (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.95?3.38; P?<?0.001). RLS seemed to have a significant relationship with depression by using the CIDI (adjusted OR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.45?2.79. P?<?0.001) and GDS (adjusted OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.34?1.94; P?<?0.001). Conclusions Restless legs syndrome might be a risk factor for major depressive disorder in older Koreans. Future investigations should focus on the causality and mechanism underlying the relationship between RLS and major depressive disorder. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in damage to the developing brain, particularly in severely injured individuals. Little is known, however, of the long-term structural aspects of the brain following childhood TBI. This study investigated the integrity of the brain 10 years post-TBI using magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics in a sample of 49 participants with mild, moderate and severe TBI, evaluated against a normative sample of 20 individuals from a pediatric database with comparable age and gender distribution. Structural integrity was investigated in gray and white matter, and by manually segmenting two regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala), potentially vulnerable to the effects of childhood TBI. The results indicate that more severe injuries caused a reduction in gray and white brain matter, while all TBI severity levels resulted in increased volumes of cerebrospinal fluid and smaller hippocampal volumes. In addition, enlarged amygdala volumes were detected in severely injured patients compared to their mild and moderate counterparts, suggesting that childhood TBI may disrupt the development of certain brain regions through diffuse pathological changes. The findings highlight the lasting impact of childhood TBI on the brain and the importance of monitoring brain structure in the long-term after early injury.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Abstract Soft tissue augmentation by fillers has become a popular cosmetic tool to offer rejuvenation and aesthetic improvement. Its results are comparable to those previously achieved only by plastic surgery. However, marked increase of filler procedures is associated with a great number of complications. Complications associated with filler injection might have early onset (within days) or late onset (after weeks to years). Delayed complications include infections, foreign body granulomatous reaction, migration of filler material, persistent discoloration, and scarring. Here we report two cases of delayed complications: one case of foreign body granuloma with migration and one case of acute inflammation involving a quiescent granuloma.

AB  - Abstract Maltreatment of children is a major public-health and social-welfare problem but socio-demographic variability has received little attention. This work addresses such variability in a general population cohort and associations with depression. Analyses were based on the cross-sectional SHIP-LEGEND examination among 2265 adults (29?89 years). Childhood maltreatment was multi-dimensionally assessed with the German 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ): emotional neglect; emotional abuse; physical neglect; physical abuse; sexual abuse. Non-linear associations between CTQ responses and age were assessed with fractional polynomials and cubic splines. Scale properties were analysed with confirmatory factor analyses and item response models. Associations between childhood maltreatment domains and depression [Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)] were assessed. The majority (58.9%) reported events indicative of at least mild levels of childhood maltreatment. CTQ subscales showed characteristically different non-linear associations to age across the five studied domains, indicating methodological issues like recall bias and the influence of seminal events. Psychometric scale properties were acceptable to good for all subscales except for physical neglect. Associations to depression measures varied systematically across socio-demographic strata. We conclude that socio-demographic variability is a major issue when studying self-reported childhood maltreatment in a community sample. This needs to be taken into account for the study of associations to psychiatric key outcomes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Liver transplantation using elderly donors: a risk factor analysis. ?Clin Transplant 2011: 25: 270?276. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Survival after liver transplantation is negatively impacted by use of elderly deceased donors, but excluding them would increase waiting times and waiting list mortality. We reviewed our experience with liver transplantation (LT) utilizing livers from deceased donors 65?yr of age and older to identify those factors that impact graft survival. All adult patients (≥18?yr old) who underwent primary LT using deceased donor livers from donors aged ≥65?yr between February 1995 and November 2003 were included. With multivariate analysis we found four unfavorable characteristics significantly associated with higher post-transplant graft failure rate. These characteristics are hepatitis C as an etiology of liver disease, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score >20, serum glucose level of donor >200?mg/dL at the time of liver recovery, and skin incision to aortic cross-clamp time >40?minutes in the donor surgery. The five-yr estimated graft survival rates having 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 unfavorable characteristics were 100%, 82.0%, 81.7%, 39.3%, and 25.0%, respectively (p?<?0.05). Our data demonstrated good graft survival can be achieved in LT using elderly donor liver allografts with appropriate patient selection, donor blood glucose management and efficient liver recovery with minimal manipulation of the liver during donor surgery.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2017 are notable for (1) continued growth in numbers of new waitlist registrants (11,514) and of transplants performed (8,082); (2) continued increase in the transplant rate (51.5 per 100 waitlist-years); (3) a precipitous decrease in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) reciprocal increases in waitlist registrants and recipients with alcoholic liver disease and with clinical profiles consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) continued improvement in graft survival despite changing recipient characteristics such as older age and higher rates of obesity. Variability in transplant rates remained by candidate race, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, urgency status (status 1A versus model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >35), and geography. More than half of all children listed for liver transplant in 2017 were aged younger than 5 years in 2017, and the highest rate of pretransplant mortality persisted for children aged younger than 1 year. Children underwent transplant at higher acuity than the past, as evidenced by higher MELD/pediatric end-stage liver disease scores and listings at status 1A and 1B. Higher acuity at transplant is likely due to lack of access to suitable donor organs, which has been compensated for by persistent trends toward use of partial or split liver grafts and ABO-incompatible grafts. Despite higher illness severity scores at transplant, pediatric graft and patient survival posttransplant have improved over time.

AB  - Abstract Neovascularization or angiogenesis is an essential yet poorly understood component of the healing process. In wound healing research, there is a lack of models enabling quantitative and continuous measurements of wound neovascul-arization. The hairless mouse ear wound model permits quantitative measurements of wound epithelialization and neovascularization continuously throughout the healing process. On the ears of male homozygous (hr/hr) hairless mice, standardized circular full thickness dermal wounds are produced; then, using vital microscopy, these two processes are directly viewed and measured at day 0 and every third day thereafter until these are complete. This model system and its application to clinically relevant situations are reviewed. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2016 are no-table for (1) the largest total number of transplants performed (7841); (2) the shortest median waiting time in recent history (11.3 months); (3) continued reduction in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) increasing numbers of patients whose clinical profiles are consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) equilibration of transplant rates in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increase in the number of available organs, waitlist mortality remained an important concern. Graft survival rates continued to improve. In 2016, 723 new active candidates were added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) was stable, 408 active and 169 inactive. The number of pediatric living donor liver transplants decreased from a peak of 79 in 2015 to 62 in 2016, with most from donors closely related to the recipients. Graft survival continued to improve over the past decade among recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers.
