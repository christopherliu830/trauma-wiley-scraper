AB  - Abstract Identifying the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a critical step toward reducing its debilitating impact. Spontaneous neural activity, measured at rest using various neuroimaging techniques (e.g., regional homogeneity [ReHo], amplitude of low frequency fluctuations [ALFF]), can provide insight about baseline neurobiological factors influencing sensory, cognitive, or behavioral processes associated with PTSD. The present study used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct the largest-to-date quantitative meta-analysis of spontaneous neural activity in PTSD, including 457 PTSD cases, 292 trauma-exposed controls (TECs), and 293 non-traumatized controls (NTCs) across 22 published studies. Five regions-of-interest (ROIs) were identified where activity differed between PTSD cases and controls: one when compared to all controls (left globus pallidus), two when compared to TECs (left inferior parietal lobule [IPL] and right lingual gyrus), and two when compared to NTCs (left amygdala and right caudate head). To corroborate these results, a second analysis was conducted using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on an independent sample of 205 previously-deployed US military veterans. In this analysis, converging evidence from ReHo and ALFF showed that spontaneous neural activity in the left IPL alone was positively correlated with PTSD symptom severity. This result is consistent with theoretical accounts that link left IPL activity with PTSD-relevant processes such as processing of emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) and the extent that attention is captured by salient autobiographical memories. By modeling the neurobiological correlates of PTSD, we can increase our understanding of this debilitating disorder and guide the development of future clinical innovations.

AB  - Abstract Several notable developments in adult liver transplantation in the US occurred in 2015. The year saw the largest number of liver transplants to date, leading to reductions in median waiting time, in waitlist mortality for all model for end-stage liver disease categories, and in the number of candidates on the waiting list at the end of the year. Numbers of additions to the waiting list and of liver transplants performed in patients with hepatitis C virus infection decreased for the first time in recent years. However, other diagnoses, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, became more prevalent. Despite large numbers of severely ill patients undergoing liver transplant, graft survival rates continued to improve. The number of new active candidates added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list in 2015 was 689, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent pediatric candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) continued to decline, to 373 active and 195 inactive candidates. The number of pediatric liver transplants peaked at 613 in 2008 and was 580 in 2015. The number of living donor pediatric liver transplants increased to its highest level, 79, in 2015; most were from donors closely related to the recipients. Pediatric graft survival rates continued to improve.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the fresh gas flow (FGF) rate requirements for the Humphrey ADE semi-closed breathing system in the Mapleson A mode; to determine the FGF at which rebreathing occurs, and compare the efficiency of this system to the Bain (Mapleson D) system in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs. Study Design Prospective clinical study. Animals Twenty-five healthy (ASA score I or II) client-owned cats and dogs (mean ± SD age 4.7 ± 5.0 years, and body weight 5.64 ± 3.26 kg) undergoing elective surgery or minor procedures. Methods Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered via the Humphrey ADE system in the A mode using an oxygen FGF of 100 mL kg?1 minute?1. The FGF was then reduced incrementally by 5?10 mL kg?1minute?1 at approximately five-minute intervals, until rebreathing (inspired CO2 >5 mmHg (0.7 kPa)) was observed, after which flow rates were increased. In six animals, once the minimum FGF at which rebreathing occurred was found, the breathing system was changed to the Bain, and the effects of this FGF delivery examined, before FGF was increased. Results Rebreathing did not occur at the FGF recommended by the manufacturer for the ADE. The mean ± SD FGF that resulted in rebreathing was 60 ± 20 mL kg?1minute?1. The mean minimum FGF at which rebreathing did not occur with the ADE was 87 ± 39 mL kg?1minute?1. This FGF resulted in significant rebreathing (inspired CO2 8.8 ± 2.6 mmHg (1.2 ± 0.3 kPa)) on the Bain system. Conclusions The FGF rates recommended for the Humphrey ADE are adequate to prevent rebreathing in spontaneously breathing cats and dogs <15 kg. Clinical relevance The Humphrey ADE system used in the A mode is a more efficient alternative to the Bain system, for maintenance of gaseous anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs.

AB  - Abstract Background We hypothesized that children treated in adult intensive care units (ICUs) might be at increased risk of hospital-acquired infection. Therefore, we compared the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in children treated in pediatric ICU (PICU) and in those treated in adult ICUs. Methods Patients aged <18 years admitted to PICU or adult ICUs between March 2009 and June 2017 were enrolled. We retrospectively investigated A. baumannii isolates and calculated A. baumannii incidence during ICU admission. Cox regression was used to identify possible risk factors for A. baumannii infection. Results Eight hundred thirty ICU cases were included; 508 were treated in PICU (PICU group) and 322 in adult ICUs (adult-ICU group). A. baumannii was isolated 19 (3.7%) and 23 (7.1%) times in the PICU and adult-ICU groups, respectively. Incidence densities for A. baumannii acquisition in PICU and adult-ICU groups were 1.63 and 5.62 per 1,000 ICU-days, respectively. In the Cox regression model, the hazard ratio (HR) for A. baumannii acquisition associated with treatment in PICU was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.61; P=0.001). In multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and sex, treatment in PICU remained significantly associated with a reduced risk of A. baumannii infection (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20-0.76). Conclusion Pediatric patients treated in PICU had a lower rate and incidence density of A. baumannii nosocomial infection than those treated in adult ICUs, suggesting that PICU provides better infection control for children than adult ICUs.

AB  - Abstract Objective Hand infections are a common presentation to health services in the Northern Territory; however, little is known about these patients. This study aims to identify incidence, treatment and co-morbidities of hand infection patients and to pinpoint factors associated with poor outcome. Design A retrospective study of all patients presenting to Alice Springs Hospital with a hand infection during 2012. Setting Orthopaedic Unit at Alice Springs Hospital. Participants All patients admitted with a hand infection were included. Main outcome measures Admission duration, duration waited before first presentation, re-admission rate, duration of re-admission and rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Results One hundred fourteen cases of hand infections were admitted to Alice Springs Hospital during 2012, of which 87 (76%) were in Indigenous patients. Indigenous patients (P?=?0.001) and older patients (P?=?0.038) had significantly longer admissions. Indigenous patients were 9.52 times (P?=?0.038) more likely to be re-admitted than non-Indigenous patients. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 24.6%, and this was associated with smoking (P?=?0.049) and substance abuse (P?=?0.036). Formal follow-up was not related to indirect measures of hand infection severity, such as admission duration or re-admissions. Conclusion Hand infections are a common presentation to Alice Springs Hospital. Indigenous people are admitted 2.38 times longer after adjusting for age and alcohol abuse. They have a more than ninefold chance of being re-admitted to hospital than non-Indigenous people following a hand infection.

Although traditional psychological approaches work with one or more of the psychological, emotive, cognitive, and even somatic and mythological dimensions of human experience, transpersonal psychology includes all these within a philosophical and psychological perspective that grounds all these modalities within a broader spiritual context. The chapter outlines some of the major creative arts therapies (practices and methods also utilized by expressive arts therapists) focusing specifically on art therapy, music therapy, dance/movement therapy, and drama/psychodrama therapy.

AB  - Purpose To propose a susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) method by combining a magnitude image with a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) -based weighting factor thereby providing an alternative contrast compared with magnitude image, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and QSM. Methods A three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo sequence is used to obtain the data. The QSM was transformed to a susceptibility mask that varies in amplitude between zero and unity. This mask was multiplied several times with the original magnitude image to create alternative contrasts between tissues with different susceptibilities. A temporal domain denoising method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio was further applied. Optimal reconstruction processes of the SMWI were determined from simulations. Results Temporal domain denoising enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio, especially at late echoes without spatial artifacts. From phantom simulations, the optimal number of multiplication and threshold values was chosen. Reconstructed SMWI created different contrasts based on its weighting factors made from paramagnetic or diamagnetic susceptibility tissue and provided an excellent delineation of microhemorrhage without blooming artifacts typically caused by the nonlocal property of phase. Conclusion SMWI presents an alternative contrast for susceptibility-based imaging. The validity of this method was demonstrated using in vivo data. This proposed method together with denoising allows high-quality reconstruction of susceptibility-weighted image of human brain in vivo.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the ethical issues that arise when healthcare providers act as gatekeepers to research involving vulnerable populations. Traumatised refugees serve as an example of this subset of research participants. Highlighting the particular vulnerabilities of this group, we argue that specific ethical considerations are required that go beyond the conventional research approaches. While gatekeeping responds to some of those vulnerabilities, it risks wronging through unwarranted paternalism. Instead, we will propose that a relational ethics of justice and care serves as a more appropriate framework for responding to the challenges of research involving traumatised refugees. Specifically, such a framework allows us to reflect more deeply on the role of the gatekeeper. In conclusion, we recommend that clinicians and researchers collaborate with survivors? advisory groups in the development of specific research ethical guidelines.

AB  - Abstract The last decade has seen the rapid development of untethered mobile micro- and nanorobots able to navigate liquids by means of external power sources or by harvesting chemicals from their surrounding media. These tiny devices hold great promise for applications in the biomedical field including targeted drug delivery, localized diagnostics, microsurgery, and cell stimulation. However, to translate small-scale robots from the laboratory to the clinic, many challenges remain. A major obstacle is the lack of imaging technologies that will allow for precise tracking of the devices in vivo. Here, the current progress, challenges, and future possibilities in the monitoring and tracking of biomedical micro- and nanomachines using established as well as less conventional imaging technologies are reviewed.

AB  - Objective:? We have reported that intimal hyperplasia, which is the pathologic change of the radial artery, is associated with early failure of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis (HD) patients (Am J Kidney Dis, 41:422?428, 2003). Intima-media thickness (IMT), which represents the whole thickness of arterial wall, can be easily measured by ultrasonography, unlike intima thickness. This study was performed to investigate the impact of IMT of radial artery on early failure of AVF in HD patients. Methods:?Ninety HD patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation were included in this study. The AVF was constructed in an end vein?to?side artery fashion at the wrist by one vascular surgeon. During the operation, 10-mm long partial arterial walls were removed with elliptical form for microscopic analysis. Specimens were stained with trichrome and examined by a pathologist blinded to the clinical data. AVF patency was prospectively followed up for 1 year after the operation. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 56?±?13 years and the number of females was 44 (48.9%). Mean IMT was 430?± 132??m (133?760??m). Of the total 90 patients, 31 patients (34.4%) had AVF failure within 1 year after the operation. Mean IMT was higher in the failed group (n?=?31) than in patent group (n?=?59)(486?±?130??m vs. 330?±?178??m, p?=?0.004). Using a threshold of 500??m of IMT, AVF patency rate was compared between these two groups using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The AVF patency rate within 1 year after the operation was higher in patients with IMT?≥?500??m (n?=?26) than in patients with IMT?<?500??m (n?=?64)(p?<?0.001). The patients with IMT?≥?500??m were older and had higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, compared to the patients with IMT?<?500??m. There was no difference in sex, smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol and albumin levels between the two groups. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that increased intima-media thickness of radial artery is associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Summary The development of the mandibular condylar cartilage is important for the overall growth of the mandible. However, there have been a few researches into medical approaches aimed at controlling condylar growth. This study examined the effects of bisphosphonate on the growth of the condylar cartilage. Alendronate (3.5?mg/kg/week) was administered to postnatal day 1 SD rats for 7 and 10?days. The thickness of each chondrocyte layer and the level of MMP-9 expression were measured. The anteroposterior diameter of the developing condyle was unaffected by the alendronate treatment for 7?days (P?>?0.05). The total thickness of the cartilage layers was also unaffected by the treatment for 7?days (P?>?0.05). In particular, there was no change in the thickness of the perichondrium and reserve cell layer at the measured condylar regions (P?>?0.05). However, the thickness of the proliferating cell layer was reduced significantly, whereas the thickness of hypertrophied cartilage layer was increased (P?<?0.05). The number of chondroclasts engaged in hypertrophied cartilage resorption was reduced significantly by the alendronate treatment (P?<?0.05). The level of MMP-9 expression was reduced at both the transcription and translation levels by the alendronate treatment for 7 and 10?days. These results indicate that alendronate (>3.5?mg/kg/week) inhibits the longitudinal growth of the mandibular condyle by inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation and the resorption of hypertrophied cartilage for ossification.
