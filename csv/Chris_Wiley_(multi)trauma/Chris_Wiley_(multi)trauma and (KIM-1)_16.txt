AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the activity and tolerability of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma that were ineligible for surgical resection or with owners who declined surgical resection, and underwent 3D-CRT were retrospectively reviewed. 6 to 10 Gy per fraction was prescribed at isocentre of planning target volume to a total dose of 18 to 42 Gy with 1 to 2 fractions per week for a total of 3 to 7 fractions. Follow-up examinations included physical examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan and blood analysis (complete blood count, electrolytes and serum biochemical panel). RESULTS The median follow-up time after 3D-CRT was 534 (range, 281 to 1057) days. An objective response was observed in five of six cases. Radiation-induced liver disease developed in one dog but was asymptomatic and reversible. Toxicity was not noted in any other dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 3D-CRT appears to be a viable treatment option for dogs with inoperable massive hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - haslam l., dale c., knechtel l. & rose l. (2011)?Pain descriptors for critically ill patients unable to self-report. Journal of Advanced Nursing 68(5), 1082?1089. Abstract Aim.? To examine descriptors used by nurses in two Canadian intensive care units to document pain presence for critically ill patients unable to self-report. Background.? Systematic documentation of pain assessment is essential for communication and continuity of pain management, thereby enabling better pain control, maximizing recovery and reducing physical and psychological sequelae. Method.? A retrospective, mixed method, having observational design in two Level-III intensive care units of a quaternary academic centre in Toronto, Canada. During 2008?2009, data were abstracted via chart review guided by a reference compendium of potential behavioural descriptors compiled from existing behavioural pain assessment tools. Results.? A total of 679 narrative descriptions were extracted. Behavioural descriptors (232, 34%), physiological descriptors (93, 14%), and descriptors indicating the patient was pain free (117, 17%) were used to describe pain presence or absence. Narratives also described analgesia administered without descriptors of pain assessment (117, 17%) and assessment and analgesic administration prior to a known painful procedure (30, 4%). Emerging themes included life-threatening treatment interference, decisional uncertainty and a wakefulness continuum. Conclusion.? Inconsistent or ambiguous documentation was problematic in this sample. This may reflect confounding behaviours and concomitant safety priorities. Developing a lexicon of pain assessment descriptors of critically ill patients unable to self-report for use in combination with valid and reliable measures may improve documentation facilitating appropriate analgesic management. Protocols or unit guidelines that prioritize a trial of analgesia before administration of sedatives may decrease decisional uncertainty when patients exhibit ambiguous behaviours such as agitation or restlessness.

AB  - Summary Biliary tract emergencies include gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile leak, and acute cholecystitis. Urgent ERCP (within 24 hours after admission) is indicated in patients with gallstone pancreatitis who have concurrent acute cholangitis, but it is not needed in most patients who do not have evidence of ongoing biliary obstruction. The treatment goal of acute cholangitis is biliary decompression by re-establishing patency of the biliary system. The primary goal of endoscopic treatment of bile leaks is directed at reducing biliary pressure. This is accomplished in several ways including performing a biliary sphincterotomy and/or placement of a bile duct stent across the papilla. The timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has been debated and is discussed in this chapter.

AB  - Abstract Human neural stem cells (hNSCs) can control inflammation in the central nervous system, although the underlying mechanisms are not understood fully. We investigated the immunomodulatory effect of hNSCs on human T cells and the underlying mechanisms. Culture supernatant from an immortalized hNSC cell line, HB1.F3, which has a therapeutic effect on acute stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, suppressed the proliferation of allogeneically or mitogenically stimulated human peripheral T cells, including the CD3+CD103+ subpopulation. CFSE labeling and flow cytometry showed that the suppression of proliferation was caused by cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The lack of significant change in caspase-8 levels and the significant reduction in Bcl-2 expression in the affected T cells suggest that the intrinsic pathway plays a major role in soluble-factor-mediated T-cell apoptosis. The addition of culture supernatant from hNSCs to activated T cells reduced the expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 at 24 hr after activation, but at 48 hr only CD69 was down-regulated. A cytometry bead assay showed that the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2 decreased significantly, whereas that of IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-? increased. These results show that hNSCs can negatively affect human peripheral T cells by suppressing their activation and proliferation through soluble mediators, suggesting that hNSCs have a bystander immunomodulatory effect on T cells. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The hypothesis that inhibitory control?an aspect of executive functioning?is related to children's suggestibility was tested. Five- to 7-year-olds (N?=?125) participated in a staged event, were suggestively interviewed, and were later given a recognition test. Conflict and interference measures of inhibitory control were taken and compared to children's ability to identify details from the target event and reject details from non-target sources (i.e. false suggestions, details from prior events). Children with higher than average verbal retroactive inhibition skills were more resistant to suggestions than children with poor inhibitory control. Collectively, age and retroactive inhibition skills accounted for 17% of the variance in suggestibility scores, with each making independent contributions. Three other measures of inhibition did not, however, correlate significantly with resistance to suggestion. The findings are discussed in relation to a multi-component view of eyewitness memory emphasizing links between inhibitory control, suggestibility, and source monitoring.

AB  - Overview Melanoma comprises a wide variety of malignant cell types arising from the skin, the mucous membranes, and the pigmented cells of the eye. While these tumors are all classified as melanoma and share a common molecular biology of pigmentation and biological resemblance to cells of neural crest origin, important distinctions in other molecular characteristics and patterns of exposure to ultraviolet light as a carcinogen determine their clinical natural history, including the response to therapeutic interventions. While the majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and curable with minimal surgery, melanoma has the potential for early and widespread dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for primary, regional, and many cases of single- or oligo-metastatic disease, but systemic therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis for metastatic melanoma, particularly immunotherapies that enhance existing cellular immunity. The rapid discovery of new molecular targets, immunotherapy combinations (including the use of radiotherapy), and understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance are likely to lead to even greater improvements in the prognosis for patients with melanoma in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Recently there has been an increase in interest in the relationship between stress and memory. Brain regions which are involved in memory function also effect the stress response. Traumatic stress results in changes in these brain regions; alterations in these brain regions in turn may mediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural mechanisms which are relevant to the effects of stress on memory, such as fear conditioning, stress sensitization, and extinction, are reviewed in relation to their implications for PTSD. Special topics including neural mechanisms in dissociation, neurobiological approaches to the validity of childhood memories as they apply to controversies over the ?False Memory Syndrome,? and implications of the effects of stress on memory for psychotherapy, are also reviewed. The findings discussed in this paper are consistent with the formulation that stress-induced alterations in brain regions and systems involved in memory may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD, as well as dissociative amnesia, seen in survivors of traumatic stress.

AB  - ABSTRACT During 2013, 10,479 adult candidates were added to the liver transplant waiting list, compared with 10,185 in 2012; 5921 liver transplants were performed, and 211 of the transplanted organs were from living donors. As of December 31, 2013, 15,027 candidates were registered on the waiting list, including 12,407 in active status. The most significant change in allocation policy affecting liver waitlist trends in 2013 was the Share 35 policy, whereby organs from an entire region are available to candidates with model for end-stage liver disease scores of 35 or higher. Median waiting time for such candidates decreased dramatically, from 14.0 months in 2012 to 1.4 months in 2013, but the effect on waitlist mortality is unknown. The number of new active pediatric candidates added to the liver transplant waiting list increased to 693 in 2013. Transplant rates were highest for candidates aged younger than 1 year (275.6 per 100 waitlist years) and lowest for candidates aged 11 to 17 years (97.0 per 100 waitlist years). Five-year graft survival was 71.7% for recipients aged younger than 1 year, 74.9% for ages 1 to 5 years, 78.9% ages 6 to 10 years, and 77.4% for ages 11 to 17 years.

AB  - Abstract We started performing laparoscopic cholecystectomies in 1991. Since that time, many surgeons have been trained in laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgery, and laparoscopic surgery has been used in numerous procedures, with patients benefitting as a result. We performed the first automated surgery in Korea using Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning in June 1996. Inspired by Inbae Yoon and assisted by his generous donation, our hospital started the IB Yoon Multi-Specialty Endoscopic Research & Training Center in 1998. Subsequently in March 2005, we started the Severance Robotic and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center. The establishment of these centers has enabled us to widen the use of laparoscopic surgery and to teach many surgeons the principles of and the techniques involved in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. We performed our first robotic surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System in July 2005. In the 4 years since introducing the da Vinci Surgical System, we have successfully performed more than 2600 robotic surgical procedures. As the collaboration between medicine and robotic engineering produces more technically advanced results, we hopefully can develop our own version of the robotic system in the near future.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.
