AB  - Abstract Children in families with mental health problems may encounter multiple risks to their well-being. General aims of peer support programmes for these children include fostering resilience and effective coping strategies, and enhancing self-esteem and social skills. This study aimed to evaluate outcomes from a pilot multi-site implementation of the ON FIRE peer support programme. The purpose of ON FIRE is to cultivate hope, resilience and well-being in children and adolescents aged 8?17 years living in families affected by sibling or parental mental health problems. We employed a pre-post test (baseline and 4 months) evaluation using a suite of outcome measures. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Children's Hope Scale, Kids Connections Scale and Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) were completed for 64 child/adolescent participants. At baseline, participants had significantly greater difficulties compared with Australian norms. At 4 months, there were significant differences in children's hope and in connections outside the family. There were no significant differences in the SDQ or the PANAS-C.

AB  - Background and purpose: Apoptosis is a fundamental process required for neuronal development but also occurs in most of the common neurodegenerative disorders. In an attempt to obtain an anti-apoptotic neuroprotective compound from natural products, we isolated the diterpenoids, pinusolide and 15-MPA, from B. orientalis and investigated their neuroprotective activity against staurosporine (STS) -induced neuronal apoptosis. In addition, we determined the anti-apoptotic mechanism of these compounds in rat cortical cells. Experimental approach: Primary cultures of rat cortical cells injured by STS were used as an in vitro assay system. Cells were pretreated with pinusolide or 15-MPA before exposure to STS. Anti-apoptotic activities were evaluated by the measurement of cytoplasmic condensation and nuclear fragmentation. The levels of cellular peroxide, malondialdehyde (MDA) and [Ca2+]i, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and caspase-3/7, were measured. Key results: Pinusolide and 15-MPA, at a concentration of 5.0 ìM, reduced the condensed nuclei and rise in [Ca2+]i that accompanies apoptosis induced by 100 nM STS. Pinusolide and 15-MPA also protected the cellular activity of SOD, an antioxidative enzyme reduced by STS insult. Furthermore, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation induced by STS was significantly reduced in pinusolide and 15-MPA treated cells. In addition, pinusolide and 15-MPA inhibited STS-induced caspase-3/7 activation. Conclusions and Implications: These results show that pinusolide and 15-MPA protect neuronal cells from STS-induced apoptosis, probably by preventing the increase in [Ca2+]i and cellular oxidation caused by STS, and indicate that they could be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Purpose:? To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Methods:?Between January 1997 and December 2003, we treated 22 patients with non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas by PTA. Retrospective analysis was performed on the findings of fistulogram, techniques and success rate of PTA, and patency rate. Results:?Seventeen segmental stenoses and 5 segmental occlusions of cephalic veins were identified. Sixteen stenoses and 2 occlusions were located at the cephalic vein adjacent to the anastomosis site, and 3 occlusions and 1 stenosis were seen at the proximal vein near the elbow joint. In addition to venous stenosis, a focal arterial stenosis at the anastomosis site and two accompanying accessory veins that might hamper maturation of main cephalic vein was seen in each of two patients, respectively. Simultaneous occlusion of left innominate vein as well as occlusion of cephalic vein were noted in one patient. Initial success rate of PTA was 95.5%(21/22). Overall success rate including 11 additional PTAs performed during follow-up was 96.9%(32/33). No major complication occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 72% and 95% at 3 months, and 50% and 77% at 6 months, respectively. Conclusion:?PTA is an effective and safe method in salvaging non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas.

AB  - Abstract Cellular studies indicate that endocannabinoid type-1 retrograde signaling plays a major role in synaptic plasticity. Disruption of these processes by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could produce alterations either in structural and functional brain connectivity or in their association in cannabis (CB) users. Graph theoretic structural and functional networks were generated with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional imaging in 37 current CB users and 31 healthy non-users. The primary outcome measures were coupling between structural and functional connectivity, global network characteristics, association between the coupling and network properties, and measures of rich-club organization. Structural?functional (SC?FC) coupling was globally preserved showing a positive association in current CB users. However, the users had disrupted associations between SC?FC coupling and network topological characteristics, most perturbed for shorter connections implying region-specific disruption by CB use. Rich-club analysis revealed impaired SC?FC coupling in the hippocampus and caudate of users. This study provides evidence of the abnormal SC?FC association in CB users. The effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local interconnections. Notably, the hippocampus and caudate specifically showed aberrant structural and functional coupling. These structures have high CB1 receptor density and may also be associated with changes in learning and habit formation that occur with chronic cannabis use.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare outcomes and identify prognostic factors in dogs with single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEHPSS) gradually attenuated with an ameroid ring constrictor (ARC) or cellophane banding (CB). Study Design Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Animals Forty-nine dogs with CEHPSS (n?=?23 for ARC; n?=?26 for CB). Methods Medical records of dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC or CB were reviewed for postoperative (<1 month), midterm (1-6 months), and long-term (> 6 months) outcomes. Data were evaluated to detect factors associated with postoperative complications, residual shunting, and long-term outcome. Results Postoperative complication rates did not differ between ARC (26.1%) and CB (23.1%, P?=?.89) and were negatively associated with body weight (P?=?.03). Overall, postoperative mortality was low (2.0%). Clinical long-term outcome was excellent in 45.0% and 39.1% and good in 55.0% and 60.9% of dogs after ARC and CB, respectively. Suspected residual shunting rate upon abdominal ultrasonography was greater after CB (31.6%) than after ARC (0%). Conclusion ARC and CB were both effective for attenuation of CEHPSS, resulting in good to excellent outcomes with low morbidity and mortality. Residual shunting was suspected in a higher proportion of dogs treated with CB on the basis of abdominal ultrasonography results. However, further prospective randomized studies must be conducted with validated evaluation methods to verify this assumption.

AB  - Background? Dignity and respect are at the foundation of good care and effective treatment planning and are guiding service principles. The use of physical restraints is contrary to treatment with dignity and respect. Because of the numerous risks to clients and employees associated with the use of physical restraints, an innovative plan was implemented to minimize the use. Method? Information was gathered to obtain a clear understanding of the employees? feelings about the initiative to minimize physical restraint. Training was provided regarding philosophical issues as well as how to utilize a new tool/procedure to keep everyone safe during aggressive outbursts. Presence by the management team was increased to support employees and encourage newly trained techniques. Finally, a formal system of processing was put in place to learn from each restraint in order to prevent the situation in the future. Results? The Winchester Region reduced the use of physical restraint by 99.4% and client-induced employee injuries by 37.7%. Conclusions? We drastically reduced physical restraints, staff injuries and created a safer place to work.

AB  - Background:? Because of high incidence of acquired renal cyst and renal malignancy, it is suggested that spontaneous renal rupture more frequently occurs in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis than in the general population. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?This retrospective study enrolled 12 hemodialysis patients who developed spontaneous renal rupture. We investigated primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, clinical symptoms and signs, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and histologic findings. Result:?The mean age of the patients was 54?±?10 years old and the number of male was 9. Primary renal disease consisted of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PCKD)(n?=?5), chronic glomerulonephritis (n?=?2), diabetic nephropathy (n?=?1), hypertensive nephropathy (n?=?1), unknown cause (n?=?3). Presenting symptoms and signs were sudden onset of flank pain in 9 patients and gross hematuria with mild flank pain in 3 patients. Mean duration from initiation of hemodialysis to development of spontaneous renal rupture was 53?±?36 months. Abdominal computed tomography showed subcapsular or perinephric hematoma in all patients. Of the 7 non-PCKD patients, 6 patients had multiple acquired renal cysts. Surgical exploration was undertaken in 9 patients. Pathologic examination demonstrated small sized renal cell carcinoma in 2 of 9 patients. Three patients were only treated with conservative management including blood transfusion. All 12 patients recovered without recurrence. Conclusion:?This study demonstrated that genetic or acquired renal cyst was an important cause of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients and presenting manifestations were sudden onset of flank pain and gross hematuria.

AB  - Objective To test the effectiveness of a telephone care management intervention to increase the use of primary and preventive care, reduce hospital admissions, and reduce emergency department visits for Medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities in a managed care setting. Data Source Four years (2007?2011) of Medicaid claims data on blind and/or disabled beneficiaries, aged 20?64. Study Design Randomized control trial with an intervention group (n = 3,540) that was enrolled in managed care with telephone care management and a control group (n = 1,524) who remained in fee-for-service system without care management services. Multi-disciplinary care coordination teams provided telephone services to the intervention group to address patients' medical and social needs. Data Collection/Extraction Medicaid claims and encounter data for all participants were obtained from the state and the managed care organization. Principal Findings There was no significant difference in use of primary care, specialist visits, hospital admissions, and emergency department between the intervention and the control group. Care managers experienced challenges in keeping members engaged in the intervention and maintaining contact by telephone. Conclusions The lack of success for Medicaid beneficiaries, along with other recent studies, suggests that more intensive and more targeted interventions may be more effective for the high-needs population.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Summary This chapter examines narrative mainstream cinema in South Korea, focusing on the key films that were commercially successful and influential as far as Korean gangster cinema is concerned. It explains how broad of a presence the kkangpae maintains while proposing one possible method of considering the movement of the Korean gangster in cinema. Jung Doo-hong is perhaps the single most instrumental figure in Korean kkangpae cinema, playing an integral role in producing the gangster in contemporary Korean visual image culture. Discussions of Korean gangster films often begin comparatively, suggesting an analogous quality between the Korean gangster and the neighboring Japanese yakuza or the Italian/American mafia. Much of 2000s gangster cinema was reflecting on the aesthetics of the 1990s kkangpae films and, almost inadvertently, the films were also reconsidering the work of Jung Doo-hong.
