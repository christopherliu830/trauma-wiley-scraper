AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 ± 11 years, mean ± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 ± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Background Single-event multi-level chemoneurolysis (SEMLC) is a single-session procedure that treats various limbs of patients with spasticity at multiple levels with chemoneurolytic agents. Phenol is used in combination with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to enable spastic muscles to be treated without overdosing with BTX-A. Objective To review unintended effects (UEs) of SEMLC for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Pediatric rehabilitation outpatient clinic at an academic medical center. Participants The study included 98 children with CP who underwent SEMLC on at least one occasion. Interventions SEMLC. Main Outcome Measures UEs, the goal achievement for each SEMLC session, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER). Results A total of 98 subjects and 146 SEMLC procedures were reviewed. Patients had a mean age of 7.56 years (standard deviation, 4.28); 57% were male; and 14 had hemiplegia, 22 had diplegia, 8 had triplegia, and 54 had quadriplegia. Most SEMLCs (72%) were performed with a combination of BTX-A and 5% phenol in a session. UEs were reported for 31/146 (21%) of SEMLC sessions, with 16 of 31 UEs being temporary weakness. The overall incidence of UEs of the group that received combined agent treatment was not different from the group that received BTX-A only (P = .267). Transient pain occurred in 7 of 105 patients who were treated with the combined agents BTX-A and phenol. Dysesthesia did not develop in any of the patients. The type of CP, GMFCS level, number of muscles injected, and doses of medications were not correlated with the incidence of UEs. Conclusions SEMLC using combined BTX-A and phenol is a safe procedure for children with spastic CP. It could be a treatment option for patients with diffuse spasticity, because combining agents allowed more muscles to be treated without enduring or serious UEs. Patient and family education is essential to prepare them for the occurrence of common UEs, such as temporary weakness and pain.

AB  - Summary? Putty form graft materials may have additional favourable effects when compared with particulate ones in periodontal bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and also radiographic changes following application of (i) putty form demineralized bone matrix (DBM), (ii) particulate form DBM and (iii) open flap debridement (control), using modified curtain suturing technique in the treatment of interproximal suprabony (horizontal) defects. Twenty-five chronic periodontitis patients with 125 sites (radiologically ≥4?mm horizontal bone defect) were selected to participate in this triple-blind, split mouth, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Putty and particulate form DBM grafts were placed at experimental sites. Clinical measurements included probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL), gingival recession and bone probing depth (BPD) were made at baseline and repeated 12?months after the operations. Standardized digital radiographs were also taken to measure radiographic bone level (RBL) at baseline and 12?months later to be compared in a software. Probing depth reductions and RAL gains were significantly improved in all treatment groups (P?<?0·001). No significant differences in soft tissue parameters were found among three groups (P?>?0·05). Bone probing depth measurements indicated comparable significant bone gain in graft applied groups (P?<?0·01) and a significant bone resorption in open flap debridement group (P?<?0·01). Radiographic evaluation did not show any significant bone gain or resorption in all treatment groups (P?>?0·05). The results of this study indicate that either putty or particulate DBM demonstrates similar enhancements in soft and hard tissue parameters. Applying putty or particulate form DBM results with slight bone formation when compared with open flap debridement in horizontal bone defects at 1-year post-operative examination according to BPD measurements.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objectives of the present study were to describe the injury profiles of cyclists presenting to an ED and determine the risk of significant head injury associated with bicycle helmet use. Methods This was a retrospective single trauma centre study of all adult cyclists presenting to an inner city ED and undergoing a trauma team review between January 2012 and June 2014. The outcome of interest was significant head injury defined as any head injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of two or more. Variables analysed included demographic characteristics, helmet use at time of incident, location, time and the presence of intoxication. Results The most common body regions were upper limb injuries (57%), followed by head injuries (43%), facial injuries (30%) and lower limb injuries (24%). A lower proportion of people wearing helmets had significant head injury (17% vs 31%, P = 0.018) or facial injury (26% vs 48%, P = 0.0017) compared with non-helmet users. After adjustment for important covariates, helmet use was associated with a 70% decrease in the odds of significant head injury (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.76, P = 0.008). Conclusions Head injuries were common after inner city cycling incidents. The use of helmets was associated with a reduction in significant head injury.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

A total of 4085 schoolchildren aged 16 years were examined. The prevalence of injury was 4.1% and it was significantly higher in males than females, with a ratio of 2:1. Almost 75% of the subjects had one tooth affected. Out of a total of 200 fractured teeth, 78.0% involved the maxillary central incisors. A high level of untreated traumatized teeth (89%) was noted. However, of the untreated traumatized teeth, only 9% presented with problems such as discoloration of tooth, sinus or abscess formation.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Development of an organ and subsequently the whole system from an embryo is a highly integrated process. Although there is evidence that different systems are interconnected during developmental stages, the molecular understanding of this relationship is either not known or only to a limited extent. Nervous system development, amongst all, is maybe the most crucial and complex process. It relies on the correct distribution of specific neuronal growth factors and hormones to the specific receptors. Among the plethora of proteins that are involved in downstream signalling of neuronal growth factors, we find the kinase-D interacting substrate of 220 kDa (KIDINS220), also known as ankyrin-rich repeat membrane spanning (ARMS) protein. KIDINS220 has been shown to play a substantial role in the nervous system and vascular system development as well as in neuronal survival and differentiation. It serves as a downstream regulator for many important neuronal and vascular growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the neurotrophin family, glutamate receptors and ephrin receptors. Moreover, activation and differentiation of B- and T-cells, as well as tumour cell proliferation has also shown to be related to KIDINS220. This review comprehensively summarises the existing research data on this protein, with a particular interest in its role in cancer and in other pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Productivity is one of the components of occupational performance in occupational therapy. Thus, work status is an important area to address after head injury. Many studies on long-term outcomes after head injury document return to work post injury but often do not report the nature of employment after injury. The aim of this study was to examine change in vocational status 10 years after head injury and explore participants' perception of how this injury affected career plans. Eighty-three out of 100 subjects were traced 10 years post injury from a large trauma centre in Canada. Of these, 59 agreed to participate in a telephone interview where data on employment were collected. Occupations before and after injury were coded using three indices (Hollingshead Index, Blishen Socioeconomic Index for Occupations, and the Pineo Socioeconomic Classification of Occupations). The study shows that, on average, subjects who are employed before and after injury stay at the same level of vocational status or improve slightly. Younger age (p<0.05) and being male (p<0.10) were associated with an increase in status. Six major themes on how injury affected career plans emerged. It is recommended that greater attention be given to coding occupations in research, clinical work and follow-up studies of head injured subjects. Copyright ? 1997 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Purpose To introduce novel acquisition and postprocessing approaches for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) to remove background field inhomogeneity artifacts in both magnitude and phase data. Methods The proposed method acquires three echoes in a three-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) sequence, with a field compensation gradient (z-shim gradient) applied to the third echo. The artifacts in the magnitude data are compensated by signal estimation from all three echoes. The artifacts in phase signals are removed by modeling the background phase distortions using Gaussians. The method was applied in vivo and compared with conventional SWI. Results The method successfully compensates for background field inhomogeneity artifacts in magnitude and phase images, and demonstrated improved SWI images. In particular, vessels in frontal lobe, which were not observed in conventional SWI, were identified in the proposed method. Conclusion The new method improves image quality in SWI by restoring signal in the frontal and temporal regions. Magn Reson Med 72:452?458, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
