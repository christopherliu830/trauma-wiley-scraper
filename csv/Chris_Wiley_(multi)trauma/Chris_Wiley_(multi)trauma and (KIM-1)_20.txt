AB  - ABSTRACT Using coffee shops as information grounds in the context of Christians and Muslim violent conflicts in Indonesia, this paper explores and explicates the emergence of information grounds in the context of conflicts. In a polarized society, coffee shops are constructed as a venue for social reliefs and rituals. They function as social magnets, attracting conflicting actors to put off their differences in lieu of community building. As information grounds, coffee shops allow human actors to cultivate trust and develop networked individuals. Individuals? capabilities are connected within the communitarian spectrum. Diverse information is shared and exchanged but searching for a common ground is the main goal. As information grounds, the coffee shops reported in this paper are spaces where social capital flourish and increase in value with greater levels of trust. Through the discussion, we posit information grounds as spaces for conflict transformation.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion of Immunological Origin (RSAI) is currently diagnosed by the occurrence of 2?3 consecutive miscarriages of unknown origin. The psychological trauma incurred by these events is a serious ailment which may be potentially avoided if a method of analysis is derived which may forecast these events and in turn prevent them from occurring. This review intends to examine studies of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) which use laboratory diagnosis and also studies of RSA that do not use laboratory diagnosis. We believe that when laboratory results are incorporated into the diagnosis of RSA/RSAI that treatment is highly successful whereas the absence of laboratory results severely hinders the effectiveness of treatment. It is worth noting that correlating treatment versus outcome is imprudent because of the multiple variables involved in patient cases. It is not imprudent, however, to say that incorporation of laboratory data is essential when diagnosing RSA/RSAI.

AB  - Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single-pool Kt/V of at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important as a factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. Objective:? The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of increasing blood flow rate on dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V. Methods:? This study enrolled 36 HD patients with single-pool Kt/V <1.2 per session thrice weekly, which was measured in dialyzer blood flow rate of 230?mL/min. We increased 15% of blood flow rate in patients <65?kg of body weight and 20% in patients >65?kg. And then we compared Kt/V and urea reduction ratio (URR) between before and after increasing blood flow rate. Results:? The mean age was 48?±?11 years (23?73 years), and the number of males was 25. Of the total patients, 24 patients had dry weight <65?kg. Mean dialysis duration was 52?±?50 months (3?216 months). Mean Kt/V before increasing blood flow rate was 1.02?±?0.09. It increased to 1.14?±?0.12 after increasing blood flow rate (p?<?0.001). Of the total 36 patients, 13 patients (36.1%) achieved adequacy target (Kt/V?≤?1.2). Mean URR before increasing blood flow rate was 56.9?±?4.0%. It also increased to 60.8?±?4.1% (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that increasing blood flow rate by 15?20% of previous flow rate is effective in achieving dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Fibrin sealants have had applications in hemostasis, cohesion, and promotion of healing in plastic surgery. In this article, we review cases where fibrin sealant was used to stabilize microvascular pedicles and compared with previous free flaps performed without fibrin sealant. Methods Between 2008 and 2010, 62 consecutive patients underwent free tissue transfer for reconstruction; this involved 33 latissimus dorsi perforator flaps, 14 thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps, 9 latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, 3 lateral thoracic artery perforator flaps, and 3 transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps, used in head and neck reconstruction, lower limb reconstructions, breast reconstructions, and facial palsy reconstruction. Following microvascular anastomosis, the microvascular pedicles were placed in the optimal position, and fibrin sealant was used to fix and stabilize them. The complications, such as venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, hematoma, and vascular pedicle kinking, were compared with that of 672 previous free flaps without fibrin sealant for stabilizing microvascular pedicles. Results Among the 62 free tissue transfers using fibrin sealant, there was only one complication involving flap failure (1.6%), in this case due to venous thrombosis. Analysis of 672 free flaps performed without application of fibrin sealant revealed 24 complications (3.6%), due to 3 venous thrombosis, 1 arterial thrombosis, 4 vascular pedicel compression due to hematoma, and 16 pedicle kinking. However, the comparison of complications between the free flap using fibrin sealant and the free flap without fibrin sealant were not statistically significant (P?=?0.65). Conclusions Fibrin sealant can be used to prevent vascular kinking and to position anastomosed vessels after successful micro-anastomosis and allow the reconstructive surgeon to overcome challenging situations of vascular pedicle related complications ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We conducted a systematic review of studies that have evaluated invariance of the construct of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to summarize their conclusions related to invariance/noninvariance and sources of noninvariance. In November 2017, we searched Pubmed, PSYCINFO, PILOTS Web of Science, CINAHL, Medline, and Psychological and Behavioral Science Collection for abstracts and articles with these inclusionary criteria: peer-reviewed, including DSM-IV or DSM-5 PTSD invariance as a main study aim, use of multigroup confirmatory factor analyses, and use of an independent PTSD instrument or module. In total, 45 articles out of 1,169 initially identified abstracts met inclusion criteria. Research assistants then followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to complete a secondary search and independently extract data. Results indicated that DSM-IV dysphoric arousal and DSM-5 hybrid model factors demonstrated the most stability; sources of instability were some intrusion (distress to trauma cues), dysphoria/numbing (traumatic amnesia, foreshortened future, emotional numbness, detachment), and arousal (hypervigilance) items. The PTSD Checklist and PTSD Reaction Index were most often used to assess PTSD in studies investigating its invariance; however, these measures demonstrated partial conceptual equivalence of PTSD across subgroups. Instead, clinician-administered measures demonstrated more conceptual equivalence across subgroups. Age, gender, cultural/linguistic factors, and sample diversity had the least moderating effect on PTSD's symptom structure. Our review demonstrates the need to examine invariance of the PTSD construct following recommended guidelines for each empirical and clinical trial study to draw meaningful multigroup comparative conclusions.

AB  - Recently, social media has become a potentially new way for scholarly journals to disseminate and evaluate research outputs. Scholarly journals have started promoting their research articles to a wide range of audiences via social media platforms. This article aims to investigate the social media presence of scholarly journals across disciplines. We extracted journals from Web of Science and searched for the social media presence of these journals on Facebook and Twitter. Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals' social media accounts were also crawled for data analysis. From our results, the social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1% and 14.2% across disciplines; and it has shown a steady increase in the last decade. The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is distinct across disciplines. Further, we investigated whether social media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant effects on the JIF. In addition, a word co-occurrence network analysis was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly journals on social media platforms. Finally, we highlight challenges and issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions.

AB  - Increased radial artery wall thickness (RAWT) is considered to be associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as coronary artery atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, exact measurement of RAWT by noninvasive method before the operation is very important. Objective:? This study was designed to evaluate accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 21 hemodialysis patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation for the first time. We measured RAWT (intima-media thickness) using high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography at the wrist before the AVF operation. We obtained specimens of the radial artery during the AVF operation and then measured RAWT by histologic examination. Results:? Mean age of the patients was 60?±?13 years and the number of females was 7 (33.3%). Mean values of RAWT measured by Doppler ultrasonography and histologic examination were 485?±?93??m (300?700??m) and 426?±?106??m (300?700??m), respectively. The value of RAWT of Doppler sonographic measurement well correlated with that of histologic measurement (r?=?0.800, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that Doppler ultrasonography is an effective tool in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients before AVF operation.

AB  - Background and Objectives Youth drinking is a pervasive public health concern with serious negative developmental implications. Candidate gene and environment interaction studies (cGxE) show that environmental effects on drinking behaviors may differ by individuals? genotypes. Yet little is known about whether genetic and environmental effects on drinking behaviors are developmentally specific. Methods This systematic review evaluated 42 cGxE studies of drinking in adolescence and young adulthood. Results Although there are mixed findings, studies of cGxE effects involving DRD4, 5-HTTLPR, DRD2, and OPRM1 genotypes showed relatively consistent patterns. The effects of under-controlled environments (eg, low levels of parental monitoring) on early and middle adolescent drinking appeared to differ across DRD2 or OPRM1 genotypes. Effects of alcohol-facilitating environments (eg, heavy drinking peers) on late adolescent and young adult drinking appeared to differ across DRD4 or OPRM1 genotypes. Interactions between 5-HTTLPR genotype with stressful environments (eg, negative life events) were found throughout adolescence and young adulthood, although there were some inconsistencies regarding the risk-conferring allele. There was limited evidence for other cGxE effects due to the small number of studies. Conclusions and Scientific Significance This review suggests that GxE findings may advance our knowledge regarding which developmentally specific conditions result in the expression of candidate genes that influence youth alcohol use and misuse. However, since a significant number of studies had small sample sizes and most studies had small effect sizes, findings need replication across independent studies with large samples.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the outcome of dogs with central nervous system lymphoma. Materials and Methods A multi-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted by reviewing medical records of 18 cases of central nervous system lymphoma from seven institutions. Results Diagnosis of lymphoma was made through cerebrospinal fluid analysis, histopathology, flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid, and cytology of cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node or spleen with correlated imaging. A total of 15 of 18 dogs received specific treatment other than prednisone. Three dogs underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgical decompression, five dogs underwent chemotherapy, two dogs underwent radiation therapy after surgical decompression, three dogs underwent chemotherapy after surgical decompression and two dogs underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Only one dog received prednisone, and two dogs did not receive any treatment. Overall, the median survival time was 171?days (range 1 to 1942?days). Clinical Significance Dogs receiving any type of treatment for central nervous system lymphoma lived longer than cases described in previous historical reports. Further studies are needed to elucidate the importance of specific treatment modalities.

AB  - Abstract Importance Reduction of intraoperative complications in phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Background To assess practicability of a risk stratification system, the New Zealand Cataract Risk Stratification (NZCRS) system, in a major teaching hospital service, without investigator oversight, to ascertain whether benefits identified in research studies are maintained in busy clinical practice. Design Prospective cohort study in a major public teaching hospital. Participants Five hundred cases of phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Methods NZCRS system inserted into 621 consecutive preoperative cataract patient files. Recommendation to allocate higher-risk cases to experienced surgeons. Main Outcome Measures NZCRS system uptake and adherence, appropriate identification of high risk cases and intraoperative complication rates. Results NZCRS scores calculated in 500 of 621 (80.5%) cases and 98 (19.6%) scored as ?high risk.? Cataract surgery (N = 500) performed by: 12 Registrars (20%), 4 Fellows (7.2%), 26 Consultants (72.8%). Risk scores adhered to in 99%. Overall intraoperative complications (3.0%) included iris prolapse 1.6% and posterior capsule tear 0.8%. No statistical difference in complication rates identified between surgeon grades. Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 6/10 (20/32). Postoperatively, cystoid macular oedema occurred in 3.2%. Rescoring by an experienced investigator noted a greater number of ?high risk scores? (31.6% vs 19.6%) related to differences in subjective scoring of anterior chamber depth and cataract density. Conclusions and Relevance Practical uptake of cataract risk stratification was promising in this study with NZCRS calculated in 80.5% with 99% adherence to scoring recommendations. Compared to baseline studies, in the day-to-day clinical setting, a continued, decreasing trend in frequency and severity of intraoperative complications was noted. Subjective variability of risk scoring may be further improved by better, objective, standardization.

AB  - Objectives To describe the biochemical changes ? also known as the storage lesion ? that occur in canine packed red blood cells during ex vivo storage. Materials and Methods Ten 125-mL units of non-leuco-reduced packed red blood cells in citrate phosphate dextrose adenine were obtained from a commercial blood bank within 24 hours of donation. Samples were aseptically collected on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 for measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, glucose, pH and ammonia concentrations. All units were cultured on day 42. Friedman's repeated measures test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used for non-parametric data. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for parametric data. Alpha was set to 0·05. Results All analytes changed significantly during storage. The mean ammonia on day 1 (58·14 g/dL) was significantly lower (P<0·05) than those on days 28 (1266 g/dL), 35 (1668 g/dL) and 42 (1860 g/dL). A significant increase in median lactate concentration over time was also observed, with day 1 (4·385 mmol/L) being significantly less (P<0·05) than days 14 (19·82 mmol/L), 21 (22·81 mmol/L), 35 (20·31 mmol/L) and 42 (20·81 mmol/L). Median pH was significantly decreased after day 7. All bacterial cultures were negative. Clinical Significance Many biochemical alterations occur in stored canine packed red blood cells, although further studies are required to determine their clinical importance.

AB  - Background We evaluated composite anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps including vascularized fascia lata (FL), for stable soft tissue coverage and tendons restoration at various joint levels in a one-stage procedure. Methods We performed a retrospective investigation including 21 ?functional? ALT flaps between November 2006 and December 2016. In all patients included, FL was shaped to anatomical reproduce a tendon structure. Functional analysis included range of motion and force assessment. Functional scores were established according to Chen classification, DASH, and LEFS score. Defects resulted from tumor excision, trauma, burn, or infection-debridement and were distributed in four main anatomical districts: knee (seven cases), ankle (six cases), forearm-elbow (four cases), and hand-wrist level (three cases). Results Nineteen flaps were raised as free flaps, while two as distally-based propeller flaps. Average follow-up was 38?months. Major complication requiring the harvest of a second flap was seen in two patients, whereas three flaps presented superficial necrosis and was treated in an outpatient regimen. We observed 81% of total ROM recovery compared to contralateral sides with 89% recovered articular stability. Best articulation outcomes were present in elbow reconstruction, while ankle reconstructions showed less articularity. Hospital stay was significantly reduced in hand and wrist functional reconstruction when compared with reconstruction at the ankle level (P?<?0.05). Conclusion The ALT flap extended to vascularized FL provides a particularly effective and resistant tissue that can be folded to reconstruct and support tendinous structures. This can restore functional and structural integrity after complex defects in a single stage procedure.
