AB  - Summary For most of human history, the experience of delusions has been synonymous with madness. This chapter considers research and theory from a variety of domains to grapple with the nature of delusions. These will involve theory and research on delusions, including a discussion of Jaspers' Wahnstimmung, multiple memory systems, and early childhood experiences, particularly those associated with disorganized attachment. There is abundant evidence that memory systems, particularly autobiographical forms of episodic and semantic memory, and 'working' memory, are impaired in schizophrenia. The double bind theory claims that a regular pattern of disturbed communication between mother (typically) and child, from infancy on, leads to later disturbed 'schizophrenic' thinking and behaviour. While 'double bind' interactions, or disrupted maternal-child communication patterns, may provide the memorial foundation for psychosis in later life, it is also possible that delusions may serve as a creative solution for, or escape from, the double bind.

AB  - Abstract Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are of increasing importance in clinical research because they capture patients? experience with well-being, illness, and their interactions with health care. Because PROs tend to focus on specific symptoms (e.g., pain, anxiety) or general assessments of patient functioning and quality of life that offer unique advantages compared to traditional clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, emergency department revisits), emergency care researchers may benefit from incorporation of PRO measures into their research design as a primary or secondary outcome. Patients may also benefit from the ability of PROs to inform clinical practice and facilitate patient decision making, as PROs are obtained directly from the lived experience of other patients with similar conditions or health status. This review article introduces and defines key terminology relating to PROs, discusses reasons for utilizing PROs in clinical research, outlines basic psychometric and practical assessments that can be used to select a specific PRO measure, and highlights examples of commonly utilized PRO measures in emergency care research.

AB  - Peptide self-assembly is an attractive route for the synthesis of intricate organic nanostructures that possess remarkable structural variety and biocompatibility. Recent studies on peptide-based, self-assembled materials have expanded beyond the construction of high-order architectures; they are now reporting new functional materials that have application in the emerging fields such as artificial photosynthesis and rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, there have been few reviews particularly concentrating on such versatile, emerging applications. Herein, recent advances in the synthesis of self-assembled peptide nanomaterials (e.g., cross ?-sheet-based amyloid nanostructures, peptide amphiphiles) are selectively reviewed and their new applications in diverse, interdisciplinary fields are described, ranging from optics and energy storage/conversion to healthcare. The applications of peptide-based self-assembled materials in unconventional fields are also highlighted, such as photoluminescent peptide nanostructures, artificial photosynthetic peptide nanomaterials, and lithium-ion battery components. The relation of such functional materials to the rapidly progressing biomedical applications of peptide self-assembly, which include biosensors/chips and regenerative medicine, are discussed. The combination of strategies shown in these applications would further promote the discovery of novel, functional, small materials.

AB  - The predicted increase in unconventional gas production is set to change global energy and concomitant geopolitical relations. The scale and required infrastructure of unconventional gas extraction result in profound changes in the landscape where extraction and processing take place. Widespread public concerns about the impacts of this industry have emerged, particularly with regard to fracking, surface and subterranean water contamination, air pollution and a host of other environmental issues, as well as social impacts and health risks. This article sets out some of the emerging anthropological engagements with unconventional gas and fracking, including analyses of materiality, politics, discourses, rights, risk and knowledge.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is difficult to manage and can result in significant patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for painful tendons has received attention, but its efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of PRP and its biological components. A total of 156 patients with LE were randomly divided into group 1, treated with a single injection of 2-ml autologous PRP, and group 2, treated with a control received only physical therapy without injection. Both groups used a tennis elbow strap and performed stretching and strengthening exercises during 24 weeks? follow-up. Pain and functional improvements were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the elbow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White blood cell count, platelet count, and levels of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and interleukin-1 ? in PRP were measured and investigated for statistical correlation with the clinical score. At 24 weeks, all pain and functional variables, including VAS score, Mayo Clinic performance scores, and MRI grade, improved significantly in group 1 (p?<?0.05). PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-? levels were more significantly increased in PRP than in whole blood. TGF-? level significantly correlated with Mayo Clinic performance score and MRI grade improvement. Thus, TGF-? level in PRP is considered to play a pivotal role in tendon healing. These results may contribute to identifying the best protocol for PRP application in tendinopathies. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Ubuntu is a complex concept, but at its simplest is ?human-ness,? the notion that individuals? well-being is intertwined with that of others in the community. This article examines how ubuntu?s multiple meanings offer a potential tool for resilience in South Africa, both for arts organizations and for micro and small businesses. Artist Proof Studio offers a sustained working example of how creativity can make a contribution towards a more just society using a hybrid arts/business model. The arts are particularly important in South Africa for offering the space to address deep wounds, using artistic collaborations to contribute to resilience and wellbeing. Ubuntu can offer an alternative vision to financing micro and small business to the one currently proposed by international lending organizations that seek to import Western-style models of shareholder primacy, short-term profit, and privatization of public goods. Ubuntu allows for creative new approaches to business, encouraging hybrid models that are socially focused and economically sustainable. The arts have the potential for a significant role in conceiving of ubuntu as a tool for resilience of micro and small businesses and as a way of conceptualizing being human in the business context, helping to envision productive and sustainable activities that advance greater economic sustainability.

AB  - Abstract Aims This study examined the association between the need for a repeat voiding trial after midurethral sling (MUS) surgery and 1-year success rates. Methods We conducted this secondary analysis of the participants in the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network trial of midurethral sling (TOMUS) study which compared retropubic versus transobturator MUS. A standard voiding trial was attempted on all subjects. The ?repeat voiding trial? group included subjects discharged with catheterization. All others were considered ?self voiding.? Success rates between the groups at 1-year were compared, followed by multivariate analyses controlling for previously reported clinical predictors of success. Results Most women (76%) were self-voiding, while 24% required a repeat voiding trial. The objective success rate at 1-year was 85.8% in the repeat voiding trial group and 75.3% in the self-voiding group (P?=?0.01). Subjective success rate at 1-year was 61.0% in the repeat voiding trial group and 55.1% in the self-voiding group (P?=?0.23). Women in the repeat voiding trial group continued to demonstrate greater objective success than the self-voiding group in multivariate analysis that controlled for previous incontinence surgery, pad weight, urethral mobility, urge score, and type of MUS (P?=?0.04, OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.03?3.22). Conclusions Women who require a repeat voiding trial following MUS surgery have greater objective success at 1-year postoperatively when compared to those who are self-voiding at the time of discharge. These results may help reassure women who require catheterization after MUS surgery that their outcome is not compromised by this immediate transient post-operative result. Neurourol.

AB  - Purpose:? To report our initial experience of using cutting balloons angioplasty in the treatment of resistant venous stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Materials and Methods:?Forty-eight patients with Brescia-Cimino fistulas underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 62 venous stenoses. Of these 48 patients, we encountered 8 venous stenoses (8/62, 12.9%) in 7 patients that were not successfully dilated with 6?8?mm high-pressure balloons inflated up to 24 atm. In each of 8 stenoses, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm were employed to dilate resistant stenoses. Results:?The locations of stenoses were 3 at the surgical vein mobilization site (?swing point?), 4 at the cephalic vein downstream from the anastomosis, and 1 at the cephalic arch. The grade of stenosis after high-pressure balloon angioplasty ranged from 57% to 87%(mean, 76%). Cutting balloons expanded completely in all stenoses and the residual stenosis after cutting balloon PTA ranged from 0% to 24%(mean, 7%). Residual stenosis was virtually nonexisistent at the 3 stenoses of ?swing point.? A focal rupture with a large hematoma occurred at the cephalic arch stenosis, which was treated by a stent placement. One minimal rupture that did not require any treatment occurred at the stenosis of downstream cephalic vein. No repeat angioplasty has been needed during follow-up period (range, 74?249 days). Conclusion:?Our early experience demonstrated that when high-pressure balloons fail to dilate stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm can be effectively used to overcome the resistance of stenoses.

AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) ?Level of Evidence?4 What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Although research in other fields of society demonstrate a negative effect of distraction on performance, little research is done within the surgical specialties. We aimed to establish what the effect of distraction is, on the performance of basic endourological tasks by medical students. OBJECTIVE ??To establish the effect of distraction on the performance of cystoscopy and basic endourological tasks by using a virtual reality (VR) simulator. SUBJECTS AND METHODS ??A total of 86 third-year medical students from Maastricht University, who had no previous experience in performing the tasks on a VR simulator, were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. ??All participants performed three endourological tasks on the VR simulator. Participants in the intervention group were distracted 1 min into the third task. The distraction consisted of being asked to answer questions about a medical case that had been presented to all the participants before the hands-on session. After two adequate verbal responses the conversation was terminated. ??Number of traumata, number of missed lesions in the bladder and time to completion were measured by the VR simulator. RESULTS ??Number of traumata and missed lesions, as well as time to completion were significantly higher in the intervention than in the control group with effect sizes (using Cohen?s categorization) of 0.48, 0.41 and 0.50 respectively. ??Nevertheless, only 9.5% of the participants in the intervention group reported feeling burdened by the distraction. CONCLUSIONS ??Distraction during the performance of endourological skills results in significantly poorer performance by medical students on all the variables measured in a controlled learning environment. ??Most students do not realize they are affected by distraction. ??Further research is needed to determine the impact of distraction on more experienced participants and on patient safety.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have proposed that glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST) is associated with a loss of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which may be an initiating factor in intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. Despite its promising potential, this application has not been reported in human in vivo IVD studies because of the challenges of B0 magnetic field inhomogeneity in gagCEST. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of quantifying CEST values in IVDs of healthy volunteers using a clinical 3 T scanner. A single-slice turbo spin echo sequence was used to quantify the CEST effect in various GAG phantoms and in IVDs of 12 volunteers. The phantom results indicated high correlation between gagCEST and GAG concentrations (R2?=?0.95). With optimal B0 inhomogeneity correction, in vivo CEST maps of IVDs showed robust contrast between the nucleus pulposus (NP) and the annulus fibrosus (AF) (p?<?0.01), as well as higher signal in the central relative to the peripheral NP. In addition, a trend of decreasing CEST values from upper to lower disc levels was evident in NP. Our results demonstrate that in vivo gagCEST quantification in human lumbar IVDs is feasible at 3?T in combination with successful B0 inhomogeneity correction, but without significant hardware modifications. Our initial findings suggest that it would be worthwhile to perform direct correlation studies between CEST and GAGs using cadaver samples, and to extend this novel technique to studies on patients with degenerative discs to better understand its distinct imaging features relative to conventional techniques.

AB  - Abstract Mutually interacted musculoskeletal tissues work together within the physiological environment full of varieties of external stimulus. Consistent with the locomotive function of the tissues, musculoskeletal cells are remarkably mechanosensitive to the physical cues. Signals like extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, topography, and geometry can be sensed and transduced into intracellular signaling cascades to trigger a series of cell responses, including cell adhesion, cell phenotype maintenance, cytoskeletal reconstruction, and stem cell differentiation (Du et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017). With the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the potent effects of ECM physical properties on cell behaviors at the cell-matrix interface are drawing much attention. To mimic the interaction between cell and its ECM physical properties, developing advanced biomaterials with desired characteristics which could achieve the biointerface between cells and the surrounded matrix close to the physiological conditions becomes a great hotspot. In this review, based on the current publications in the field of biointerfaces, we systematically summarized the significant roles of stiffness and topography on musculoskeletal cell behaviors. We hope to shed light on the importance of physical cues in musculoskeletal tissue engineering and provide up to date strategies towards the natural or artificial replication of physiological microenvironment.
