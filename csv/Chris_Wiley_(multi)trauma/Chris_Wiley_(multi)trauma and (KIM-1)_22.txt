AB  - Abstract Mutually interacted musculoskeletal tissues work together within the physiological environment full of varieties of external stimulus. Consistent with the locomotive function of the tissues, musculoskeletal cells are remarkably mechanosensitive to the physical cues. Signals like extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, topography, and geometry can be sensed and transduced into intracellular signaling cascades to trigger a series of cell responses, including cell adhesion, cell phenotype maintenance, cytoskeletal reconstruction, and stem cell differentiation (Du et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017). With the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the potent effects of ECM physical properties on cell behaviors at the cell-matrix interface are drawing much attention. To mimic the interaction between cell and its ECM physical properties, developing advanced biomaterials with desired characteristics which could achieve the biointerface between cells and the surrounded matrix close to the physiological conditions becomes a great hotspot. In this review, based on the current publications in the field of biointerfaces, we systematically summarized the significant roles of stiffness and topography on musculoskeletal cell behaviors. We hope to shed light on the importance of physical cues in musculoskeletal tissue engineering and provide up to date strategies towards the natural or artificial replication of physiological microenvironment.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for extreme cases in patients with massive anterior mediastinal masses, but resection of this mass without prior tissue diagnosis would not be an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Cardiopulmonary bypass is rarely necessary for management of lung injury. The requirement for high-dose anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would present prohibitive risk and would likely be associated with a dismal neurological outcome. All patients undergoing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment must be assessed with frequent neurovascular examinations. Benign etiologies include superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, mediastinal fibrosis, and complications of intravascular devices and catheters. Several operative techniques have been described for damage control of thoracotomy to control hemorrhage and decrease operative time and transfusion requirements, as well as improving survival.

AB  - Objective? To determine the clinical value of a novel osteoarthritis (OA) biomarker in detecting canine cruciate disease. Study Design? Cross sectional clinical study. Animals? Dogs (n=22) with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and 12 control dogs. Methods? Concentrations of collagenase-generated cleavage epitope of type II collagen (Col2-3/4Clong mono, or C2C) in serum, urine, and joint fluid were compared between a group of dogs with CCL rupture and a control group. Correlation of C2C concentrations to the clinical stage of stifle OA was also evaluated. Results? There were no significant differences in C2C concentrations in serum, urine, and joint fluid between groups (P>.05). Subjective scores of lameness, joint effusion, osteophytosis were significantly more severe in the CCL rupture group compared with the control group (P<.05). There was no significant correlation of C2C concentrations with clinical stage of stifle OA (P>.05). Conclusion? This OA biomarker did not detect pathology associated with CCL rupture. Our results suggest that collagenase-specific degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage may not be involved in the early stage of naturally occurring canine cruciate disease, and that pathology associated with naturally occurring CCL rupture is different from that of experimental OA model. Clinical Relevance? C2C is not clinically useful in detecting CCL rupture in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Computed tomography angiography is widely used for the assessment of various mesenteric vascular and bowel diseases in humans. However, there are only few studies that describe CT angiography application to mesenteric vessels in dogs. In this prospective, experimental, exploratory study, the mesenteric vasculature and enhancement pattern of the intestinal wall were evaluated on triple-phase CT angiography, and improvement of the visibility of vasculature was assessed on multiplanar reformation, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering technique. After test bolus scanning at the level of the cranial mesenteric artery arising from the aorta, mesenteric CT angiography was performed in 10 healthy, male, Beagle dogs. Scan delay was set based on time-to-attenuation curves, drawn by placing the regions of interest over the aorta, intestinal wall, and cranial mesenteric vein. Visualization and enhancement of mesenteric arteries and veins were evaluated with multiplanar reformation, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering techniques. The degree of intestinal wall enhancement was assessed on the transverse images in precontrast, arterial, intestinal, and venous phases. Pure arterial images were obtained in the arterial phase. Venous phase images allowed good portal vascular mapping. All CT angiography images were of high quality, allowing for excellent visualization of the anatomy of mesenteric vasculature including the small branches, particularly on maximum intensity projection and volume rendering technique. Distinct contrast enhancement of the intestinal wall was observed in both intestinal and venous phases. Findings indicated that this technique is feasible for the evaluation of mesenteric circulation in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Background Whether the introduction of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has an effect on transplant outcome for different age categories remain unclear. Methods We analyzed 49,762 adult hepatitis C virus (HCV) candidates through 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2012 from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Patients were divided into four age categories (18?34, 35?49, 60?64, ≥65 years) in the pre-MELD era and MELD era, respectively. Results Waiting list dropouts have decreased in the MELD era for all categories. A reduced trend in survival was observed for 18?34 years patients in the MELD era compared with the pre-MELD era, with 5-year intention-to-treat, overall and graft survival of 56.5%, 57.9%, 56.3% vs. 56.4%, 69.7%, 64.4% (P = 0.604, 0.034, and 0.071, respectively). For other age categories, survival rates were all superior in the MELD era. Cox-regression analysis showed values of hazard ratio for age increased with advanced age (all >1) in the pre-MELD era compared with the reference group (18?34 years), while these hazard ratios were <1 for overall and graft survival in MELD era. Conclusions Our study provides useful evidence that the introduction of MELD for liver allocation may adversely affect survival of specific HCV patients.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 112, 1415?1430. Abstract Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease increasingly recognized as one of the most important medical problems affecting the elderly. Although a number of drugs, including several cholinesterase inhibitors and an NMDA receptor antagonist, have been approved for use, they have been shown to produce diverse side effects and yield relatively modest benefits. To overcome these limitations of current therapeutics for AD, extensive research and development are underway to identify drugs that are effective and free of undesirable side effects. Certain naturally occurring dietary polyphenolic phytochemicals have received considerable recent attention as alternative candidates for AD therapy. In particular, curcumin, resveratrol, and green tea catechins have been suggested to have the potential to prevent AD because of their anti-amyloidogenic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. These polyphenolic phytochemicals also activate adaptive cellular stress responses, called ?neurohormesis?, and suppress disease processes. In this commentary, we describe the amyloid-?-induced pathogenesis of AD, and summarize the intracellular and molecular targets of selected dietary phytochemicals that might slow the progression of AD.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study's objectives were to examine the effects of depression on the distress of caregivers of children with brain tumors and to identify the factors moderating depression and caregiver distress. Methods Participants were 82 caregivers of children with brain tumors undergoing treatment in the National Cancer Center of South Korea. The depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Burden of a Primary Caregiver (BPC) Scale were used to measure participants' depression and caregiver distress, respectively. The Korean version of the Parenting Sense of Competence (K-PSOC) Scale, Family Environmental Scale-Revised (K-FES-R), and the DUKE-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire-S (DUKE-UNC-FSSQ) were used to assess parental efficacy, family relationships, and perceived social support, respectively. Results Younger patient age, lower family income, and caregivers' greater number of years of education significantly predicted caregiver distress. Caregivers with depression experienced significantly more distress than those without depression. The interaction of depression with parenting efficacy and social support affected caregiver distress. For highly depressed caregivers, parental efficacy, social support, and family relationships played weaker roles as protective factors against caregiver distress. High parental efficacy and social support were protective factors against distress in caregivers without depression. Conclusions A multi-dimensional assessment of the psychosocial factors that may affect caregivers of children with brain tumors should precede interventions for distress management. Interventions tailored to individuals' psychosocial factors are needed. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare, recently described fibrotic skin condition that primarily affects patients with a history of renal disease.We report 2 cases of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and review clinical and histopathologic features with differential diagnosis and more.Case #1 was a 64-year-old black male with chronic renal insufficiency which progressed to end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. After two days, he developed blisters on both his hands. By a month, his blister lesions resolved leaving scaly skin with some skin thickening and tightening in the hands and forearms. Over the course of one month, skin over above-mentioned areas began to harden and stiffen. His fingers began to coalesce and contract resulting in fixation of hand grip. He also developed flexing contracts at the elbows bilaterally. Skin biopsy revealed the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with giant cells reaction. Case #2 was a 44-year-old black male with a hx of nephropathy. He eventually developed end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. One month after, he was found to have thickened, sclerotic appearing skin involving the upper back, hands, and forearms with flexing contracts of the all the small joints. Histopathology was most consistent with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to determine whether functional disturbances in fronto-striatal control circuits characterize adolescents with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) spectrum eating disorders regardless of clinical severity. FMRI was used to assess conflict-related brain activations during performance of a Simon task in two samples of adolescents with BN symptoms compared with healthy adolescents. The BN samples differed in the severity of their clinical presentation, illness duration and age. Multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPAs) based on machine learning were used to determine whether patterns of fronto-striatal activation characterized adolescents with BN spectrum disorders regardless of clinical severity, and whether accurate classification of less symptomatic adolescents (subthreshold BN; SBN) could be achieved based on patterns of activation in adolescents who met DSM5 criteria for BN. MVPA classification analyses revealed that both BN and SBN adolescents could be accurately discriminated from healthy adolescents based on fronto-striatal activation. Notably, the patterns detected in more severely ill BN compared with healthy adolescents accurately discriminated less symptomatic SBN from healthy adolescents. Deficient activation of fronto-striatal circuits can characterize BN early in its course, when clinical presentations are less severe, perhaps pointing to circuit-based disturbances as useful biomarker or risk factor for the disorder, and a tool for understanding its developmental trajectory, as well as the development of early interventions.

AB  - Abstract This study assessed the social adaptation of sexually abused children and tested whether children's emotion regulation competencies mediated the association between child sexual abuse (CSA) and two outcomes of the social domain (i.e. withdrawal and social difficulties). A group of 283 child victims of sexual abuse and a comparison group composed of 60 nonabused children was recruited. Teachers completed questionnaires assessing the children's emotion regulation competencies, withdrawal, and social difficulties exhibited in the school context. Results showed that sexually abused children displayed poorer emotion regulation skills and higher levels of both withdrawal and social difficulties relative to nonabused children. CSA was associated with social difficulties and withdrawn behavior through the mediation of emotion regulation competencies. Teachers and school psychologists should be assisted in identifying children at risk of social difficulties and emotional dysregulation and schools be encouraged to adopt a trauma-informed approach.

AB  - In recent years, many urban areas have established healthcare coalitions (HCCs) composed of autonomous (and often competing) hospitals, with the goal of improving emergency preparedness and response. We study the role of such coalitions in the specific context of response to multiple-casualty incidents in an urban setting, where on-scene responders must determine how to send casualties to medical facilities. A key function in incident response is multi-agency coordination. When this coordination is provided by an HCC, responders can use richer information about hospital capacities to decide where to send casualties. Using bed availability data from an urban area and a suburban area in the United States, we analyze the response capability of healthcare infrastructures under different levels of coordination, and we develop a stress test to identify areas of weakness. We find that improved coordination efforts should focus on decision support using information about inpatient resources, especially in urban areas with high inter-hospital variability in resource availability. We also find that coordination has the largest benefit in small incidents. This benefit is a new value proposition for HCCs, which were originally formed to improve preparedness for large disasters.
