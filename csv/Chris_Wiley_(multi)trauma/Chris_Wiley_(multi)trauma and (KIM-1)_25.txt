AB  - Background Since 2010, the numbers of refugees have increased and around half are under 18 years of age. It is known that experience of organised violence, displacement and resettlement increases the risk for psychiatric disorders and psychosocial impairment. This review integrates recent research into the risk and protective factors for psychopathology with service and treatment issues. Methods We draw on and critically evaluate key systematic reviews in the selected areas, innovative robust studies and relevant government reports. Results Many refugee children show resilience and function well, even in the face of substantial adversities. The most robust findings for psychopathology are that PTSD, and posttraumatic and depressive symptoms are found at higher prevalence in those who have been exposed to war experiences. Their severity may decrease over time with resettlement, but PTSD in the most exposed may show higher continuity. More severe psychiatric disorders including psychosis may also occur. Service delivery needs to take into account socioeconomic and cultural influences but, given the high level of unmet need even in high-income countries, stepped care delivery is required. The evaluation of psychological interventions, often delivered in group settings, suggests that they can be effective for many distressed children; however, for the more impaired, a greater range of disorder-specific therapies will be required. Conclusions Child and adolescent mental health clinicians and service providers need to be aware of the specific needs of this population and systems for service delivery. There are significant knowledge gaps in understanding risk and vulnerability, service delivery and treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to evaluate fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) among lymphoma patients who completed treatment and its impact on survival and quality of life (QOL). Methods In this prospective cohort study, 467 lymphoma patients were included who completed treatment with curative intent between February 2012 and March 2017. FCR was measured using a question from the Korean version of the QOL in Cancer Survivors Questionnaire. QOL and general health and functioning were measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. Participants were actively followed up for all-cause and disease-specific mortality. Results In total, 16.3% of the patients had severe FCR. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality comparing participants with and without severe FCR was 2.52 (95% CI = 1.15-5.54), and the association was stronger in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (HR = 6.77; 95% CI = 1.04-43.92). Participants with severe FCR were also at higher risk of lymphoma-specific mortality (HR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.13-6.05) than patients without severe FCR. Patients with severe FCR had significantly worse general health status (64.3 vs 71.0, P = .03) and physical (82.4 vs 76.7, P < .01), emotional (68.5 vs 84.8, P < .001), and social functioning (67.8 vs 84.2, P < .001) than patients without severe FCR. Conclusions A substantial number of participants with lymphoma experience FCR after treatment completion, even in the case of indolent lymphomas. Given the negative impact of severe FCR on survival and general health and functional status, active monitoring and appropriate management of FCR should be considered in clinical settings.

AB  - Background and purpose Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) have been extensively studied in healthy controls and patients with cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Our aim was to characterize the clinical and radiological features of CMBs in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Methods This cross-sectional study included consecutive parkinsonian patients who attended the authors' movement disorders clinic from March 2010 to February 2012 and underwent a standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol with gradient recalled echo taken with a 3 T MRI machine. Results Amongst parkinsonian disorders, CMBs were most common in vascular parkinsonism (VP) (56%) and least common in IPD (17.7%). In IPD, CMBs were significantly associated with white matter hyperintensities and concurrent lacunar infarctions. The presence of CMBs had no effect on various cognitive domains in IPD. IPD with CMBs was discriminated from VP by clinical and neuroimaging findings: frequencies of motor subtypes were similar between IPD with and without CMBs, whereas all VP patients were the postural-instability gait difficulty type. In 90.9% of the IPD cases with CMBs, the numbers of CMBs were three or less, whereas the numbers of CMBs exceeded three in 50% of the cases of VP and exceeded 10 in 31.3% of the cases (P < 0.001). The topography of the CMBs in IPD was also different from that in VP (P < 0.01). Conclusions Cerebral microbleeds are not rare in IPD, and IPD with CMBs does not appear to be a form of VP. Further studies in larger populations are needed to elucidate the clinical implications of CMBs in terms of prognoses and cognitive changes in IPD.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to assess the frequency of localised primary canine hypoplasia (LHPC) in a sample of 24 subadults from a Neolithic cemetery assemblage located at Man Bac, northern Vietnam (~4000?3500?years BP), and explore the range of factors potentially contributing to the development of this condition. It is found that 41.7% of individuals (20.9% of primary canines) have LHPC, which is similar to the frequency reported in a suite of ancient cemetery series from Neolithic through to Metal Age Thailand. A range of competing aetiological factors considered included trauma to the deciduous canine, ostensibly by way of early childhood exploratory behaviours (e.g. ?mouthing? objects), nutritional and dietary deficiencies (especially vitamin A and D), the impact of the mother's health on the developing foetus as well as the effects of premature birth on the developing child. It is concluded that while the aetiology LHPC is multi-factorial, the reasonably high prevalence of this condition at Man Bac suggests depressed maternal and neonatal health, consistent with a community experiencing high rates of fertility and transitioning to an agricultural subsistence economy.

AB  - Abstract Background Regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) is demonstrated to decrease regional bone mineral density and accelerate bone turnover. Hypothesizing that RAP can negatively affect the osseointegration of biomaterials, this study aimed to investigate the possible influence of the RAP on dental implant osseointegration. Materials and Methods Orthognathic surgery, one of the major surgeries on oral and maxillofacial region was set as intervention for RAP. Considering that RAP exerts its physiologic effects until 4 months after noxious stimuli, patients were classified according to the time interval between orthognathic surgery and dental implant installation; group I was designated to patients who had implant installation within 4 months from orthognathic surgery. Group II were those with installation after 4-12?months and group III was longer than 12?months. Radiographic and clinical evaluations of dental implants including peri-implant marginal bone changes (MBR), implant stability, cumulative survival rates were analyzed. Results A total of 54 patients with 106 implants (mean follow-up of 72.6 months) were included in the study. MBR was significantly higher in group I (2.62?±?0.91?mm) and II (2.25?±?0.95?mm) compared to that of group III (0.94?±?0.90?mm) at last follow up (P?<?0.05) and this group difference over time was also significant (P?<?0.001). Compared to group III, groups I and II exhibited lower ISQ values and higher biological complications including peri-implantitis and peri-implant gingivitis (P?<?0.05). Group I showed significantly low-cumulative survival rate (89.2%; implant-level) compared to groups II and III. Conclusions In this study, impaired osseointegration of dental implants was demonstrated associated with orthognathic surgery. Micro-environmental changes of hard tissue induced by major surgery on the jaw showed deteriorating effects on integrity of biomaterial osseointegration. Special considerations should be addressed for ideal treatment results and prognosis.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

AB  - Abstract Research studies have revealed that people with hoarding typically collect and keep items due to their aesthetic appeal, utility and strong emotional attachment to the items resulting in clutter and limiting living spaces. This study aims to explore the experiences of individuals with hoarding disorder to understand and describe?the patterns and reasons for hoarding, experiences with decluttering and the impact of hoarding disorder on significant others and society in the context of a multi-ethnic urban Asian country. A total of 12 participants with hoarding disorder were recruited and interviewed using a simple semi-structured interview guide designed for the study. The resulting transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The mean age of the participants was 56.7 years (SD = 14.5). Nine super-ordinate and discrete but interconnecting themes emerged from the qualitative interviews: types of hoarded items, sources of hoarded items, ways of storing/arranging hoarded items, help-seeking/treatment contact, reasons for hoarding, experiences with decluttering, impact upon family, community and self, restricting hoarding behaviours and insight. Key themes identified in the study are consistent with the literature on studies on hoarding which have been done in other populations. Hoarding in the community has serious consequences for individuals with hoarding disorder and others living in the community, which is compounded by the lack of insight among these individuals. There is a pressing need to increase public awareness and recognition of hoarding behaviours to aid efforts in bringing timely and appropriate services to the affected individuals.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides orientation for the book by exploring how practices of caring and designing have been disconnected or brought together at different junctures, and how the recent upsurge in academic work on care can offer methodological and pedagogical ideas for those involved in the shaping of the built environment. The authors begin by discussing recent work on care in the social sciences to demonstrate how the notion might be deployed in support of design sensibilities that are responsive to the fragile interdependencies of the world. Imrie and Kullman then turn to explore ?good urban form?, which is a fundamental part of the attempt to study and theorise the design and use of civic spaces and the political and ethical relations that they facilitate. The authors conclude by introducing the chapters in the volume, highlighting relevant themes and how they contribute to debates around design, care and urban environments.

AB  - A two-year-old Rottweiler presented for acute onset of a right hindlimb lameness 20 weeks after a cementless total hip replacement (THR) and 16 weeks after open reduction to address luxation of the THR. Radiographs revealed periosteal proliferation of the medial acetabulum and a stable implant. Synovial fluid cytology was consistent with inflammatory joint fluid. Treatment consisted of surgical debridement and intravenous and oral antibiotics. THR implants were not removed. Culture of tissue removed from the THR site yielded growth of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus species. Lameness resolved 2 months after surgery. Twenty months after surgery, the dog was exercising normally with no clinical lameness and pelvic radiographs revealed no evidence of implant loosening and markedly decreased periosteal reaction. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an infected THR site successfully treated without prosthesis explantation in the dog.

Methods Data were obtained from 280 breast cancer survivors receiving treatment at the outpatient clinic of Kosin University Hospital located in Busan City, Korea, and the collected data were used to confirm content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, and internal consistency reliability. Results The Korean version of the BCRS comprised two subdomains and a total of 16 items, and the internal consistency reliability estimated by Cronbach?s alpha was .87~.89. Conclusion This study found that the Korean version BCRS has high validity and reliability. In future studies, it will be necessary to conduct research that identifies the resilience levels of patients with breast cancer, using the Korean version BCRS, and seeks interventions in agreement with the results.

AB  - ABSTRACT? The current liver allocation system, introduced in 2002, decreased the importance of waiting time for allocation priorities; the number of active wait-listed candidates and median waiting times were immediately reduced. However, the total number of adult wait-listed candidates has increased since 2002, and median waiting time has increased since 2006. Pretransplant mortality rates have been stable, but the number of candidates withdrawn from the list as being too sick to undergo transplant nearly doubled between 2009 and 2011. Deceased donation rates have remained stable, with an increasing proportion of expanded criteria donors. Living donation has decreased over the past 10 years. Transplant outcomes remain robust, with continuously improving graft survival rates for deceased donor, living donor, and donation after circulatory death livers. Numbers of new and prevalent pediatric candidates on the waiting list have decreased. Pediatric pretransplant mortality has decreased, most dramatically for candidates aged less than 1 year. The transplant rate has increased since 2002, and is highest in candidates aged less than 1 year. Graft survival continues to improve for pediatric recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers. Incidence of acute rejections increases with time after transplant. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder remains an important concern in pediatric recipients.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.
