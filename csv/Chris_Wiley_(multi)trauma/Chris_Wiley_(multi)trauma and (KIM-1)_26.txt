AB  - Objective:? The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern and prevalence of hypodontia in the Korean population along with its association with the dental and skeletal polymorphisms. Subjects and materials:? The diagnostic materials including casts, panoramic radiographs, and lateral cephalograms of 1622 Korean subjects (611 males, 1011 females) were used to evaluate the pattern and prevalence of hypodontia as well as its association with the congenital absence of the third molar. The changes in the tooth size and skeletal characteristics of the hypodontia group were evaluated using cast/cephalometric analysis and compared with the standard values of normal occlusion in Koreans. Results:? The prevalence of hypodontia in Koreans was 11.2%. The mandibular lateral incisor and second premolar were the most frequently absent. Congenital absence of the third molar was observed more frequently in the hypodontia group than in the non-hypodontia group. The prevalence of hypodontia in Class III malocclusion was significantly higher than in Class I or Class II malocclusion. Conclusion:? The pattern and prevalence of hypodontia can vary in different ethnic groups. In Koreans, the special features of hypodontia were its association with a higher level of congenital missing third molars and skeletal Class III malocclusion.

AB  - Recent advances in nanotechnology have generated wide interest in applying nanomaterials for neural prostheses. An ideal neural interface should create seamless integration into the nervous system and performs reliably for long periods of time. As a result, many nanoscale materials not originally developed for neural interfaces become attractive candidates to detect neural signals and stimulate neurons. In this comprehensive review, an overview of state-of-the-art microelectrode technologies provided first, with focus on the material properties of these microdevices. The advancements in electro?active nanomaterials are then reviewed, including conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon nanowires, and hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials, for neural recording, stimulation, and growth. Finally, technical and scientific challenges are discussed regarding biocompatibility, mechanical mismatch, and electrical properties faced by these nanomaterials for the development of long-lasting functional neural interfaces.

AB  - The impact of sibling sexual abuse (SSA) has been culturally and therapeutically minimised and has received scant research attention. Furthermore, prior research has focused upon the separate experiences of the victim or the offender, or upon seeking family dysfunction explanations. In contrast, this qualitative study attempts to understand the experiences of all family members (victims, offenders, parents and other siblings) when SSA is disclosed. The pathway to recovery for each family member is identified. A systemic analysis of these (often conflicted) pathways of recovery provides some surprising findings and contributes to an understanding of the difficulties facing families in this situation, the constraints on family support and connectedness, validation for the victim and offender accountability.

AB  - Abstract DAPK (death-associated protein kinase) is a calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) regulated serine/threonine kinase. Structurally, it assumes a multi-domain structure and participates in various apoptotic systems which imply that it may interact with a wide range of intracellular components to exert its action. DAPK plays vital roles in pro-apoptotic, apoptotic and autophagic pathways. In addition, it plays important roles in many diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia and epilepsy. Although a novel protein, DAPK's various cellular signal transduction pathways proves that it can be a target for a potential future therapeutic effects. Specific role of DAPK in the development and maintenance of the nervous system needs to be further investigated as it is involved in neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury and neuronal development or recovery from injury. This review summarizes DAPK signaling pathways in autophagy, apoptosis, and stresses the important role it might play in the nervous system.

AB  - Abstract Background Postpartum hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening albeit preventable condition that persists as a leading cause of maternal death. Identification of safe and cost-effective hemostatic treatment options remains crucial as a supplement to surgery and uterotonic agents. Objective This review summarizes the background, current evidence and recommendations with regard to the role of fibrinogen, tranexamic acid, prothrombin complex concentrate, desmopressin, and recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of patients with postpartum hemorrhage. The benefits and evidence behind traditional standard laboratory tests and viscoelastic hemostatic assays, i.e. thromboelastography TEG? and thromboelastometry ROTEM?, are discussed. In addition we assess and elaborate on the current paradigm and evidence for transfusion of these patients. Data sources Publications between 1994 and 2014 were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and ClinicalTrial.gov. Results Viscoelastic hemostatic assays were found to provide a real-time continuum of coagulation and fibrinolysis when introduced as a supplement in transfusion management of postpartum hemorrhage. Fibrinogen should be considered when hypofibrinogenemia is identified. Early administration of 1?2 g tranexamic acid is recommended, followed by an additional dose in cases of ongoing bleeding. Uncontrolled hemorrhage requires early balanced transfusion. Conclusion Despite the lack of conclusive evidence for optimal hemostatic resuscitation in postpartum hemorrhage, the use of viscoelastic hemostatic assays, fibrinogen, tranexamic acid and balanced transfusion therapy may prove to be potentially pivotal in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.

AB  - Background Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (EAF) is a benign rare lesion of the upper respiratory mucosa. EAF most commonly presents with an obstructive nasal mass. Due to the rarity of EAF, case reports and case studies have predominated the literature. This systematic review discusses the demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, management, and outcomes of this uncommon entity. Methods The PubMed database was searched for all articles describing patients diagnosed with sinonasal EAF. Additional cases were examined from the bibliographies of selected articles. Demographics, clinical presentation, associated findings, radiography, management, and outcome were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases were included from 34 articles, including 1 case from our institution. The most common presenting symptom was nasal obstruction (78.8%). Fourteen patients (26.9%) had a previous history of nasal surgery or trauma. Surgical resection alone was the most commonly used primary treatment approach (50.0%), resulting in the greatest proportion of disease-free patients (55.6%) over a median follow-up period of 36 months. A combination of surgery and corticosteroids was the second-most-common treatment modality, used in 28.8% of cases. Of the 40 cases reporting patient outcomes, 100% of patients were alive at follow-up independent of treatment modality. Conclusion To date, this review contains the largest number of patients with sinonasal EAF. Aggressive surgical resection alone constitutes the most common treatment modality and may be most effective at eradicating disease.

AB  - Abstract To study the expression level of a panel of pro/anti-apoptotic factors and inflammation-related receptors in chondral fragments from patients undergoing surgical treatment for intra-articular calcaneal fractures, cartilage fragments were retrieved from calcaneal fractures of 20 patients subjected to surgical treatment. Primary cultures were performed using chondral fragments from fractured and control patients. Chondrocyte cultures from each patient of the fractured and control groups were subjected to immunofluorescence staining and quantitatively analyzed under confocal microscopy. Proteins extracted from the cultured chondrocytes taken from the fractured and control groups were processed for Western blot experiments and densitometric analysis. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the cleaved PARP-1 antibody. The proportion of labelled cells was 35% for fractured specimens, compared with 7% for control samples. Quantification of caspase-3 active and Bcl-2 proteins in chondrocyte cultures showed a significant increase of the apoptotic process in fractured specimens compared with control ones. Fractured chondrocytes were positively stained for ChemR23 with statistically significant differences with respect to control samples. Densitometric evaluation of the immunoreactive bands confirmed these observations. Human articular chondrocytes obtained from patients with intra-articular calcaneal fractures express higher levels of pivotal pro-apoptotic factors, and of the chemo-attractive receptor ChemR23, compared with control cultures. On the basis of these observations, the authors hypothesize that consistent prolonged chondrocyte death, associated with the persistence of high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, could enhance the deterioration of cartilage tissue with consequent development of post-traumatic arthritis following intra-articular bone fracture.

AB  - Abstract This prospective investigation applied the Experience Sampling Method to examine the mood and behavioral responses of individuals facing the risk of community violence (in anticipation of the second Rodney King verdicts). Threatened participants experienced more negative affect and were less stable in behavioral involvement than individuals not under threat. Threatened participants also avoided social contact except for well-known individuals, and were more likely to be traveling than nonthreatened participants. Social contact with family or close friends and being at home (one's own home or the home of familiar individuals) were associated with large reductions in negative affect for those at risk for urban violence. The findings are discussed in terms of risk factors for trauma following community-wide stressors.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the outcome effects of cognitive match between Asian and White outpatient clients and their therapists. Many clinicians believe that one hindrance to the treatment of ethnic minority clients is that therapists and clients may not share common assumptions and attitudes about therapy and about the problems that are presented in treatment. The study investigated client?therapist similarity in their perceptions of the presenting problem, coping orientation, and expectations about treatment goals. This study constituted a more rigorous test of the cognitive match hypotheses in that it was prospective in nature, used separate and independent sources for the cognitive predictors, employed multiple outcome measures, and focused on specific attitudes and perceptions that are quite salient and relevant to treatment. Cognitive match on treatment goals was predictive of session impact. Moreover, cognitive matches in avoidant coping orientation and in perceived distress associated with interpersonal problems were predictive of certain treatment outcomes. The findings may help explain why clients matched on ethnicity with their therapists tend to stay longer in treatment and do better in psychotherapy. ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This chapter gives some explanations about in situ TEM mostly dedicated to the study of devices. It lists the various forms of in situ TEM techniques regarding their physical meaning conjugated to their experimental requirements. The forms of in situ TEM techniques include temperature control and electron irradiation, electromagnetic field applications, mechanical traction or compression, chemistry, light interaction, and current injection constraint. The chapter reviews commercial and homemade sample holder designs such as multi-contact holders and movable contact holders. The chapter finally describes some of the most common tools that can be used to easily design a TEM sample that can be fitted within the sample holders. The tools discussed are focused ion beam and TEM windows.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of proximal ulnar rotational osteotomy (PURO) on the contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of cadaveric normal dog elbows. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals Unpaired thoracic limbs from 12 dogs (mean ± SD weight, 26 ± 4 kg). Methods PURO consisted of a transverse osteotomy with 30° external rotation of the proximal segment. With the limb under 200 N axial load, contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (CP) and peak contact pressure (PCP) were measured using digital pressure sensors in the medial and lateral compartments and 3D static elbow poses were obtained, before and after PURO. Each specimen was tested at 115°, 135°, and 155° elbow flexion, with the antebrachium in neutral rotation, in 28° supination, and in 16° pronation. Repeated measures ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni (P ≤ .05) were performed. Results PURO caused significant changes, mostly at 135° elbow flexion and neutral antebrachial rotation, characterized by decreased CP (10%) and PCP (10%) in the medial compartment, and increased CP (27%) and PCP (23%) in the lateral compartment. The apex of the medial coronoid process translated 3.4 mm caudally, 1.7 mm abaxially, and rotated 1.8° externally relative to the radial head. Humeroradial varus angulation reduced by 6.7°. Conclusions In limited poses, PURO displaces the medial coronoid process caudally and abaxially and shifts contact pressures towards the lateral elbow compartment by decreasing varus angulation.
