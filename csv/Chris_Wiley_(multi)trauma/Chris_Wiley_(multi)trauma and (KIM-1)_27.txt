AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of proximal ulnar rotational osteotomy (PURO) on the contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of cadaveric normal dog elbows. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals Unpaired thoracic limbs from 12 dogs (mean ± SD weight, 26 ± 4 kg). Methods PURO consisted of a transverse osteotomy with 30° external rotation of the proximal segment. With the limb under 200 N axial load, contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (CP) and peak contact pressure (PCP) were measured using digital pressure sensors in the medial and lateral compartments and 3D static elbow poses were obtained, before and after PURO. Each specimen was tested at 115°, 135°, and 155° elbow flexion, with the antebrachium in neutral rotation, in 28° supination, and in 16° pronation. Repeated measures ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni (P ≤ .05) were performed. Results PURO caused significant changes, mostly at 135° elbow flexion and neutral antebrachial rotation, characterized by decreased CP (10%) and PCP (10%) in the medial compartment, and increased CP (27%) and PCP (23%) in the lateral compartment. The apex of the medial coronoid process translated 3.4 mm caudally, 1.7 mm abaxially, and rotated 1.8° externally relative to the radial head. Humeroradial varus angulation reduced by 6.7°. Conclusions In limited poses, PURO displaces the medial coronoid process caudally and abaxially and shifts contact pressures towards the lateral elbow compartment by decreasing varus angulation.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effects of antebrachial rotation at 3 elbow flexion angles on contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of normal dog elbows. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals Unpaired thoracic limbs from 18 dogs (mean ± SD weight, 27 ± 4 kg). Methods With the limb under 200 N axial load, digital pressure sensors measured contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (MCP), peak contact pressure (PCP), and PCP location in the medial and lateral elbow compartments, and 3D static poses of the elbow were obtained. Each specimen was tested at 115°, 135°, and 155° elbow flexion, with the antebrachium in a neutral position, in 28° supination, and in 16° pronation. Repeated measure ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni (P ≤ .0167) were performed. Results Both pronation and supination decreased CA by 16% and 8% and increased PCP by 5% and 10% in the medial and lateral compartments, respectively. PCP location moved 2.3 mm (1.8?3.2 mm) closer to the apex of the medial coronoid process in pronation and 2.0 mm (1.8?2.2 mm) farther away in supination. The radial head and medial coronoid process rotated 5.4° and 1.9° internally during pronation and 7.2° and 1.2° externally during supination. Conclusions Contact mechanics and 3D alignment of normal dog elbows varied significantly at different elbow poses.

AB  - Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a metastatic cancer invading the central nervous system (CNS). We previously reported a metabolomic diagnostic approach as tested on an animal model and compared with current modalities. Here, we provide a proof of concept by applying it to human LC originating from lung cancer, the most common cause of CNS metastasis. Cerebrospinal fluid from LC (n?=?26) and normal groups (n?=?41) were obtained, and the diagnosis was established with clinical signs, cytology, MRI and biochemical tests. The cytology on the CSF, the current gold standard, exhibited 69% sensitivity (?100% specificity) from the first round of CSF tapping. In comparison, the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra on the CSF showed a clear difference in the metabolic profile between the LC and normal groups. Multivariate analysis and cross-validation yielded the diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, the specificity of 96% and the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991. Further spectral and statistical analysis identified myo-inositol (p?<?5 ? 10?14), creatine (p?<?7 ? 10?8), lactate (p?<?9 ? 10?4), alanine (p?<?7.9 ? 10?3) and citrate (p?<?3 ? 10?4) as the most contributory metabolites, whose combination exhibited an receiver?operating characteristic diagnostic AUC of 0.996. In addition, the metabolic profile could be correlated with the grading of radiological leptomeningeal enhancement (R2?=?0.3881 and p?=?6.66 ? 10?4), suggesting its potential utility in grading LC. Overall, we propose that the metabolomic approach might augment current diagnostic modalities for LC, the accurate diagnosis of which remains a challenge.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Abstract Shame following childhood sexual abuse (CSA) can be intensely painful and destructive to one's sense of self and place in the world. Organised around an internalised core belief of worthlessness, extreme shame presents as a major therapeutic challenge in therapy with many CSA survivors. A range of clinical and empirical literature, alongside recounts of survivors lived experience, shows that shame is an effect of CSA for many survivors. Yet research has rarely focused specifically on survivors? qualitative or lived experiences of shame. This article reports the results of a scoping review of the empirical research investigating adult survivors? experiences of shame following sexual abuse in their childhood. Conducted in March 2018, the search strategy involved on-line searches of English language, peer review and select grey literature repositories for articles published up to the end of 2017. Of the 28 peer reviewed studies included in the review, only three studies specifically investigate adult survivors lived experiences of shame. The synthesised findings from the studies identify five themes demonstrating the pervasive and detrimental influence of shame following CSA: (1) Psychological effects and trauma symptoms; (2) Relationships and social connections and disconnections; (3) Disclosure; (4) Self concept; and, (5) The process of recovery. These findings resonate with conceptual literature and broader research on the influence of shame following violence and highlight areas for future research and clinical practice. This scoping review identifies three key gaps: a need for further research across specific populations and groups; research evaluating therapeutic interventions responding to shame; and research that specifically investigates adult survivors? lived experiences of shame following CSA.

AB  - Regenerative medicine holds the promise of engineering functional tissues or organs to heal or replace abnormal and necrotic tissues/organs, offering hope for filling the gap between organ shortage and transplantation needs. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is evolving into an unparalleled biomanufacturing technology due to its high-integration potential for patient-specific designs, precise and rapid manufacturing capabilities with high resolution, and unprecedented versatility. It enables precise control over multiple compositions, spatial distributions, and architectural accuracy/complexity, therefore achieving effective recapitulation of microstructure, architecture, mechanical properties, and biological functions of target tissues and organs. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in 3D bioprinting technology, as well as design concepts of bioinks suitable for the bioprinting process. We focus on the applications of this technology for engineering living organs, focusing more specifically on vasculature, neural networks, the heart and liver. We conclude with current challenges and the technical perspective for further development of 3D organ bioprinting.

AB  - Abstract Age-based differences in fall type and neuroanatomy in infants and toddlers may affect clinical presentations and injury patterns. Objective Our goal is to understand the influence of fall type and age on injuries to help guide clinical evaluation. Design/Setting/Participants Retrospectively, 285 children 0?48 months with accidental head injury from a fall and brain imaging between 2000 and 2006 were categorized by age (infan ≤ 1 year and toddler = 1?4 years) and fall type: low (≤3 ft), intermediate (>3 and <10 ft), high height falls (≥10 ft) and stair falls. Outcome Measures Clinical manifestations were noted and head injuries separated into primary (bleeding) and secondary (hypoxia, edema). The influence of age and fall type on head injuries sustained was evaluated. Results Injury patterns in children <4 years varied with age. Despite similar injury severity scores, infants sustained more skull fractures than toddlers (71% vs. 39%). Of children with skull fractures, 11% had no evidence of scalp/facial soft tissue swelling. Of the patients with primary intracranial injury, 30% had no skull fracture and 8% had neither skull fracture nor cranial soft tissue injury. Low height falls resulted in primary intracranial injury without soft tissue or skull injury in infants (6%) and toddlers (16%). Conclusions Within a given fall type, age-related differences in injuries exist between infants and toddlers. When interpreting a fall history, clinicians must consider the fall type and influence of age on resulting injury. For young children, intracranial injury is not always accompanied by external manifestations of their injury.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To perform a retrospective audit of cases of uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) at The Canberra Hospital and review of recent literature reporting pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of UAVM aiming to devise a diagnostic and treatment protocol to optimise pregnancy post UAVM. Methods: A retrospective audit of cases of UAVM at the Canberra Hospital from a prospectively managed patient database was performed. A search of the electronic database PubMed, for articles between 2000?2011 relating to pregnancy post UAVM. Individual case studies were analysed separately to case series. Results: The study included 28 individual studies and five case series (61 women). Average age was 29.5 ± 6.7 (range 18?42). Most women (24, 85.7%, 100% in case series) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding; 11 (41%) individuals presented post interruption of pregnancy. All women had had a previous pregnancy (mean gravidity 3.1 ± 3.1, range 1?15 for case studies) and only four women (14.2 %) had no history of uterine trauma. Only one woman (3.6 %) did not have any ultrasound and most women underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography (20, 71.4% in case studies; 61, 83.6% in case series). Of the women, 72 (53.6 % of case studies, 78.1 % of case series) were treated with uterine artery embolisation, seven (25%) were treated expectantly. A total of 63 pregnancies occurred post treatment, seven (13.9%) ending in miscarriage. Average time to conceive post diagnosis was 19 months ± 16.3 (range 2?72). A total of 54 healthy infants were born to mothers post AVM diagnosis. Conclusion: UAVM are likely to exist on a continuum with other pregnancy related pathologies, such as sub involution of the placental bed, making a single best diagnostic and treatment plan difficult. However, this study shows that successful uncomplicated pregnancy is achievable for women after the diagnosis of UAVM.

AB  - Objectives To describe the long-term outcomes and prognostic factors associated with curative-intent surgery for oral tumours in a large series of dogs. Methods Retrospective review of records for dogs with oral tumours treated with curative-intent surgery. Data collected included signalment, weight, surgical procedure, lymph node staging results, computed tomography results, tumour size, histopathology results including margin evaluation, complications, adjunctive therapies, local recurrence or metastasis, date and cause of death and owner satisfaction. Results Median cause-specific survival was shortest for malignant melanoma (206 days) and osteosarcoma (209 days). Local recurrence rate was highest for fibrosarcoma (54·2%) and distant metastatic rate was highest for malignant melanoma (30%). Curative-intent surgery resulted in complete surgical margins in 85·2% of cases. Clinical Significance Results suggest tumour type, completeness of excision, tumour size, and age may affect disease-free interval and cause-specific survival. Fibrosarcoma had a higher risk of recurrence compared to other tumour types.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes various abdominal vein thromboses, their clinical implications, and strategies of treatment. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, BCS), portal (PVT), splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). The optimal management of SVT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes hepatologists, experts on thrombosis, radiologists and surgeons. In the paediatric population, renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most prevalent non catheter-related thrombosis during the neonatal period. For patients with RVT, a medical therapy, instead of a surgical approach (thrombectomy or nephrectomy), is recommended. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition most commonly diagnosed in the post-partum period. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are generally recommended for 3-6 months in the presence of transient risk factors, whereas a prolonged duration is suggested for idiophatic OVT, cancer-related OVT, and in patients with severe thrombophilia abnormalities.

AB  - The large volume of adult living donor liver transplantations (ALDLTs) at our center affords a unique opportunity to examine the impact of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) among high?Model for End-Stage Liver Disease MELD score patients. From February 1998 to March 2010, 1958 cirrhotic recipients were analyzed to study the relationship between MELD scores and ALDLT outcomes. A total of 327 high-MELD score recipients were categorized into ACLF and non-ACLF groups, and their outcomes were compared. The 5-year graft and patient survival in the high-MELD group were 75.2% and 76.4%, respectively, which were significantly worse than the low and intermediate MELD groups. The presence of ACLF associated with higher MELD scores appeared to be the dominant factor responsible for the inferior results of patients with MELD score of 30?34 points. The 5-year graft survivals in the ACLF group was 70.5% and in the non-ACLF group it was 81.0% (p = 0.035). Therefore, ALDLT should be performed as soon as possible in high-MELD score patients prior to ACLF development. Moreover, ACLF patients should be separately categorized when analyzing the outcomes of ALDLT. ALDLT for ACLF patients should not be discouraged because favorable outcomes can be expected through timely ALDLT and comprehensive management.

AB  - Abstract Burn injuries and associated complications present a major public health challenge. Many burn patients develop clinically intractable complications, including pain and other sensory disorders. Recent evidence has shown that dendritic spine neuropathology in spinal cord sensory and motor neurons accompanies central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) trauma and disease. However, no research has investigated similar dendritic spine neuropathologies following a cutaneous thermal burn injury. In this retrospective investigation, we analyzed dendritic spine morphology and localization in alpha-motor neurons innervating a burn-injured area of the body (hind paw). To identify a molecular regulator of these dendritic spine changes, we further profiled motor neuron dendritic spines in adult mice treated with romidepsin, a clinically approved Pak1-inhibitor, or vehicle control at two postburn time points: Day 6 immediately after treatment, or Day 10 following drug withdrawal. In control treated mice, we observed an overall increase in dendritic spine density, including structurally mature spines with mushroom-shaped morphology. Pak1-inhibitor treatment reduced injury-induced changes to similar levels observed in animals without burn injury. The effectiveness of the Pak1-inhibitor was durable, since normalized dendritic spine profiles remained as long as 4 days despite drug withdrawal. This study is the first report of evidence demonstrating that a second-degree burn injury significantly affects motor neuron structure within the spinal cord. Furthermore, our results support the opportunity to study dendritic spine dysgenesis as a novel avenue to clarify the complexities of neurological disease following traumatic injury.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.
