AB  - Abstract Background Game-based training has been shown to improve behavioral motor learning in various medical fields including rehabilitation. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the effects of a tablet PC (personal computer) game-based tongue training on tongue strength, thickness, and compliance in healthy adults. Methods This study recruited 30 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=15/group). Group 1 performed game-based tongue training, and group 2 performed tongue resistance training using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument. Both groups performed the same tongue exercises as follows: frequency (isotonic = 30 times ? 3, isometric = 20 seconds ? 3), intensity (70% of 1-repeated maximum contraction), and intervention period (5 days for 6 weeks). The primary outcomes were tongue muscle strength and thickness. Secondary outcomes were assessed using a 0-to-10 numerical rating self-report scale that included motivation, interest/fun, physical effort, and muscle fatigue/pain. Results Both groups showed significant improvement in tongue strength and thickness, but there were no significant differences between the groups after the intervention. The self-report scale numerical rating revealed that group 1 had significantly higher motivation and interest/fun after the exercise than group 2. Group 1 had expended a significantly lower physical effort than group 2. No significant differences were noted between the 2 groups for muscle fatigue/pain. Conclusion This study showed that both exercises had similar effects on tongue strength and thickness increase in healthy adults, but game-based tongue training was more fun and physically less demanding.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Reconstruction of abdominal wall defects with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF) remains challenging. The purpose of this report is to describe a single-stage approach using combined microscopic enterolysis, pedicle seromuscular bowel flaps, mesh, fasciocutaneous, and myocutaneous flaps. Methods Between 1990 and 2016 a retrospective review identified a total of 18 patients with an average age of 39?years (ranging 26?59?years). Thirteen cases were associated with trauma, four were complication of previous mesh repair, and one was after an aortic dissection. Average diameter of defect size was 22?cm (ranging 20?24?cm). Surgical technique involved enterolysis using microscope magnification, a pedicle seromuscular bowel flap to reinforce the bowel anastomosis, mesh, musculocutaneous, and fasciocutaneous flaps to reconstruct the abdominal wall. Results Fifteen patients required rotational flaps with an average skin paddle area of 442.7 cm2 (ranging 440?cm2?260?cm2) and 10 patients required a serosal patch with an average length of 5 cm (ranging 4?6 cm). Complications included three wound dehiscence and one abdominal wall bulging. Flap survival was 100%. The majority of patients (12 out of 18) were able to resume normal activities, and the remaining (n = 6) were able to resume most activities. Functional outcome as assessed by 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) physical function component questionnaire at 18?24?months follow up was 67.8% (ranging from 59 to 72%). Mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 weeks (ranging 1.4?2.7 weeks). Mean follow-up was 24?months (ranging 22?26?months) with clinical examination. Conclusion Microscopically assisted intra-abdominal dissection with resection of diseased bowel, replacement with well-vascularized tissue at the anastomosis site in, and reinforcement with mesh combined with pedicle musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps may be an alternative when other local reconstructive options have failed.

AB  - Summary The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to restore periodontal tissues lost through disease or trauma. The most predictable way to accomplish this goal is by guided tissue regeneration (GTR). The principle of GTR is to give preference to certain cells to repopulate the wound area to form a new attachment apparatus. Clinically this is accomplished by placing a barrier over the defect thereby excluding gingival tissues from the wound during early healing. The first generation of GTR barriers were non-resorbable which implies that they have to be removed in a second surgical procedure. Resorbable barriers have recently been introduced, changing GTR into a single-step procedure. Periodontal defects that will predictably benefit from GTR therapy are intrabony, furcation class II and gingival recession defects. This paper reviews the scientific evidence of what can be achieved by GTR procedures for various periodontal defects as well as factors of importance to increase the predictability of a successful treatment outcome. Résumé L'objectif ultime de la thérapie parodontale est de restaurer les tissus parodontaux perdus par la maladie ou des lésions. Le moyen le plus logique de réaliser cet objectif est par régénération tissulaire guidée (RTG). Le principe en est de donner la préférence à certaines cellules pour repeupler la région lésée, afin de former un nouvel appareil de soutien de la dent. Sur le plan clinique, ceci est fait en plaçcant une barrière sur le défaut, ce qui permet d'exclure les tissus gingivaux de la lésion pendant les premières phases de cicatrisation. La première génération de barrières de RTG était non-résorbables, ce qui signifiait qu'il fallait en faire l'ablation lors d'une seconde opération chirurgicale. Des barrières résorbables ont été introduites récemment, transformant la RTG en une procédure à phase unique. Les défauts parodontaux dont on peut dire qu'ils bénéficieront probablement de la thérapie par régénération tissulaire guidée sont les défauts intra-osseux, les bifurcations de classe II et les récessions gingivales. Cet article examine d'abord les preuves scientifiques de ce qui peut être fait par des procédures de régénération tissulaire guidée pour diverses pertes de tissus parodontaux et étudie ensuite les facteurs essentiels permettant d'accrôitre la possibilité de prévision d'un traitement réussi. Zusammenfassung Die Parodontaltherapie soll dazu dienen, infolge Parodontitis oder Trauma zerstörtes parodontales Gewebe wiederherzustellen. Die hinsichtlich dieses Ziels zuverlässigste Methode ist die gesteuerte Geweberegeneration (GTR). Mit der GTR-Therapie, bei der eine bestimmte, hierfür am besten geeignete Zellart in dem Wundareal angesiedelt wird, soll parodontales Attachment regeneriert werden. Die klinische Durchführung erfolgt durch Plazierung einer Barriere über den Defekt, was eine Deckung der Wunde mit Gingivalgewebe während der frühen Heilungsphase verhindert. Die ersten GTR-Membranen waren nichtresorbierbar, was bedeutete, daß sie nur temporär implantiert wurden und eine zweite parondontalchirurgische Maßnahme zu ihrer Entfernung erforderlich war. Die neueren, biologisch abbaubaren Barrieren erfordern nur noch einen einzigen Eingriff. In folgenden Fällen ist das GTR-Verfahren indiziert: Furkationsbeteiligung II. Grades, intraossäre Defekte und Gingivarezession. Im Zentrum des vorliegenden Artikels steht die Überprüfung der wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse im Zusammenhang mit der Anwendung des GTR-Prinzips in Fällen unterschiedlicher Parodontaldefekte. Ebenfalls diskutiert werden die für den Behandlungserfolg bzw. die Langzeitstabilität ausschlaggebenden Faktoren. Resumen El objetivo primordial de la terapia periodontal es el de restaurar los tejidos periodontales que se han perdido por enfermedad o trauma. El método más seguro para alcanzar este objetivo es la regeneración tisular guiada (RTG). El principio de la RTG es el de dar preferencia a ciertas células para repoblar la zona de la herida y formar un nuevo aparato de unión. Clínicamente esto se logra colocándose una barrera sobre el defecto, excluyendo así a los tejidos gingivales de la herida durante la cicatrización inicial. La primera generación de barreras eran no reabsorbibles, lo que significa que deben ser removidas por medio de un segundo procedimiento quirürgico. Se han introducido recientemente barreras reabsorbibles y ahora la RTG se lleva a cabo en un solo procedimiento. Este trabajo examina la evidencia científica de lo que puede lograrse mediante la RTG en el caso de distintos defectos periodontales, como también los factores de importancia para asegurar el éxito del tratamiento.

AB  - Adult-onset neuroblastoma is rare and little is known about its biology and clinical course. There is no established therapy for adult-onset neuroblastoma. Anti-GD2 immunotherapy is now standard therapy in children with high-risk neuroblastoma; however, its use has not been reported in adults. Forty-four adults (18?71 years old) diagnosed with neuroblastoma between 1979 and 2015 were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Five, 1, 5 and 33 patients had INSS stage 1, 2, 3 and 4 diseases, respectively. Genetic abnormalities included somatic ATRX (58%) and ALK mutations (42%) but not MYCN-amplification. In the 11 patients with locoregional disease, 10-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 35.4?±?16.1% and 61.4?±?15.3%, respectively. Among 33 adults with stage 4 neuroblastoma, 7 (21%) achieved complete response (CR) after induction chemotherapy and/or surgery. Seven patients with primary refractory neuroblastoma (all with osteomedullary but no soft tissue disease) received anti-GD2 antibodies, mouse or humanized 3F8. Antibody-related adverse events were similar to those in children, response rate being 71.4%. In patients with stage 4 disease at diagnosis, 5-year PFS was 9.7± 5.3% and most patients who were alive with disease at 5 years died of neuroblastoma over the next 5 years, 10-year OS being only 19.0?±?8.2%. Patients who achieved CR after induction had superior PFS and OS (p?=?0.006, p?=?0.031, respectively). Adult-onset neuroblastoma appeared to have different biology from pediatric or adolescent NB, and poorer outcome. Complete disease control appeared to improve long-term survival. Anti-GD2 immunotherapy was well tolerated and might be beneficial.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Despite the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving the experience of obsessions and compulsions, some people do not benefit from this approach. The present research uses a case series design to establish whether mindfulness-based therapy could benefit those experiencing obsessive?intrusive thoughts by targeting thought?action fusion and thought suppression. Three participants received a relaxation control intervention followed by a six-session mindfulness-based intervention which emphasized daily practice. Following therapy all participants demonstrated reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive?Compulsive Scale scores to below clinical levels, with two participants maintaining this at follow-up. Qualitative analysis of post-therapy feedback suggested that mindfulness skills such as observation, awareness and acceptance were seen as helpful in managing thought?action fusion and suppression. Despite being limited by small participant numbers, these results suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial to some people experiencing intrusive unwanted thoughts and that further research could establish the possible efficacy of this approach in larger samples.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: ? Preliminary evidence is provided for the use of mindfulness-based therapy with obsessive intrusive thoughts. ? Mindfulness processes may be useful in the management of thought-action fusion and thought suppression.

AB  - Abstract Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a rare haemorrhagic, non-neoplastic lesion, most commonly seen involving the long bone and spine. It is characterised by its expansile nature, high vascularity and multi-cystic appearance. It is a rare lesion in the maxillofacial region with its occurrence more in the mandible than in the maxilla. So far only four cases of ABC in the zygoma have ever been reported in the English literature. Here we report a rare case of ABC of zygomatic bone with a short review.

AB  - The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a toll on military chaplains (MCs) who often return from deployment with high levels of stress, yet are expected to counsel on a daily basis without decompression of their own, potentially exacerbating any personal trauma. MC with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have had deployments abridged due to their positive PTSD screen have reported shame due to leaving service members in their unit in danger while they went to safety. Many MCs report compassion fatigue, PTSD, reintegration issues, and adverse effects to their personal energy, motivation, and mental and spiritual well-being postdeployment, related to stressors from deployment and combat exposure. Only 23?40 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) service members with a psychiatric disorder seek mental health care, citing stigma as a primary barrier. For MCs, stigma is compounded by a culture in which military health care providers, including MCs, are encouraged to deny their own needs to provide the necessary support to beneficiaries. This paper reviews a pilot study, which explored the impact of operational stress on the psychosocial health and reintegration of MCs, focusing on findings related to mental health and stigma within the military chaplaincy.

Findings show that one SD increment in local homicides is associated with increments by 0.17 SD in the mental health disorder index and a 0.14 SD increase in the PTSD score index, even after accounting for adolescents? direct exposure to violence. The estimated effect for PTSD was larger for adolescents? who were directly exposed to violence and for those living in multidimensionally poor households, whereas no detectable effects were found for adolescents who perceived their residential neighborhood as relatively safe.

AB  - Individual and environmental correlates of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and co-occurring suicide attempts (SA) among incarcerated women (N = 104) were examined. Participants completed measures of putative risk and protective factors, including coping styles, childhood maltreatment, and hopelessness. Results indicated that active coping was uniquely, negatively associated with the presence and frequency of NSSI, whereas avoidant coping and childhood physical/emotional abuse were positively associated with NSSI frequency. Conversely, among women with a history of NSSI, hopelessness was uniquely, positively associated with the presence and frequency of SA. Further, childhood sexual abuse was associated with the presence of SA, while physical/emotional abuse was associated with SA frequency. Hopelessness was more strongly related to SA frequency than NSSI frequency. These findings help disentangle the unique risk and protective factors for NSSI and co-occurring SA in incarcerated samples.

AB  - This paper is a reflection and discussion on the integration and personal development that may occur when we use ourselves in heuristic research, particularly in the process of writing. It focuses on my writing about a study I undertook with two of my ex-clients who are brothers, and their journey towards healing, and on their experience of our counselling relationship as part of that journey. As their counsellor, and the main researcher, my story inevitably intermingles and overlaps with theirs. My ?selves? as woman, survivor, client, counsellor, researcher (and numerous other selves) and their selves as survivor, man, client and researcher (and many others) are impacted by the collaborative, experiential nature of the work. Issues faced in the writing of a book about the research (Etherington, 2000), such as self-disclosure and reclaiming my voice, parallel many of my own issues as a client and my clients' issues.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Globally adolescents and young adults account for more than 40% of new HIV infections, and HIV-related deaths amongst adolescents increased by 50% from 2005 to 2012. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical to control viral replication and preserve health; however, there is a paucity of research on adherence amongst the growing population of adolescents living with HIV/AIDS (ALHIV) in Southern Africa. We examined levels of self-reported ART adherence, barriers to adherence, and factors associated with non-adherence amongst ALHIV in Malawi. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 519 ALHIV (12?18 years) attending two large HIV clinics in central and south-eastern Malawi. Participants self-reported missed doses (past week/month), barriers to adherence, and completed questionnaires on past traumatic events/stressors, disclosure, depression, substance use, treatment self-efficacy, and social support. Biomedical data were retrieved from existing medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with self-reported ART adherence (7 day recall). Results: The mean age of participants (SD) was 14.5 (2) years and 290 (56%) were female. Of the 519 participants, 153 (30%) reported having missed ART doses within the past week, and 234 (45%) in the past month. Commonly reported barriers to adherence included forgetting (39%), travel from home (14%), busy with other things (11%), feeling depressed/overwhelmed (6%), feeling stigmatized by people outside (5%) and within the home (3%). Factors found to be independently associated with missing a dose in the past week were drinking alcohol in the past month (OR 4.96, 95% CI [1.41?17.4]), missed clinic appointment in the past 6 months (OR 2.23, 95% CI [1.43?3.49]), witnessed or experienced violence in the home (OR 1.86, 95% CI [1.08?3.21]), and poor treatment self-efficacy (OR 1.55 95% CI [1.02?2.34]). Sex and age were not associated with adherence. Conclusions: In our study, nearly half of all ALHIV reported non-adherence to ART in the past month. Violence in the home or alcohol use in the past year as well as poor treatment self-efficacy were associated with worse adherence. Sub-optimal adherence is a major issue for ALHIV and compromise treatment outcomes. Programmes specifically tailored to address those challenges most pertinent to ALHIV may help improve adherence to ART.
