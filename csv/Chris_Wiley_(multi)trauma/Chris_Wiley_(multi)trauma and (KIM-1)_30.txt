AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series)?Level of Evidence?4 What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Several studies have shown the feasibility of performing both complex and reconstructive laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgical procedures in urology. To date, no studies have evaluated the rates of conversion to conventional laparoscopy and complications at the time of LESS procedures in urology. This study, a compilation of results from members of the NOTES working group, is the first study to address the rates of complications and conversions to conventional laparoscopy at the time of LESS surgery in urology. OBJECTIVE ??To present complications and rates of conversion from LESS to conventional laparoscopy (CL) at the time of upper tract LESS urologic procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS ??Patients undergoing LESS upper tract procedures between September, 2007 and November, 2008 (n = 125) were identified at six high-volume academic centers pioneering urologic LESS procedures. All LESS procedures were performed transperitoneally via a single umbilical incision using either adjacent conventional trocars or a dedicated single-site access device. Reconstructive procedures incorporating a single planned 2 mm accessory needle port were included as LESS procedures and were not considered conversions. ??Patients, undergoing LESS procedures requiring conversion to CL with the placement of additional ports were identified. Conversion was defined as the placement of additional 5 or 10/12 mm ports beyond the primary incision. In each case the operative reports were reviewed, the reason for conversion was determined, and the number and types of additional ports and complications were noted. RESULTS ??Upper tract LESS procedures were performed in 125 patients comprising 13.3% of the total 937 laparoscopic procedures performed at the participating institutions during this time period. Conversion to CL was necessary in 7 patients (5.6%) undergoing LESS requiring the addition of 2?5 ports. ??Reasons for conversion included: facilitate dissection in 3 (43%), facilitate reconstruction in 3 (43%), and control of bleeding in 1 (14%). All attempted LESS cases were completed laparoscopically without need for open conversion. ??Complications occurred in 15.2% of patients undergoing LESS surgery. Three of the 7 patients that required conversion to CL developed postoperative complications (Clavien grade II in two and IIIa in one). ??Limitations of this study included the inability to standardize LESS patient selection criteria, instrumentation and surgical technique as well as the lack of available complete data from a CL control group for comparison. CONCLUSION ??LESS surgery is technically feasible for a variety of upper urinary tract reconstructive and ablative procedures, although it appears to be associated with higher rates of complications than in mature CL series. Conversion to CL occurs infrequently and may be a reflection of stringent patient selection.

AB  - Abstract Background Despite evidence that CNS treatment is associated with cognitive and academic impairment, interventions to prevent or mitigate these problems are limited. The purpose was to determine if early intervention can prevent declines in mathematics abilities. Procedures Fifty-seven children with ALL were enrolled and randomized to a Mathematics Intervention or Standard Care. Subjects completed neurocognitive assessments prior to the intervention, post-intervention, and 1 year later. Parents received written results and recommendations for use with their school. The Mathematics Intervention was based on Multiple Representation Theory and delivered individually over 1 year. Results Thirty-two of 57 subjects completed the study and were included in data analyses. These 32 subjects completed all neurocognitive assessments and, for those in the Intervention Group, 40?50?hours of the Mathematics Intervention. There were no group differences on relevant demographic variables; risk stratification; number of intrathecal methotrexate injections; or high dose systemic methotrexate. Significant improvements in calculation and applied mathematics from Baseline to Post-Intervention (P?=?0.003 and 0.002, respectively) and in visual working memory from Baseline to 1 year Follow-up (P?=?0.02) were observed in the Intervention but not the Standard Care Group. Results from repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant between group differences for applied mathematics [F(2,29)?=?12.47, P?<?0.001] and visual working memory [F(2,29)?=?5.53, P?=?0.009]. Conclusions The Mathematics Intervention improved mathematics abilities and visual working memory compared to standard care. Future studies are needed to translate the Mathematics Intervention into a ?virtual? delivery method more readily available to parents and children.

AB  - Abstract Background Clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolic events (uVTE) detected during routine imaging pose a management challenge due to limited knowledge about their clinical significance. Unsuspected VTE are often referred as ?asymptomatic?, ?incidental? or ?clinically silent/occult? VTE. Objective Understand the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of uVTE in children. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The search criteria included controlled vocabulary and keywords for VTE, incidental findings, and children (ages ≤21 years). Results Among 10,875 articles, 51 studies (7597 children with 758 uVTE) were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, I2 96%; p <.0001. Unsuspected VTE were diagnosed in two settings: first, asymptomatic VTE (aVTE) diagnosed through surveillance imaging for VTE [45 studies; n=5869; aVTE: 715, pooled frequency:19%, 95% CI:13- 24%]; second, incidental VTE (iVTE) diagnosed during imaging performed for indications without primary suspicion for VTE [6 studies; n=2460; iVTE: 43]. Majority (94%) of aVTE were associated with central venous lines (CVL). Non-CVL settings included post-spinal surgery, post-splenectomy, trauma, nephrotic syndrome and newborns. In general, aVTE were reported to have a benign clinical course, were mostly transient, and resolved without intervention and with few immediate or long-term functional complications. Incidental VTE were primarily detected in children with cancer and ranged from tumor-associated thrombi to pulmonary embolism (PE) with insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions about their management. Conclusion Clinically uVTE were predominantly diagnosed with CVL and their outcomes were generally favorable implying limited benefit of routine surveillance and thromboprophylaxis. Prospective research is needed to clarify the optimal management of iVTE.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values according to the different b values. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was acquired. We evaluated 74 patients (M:F = 43:31, mean age of 44 years) who underwent 3.0 Tesla knee MR with DWI because of the possibility of ACL tear due to trauma. Region of interest measurements were performed. We (two radiologists) measured the signals of the DWI and derived ADC values on the oblique sagittal DWI with b values of 0, 600, and 1000. The diagnostic accuracies of the conventional MR image and each DWI with an ADC value with a different b value were evaluated. The CNR and ADC values were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The diagnostic performances of the various imaging methods were evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for differentiating between normal and ACL injury as determined by the use of conventional MRI with additional DWIs with McNemar test. The arthroscopic or clinical findings were used as the reference standard. Results The mean CNRs of ligament tears with b values of 600 and 1000 were significantly higher than those of normal ligament (22 versus 7 and 9 versus 4, P value < 0.05). The sensitivities and the accuracies of the DWI were significantly lower than the conventional MRIs (P value < 0.001). Conclusions: The CNRs of the torn ACL with each b value (600 and 1000) were significantly higher those of than normal ligament, although the ADC values of the torn ligament were not different from normal ligament. Addition of the DWI to the conventional MRI did not improve diagnostic performance. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1116?1122.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rotator cuff degeneration is one of the factors contributing to rotator cuff tears. Oxidative stress is involved in tendon degeneration, and superoxide-induced oxidative stress plays a pathological role in regulating the balance between oxidation and reduction. The role of oxidative stress in rotator cuff tears, however, is unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the contribution of superoxide-induced oxidative stress to rotator cuff tears. Seventy patients were recruited and divided into two groups: patients with (Ruptured group) and those without (Unruptured group) a rotator cuff tear. Specimens from both groups were collected during surgery. Degeneration morphology was classified according to the degeneration score. Superoxide-induced oxidative stress was assessed according to dihydroethidium (DHE) relative fluorescence intensity, capacity for antioxidation according to superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and the balance between oxidation and reduction based on the redox ratio. Data were compared between groups. Correlations between the degeneration score and the oxidative stress factors were calculated. Degeneration score and DHE relative fluorescence intensity were significantly higher in the Ruptured than the Unruptured group. The SOD activity was not significantly different between groups. Degeneration score was positively correlated with both DHE relative fluorescence intensity and SOD activity. Thus, superoxide-induced oxidative stress and tendon degeneration were greater in rotator cuff tear tissues than in those with no tear, suggesting that oxidative imbalance may be involved in degenerative rotator cuff tears. Clinical Relevance: Understanding the mechanisms of superoxide-induced oxidative stress may lead to targeted tissue therapy for degenerative rotator cuff tears. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Stereotaxic instruments are increasingly used in research animals for the study of disease, but typically require restraints and anesthetic procedures. A stereotaxic head mount that enables imaging of the anterior chamber of the eye in alert and freely mobile mice is presented in this study. The head mount is fitted based on computed tomography scans and manufactured using 3D printing. The system is placed noninvasively using temporal mount bars and a snout mount, without breaking the skin or risking suffocation, while an instrument channel stabilizes the ocular probes. With a flexible micro-endoscopic probe and a confocal scanning laser microscopy system, <20??m resolution is achieved in vivo with a field of view of nearly 1?mm. Discomfort is minimal, and further adaptations for minimally invasive neuroscience, optogenetics and auditory studies are possible.

AB  - Abstract Pulpal healing patterns were studied in a clinical material of 637 luxated and 95 root-fractured permanent incisors followed routinely for up to 11 years. It was found that pulpal healing patterns could generally be divided into 3 groups according to the degree of injury sustained by the pulp: little, moderate or severe. Thus after luxation injuries, pulp survival could be without radiographic change (PS), with pulp canal obliteration (PCO) or nonhealing (pulp necrosis (PN)). After root fracture, similar healing patterns could be observed: healing by hard tissue union of fragments (HT), by connective tissue union of fragments (CT) or by nonunion due to interposition of granulation tissue between fragments (GT) resulting from PN of the coronal fragment. In both trauma situations, healing or nonhealing could be determined by type of luxation injury, stage of root development and type of fixation used (forceful application of orthodontic bands vs. passively applied acid-etch fixation). Pulpal healing complications (PN or GT) were based on clinical findings (coronal discoloration, loss of pulpal sensibility) and radiographic findings (resorption processes of the lamina dura at the root apex or at the level of the root fracture). However, in both injury groups the same changes could also be seen to be intermediate steps in the pulpal healing process. Based on findings from these studies, hypotheses for the mechanics of pulpal healing are proposed as well as guidelines for acute and later treatment of dental luxations, root fractures and the diagnosis of healing complications.

AB  - Abstract During liver transplantation, the patient is at risk of developing progressive lactic acidosis. Following reperfusion, correction of acidosis may occur. In some patients, acidosis will worsen, a phenomenon referred to as persistent acidosis after reperfusion (PAAR). We compared postoperative outcomes in patients who manifested PAAR vs those that did not. All adult patients undergoing liver transplantation from 2002 to 2015 were included. PAAR is defined by the presence of a significant negative slope coefficient for base excess values measured after hepatic artery anastomosis through 72 hours postoperatively. Primary outcome was a composite of 30-day and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included: ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and re-transplantation rate within 7 days. PAAR occurred in 10% of the transplant recipients. Patients with PAAR had higher MELD, BMI, and eGFR and demonstrated a longer median ICU LOS and hospital median LOS with a trend toward mortality difference. But, after propensity matching, the mortality rate difference became significantly higher in patients with PAAR compared with matched controls while the ICU LOS differences disappeared. The re-transplantation rates were similar also between the PAAR and no PAAR groups. The cohort with PAAR had a significant 30-day and in-hospital increase in mortality after propensity score matching.

AB  - Abstract Chromium is an essential nutrient required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in humans and many animal species. We evaluated whether feeding laying hens with high levels of different chemical forms of trivalent chromium may affect hepatic metabolizing cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-linked enzymes. Modulation of CYP-dependent monooxygenases (which play a pivotal role in the endogenous metabolism) by Cr(III) was tested using either specific substrates as probes of different CYPs or testosterone as a multi-bioprobe. The CYP-supported oxidases were studied in liver microsomes from laying hens fed with diet supplemented with either 25 or 50 ppm chromium chloride as a yeast or as aminoniacinate. Although at 25 ppm no appreciable effects were observed, at 50 ppm a general inactivation of the recorded monooxygenases (ranging from 34% loss for ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase with chromium chloride to 85% loss for O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin with either chromium yeast or aminoniacinate) were achieved in the supplemented groups vs controls. The only exception was the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin, which was significantly boosted by both chromium yeast (up to 65% increase) and chromium aminoniacinate (up to 141%). Measurements of the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of testosterone used as a multi-bioprobe corroborated the inactivating properties of Cr(III) at the higher dose. Taken as a whole, these findings seem to indicate that high levels of Cr(III) supplementation can substantially impair CYP-catalysed drug metabolism in laying hens.

AB  - Abstract Objectives We employed the correspondence analysis (CA) biplot to estimate correlations between gender?age levels of cardiovascular disease patients and their psychiatric and physical symptoms. Utilization of this correlation estimation can inform clinical practice by elucidating associations between certain psychiatric or physical symptoms and specific gender?age levels. Method The CA biplot utilized here was designed to visually inspect row?column category associations in a 2-dimensional plane and then to numerically estimate the category associations with correlations. To do so, we (a) estimated dimensions from row and column categories with CA; (b) verified statistical significance of dimensions with a permutation test; (c) projected row and column categories in a plan constructed with the first 2 dimensions that were statistically significant; (d) visually inspected category associations in the plane; and (e) numerically estimated category associations with correlations. Results Consistent with the previous results, female cardiovascular disease patients were more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms than the male patients. However, when examining the results by gender and age, both female and male patients in their 50s and 60s tended to experience elevated rates of the psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions The CA biplot can be useful for isolating key clinical concerns among any medical populations.

AB  - Key content Cardiac arrest in pregnancy is rare. Effective management involves the decision to perform a perimortem caesarean section if the gestation is greater than 20 weeks and return of spontaneous circulation does not occur after 4 minutes of effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Delivery should ideally be achieved within 5 minutes of cardiac arrest as this maximises maternal survival and reduces the risk of long-term neurological impairment. In hospital, the procedure should be undertaken at the site of the cardiac arrest without moving to an operating theatre. Minimal equipment is required to undertake the procedure. Clinical areas where pregnant women are seen should have a designated ?equipment box?. Debriefing all personnel is of utmost importance after the acute event. Learning objectives To understand why perimortem caesarean section is beneficial to maternal survival. To appreciate the need for rapid decision making when perimortem caesarean section is required. To gain practical knowledge of perimortem caesarean section, including the steps to be used when resuscitation is unsuccessful. Ethical issues To be aware that the primary aim of perimortem caesarean section is to aid maternal survival, not necessarily fetal survival.

AB  - Objectives To report the signalment, clinical presentation, treatments pursued and outcomes of dogs with malignant anal sac melanoma. Methods Medical records from five institutions from January 2000 through December 2015 were reviewed and dogs with cytologically- or histologically-confirmed malignant anal sac melanoma were identified. Signalment, clinical signs, staging, cytology, histopathologic analysis, surgical and non-surgical treatments were extracted from the medical records. The referring veterinarians and owners were contacted for follow-up data. Results Eleven dogs were included and survival data was available for all. The most common clinical signs were bloody anal sac discharge and perianal licking. Initial treatments pursued included surgery (n=8), chemotherapy (n=1), and palliative treatment with pain medications and stool softeners (n=2). In an adjuvant setting, melanoma vaccine was pursued following surgery in three dogs and chemotherapy in one dog. Regardless of treatment, progression-free survival (mean 92 · 5?days) and overall survival times (median 107?days) were short. Clinical Significance Dogs in this case series had a guarded to poor prognosis regardless of treatment. Ten of 11 dogs were euthanased due to local or distant disease progression. Only 1 of 11 dogs was alive one year after diagnosis. An understanding of tumour behaviour in this location could lead to improved survival times with earlier diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the acid-base, fluid, and electrolytes. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a failure of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI manifests as polyuria with dilute urine in setting of hypertonic plasma. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase after fluid restriction is diagnostic confirmation. Treatment is aimed at replacing free water deficits and vasopressin, an ADH analogue. Acidosis is from the loss of bicarbonate and not the addition of an acid, a normal anion gap is expected. A widened anion gap would be expected from an etiology that caused the addition of an acid. The loss of bicarbonate causes a gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Because of this, normal gap metabolic acidosis has also been referenced as ?hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis?. The treatment in this setting would be to replace fluids and electrolytes.
