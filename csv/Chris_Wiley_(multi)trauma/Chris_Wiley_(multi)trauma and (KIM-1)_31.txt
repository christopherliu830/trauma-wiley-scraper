AB  - ABSTRACT Cartilage T2 relaxation time in isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) without concomitant meniscal pathology and their changes over time remain unclear. The purpose of this exploratory study was to: (i) compare cartilage T2 relaxation time (T2 values) in people with isolated ACLR at 2?3 years post-surgery (baseline) and matched healthy controls and; (ii) evaluate the subsequent 2-year change in T2 values in people with ACLR. Twenty-eight participants with isolated ACLR and nine healthy volunteers underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline; 16 ACLR participants were re-imaged 2 years later. Cartilage T2 values in full thickness, superficial layers, and deep layers were quantified in the tibia, femur, trochlear, and patella. Between-group comparisons at baseline were performed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Changes over time in the ACLR group were evaluated using paired sample t-tests. ACLR participants showed significantly higher (p?=?0.03) T2 values in the deep layer of medial femoral condyle at baseline compared to controls (mean difference 4.4?ms [13%], 95%CI 0.4, 8.3?ms). Over 2 years, ACLR participants showed a significant reduction (p?=?0.04) in T2 value in the deep layer of lateral tibia (mean change 1.4?ms [?7%], 95%CI 0.04, 2.8?ms). The decrease in T2 values suggests improvement in cartilage composition in the lateral tibia (deep layer) of ACLR participants. Further research with larger ACLR cohorts divided according to meniscal status and matched healthy cohorts are needed to further understand cartilage changes post-ACLR. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The Mental Health First Aid First Nations course was adapted from Mental Health First Aid Basic to create a community-based, culturally safe and relevant approach to promoting mental health literacy in First Nations contexts. Over 2.5 days, the course aims to build community capacity by teaching individuals to recognize and respond to mental health crises. This feasibility trial utilized mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability, cultural adaptation, and preliminary effectiveness of MHFAFN. Our approach was grounded in community-based participatory research principles, emphasizing relationship-driven procedures to collecting data and choice for how participants shared their voices. Data included participant interviews (n = 89), and surveys (n = 91) from 10 groups in four provinces. Surveys contained open-ended questions, retrospective pre-post ratings, and a scenario. We utilized data from nine facilitator interviews and 24 facilitator implementation surveys. The different lines of evidence converged to highlight strong acceptability, mixed reactions to the cultural adaptation, and gains in participants? knowledge, mental health first aid skill application, awareness, and self-efficacy, and reductions in stigma beliefs. Beyond promoting individual gains, the course served as a community-wide prevention approach by situating mental health in a colonial context and highlighting local resources and cultural strengths for promoting mental well-being.

AB  - Ultrasound is a promising neural stimulation modality, but an incomplete understanding of its range and mechanism of effect limits its therapeutic application. We investigated the modulation of spontaneous hippocampal spike activity by ultrasound at a lower acoustic intensity and longer time scale than has been previously attempted, hypothesizing that spiking would change conditionally upon the availability of glutamate receptors. Using a 60-channel multielectrode array (MEA), we measured spontaneous spiking across organotypic rat hippocampal slice cultures (N?=?28) for 3?min each before, during, and after stimulation with low-intensity unfocused pulsed or sham ultrasound (spatial-peak pulse average intensity 780??W/cm2) preperfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, 300??M kynurenic acid (KA), or 0.5??M tetrodotoxin (TTX) at 3?ml/min. Spike rates were normalized and compared across stimulation type and period, subregion, threshold level, and/or perfusion condition using repeated-measures ANOVA and generalized linear mixed models. Normalized 3-min spike counts for large but not midsized, small, or total spikes increased after but not during ultrasound relative to sham stimulation. This result was recapitulated in subregions CA1 and dentate gyrus and replicated in a separate experiment for all spike size groups in slices pretreated with aCSF but not KA or TTX. Increases in normalized 18-sec total, midsized, and large spike counts peaked predominantly 1.5?min following ultrasound stimulation. Our low-intensity ultrasound setup exerted delayed glutamate receptor-dependent, amplitude- and possibly region-specific influences on spontaneous spike rates across the hippocampus, expanding the range of known parameters at which ultrasound may be used for neural activity modulation. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Parents and children exposed to war and relocation have high rates of negative relational and mental health outcomes. This study tested the feasibility of implementing an adapted evidence-based parenting intervention for contexts of trauma and relocation stress. Eleven Karen refugee caregivers from Burma participated in the intervention. Participants and a focal child completed ethnographic interviews as well as structured assessments at baseline and follow-up. Caregivers reported changes in their teaching, directions, emotional regulation, discipline, and child compliance. Children reported changes in these areas and in positive parent involvement. Caregivers reported higher mental health distress immediately after the intervention, potentially due to increased awareness. Researchers made personalized referrals for counseling services as needed. Children reported a decrease in mental health symptoms.

AB  - There are many reports of patients with a severe hydroa vacciniforme (HV)-like eruption. The cutaneous lesions occur both in sun-exposed and nonexposed areas in these patients unlike a true HV. In most cases, a latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been detected in the skin lesions of these patients. We performed the photo-provocation test in five patients with an EBV associated HV-like eruption. The photoprovocation tests were caried out using the UVA delivered by a SUPUVASUN 3000 light source. A 5x 5 sqaure cm area on the buttock was irradiated three or four times at 24 hour intervals. A skin biopsy was obtained from the lesional skin and photo-provoked lesion in all five patients. H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed. In situ hybridization was also performed to detect mRNA for EBV in the skin biopsy specimens. Skin lesions were induced by repetitive UVA exposure in all five patients. The severity of the phtoprovoked lesion showed correlation with that of the clinical features. The immunohistologic findings of photo-provoked skin lesions were similar to those of original skin lesions. A latent EBV infection was also demonstrated in the photo-provoked lesion.

AB  - Background Despite gains made in the study of childhood anxiety, differential diagnosis remains challenging because of indistinct boundaries between disorders and high comorbidity. This is certainly true for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive?compulsive disorder (OCD) as they share multiple cognitive processes (e.g., rumination, intolerance of uncertainty, and increased attention to threat). Disentangling such cognitive characteristics and, subsequently, underlying mechanisms could serve to inform assessment and treatment practices, and improve prognoses. Methods The current study sought to compare the cognitive performance (working memory, visuospatial memory, planning ability/efficiency, and cognitive flexibility), indexed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Battery (CANTAB) among three nonoverlapping groups of youth: (1) those diagnosed with OCD (n = 28), (2) those diagnosed with GAD, not OCD (n = 34), and (3) typically-developing controls (TDC) (n = 65). Results Results showed that OCD and GAD youth demonstrated neurocognitive deficits in planning ability/efficiency, cognitive flexibility, and visual processing when compared to TDC, with potential diagnostic specificity such that youth with GAD or OCD had unique deficits compared to TDC and to one another. Specifically, youth with OCD demonstrated significantly impaired planning ability compared to youth in the GAD and TDS groups, whereas youth with GAD demonstrated greater cognitive inflexibility and delayed visual processing compared to youth in the OCD and TDC groups. Conclusions Future studies should expand upon these findings with more comprehensive assessment of cognitive functioning by including self- and parent-report forms, and neuroimaging to link behavioral findings with subjective ratings and neurocircuitry. Altogether, data can then inform future assessment and treatment targets.

AB  - Abstract Aim Quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes are at risk of being impaired after rectal surgery, but there has been no large prospective study to thoroughly assess QoL according to surgical approach. We have investigated the impact of laparoscopic and robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) on QoL and functional outcomes. Method Patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic TME for rectal cancer between 2009 and 2013 were prospectively included in this questionnaire-based survey of QoL together with variations in urinary and sexual function. A propensity score analysis was retrospectively conducted to compare outcomes between groups in a cohort matched 1:1 for age, sex, body mass index, preoperative chemoradiation status and tumour height. The survey was performed preoperatively and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results Global health status/QoL was similar between the two groups for 130 matched pairs, but the robotic group showed better role, emotional and social functioning and experienced less fatigue and financial difficulty. International Prostatic Symptom Scores in men increased postoperatively, with significantly less impairment in the robotic group at 6 months. These scores were comparable to preoperative scores at 6 months in the robotic group and at 12 months in the laparoscopic group. Of 48 sexually active men in each group, International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores decreased postoperatively, returning to preoperative levels at 6 months in the robotic group and at 12 months in the laparoscopic groups. Conclusion The robotic approach for TME was associated with less impairment of urinary and sexual function; QoL was comparable to the laparoscopic approach.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is involved in the regulation of many essential processes, especially metabolic homeostasis. SIRT6 knockout mice undergo premature aging and die at age ~4 weeks. Severe glycometabolic disorders have been found in SIRT6 knockout mice, and whether a dietary intervention can rescue SIRT6 knockout mice remains unknown. In our study, we found that at the same calorie intake, a high-fat diet dramatically increased the lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice to 26 weeks (males) and 37 weeks (females), reversed multi-organ atrophy, and reduced body weight, hypoglycemia, and premature aging. Furthermore, the high-fat diet partially but significantly normalized the global gene expression profile in SIRT6 knockout mice. Regarding the mechanism, excessive glucose uptake and glycolysis induced by the SIRT6 deficiency were attenuated in skeletal muscle through inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling by the high-fat diet. Similarly, fatty acids but not ketone bodies inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis, and senescence in SIRT6 knockout fibroblasts, whereas PI3K inhibition antagonized the effects of a high-fatty-acid medium in vitro. Overall, the high-fat diet dramatically reverses numerous consequences of SIRT6 deficiency through modulation of insulin and IGF1 signaling, providing a new basis for elucidation of SIRT6 and fatty-acid functions and supporting novel therapeutic approaches against metabolic disorders and aging-related diseases.

AB  - Abstract Soft tissue defects exposing the patellar tendon or bone are common in patients who have experienced trauma or implant infection. The purpose of this article is to present our experience of six patients who underwent reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the knee using a pedicled medial sural perforator flap. Between November 2013 and November 2015, six patients who presented with a soft tissue defect overlying the knee were admitted to our hospital. After adequate debridement or wide excision of the tumour, these patients underwent pedicled medial sural perforator flap placement to resurface the complex soft tissue defects and to provide a gliding surface for the exposed patellar tendon. The patients' age, comorbidity, aetiology, defect size and location, flap size, perforator numbers and lengths, outcome and follow-up period were reviewed. The six medial sural perforator flaps survived completely, and the wounds healed satisfactorily over a mean follow-up of 21·5?months (range, 6?51 months). Donor sites were closed primarily or covered with a split-thickness skin graft. The medial sural perforator flap is a reliable flap for coverage of defects overlying the knee. The thin and pliable flap, long pedicle length and less donor site mobility benefit patients. Thus, the medial sural perforator flap may be a valuable alternative for defect reconstructions overlying the knee, which produces satisfactory results both functionally and cosmetically.

AB  - Scope: Recent findings indicate that ketogenic diet is neuroprotective and electrical stimulation can improve functional recovery from peripheral nerve injury. However, it is not clear whether ketogenic diet and electrical stimulation play synergistical role in the peripheral nerve recovery following injury. Methods and Results: We used ketogenic diet consisting of 3:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrate+protein and coupled it with electrical stimulation treatment in a rat model of peripheral nerve crush injury. Neuromuscular recovery was evaluated by electromyography, and axonal regeneration and myelination by histological methods. We also investigated the effects on IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor expression in peripheral nerve tissue, pre- and post-nerve injury. Combination of ketogenic diet and electrical stimulation synergistically increased muscle force in biceps femoris and gluteus maximus and prevented development of hypersensitivity in biceps femoris. It promoted peripheral nerve regeneration by increasing total axons, axons density, and axonal diameter, as well as myelin thickness and axon/fiber ratio. These effects were due to modulation of IGF system as the treatment expression of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor in regenerated nerve tissue. Conclusion: Our results establish that ketogenic diet and electrical stimulation promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Patients recovering from peripheral nerve injury may benefit from this combinational approach. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
