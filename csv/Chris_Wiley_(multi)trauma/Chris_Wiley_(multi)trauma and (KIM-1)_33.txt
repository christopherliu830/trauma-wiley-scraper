AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a recessively inherited genodermatosis associated with extreme sun sensitivity, defective repair of several types of sunlight induced adducts in cellular DNA, and numerous, early-onset skin cancers. The dry, rough skin corresponds to progressive cytologic atypia and loss of polarity in the underlying epidermis. Associated with these changes are immune deficiencies against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin cancer. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a DNA synthesis antimetabolite used against several types of cancers. Applied topically in normal subjects it is associated with moderate to severe inflammation in areas where actinic keratoses have arisen followed by ablation of the actinic keratoses which is dependent on the inflammation. We applied 5-FU to the sun-exposed skin of two patients with XP, a 14 year-old light complected black male and a 14 year-old Caucasian female. No inflammation was observed, but marked improvement in the clinical presentation of the skin was seen, as well as an absence of new malignancies. This change was confirmed histopathologically and correlated with normalization of polarity and cytologic changes in the epidermal cells. These histologic findings were quantitated using computerized image analysis. These results may be due to activation of alternative DNA repair pathways in these nucleotide excision repair deficient cells.

AB  - Summary The journey from emerging technology to therapeutic paradigm change follows a rocky road. The development of monoclonal antibodies as a commercially viable industry exemplifies this. Several technological S-curves have been navigated to make mAbs the conventional pharmaceuticals that they have become today: from discovery and engineering to clinical translation and industrial scale manufacturing. The transformational nature of these new molecules has generated a multi-billion dollar global industry. A historic recollection of the defining events that shaped the mAb technology is particularly relevant to regenerative medicine in general and therapeutic stem cells in particular. A point of inflexion in the value of mAb transactions occurred with the commercial success of the first mAb blockbuster (rituximab), triggering multi-billion USD licensing transactions and very large M (3) enhancement of biological attributes, (4) combination with conventional drugs, (5) delivery devices and formulation, and (6) solid organ transplantation. Each co-evolutionary advance contributes to the clinical, economic and access to care value proposition that makes or breaks a technology, as it transitions from bench to bedside.

AB  - Background and Purpose We recently reported that AAV1-Rheb(S16H) transduction could protect hippocampal neurons through the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the rat hippocampus in vivo. It is still unclear how neuronal BDNF produced by AAV1-Rheb(S16H) transduction induces neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus and whether its up-regulation contributes to the enhance of a neuroprotective system in the adult brain. Experimental Approach To determine the presence of a neuroprotective system in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, BDNF and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and their receptors, tropomyocin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and CNTF receptor α(CNTFRα), in the hippocampus of AD patients. We also determined whether AAV1-Rheb(S16H) transduction stimulates astroglial activation and whether reactive astrocytes contribute to neuroprotection in models of hippocampal neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. Key Results AD patients may have a potential neuroprotective system, demonstrated by increased levels of full-length TrkB and CNTFRα in the hippocampus. Further AAV1-Rheb(S16H) transduction induced sustained increases in the levels of full-length TrkB and CNTFRα in reactive astrocytes and hippocampal neurons. Moreover, neuronal BDNF produced by Rheb(S16H) transduction of hippocampal neurons induced reactive astrocytes, resulting in CNTF production through the activation of astrocytic TrkB and the up-regulation of neuronal BDNF and astrocytic CNTF which had synergistic effects on the survival of hippocampal neurons in vivo. Conclusions and Implications The results demonstrated that Rheb(S16H) transduction of hippocampal neurons could strengthen the neuroprotective system and this intensified system may have a therapeutic value against neurodegeneration in the adult brain.

AB  - Abstract The amygdala is known to be a critical storage site of conditioned fear memory. Among the two major pathways to the lateral amygdala (LA), the cortical pathway is known to display a presynaptic long-term potentiation which is occluded with fear conditioning. Here we show that fear extinction results in a net depression of conditioning-induced potentiation at cortical input synapses onto the LA (C-LA synapses). Fear conditioning induced a significant potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents at C-LA synapses compared with naïve and unpaired controls, whereas extinction apparently reversed this potentiation. Paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation (pp-LFS) induced synaptic depression in the C-LA pathway of fear-conditioned rats, but not in naïve or unpaired controls, indicating that the pp-LFS-induced depression is specific to associative learning-induced changes (pp-LFS-induced depotentiationex?vivo). Importantly, extinction occluded pp-LFS-induced depotentiationex?vivo, suggesting that extinction shares some mechanisms with the depotentiation. pp-LFS-induced depotentiationex?vivo required NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity, consistent with a previous finding that blockade of amygdala NMDARs impaired fear extinction. In addition, pp-LFS-induced depotentiationex?vivo required activity of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), known to be present at presynaptic terminals, but not AMPAR internalization, consistent with a presynaptic mechanism for pp-LFS-induced depotentiationex?vivo. This result is in contrast with another form of ex?vivo depotentiation in the thalamic pathway that requires both group I mGluR activity and AMPAR internalization. We thus suggest that extinction of conditioned fear involves a distinct form of depotentiation at C-LA synapses, which depends upon both NMDARs and group II mGluRs.

AB  - Summary Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) can cause complications, including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The majority of primary UEDVTs are caused by abnormalities of the costo-clavicular junction. Central venous catheter (CVC)/peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the most significant cause of secondary UEDVT, and are present in about half of all cases. Goals of therapy of UEDVT include reduction or elimination of symptoms, prevention of DVT progression, or embolisation and reduction of the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Anticoagulation, using the same approach as used for lower extremity DVT (LEDVT), is the mainstay of therapy for UEDVT. Anticoagulants do not result in fibrinolysis. Therefore, vein recanalisation depends on endogenous fibrinolytic processes. Various interventional therapies have been evaluated as a means of attempting to accelerate the process of recanalisation, with the goal of reducing the risk of PTS and, perhaps, the risk of DVT recurrence.

AB  - Feigning a psychiatric or neurological disorder may be an attractive strategy to obtain all sorts of privileges or disability benefits. In the criminal arena, feigning memory loss for a crime (crime-related amnesia) may be a way for defendants to gain sympathy or to promote a diminished capacity defence. Although crime-related amnesia may, under some circumstances, be genuine, in many cases it is more likely to be malingered. Malingered memory problems are a subtle form of deception and what is true for deceptive behaviour in general is also true for malingering memory loss: on the basis of clinical intuition alone, it is difficult to detect. Fortunately, there are methods and tools to evaluate the authenticity of memory problems. It is important that forensic and clinical psychologists familiarize themselves with these techniques.

AB  - Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been used in various problem-solving areas such as financial forecasting, credit analysis and medical diagnosis. However, conventional CBR has the limitation that it has no criterion for choosing the nearest cases based on the probabilistic similarity of cases. It uses a fixed number of neighbors without considering an optimal number for each target case, so it does not guarantee optimal similar neighbors for various target cases. This leads to the weakness of lowering predictability due to deviation from desired similar neighbors. In this paper we suggest a new case extraction technique called statistical case-based reasoning. The main idea involves a dynamic adaptation of the optimal number of neighbors by considering the distribution of distances between potential similar neighbors for each target case. In order to do this, our technique finds the optimal distance threshold and selects similar neighbors satisfying the distance threshold criterion. We apply this new method to five real-life medical data sets and compare the results with those of the statistical method, logistic regression; we also compare the results with the learning methods C5.0, CART, neural networks and conventional CBR. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique outperforms those of many other methods, it overcomes the limitation of conventional CBR, and it provides improved classification accuracy.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - Diffuse cerebellar meningeal carcinomatosis secondary to haematogenous dissemination from an anaplastic solid mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in an old German shepherd dog suffering from seizures and rapidly progressing to stupor. A single computed tomography cerebellar scan identified an unusual homogeneous density area that was considered to be associated with a vascular disorder, in the absence of space-occupying lesions. At necropsy, nodular masses were observed in the mammary gland, lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were affected by diffuse blood effusion. Histology showed a solid mammary tumour, characterised by anaplastic cells with a cytoplasmic keratin-positive and vimentin-negative immunoreaction. The tumour had spread to the lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and adrenals. Cerebellar leptomeninges were diffusely infiltrated by the cytokeratin-positive neoplastic cells. Even though computed tomography scan gave no evidence of meningeal carcinomatosis, it was considered that a cerebellar vascular disorder might be present. This was subsequently confirmed by neuropathological investigation and seen to be associated with a cerebellar leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

AB  - Aims and objectives To evaluate current research evidence reporting outcomes from modified early warning scoring system tools utilisation to prevent failure to rescue in hospitalised adult medical-surgical/telemetry patients. Background Early sepsis detection exhibits clinical significance to practitioners and patients. Thorough and timely clinical observations, along with a willingness of nurses to call for help, are pivotal to survival of hospitalised patients. This project examined effects of modified early warning scoring system tool usage on patient mortality and failure to rescue events in hospitalised adult medical-surgical/telemetry patients as reported in the literature. Design A comprehensive review and evaluation of published peer-reviewed literature was conducted. Methods Electronic databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through 2014. Results Eighteen articles were identified for review. Evidence ratings included 6% (1) Level I, 44% (8) Level IV, 6% (1) Level V, 33% (6) Level VI and 11% (2) Level VII. Six reported mortality predictive value and/or reduction, three measured impact on emergency calls, and four reported impact on mortality and rapid response team utilisation. Conclusion While modified early warning scoring system tools have been widely adopted and are recommended for utility in detection of inpatients at-risk for clinical deterioration, limited high-level data and no clinical trials linking use of modified early warning scoring system tool usage to robust outcomes were found. Established criteria for validating modified early warning scoring system criteria, organisational-specific reliability testing and multi-site trials are recommended. Relevance to clinical practice Development of all-cause illness screening tools, including sepsis, is imperative. The clinical picture may be quantified with scoring tools to assist nurses? clinical decision-making, thus leading to improved outcomes and decreased incidence of failure to rescue. Clinical outcomes of interest should be measured and reported in peer-reviewed literature to disseminate the impact on clinical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background Nocardiosis is a life-threatening opportunistic infection. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at higher risk (incidence 0.04%-3.5%) of developing nocardiosis. Rate of nocardiosis in the Southwestern US may be high due to environmental factors. Methods We performed a retrospective review study on 54 SOT patients diagnosed with Nocardia between 1997 and 2016 at our center. To explore the association of various risk factors with both the development of disseminated disease and mortality, a series of Fisher's exact tests was used. Findings Incidence of nocardiosis in SOT patients was 2.65%. Fisher's exact tests revealed no association between development of disseminated disease and the following variables: transplant rejection (P = 1), elevated tacrolimus levels (P = .4), and CMV viremia (P = .06). Also, we did not find any association between mortality and the variables we evaluated: type of transplant, transplant rejection, renal failure, disseminated nocardia, and patient's age. Overall mortality and 1-year mortality were 17% and 11%. Interpretation Based on our findings, daily 1 DS TMP/SMX prophylaxis did not appear to provide reliable protection against nocardiosis. However, we could not state definitely that TMP/SMX prophylaxis was or wasn't protective because of lack control group. None of the Fisher's exact tests revealed associations between the tested risk factors and either disease dissemination or mortality. This could be due to a true lack of association between the variables in each pair. However, it is also likely that our relatively small sample size limited our power to detect underlying relationships that may be present. Compared with other studies, 1-year mortality was lower at our institution (11% vs 16%).
