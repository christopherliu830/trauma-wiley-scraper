AB  - Child abuse and neglect are global problems that affect over 25 per cent of children and have serious health, social and economic consequences. Government and other agencies are heavily committed to the provision of services to address the consequences of abuse and neglect. In a climate of scarce resources, there is increasing interest in developing cost-effective strategies to prevent child maltreatment. Economic evaluation in the context of formal ?priority setting? can contribute to the development of an efficient child protection strategy and at the same time develop the arguments to support an increased investment in the prevention of child maltreatment. Key challenges arise from incompleteness of the evidence base of effective interventions and the considerable complexity of the cross-portfolio effects. The latter has resulted in the widespread failure to capture the full range of impacts, most notably intergenerational effects, quality of life and mortality. This means the benefits of investing in effective preventive strategies to address child maltreatment will be underestimated and too few resources allocated to this important task. Adoption of the proposed priority-setting framework and translation into action are likely to reduce child maltreatment and associated harms for children at risk now and in the future.

AB  - Abstract Objective To measure scenario participant and faculty self-reported realism, engagement and learning for the low fidelity, in situ simulations and compare this to high fidelity, centre-based simulations. Methods A prospective survey of scenario participants and faculty completing in situ and centre-based paediatric simulations. Results There were 382 responses, 276 from scenario participants and 106 from faculty with 241 responses from in situ and 141 from centre-based simulations. Scenario participant responses showed significantly higher ratings for the centre-based simulations for respiratory rate (P = 0.007), pulse (P = 0.036), breath sounds (P = 0.002), heart sounds (P < 0.001) and patient noises (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference in overall rating of the scenario reality by scenario participants in favour of the centre-based simulations (P = 0.005); however, there was no significant difference when rating participant engagement (P = 0.11) and participant learning (P = 0.77). With the centre-based scenarios, nurses rated the reality of the respiratory rate (P < 0.001), blood pressure (P = 0.016) and abdominal signs (P = 0.003) significantly higher than doctors. Nurses rated the overall reality higher than doctors for the centre simulations (96.8% vs 84.2% rated as realistic, P = 0.041), which was not demonstrated in the in situ scenarios (76.2% vs 73.5%, P = 0.65). Conclusion Some aspects of in situ simulations may be less ?real? than centre-based simulations, but there was no significant difference in self-reported engagement or learning by scenario participants. Low fidelity, in situ simulation provides adequate realism for engagement and learning.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study is to examine relationships of sleep duration with sociodemographic and health-related factors, psychiatric disorders and sleep disturbances in a nationwide sample in Korea. A total of 6510 subjects aged 18?64?years participated in this study. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the covariates, psychiatric disorders and sleep disturbances across the following sleep duration categories: 5?h or less, 6, 7, 8 and 9?h or more per day. Low levels of education, unemployment and physical illness were associated with sleeping for 5?h or less and 9?h or more. Being older and widowed/divorced/separated, high levels of physical activity, pain/discomfort, obesity and high scores on the General Health Questionnaires were associated with sleeping for 5?h or less. Female, being younger and underweight were associated with sleeping for 9?h or more. Alcohol dependence, anxiety disorder and social phobia were associated significantly with sleeping for 5?h or less and 9?h or more. Other psychiatric disorders were more common in subjects who slept for 5?h or less (e.g. alcohol use disorder, mood disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and specific phobia) or 9?h or more (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder). In addition, subjects who slept for 5?h or less reported more sleep disturbances than did subjects who slept for 7?h. Short or long sleep is associated with psychiatric disorders and/or sleep disturbance, therefore attention to the mental health of short or long sleepers is needed.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint condition predominantly affecting the knee, hip, and hand joints. Exercise plays a role in the development and treatment of OA but most of the literature in this area relates to knee OA. While studies indicate that exercise and physical activity have a generally positive effect on healthy cartilage metrics, depending upon the type of the activity and its intensity, the risk of OA development does appear to be moderately increased with sporting participation. In particular, joint injury associated with sports participation may be largely responsible for this increased risk of OA with sport. Various repetitive occupational tasks are also linked to greater likelihood of OA development. There are a number of physical impairments associated with OA including pain, muscle weakness and altered muscle function, reduced proprioception and postural control, joint instability, restricted range of motion, and lower aerobic fitness. These can result directly from the OA pathological process and/or indirectly as a result of factors such as pain, effusion, and reduced activity levels. These impairments and their underlying physiology are often targeted by exercise interventions and evidence generally shows that many of these can be modified by specific exercise. There is currently little clinical trial evidence to show that exercise can alter mechanical load and structural disease progression in those with established OA, although a number of impairments, that are amenable to change with exercise, appears to be associated with increased mechanical load and/or disease progression in longitudinal studies. ? 2011 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have suggested that heroin addiction is associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities. However, it is largely unknown whether these characteristics of brain abnormalities would be persistent or restored after long periods of abstinence. Considering the very high rates of relapse, we hypothesized that there may exist some latent neural vulnerabilities in abstinent heroin users. In this study, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 30 former heroin-dependent (FHD) subjects who were drug free for more than 3 years and 30 non-addicted control (CN) volunteers. Voxel-based morphometry was used to identify possible gray matter volume differences between the FHD and CN groups. Alterations in resting-state functional connectivity in FHD were examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. Significantly reduced gray matter volume was observed in FHD in an area surrounding the parieto-occipital sulcus, which included the precuneus and cuneus. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that the FHD subjects showed reduced positive correlation within the default mode network and visual network and decreased negative correlation between the default mode network, visual network and task positive network. Moreover, the altered functional connectivity was correlated with self-reported impulsivity scores in the FHD subjects. Our findings suggest that disruption of large-scale brain systems is present in former heroin users even after multi-year abstinence, which could serve as system-level neural underpinnings for behavioral dysfunctions associated with addiction.

AB  - Abstract This integrative review aimed to identify and synthesize evidence on workplace stress and resilience in the Australian nursing workforce. A search of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search was limited to papers published in English from January 2008 to December 2018. The review integrated both qualitative and quantitative data into a single synthesis. Of the 41 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 65.85% (27/41) used quantitative data, 29.26% (12/41) used qualitative data, and 4.87% (2/41) used mixed methods. About 48.78% (20/41) of the papers addressed resilience issues, 46.34% (19/41) addressed workplace stress, and 4.87% (2/41) addressed both workplace stress and resilience. The synthesis indicated that nurses experience moderate to high levels of stress. Several individual attributes and organizational resources are employed by nurses to manage workplace adversity. The individual attributes include the use of work?life balance and organizing work as a mindful strategy, as well as self-reliance, passion and interest, positive thinking, and emotional intelligence as self-efficacy mechanisms. The organizational resources used to build resilience are support services (both formal and informal), leadership, and role modelling. The empirical studies on resilience largely address individual attributes and organizational resources used to build resilience, with relatively few studies focusing on workplace interventions. Our review recommends that research attention be devoted to educational interventions to achieve sustainable improvements in the mental health and wellbeing of nurses.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the associations between deliberate self-harm (DSH) and key emotion-related factors thought to underlie this behaviour (i.e. emotional dysregulation, avoidance and inexpressivity) among a non-clinical sample of individuals with clinically-relevant levels of borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms (high BPD) and those without significant BPD pathology (low BPD), and explored the moderating role of BPD status in these associations. Participants were 392 undergraduates who completed questionnaires assessing DSH, BPD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance and emotional inexpressivity. Consistent with theories emphasizing the centrality of emotion dysregulation to DSH, overall emotion dysregulation and the particular dimension related to perceived difficulties modulating emotional arousal were associated with DSH status among both the high-BPD and low-BPD groups. However, other correlates of DSH differed as a function of BPD status, with emotional inexpressivity associated with DSH among the high-BPD group and non-judging of inner experience (negatively) associated with DSH among the low-BPD group. Experiential avoidance was associated with DSH frequency among self-harming individuals in the low-BPD group. The results provide support for the role of emotion-related factors (in particular, emotion dysregulation) in DSH among both high-BPD and low-BPD individuals, and highlight the need to control for BPD pathology when examining the correlates of DSH within non-clinical samples.

AB  - Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers are the main cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for major amputation in diabetic foot patients. Eight hundred and sixty diabetic patients were admitted to the diabetic wound centre of the Korea University Guro Hospital for foot ulcers between January 2010 and December 2013. Among them, 837 patients were successfully monitored until complete healing. Ulcers in 809 patients (96·7%) healed without major amputation and those in 28 patients (3·3%) healed with major amputation. Data of 88 potential risk factors including demographics, ulcer condition, vascularity, bioburden, neurology and serology were collected from patients in the two groups and compared. Among the 88 potential risk factors, statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed in 26 risk factors. In the univariate analysis, which was carried out for these 26 risk factors, statistically significant differences were observed in 22 risk factors. In a stepwise multiple logistic analysis, six of the 22 risk factors remained statistically significant. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios were 11·673 for ulcers penetrating into the bone, 8·683 for dialysis, 6·740 for gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, 6·158 for hind foot ulcers, 0·641 for haemoglobin levels and 1·007 for fasting blood sugar levels. The risk factors for major amputation in diabetic foot patients were bony invasions, dialysis, GI disorders, hind foot locations, low levels of haemoglobin and elevated fasting blood sugar levels.

AB  - Objectives To determine if serum cardiac troponin I concentrations ? measured with both a first-generation assay and a high-sensitivity assay ? were greater in dogs with generalised seizures than in controls and to identify clinical variables associated with cardiac troponin I concentration. Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.
