AB  - Objectives To determine if serum cardiac troponin I concentrations ? measured with both a first-generation assay and a high-sensitivity assay ? were greater in dogs with generalised seizures than in controls and to identify clinical variables associated with cardiac troponin I concentration. Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.

AB  - The MRI community is using quantitative mapping techniques to complement qualitative imaging. For quantitative imaging to reach its full potential, it is necessary to analyze measurements across systems and longitudinally. Clinical use of quantitative imaging can be facilitated through adoption and use of a standard system phantom, a calibration/standard reference object, to assess the performance of an MRI machine. The International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine AdHoc Committee on Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance was established in February 2007 to facilitate the expansion of MRI as a mainstream modality for multi-institutional measurements, including, among other things, multicenter trials. The goal of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee was to provide a framework to ensure that quantitative measures derived from MR data are comparable over time, between subjects, between sites, and between vendors. This paper, written by members of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee, reviews standardization attempts and then details the need, requirements, and implementation plan for a standard system phantom for quantitative MRI. In addition, application-specific phantoms and implementation of quantitative MRI are reviewed. Magn Reson Med 79:48?61, 2018. ? 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present parallel design, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the treatment outcome following flap debridement surgery (FDS) in cigarette smokers compared to non-smokers. Methods: After initial therapy, 57 systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis who presented with one area (at least 3 teeth) where surgery was required were selected. Twenty-eight patients (mean age: 39.6 years, 20 males) were smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day); 29 patients (mean age: 43.9 years, 7 males) were non-smokers. Full-mouth plaque (FMP) and bleeding on probing (BOP) scores, probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and recession depth (RD) were assessed immediately before and 6 months following surgery. Only sites with presurgery PD ≥4 mm were used for statistical analysis. Results: Presurgery FMP and BOP were similar in smokers and non-smokers and significantly decreased postsurgery in both groups. Overall, PD reduction and CAL gain were greater, although not significantly, in non-smokers (2.4 ±0.9 mm and 1.6 ±0.7 mm, respectively) than in smokers (1.9 ±0.7 mm and 1.2 ±0.7 mm, respectively). For moderate sites (PD 4 to 6 mm), no significant differences in PD and CAL changes were found between groups. For deep sites (PD ≥7 mm), PD reduction was 3.0 ±1.0 mm in smokers and 4.0 ±0.8 mm in non-smokers, and CAL gain amounted to 1.8 ±1.1 mm in smokers and 2.8 ±1.0 mm in nonsmokers (P = 0.0477). In smokers, 16% of deep sites healed to postsurgery PD values ≤3 mm as compared to 47% in non-smokers (P = 0.0000); 58% of deep sites in smokers showed a CAL gain ≥2 mm, as compared to 82% in non-smokers (P = 0.0000). Conclusions: Results of the study indicated that: 1) FDS determined a statistically significant PD reduction and CAL gain in patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis; 2) smokers exhibited a trend towards less favorable healing response following FDS compared to non-smokers, both in terms of PD reduction and CAL gain; and 3) this trend reached clinical and statistical significance at sites with initial deep PD.

AB  - While the prevalence of complicated grief has been demonstrated to be elevated in survivors of suicide, the association between complicated grief and suicidal ideation among adult suvivors of suicide has not been explored. The purpose of the present study is to examine the association between complicated grief and suicidal ideation in suicide survivors. The Inventory of Complicated Grief and the Beck Depression Inventory were administered to 60 adult survivors within 1 month of a death by suicide of a family member or significant other. Complicated grief was associated with a 9.68 (CI: 1.036, 90.417) times greater likelihood of suicidal ideation after controlling for depression, suggesting that syndromal complicated grief heightens vulnerability to suicidal ideation. Clinicians may provide more comprehensive assessments by recognizing the possibility of suicidal ideation in those with complicated grief.

AB  - Diffusion MRI is extensively used to study brain microarchitecture and pathologies, and water diffusion appears highly anisotropic in the white matter (WM) of the spinal cord (SC). Despite these facts, the use of diffusion MRI to study the SC, which has increased in recent years, is much less common than that in the brain. In the present review, after a brief outline of early studies of diffusion MRI (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) of the SC, we provide a short survey on DTI and on diffusion MRI methods beyond the tensor that have been used to study SC microstructure and pathologies. After introducing the porous view of WM and describing the q-space approach and q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), we describe other methodologies that can be applied to study the SC. Selected applications of the use of DTI, QSI, and other more advanced diffusion MRI methods to study SC microstructure and pathologies are presented, with some emphasis on the use of less conventional diffusion methodologies. Because of length constraints, we concentrate on structural studies and on a few selected pathologies. Examples of the use of diffusion MRI to study dysmyelination, demyelination as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic SC injury are presented. We conclude with a brief summary and a discussion of challenges and future directions for diffusion MRI of the SC. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer treatment. As important intracellular factors, aberrant tumor transmembrane signal transduction pathways, which include the prosurvival cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT) and the proapoptosis pathways (Wnt, p53 and TNF-α/NF-?B), have been proved to be crucial determinants of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in malignant lesions. There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation sensitization. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting aberrant tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of ionizing radiation. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the aberrant signal pathways, and the potential druggable targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the aberrant signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also addressed.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to determine whether patients with low health literacy have higher emergency department (ED) utilization and higher ED recidivism than patients with adequate health literacy. Methods The study was conducted at an urban academic ED with more than 95,000 annual visits that is part of a 13-hospital health system, using electronic records that are captured in a central data repository. As part of a larger, cross-sectional, convenience sample study, health literacy testing was performed using the short test of functional health literacy in adults (S-TOFHLA) and standard test thresholds identifying those with inadequate, marginal, and adequate health literacy. The authors collected patients' demographic and clinical data, including items known to affect recidivism. This was a structured electronic record review directed at determining 1) the median number of total ED visits in this health system within a 2-year period and 2) the proportion of patients with each level of health literacy who had return visits within 3, 7, and 14 days of index visits. Descriptive data for demographics and ED returns are reported, stratified by health literacy level. The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square was used to test whether there is an association between health literacy and ED recidivism. A negative binomial multivariable model was performed to examine whether health literacy affects ED use, including variables significant at the 0.1 alpha level on bivariate analysis and retaining those significant at an alpha of 0.05 in the final model. Results Among 431 patients evaluated, 13.2% had inadequate, 10% had marginal, and 76.3% had adequate health literacy as identified by S-TOFHLA. Patients with inadequate health literacy had higher ED utilization compared to those with adequate health literacy (p = 0.03). Variables retained in the final model included S-TOFHLA score, number of medications, having a personal doctor, being a property owner, race, insurance, age, and simple comorbidity score. During the study period, 118 unique patients each made at least one return ED visit within a 14-day period. The proportion of patients with inadequate health literacy making at least one return visit was higher than that of patients with adequate health literacy at 14 days, but was not significantly higher within 3 or 7 days. Conclusions In this single-center study, higher utilization of the ED by patients with inadequate health literacy when compared to those with adequate health literacy was observed. Patients with inadequate health literacy made a higher number of return visits at 14 days but not at 3 or 7 days.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to know the prevalence of allergic patch test responses in patients with suspected fragrance allergy in Korea and to know the photoxic potentials of limited fragrance substances. Nine dermatology departments of university hospitals and one research institute of cosmetic company were participated in this study for the past 1 year. To inquire the specific fragrance allergens in Korea, eighteen fragrance ingredients were added to Korean standard series and fragrance series (Chemotechnique Diagnosis, Sweden). Among 422 patients, 83% were women and the most common topographic site was face. Except the fragrance mix and Balsam of Peru, Cinnamic alcohol and Sandalwood oil showed high frequency of positive responses. Among the added specific fragrance ingredients, 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenen-1-yl) pent-4-en-2-ol, alpha-isomethyl-ionone(methyl ionone gamma), Lyral showed high positive responses. With eighteen added specific fragrance substances, we have also performed two in vitro phototoxicity tests, 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test and photohemolysis test. 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test is a screening method for DNA or cellular damage and Photohemolysis test is a useful screening method for phototoxic chemicals that cause oxygen-dependent membrane damage. Only Lyral showed phototoxicity in photohemolysis test and no other fragrance ubstances showed phototoxicity in 3T3 NRU phtototoxicity test. We think our data are useful to know the current status of the frequent fragrance allergens in our society and the possible phototoxic potency of limited fragrance substances.

AB  - Aims Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control. This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. Methods This clinical trial included a single ascending dose (SAD) phase in healthy subjects (BMI, 23 to <30?kg/m2) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in otherwise healthy subjects (BMI, 27 to 40?kg/m2). SAD phase doses, administered subcutaneously (SC), were 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8?mg and the MAD phase evaluated doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.8?mg twice weekly SC for 4?weeks. Results The SAD phase included 39 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?28; placebo, N?=?11); 90% were male and BMI was 26.4?kg/m2. ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses, with the most frequent adverse events being mild headache and procedural-related irritation. There were no severe or serious adverse events. All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared, resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks. The MAD phase included 29 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?22; placebo, N?=?7); 76% were male and BMI was 33.5?kg/m2. Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings. Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change (?1.5?kg total ZGN-1061 vs ?0.2?kg placebo) and other biomarker changes. Conclusions ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested. In addition, the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials.

AB  - The implantation of decellularized tissue has shown effectiveness as a strategy for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries. The preparation of decellularized tissue typically relies on the diffusion driven removal of cellular debris. For bulky tissues like muscle, the process can be lengthy, which introduces opportunities for both tissue contamination and degradation of key ECM molecules. In this study we report on the accelerated preparation of decellularized skeletal muscle (DSM) scaffolds using a infusion system and examine scaffold performance for the repair of VML injuries. The preparation of DSM scaffolds using infusion was dramatically accelerated. As the infusion rate (1% SDS) was increased from 0.1 to 1 and 10ml/hr, the time needed to remove intracellular myoglobin and actin decreased from a maximum of 140?±?3hrs to 45?±?3hrs and 10?±?2hrs respectively. Although infusion appeared to remove cellular debris more aggressively, it did not significantly decrease the collagen or glycosaminoglycan composition of DSM samples when compared to un-infused controls. Infusion prepared DSM samples retained the aligned network structure and mechanical integrity of control samples. Infusion prepared DSM samples supported the attachment and in-vitro proliferation of myoblast cells and was well tolerated by the host when examined in-vivo. ? 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.
