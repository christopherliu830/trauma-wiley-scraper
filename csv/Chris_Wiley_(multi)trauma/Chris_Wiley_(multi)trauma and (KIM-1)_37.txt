AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Aims and objectives To assess changes in perceptions of confidence and preparedness for practice of preregistration nursing students before and after the introduction of a capstone subject, and factors associated with perceptions of preparedness. Background Preregistration nursing student ?readiness? or ?preparedness? for practice has been highlighted in the literature in recent years, along with employer concerns that university graduate nurses are not work ready. Few studies have examined Australian preregistration nursing students' perceptions of preparedness for clinical practice following their final clinical placement or assessed whether preregistration student nurses' perceptions of preparedness change as the result of undertaking a capstone subject. Design A capstone subject was introduced at a regional northern Australian university in 2013. Perceptions of preparedness were assessed in two different cohorts of final year nursing students; one of which undertook a capstone subject. Methods Two separate cohorts of third year nursing students were surveyed regarding their perceptions of preparedness for practice at the conclusion of their final 240 hour clinical placement. The 2012 cohort did not experience a capstone subject, whereas the 2013 cohort were the first nursing students to experience the new capstone subject. Results Both cohorts were uncomfortable performing invasive procedures and reported low levels of confidence in the area of professional identity. An overall trend of decreasing confidence as patient assignment size increased was observed for both cohorts, and higher confidence was associated with previous health care experience. Perceptions of preparedness for practice did not increase significantly following the introduction of a capstone subject. Conclusions Although Australian undergraduate nursing student report feeling prepared for practice there are areas of knowledge, skills and patient care in which confidence is low. The results of this study highlight the importance of experience in building confidence and competence. Relevance to clinical practice This study highlights that while final year nursing students report feeling prepared for practice there are areas where additional support can be provided. It is recommended that nurse educators and health care facilities tailor their programs to provide support focused on the areas highlighted by this study.

AB  - Abstract What is known and objective Medication reconciliation is recommended to be performed at every transition of medical care to prevent medication errors or adverse drug events. This study investigated the impact of pharmacy-led medication reconciliation on medication discrepancies and potential adverse drug events in the ED to assess the benefits of pharmacy services. Methods The systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The PubMed, Ovid Embase and Cochrane library databases were searched up from inception to 1 July 2018. Studies comparing the effectiveness of the medication reconciliation service performed by pharmacy personnel to usual care (nurses or physicians) in the ED were included. Duplicated studies, non-clinical studies, studies with ineligible comparators or study designs were excluded. Results and discussion Eleven studies were eligible for qualitative analysis, and 8 studies were included in meta-analysis. Pharmacy-led medication reconciliation substantially reduced medication discrepancies in the ED. The most common medication discrepancies included medication omission and incorrect/omitted dose or frequency. Unlike usual care, pharmacy-led medication reconciliation significantly reduced the proportion of patients with medication discrepancies by 68% (response rate 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.53, P < .0001) and the number of medication discrepancy events by 88% (response rate 0.12; 95% CI 0.06-0.26, P < .00001). Intervention decreased the number of discrepancies per patient by 3.08 (mean difference ?3.08; 95% CI: ?4.76 to ?1.39, P = .0003). Subgroup analysis revealed no differences between pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in medication reconciliation performance pertaining to medication discrepancies. The patients with several comorbidities or those administered numerous medications received marked benefits related to reduced medication discrepancies from pharmacy-led medication reconciliation. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial revealed decreased risk of potential adverse drug events by pharmacy-led medication reconciliation in patients receiving care in the ED. What is new and conclusion Pharmacy-led medication reconciliation significantly decreased the number of medication discrepancies. However, only one study investigated potential adverse drug events in patients receiving care in the ED. Therefore, further studies investigating the direct clinical impact of decreased medication discrepancies are required.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lymphotoxin-α, have been described widely to play important roles in the brain in physiologic conditions and after traumatic injury. However, the exact mechanisms involved in their function have not been fully elucidated. We give some insight on their role by using animals lacking either Type 1 receptor (TNFR1KO) or Type 2 (TNFR2KO) and their controls (C57Bl/6). Both TNFR1KO and to a greater extent TNFR2KO mice showed increased exploration/activity neurobehavioral traits in the hole board test, such as rearings, head dippings, and ambulations, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the elevated plus maze test, ruling out a major role of these receptors in the control of anxiety. We next evaluated the response to a freeze injury to the somatosensorial cortex. The effect of the cryolesion on motor function was evaluated with the horizontal ladder beam test, and the results showed that both TNFR1KO and TNFR2KO mice made fewer errors, suggesting a detrimental role for TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling for coping with brain damage. Expression of ?22600 genes was analyzed using an Affymetrix chip (MOE430A) at 0 (unlesioned), 1, or 4 days post-lesion in the three strains. The results show a unique and major role of both TNF receptors on the pattern of gene expression elicited by the injury but also in normal conditions, and suggest that blocking of TNFR1/TNFR2 receptors may be beneficial after a traumatic brain injury. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Methadone is a ? opioid agonist drug that is widely used to provide analgesia in cats and dogs. A new methadone preparation (methadone 10 mg/ml racemic mixture) has recently received Marketing Authorisation for administration to dogs in Europe (Comfortan?, 10 mg/ml solution for injection for dogs and cats, Eurovet Animal Health BV). The availability of a full ? agonist opioid with a medium duration of action (3?4 hours) with Veterinary Marketing Authorisation is an exciting development in the field of small animal analgesia. This article discusses the unique features of methadone compared to other opioids commonly used in small animals and makes clinical recommendations about using methadone in practice.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - In major orthopaedic surgery, it is recommended to detect and correct preoperative anaemia several weeks prior to surgery. However, in many cases, the procedure is urgent or the patient is evaluated shortly before the intervention. As iron deficiency is the leading cause of perioperative anaemia, an exhaustive review of the literature was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of short-term perioperative intravenous, with or without erythropoietin, or postoperative oral or intravenous supplementation in major orthopaedic surgery. Overall, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 13 randomized trials (moderate quality) and seven observational studies (low to very low quality). The primary outcomes were reduction in transfusion requirements, haemoglobin increase and medication side-effects during the study period. Data analysis showed that postoperative oral iron administration neither increased haemoglobin nor reduced transfusion requirements, and it was associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects (15%). In contrast, for some patient populations, perioperative or postoperative administration of intravenous iron, with or without recombinant erythropoietin, may reduce transfusion requirements and/or hasten the recovery from postoperative, with few clinically relevant adverse effects (<2%). However, discrepancies between randomized trials and observational studies on the possible beneficial effects of short-term perioperative intravenous iron administration were found for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture repair. Further studies are needed to elucidate when the treatment should be started, which combination of drugs should be used, and which patient groups would be most benefit.

AB  - Objectives To present current literature on the topic of odontogenic sinusitis. Data Source PubMed literature search for odontogenic sinusitis. Results Odontogenic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses that is the result of dental pathology, most often resulting from prior dentoalveolar procedures, infections of maxillary dentition, or maxillary dental trauma. Infections are often polymicrobial with an anaerobe-predominant microbiome requiring special considerations for antimicrobial therapy. Medical management and treatment of the underlying dental pathology remains a critical initial step in the treatment of odontogenic sinusitis, however recent literature suggests that a significant portion of patients may require endoscopic sinus surgery for successful disease resolution. Conclusions This review describes the essential epidemiological and etiological factors, relevant clinical findings and diagnostic modalities, microbiologic and antimicrobial considerations, as well as the medical and surgical treatment approaches commonly utilized for the management of odontogenic sinusitis.

AB  - Abstract The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation for over 20 years. The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13 to June 16, 2009 and co-chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to 280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research. These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To evaluate the efficacy of silk fibroin scaffolds (SFS) and acellular collagen scaffolds (ACS) for the repair of tympanic membrane (TM) in a guinea pig acute perforation model. Study Design Experimental animal research. Methods Seventy-two albino guinea pigs underwent perforation of the right TM and were divided into four experimental groups (n = 18). The perforations were repaired with SFS, ACS, and paper patch using onlay myringoplasty, or they were allowed to heal spontaneously (control). An additional group of 10 guinea pigs without perforation or scaffold was allocated as a normal TM group. Guinea pigs in each experimental group (n = 6) were evaluated at 7, 14, and 28 days following surgery. TM structural healing was evaluated by otomicroscopy and histology, and functional hearing was analyzed by auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Prior to the study, mechanical properties of SFS and ACS were investigated. Results Tensile strength and elasticity of SFS and ACS were within the known range for human TM. Based on otologic and histologic evaluation, TMs treated with SFS or ACS showed complete closure of the perforation at an earlier stage, with a trilaminar structure and more uniform thickness compared to paper patch and control treated groups. ABR assessment demonstrated that SFS or ACS treatment facilitated a faster restoration of hearing function compared to paper patch and control groups. Conclusion The results of this study show that SFS and ACS are effective graft materials and may be utilized as alternatives to current grafts for TM repair. Level of Evidence N/A.
