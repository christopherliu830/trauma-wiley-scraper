AB  - Regenerative medicine has sparked interest in potential strategies for bone repair. Bone defects are widespread and could be caused by trauma, congenital malformations, infections, and surgery. Although bone has a large self-healing capacity, some defects or fractures are too big to regenerate. To regenerate bone structures which can be used for treatment of patients, bone growth must be induced by a number of bioactive implantable materials, cell types and intracellular, and extracellular molecular signaling pathways. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation during remodeling processes have important roles in bone regeneration, it is believed that understanding molecular signaling pathways involved is crucial to the development of bone implants, bone substitute materials, and cell-based scaffolds for bone regeneration. In this review, we briefly introduce concepts in fracture repair and regeneration following bone injuries, and then discuss the current clinical methods in bone regeneration. In the next section, we review the involvement of the various key signaling pathways in bone regeneration.

AB  - The addition of hydrosurgery into our surgical armamentarium will aim to revolutionize surgical wound debridement. Hydrosurgery (Versajet1) utilizes a high pressure fine saline jet delivered via a compact hand-piece to debride, irrigate and remove debri simultaneously. The hydrosurgery system is minimally invasive enabling debridement at the bedside, with minimal haemorrhage and analgesic requirements2. Its applications range from debridement of traumatic and non-traumatic wounds (acute and chronic), wound lavage, debridement of variable thickness burns, wound bed preparation prior to skin grafting, and flap recontouring. Complex infected wounds (necrotising fasciitis) may also be debrided with potential maximal preservation of adjacent neurovasculature and viable tissues. We present five cases involving the use of the Versajet for the debridement of three diabetic foot wounds, one venous ulcer, and one traumatic chest wound. All hydro-debridements were performed at the bedside with an average procedure time of 23 minutes (15?40 minutes), an average analgesic requirement of 10?mg morphine (5?15?mg), and with minimal encountered blood losses (including two patients on Coumarin). Only a single ward debridement procedure was required to achieve a healthy wound bed in all five patients. The Versajet enables debridement and wound bed preparation that is efficient, minimally invasive, and cost effective with reductions in hospital stay.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and test a simultaneous acquisition and analysis pipeline for voxel-based magnetic susceptibility and morphometry (VBMSM) on a single dataset using young volunteers, elderly healthy volunteers, and an Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. 3D T1-weighted and multi-echo phase images for VBM and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) were simultaneously acquired using a magnetization-prepared spoiled turbo multiple gradient echo sequence with inversion pulse for QSM (MP-QSM). The magnitude image was split into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and was spatially normalized. The susceptibility map was reconstructed from the phase images. The segmented image and susceptibility map were compared with those obtained from conventional multiple spoiled gradient echo (mGRE) and MP-spoiled gradient echo (MP-GRE) in healthy volunteers to validate the availability of MP-QSM by numerical measurements. To assess the feasibility of the VBMSM analysis pipeline, voxel-based comparisons of susceptibility and morphometry in MP-QSM were conducted in volunteers with a bimodal age distribution, and in elderly volunteers and the AD group, using spatially normalized GM and WM volume images and a susceptibility map. GM/WM contrasts in MP-QSM, MP-GRE, and mGRE were 0.14 ± 0.011, 0.17 ± 0.015, and 0.045 ± 0.010, respectively. Segmented GM and WM volumes in the MP-QSM closely coincided with those in the MP-GRE. Region of interest analyses indicated that the mean susceptibility values in MP-QSM were completely in agreement with those in mGRE. In an evaluation of the aging effect, a significant increase and decrease in susceptibility and volume were found by VBMSM in deep GM and WM, respectively. Between the elderly volunteers and the AD group, the characteristic susceptibility and volume changes in GM and WM were observed. The proposed MP-QSM sequence makes it possible to acquire acceptable-quality images for simultaneous analysis and determine brain atrophy and susceptibility distribution without image registration by using voxel-based analyses.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the association between workplace abuse exposure and injury risk among hospital workers. We hypothesized that exposed workers would have higher injury rates than unexposed workers. Methods Survey of direct-care workers (n?=?1,497) in two hospitals. Exposure to workplace abuse was assessed through self-report; occupational injury reports were extracted from employee records. We tested associations between non-physical workplace violence and injury using log-binomial regression and multilevel modeling. Results Adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for injury associated with being yelled at was 1.52 (95% CI 1.19, 1.95); for experiencing hostile/offensive gestures 1.43 (1.11, 1.82); and for being sworn at 1.41 (1.09, 1.81). In analyses by injury subtypes, musculoskeletal injuries were more strongly associated with abuse than were acute traumatic injuries. Associations operated on group and individual levels and were most consistently associated with abuse perpetrated by patients. Conclusion Exposure to workplace abuse may be a risk factor for injuries among hospital workers. Am. J. Ind. Med. 57:222?232, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - AbstractThe effectiveness of a community-based advocacy and learning intervention for Hmong refugees was assessed using a comprehensive, multi-method strategy, which included a within-group longitudinal design with four data collection points and in-depth qualitative recruitment and post-intervention interviews. The intervention's impact on five aspects of refugee well-being was examined: Participants' psychological well-being, quality of life, access to resources, English proficiency, and knowledge for the U.S. citizenship exam. Twenty-eight Hmong adults and 27 undergraduate students participated together in the intervention, which had two major components: (1) Learning Circles, which involved cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities for Hmong adults, and (2) an advocacy component that involved undergraduates advocating for and transferring advocacy skills to Hmong families to increase their access to resources in their communities. Undergraduate paraprofessionals and Hmong participants worked together for 6?8 hr per week for 6 months. Growth trajectory analysis revealed promising quantitative findings. Participants' quality of life, satisfaction with resources, English proficiency, and knowledge for the U.S. citizenship test increased and their levels of distress decreased over the course of the intervention. Mediating analyses suggested that participants' increased quality of life could be explained by their improved satisfaction with resources. Qualitative data helped to support and explain the quantitative data, as well as providing insight into other outcomes and processes of the intervention. Policy, practice, and research implications are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims: Patients with coagulation factor disorders require lifelong symptomatic treatment. This is associated with limited efficacy and transmission risks. From a clinical point of view, hepatocyte transplantation offers a rational alternative but is currently being hampered by lack of functional stability of engrafted cells. It was the aim of our study to devise culture conditions providing stable cell polarity, attachment and growth factor stimulation to improve longevity and coagulation factor production. Methods: Human hepatocytes (HC) were plated on different extracellular matrices, inside collagen gel or Matrigel. HC were grown inside growth factor-enriched serum-free medium (SFM) or exposed to media switching from differentiation (DM) to dedifferentiation (DeDM). Results: Over more than 30 days in vitro human HC synthesized coagulation factors (factors VII, VIII, IX, fibrinogen) and coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III, protein C). Protein synthesis was augmented when HC were grown inside a 3D collagen type I matrix, while Matrigel showed no additional benefit. Soluble growth factors improved coagulation factor production when applied in SFM or in sequential DM/DeDM. Coagulation factor levels ranged from 3% to 12% in the first week to 2.5?5% after 4 weeks, reaching biologically relevant levels. Conclusion: Preserved synthesis and secretion of coagulation factors in balanced proportion by human HC in this model may offer new perspectives for HC transplantation in coagulation defects of patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article investigates the year leading up to the relocation of Botezari village from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve, India, and suggests that it does not accord with the conventional scholarly theory of the powerless oustee. The village's pre-relocation phase was characterized by a genuine local openness to displacement; a socially-aware displacement authority; lively NGO and press presence; and a relatively assertive and astute village community. This facilitated constructive dialogue, culminating in meaningful concessions and a perceptible power structure shift, which, I argue, indicates that the received wisdom of inevitable oustee powerlessness may in some instances require qualification, at least in the Indian context. There, the last decade has witnessed some broad changes in regimes of governance and civil society, and a growth of cultures of opposition and struggle from ?below?. Where such wider structural changes come together with other more locally-specific favourable factors, cases such as the one described here may materialize, in which the acute powerlessness of the displaced should not be assumed.

AB  - Protecting adolescents from the risk of teen dating violence (TDV) perpetration is critical to enhancing prevention efforts. This study examined longitudinal trajectories of four protective factors (i.e., empathy, social support, parental monitoring, and school belonging) across adolescence in relation to four TDV types (i.e., verbal, relational, physical, and sexual). Adolescents (n = 1,668) who reported being in a relationship or dating during high school completed self-report measures from middle through high school. Results indicated that all protective factors differentiated between TDV perpetrators and nonperpetrators, although these trajectories varied for boys and for girls and across the different types of TDV. Overall, youth who did not perpetrate TDV in high school generally displayed higher protective factors across the TDV perpetration types.

AB  - Abstract Composite nanofibers of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and gelatin crosslinked with genipin are prepared. The contact angles and mechanical properties of crosslinked PCL-gelatin nanofibers decrease as the gelatin content increases. The proliferation of myoblasts is higher in the crosslinked PCL-gelatin nanofibers than in the PCL nanofibers, and the formation of myotubes is only observed on the crosslinked PCL-gelatin nanofibers. The expression level of myogenin, myosin heavy chain, and troponin T genes is increased as the gelatin content is increased. The results suggest that PCL-gelatin nanofibers crosslinked with genipin can be used as a substrate to modulate proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, presenting potential applications in muscle tissue engineering.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2009) 109, 911?922. Abstract Adrenal chromaffin cells synthesize and secrete catecholamines and neuropeptides that may regulate hormonal and paracrine signaling in stress and also during inflammation. The aim of our work was to study the role of the cytokine interleukin-1? (IL-1?) on catecholamine release and synthesis from primary cell cultures of human adrenal chromaffin cells. The effect of IL-1? on neuropeptide Y (NPY) release and the intracellular pathways involved in catecholamine release evoked by IL-1? and NPY were also investigated. We observed that IL-1? increases the release of NPY, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EP) from human chromaffin cells. Moreover, the immunoneutralization of released NPY inhibits catecholamine release evoked by IL-1?. Moreover, IL-1? regulates catecholamine synthesis as the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase decreases IL-1?-evoked catecholamine release and the cytokine induces tyrosine hydroxylase Ser40 phosphorylation. Moreover, IL-1? induces catecholamine release by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism, and by nitric oxide synthase activation. Furthermore, MAPK, protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and nitric oxide (NO) production are involved in catecholamine release evoked by NPY. Using human chromaffin cells, our data suggest that IL-1?, NPY, and nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to a regulatory loop between the immune and the adrenal systems, and this is relevant in pathological conditions such as infection, trauma, stress, or in hypertension.

AB  - Summary ?? Primary vascular pattern determines pathways of long distance transport for water, nutrients and signalling molecules within plant shoot systems. ?? Expression of an Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene 8::GUS construct is restricted to the procambium and provides a molecular marker for vascular pattern at early developmental stages. ?? Primary vascular pattern and phyllotaxis are highly coordinated, with vascular sympodia corresponding to phyllotactic parastichies. During vegetative development, primary vasculature forms a reticulate pattern, with each leaf trace derived from two vascular sympodia. Shoot phase change is marked by alterations of this fundamental pattern. Formation of leaf trace procambial strands is temporally coordinated with primordium initiation, but ATHB-8::GUS expression is discontinuous in these strands at early stages. ?? The interconnection of vascular sympodia provides alternate pathways for long distance transport in shoots of A. thaliana and reflects the limited secondary growth in this species. ATHB-8::GUS expression identifies a prepattern that precedes anatomical definition of procambium. The longitudinal discontinuity in ATHB-8::GUS expression indicates that one function of this gene is to define the xylem components of vascular radial pattern.

AB  - Summary Theory about organizational capability building remains underdeveloped in strategic management. Although attention to the origins of organizational capability is visible in prior works on internal corporate venturing (e.g., Burgelman, 1983; Garud and Van de Ven, 1992) or corporate entrepreneurship (e.g, Birkinshaw, 1997), and authors have recently begun to pay explicit attention to the evolution of firm capabilities (e.g., Chang, 1995; Kim, 1998), most studies conceptualize capability building processes at a relatively high level of abstraction, often based on secondary data (see Raff, 2000 and Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000 for notable exceptions). Thus the focus has been on issues such as product sequencing (Helfat and Raubitschek, 2000), entry into related markets (Klepper and Simons, 2000), and other macro-phenomena. Very little, however, is known about the managerial processes involved in capability building. A number of significant questions have not occupied the center stage of theory and empirical analysis: How do organizational members perceive and conceptualize a specific organizational capability? How do organizations go about building the capability? How is the organizational capability institutionalized as the organization-wide phenomenon its name implies?

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To assess the effect of morphine on the bispectral index (BIS) in dogs during isoflurane anesthesia maintained at a constant end-tidal concentration. Study design? Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals? Eight adult Beagle dogs, weighing between 7.1 and 9.8?kg. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane via a face mask. Dog?s tracheas were intubated and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane at a constant end-tidal concentration (e?Iso) of 1.81% for a 30-minute equilibration period. Pulmonary ventilation was controlled to normocapnia. After equilibration, baseline values were recorded prior to intravenous administration of morphine sulfate (0.5?mg?kg?1) (MT) or an equal volume of saline (CT). Measurements for heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP) were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120?minutes after treatment. Bispectral index was recorded every 10?seconds for 3?minutes for each time measurement. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 120?minutes for determination of morphine serum concentrations. Anesthesia was discontinued after the last measurement and dogs were allowed to recover. Results? Baseline BIS for MT and CT at 1.81%e?Iso were 63?±?10 and 58?±?9, respectively. Bispectral index in MT was 4?8% lower at 20, 75, 90 and 105?minutes compared with CT. There were no differences in BIS between baseline and any subsequent measurement within either MT or CT. Heart rate, SAP, MAP, and DAP decreased after morphine administration. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Intravenous administration of 0.5?mg?kg?1 morphine sulfate did not cause clinically significant changes in the BIS of unstimulated dogs during isoflurane anesthesia at an e?Iso of 1.81%.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim In addition to immunological complications, non-immunological events should be considered following kidney transplantation. Among them, diarrhoea is the most common gastrointestinal complication, but its effect on transplant outcomes remains unclear. Methods This retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent kidney transplantation between May 1993 and December 2017. Patients with diarrhoea as the chief complaint at admission were defined as the diarrhoea group. Transplant outcomes were compared between the diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea groups. Results Among a total of 1704 kidney recipients, severe diarrhoea that required hospitalization was identified in 84 (4.9%) patients. Patients with diarrhoea showed higher risks of graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.77 (2.98?7.64)) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 7.17 (4.09?12.58)) than did patients without diarrhoea. The risk of de novo donor-specific antibody was also elevated in the diarrhoea group, although there was no change in the risk of biopsy-proven rejection. In subgroup analysis, the aetiology of diarrhoea, as well as a change in immunosuppressant following diarrhoea, showed no significant differences in graft survival. However, incomplete recovery from concurrent acute kidney injury was significantly associated with graft loss. Conclusion Diarrhoea is related to poor graft and patients? outcomes in kidney recipients. An effort to recover from concurrent acute kidney injury is important for improved graft survival.

AB  - Objective To assess the suitability of the intramedullary interlocking nail to stabilise humeral diaphyseal fractures in dogs and cats. Method This multi-centre study retrospectively examined medical records, between June 1994 and May 2001, of 19 dogs and one cat, in which a total of 21 humeral fractures were stabilised with intramedullary interlocking nails. Results Animals ranged in body-weight from 4 to 97 kg. Eighteen (86%) of the fractures were comminuted. Adjunctive stabilisation was used in twelve (57%) fractures and bone grafts in nine (43%) fractures. A rapid return of function was noted in the majority of animals, with 14 (67%) having good or excellent function within four days of surgery. In two fractures the repair collapsed when a single proximal transcortical screw was placed cranial to the tricipital line of the humerus. This suggests that if a single transcortical screw is placed proximally the screw should be distal or caudal to the tricipital line in order to engage sufficient cortical bone. Eighteen (86%) of the fractures healed when stabilised with intramedullary interlocking nails. Three fractures did not heal. One was in a dog where a pathological fracture was temporarily stabilised with an intramedullary interlocking nail, one in a dog that died of an abdominal crisis three weeks after surgery and one in a dog in which fracture stabilisation collapsed due to incorrect implant selection. Conclusion Intramedullary interlocking nails are well suited to the stabilisation of humeral diaphyseal fractures in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Algorithms that are capable of capturing subject-specific abnormalities (SSA) in neuroimaging data have long been an area of focus for diverse neuropsychiatric conditions such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Several algorithms have been proposed that define SSA in patients (i.e., comparison group) relative to image intensity levels derived from healthy controls (HC) (i.e., reference group) based on extreme values. However, the assumptions underlying these approaches have not always been fully validated, and may be dependent on the statistical distributions of the transformed data. The current study evaluated variations of two commonly used techniques (?pothole? method and standardization with an independent reference group) for identifying SSA using simulated data (derived from normal, t and chi-square distributions) and fractional anisotropy maps derived from 50 HC. Results indicated substantial group-wise bias in the estimation of extreme data points using the pothole method, with the degree of bias being inversely related to sample size. Statistical theory was utilized to develop a distribution-corrected z-score (DisCo-Z) threshold, with additional simulations demonstrating elimination of the bias and a more consistent estimation of extremes based on expected distributional properties. Data from previously published studies examining SSA in mild traumatic brain injury were then re-analyzed using the DisCo-Z method, with results confirming the evidence of group-wise bias. We conclude that the benefits of identifying SSA in neuropsychiatric research are substantial, but that proposed SSA approaches require careful implementation under the different distributional properties that characterize neuroimaging data.
