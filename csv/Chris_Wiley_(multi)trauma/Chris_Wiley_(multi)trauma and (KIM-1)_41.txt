AB  - Abstract Migratory contacts may have a positive or a negative influence on local processes of reconciliation and reconstruction. However, their impact on individual attitudinal and behavioural attributes remains a largely underexposed topic. Migrants from post-conflict Rwanda maintain substantive contacts with their relatives through social networks and the resources that they send. Reconstruction and reconciliation programmes in post-conflict Rwanda heavily rely on these migratory contacts. We explore the relationship between migration, reconstruction and reconciliation processes in post-conflict Rwanda. We analyse the importance of migratory contacts as a major constituent of social capital, and discuss whether and how remittances can be used for mobilizing this social capital. Adopting a micro-level perspective, we examine the effects of migratory contacts and remittances on cooperative behaviour and willingness for reconciliation amongst 558 households in Huye District, southern Rwanda. We find that migratory contacts enhance reconstructive behaviour and reconciliatory attitudes, whereas financial remittances result in reduced participation in these processes, indicating that there is a crowding-out effect due to remittance-dependency. Furthermore, we scrutinize the relationship between reconciliation and reconstruction, showing that inter-group contact is a key mediating variable.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal HD (pre-HD). Methods As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N?=?191 pre-HD individuals and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1?5 year follow-up) DWI, with n?=?649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory, and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. Results Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. Conclusions This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied to the onset of motor symptoms in HD.

AB  - Summary The aim of this retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether adding liraglutide to lifestyle changes, metformin (Met) and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), by means of improving weight and glycaemic control, could boost erectile function in type 2 diabetic obese men with overt hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction (ED) in a ?real-life setting?. Forty-three obese, diabetic and hypogonadal men (aged 45?59 years) were evaluated because of complaining about the recent onset of ED. They were subdivided into two groups according to whether hypogonadism occurred after puberty (G1; n = 30: 25 with dysfunctional hypogonadism and 5 with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) or before puberty (G2; n = 13: 10 with Klinefelter's syndrome and 3 with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Both G1 and G2 patients were given a combination of testosterone (T) [testosterone undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg/every 12 weeks] and Met (2000?3000 mg/day) for 1 year. In the poor responders (N) to this therapy in terms of glycaemic target (G1N: n = 16; G2N: n = 10), liraglutide (L) (1.2 ?g/day) was added for a second year, while the good responders (Y) to T + Met (G1Y: 14/30 and G2Y: 3/13) continued this two drugs regimen therapy for another year. All patients were asked to fill in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF 15) questionnaire before starting TU plus Met (T1) and after 12 months (T2) and 24 months (T3) of treatment. Patients underwent a clinical examination and a determination of serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (T) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at T1, T2 and T3. At T2, each patient obtained an improvement of ED (p < 0.01) and of the metabolic parameters without reaching, however, the glycaemic goals [HbA1c = >7.5% (>58 mmol/mol)], while T turned out to be within the range of young men. L added to TU and Met regimen in G1N and G2N allowed these patients to reach not only the glycaemic target [HbA1c = <7.5% (<58 nmol/mol)] and a significant reduction in body weight (p < 0.01), but also a further increase in SHBG (p < 0.05) and T (p < 0.01) plasma levels as well as a significant increment of IIEF score (T3). Conversely, at T3 G1Y and G2Y, who received the combined therapy with TRT and Met for the second year, showed a partial failure of that treatment given that there was no improvement of the IIEF score and they showed a significant rise in serum HbA1c (p < 0.05) and weight (p < 0.04) compared with the assessments at T2. These results suggest that TRT could improve clinical and metabolic parameters in obese, type 2 diabetic men with ED and overt hypogonadism (independently of when T deficit occurred). Furthermore, in case of insufficient metabolic control the addition of L to TRT and Met regimen allows to achieve serum T levels in the range of healthy men, as well as to reach glycaemic target and to lower weight, leading to a considerable improvement of ED.

AB  - Myelin water imaging (MWI) is an MRI imaging biomarker for myelin. This method can generate an in vivo whole-brain myelin water fraction map in approximately 10?minutes. It has been applied in various applications including neurodegenerative disease, neurodevelopmental, and neuroplasticity studies. In this review we start with a brief introduction of myelin biology and discuss the contributions of myelin in conventional MRI contrasts. Then the MRI properties of myelin water and four different MWI methods, which are categorized as T2-, T2*-, T1-, and steady-state-based MWI, are summarized. After that, we cover more practical issues such as availability, interpretation, and validation of these methods. To illustrate the utility of MWI as a clinical research tool, MWI studies for two diseases, multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, are introduced. Additional topics about imaging myelin in gray matter and non-MWI methods for myelin imaging are also included. Although technical and physiological limitations exist, MWI is a potent surrogate biomarker of myelin that carries valuable and useful information of myelin.Evidence Level: 5Technical Efficacy: 1 Evidence Level: 5 Technical Efficacy: 1 J.

AB  - Summary Background Facial wrinkles are key signs of aging which affect one's quality of life and psychological well-being. Absorbable wedge-shaped polydioxanone (PDO) sutures are popular in the esthetic clinics of Korea and may be a treatment option for static wrinkles on the upper face. Objective To describe a novel technique applicable to deep static wrinkles on the upper face and to assess its safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on the static wrinkle cases which were treated with folded, wedge-shaped PDO threads. A total of 33 Korean patients with glabellar and forehead wrinkles were included. All participants underwent a single treatment session. The results were assessed objectively using serial photography and subjectively based on the patients' satisfaction scores. Complications were also recorded. Results Our patients displayed moderate (15.2%), severe (39.4%), and very severe (45.4%) static wrinkles at baseline. The majority of patients (81.8%) considered the results satisfactory. Consensus ratings by two independent dermatologists showed that the objective outcomes at 2-month follow-up were very much improved (30.3%), much improved (30.3%), and improved (24.2%). The incidence of complications was low, and the complications were minor. Conclusion Wedge-shaped PDO sutures in a folded configuration (?solid fillers?) are a promising treatment option for deep static wrinkles on the upper face. They may be applied as an adjunct, or as an alternative to conventional therapies such as botulinum toxin and soft tissue filler injection.

AB  - Background Workplace discrimination is associated with poor mental health. However, there is a lack of studies examining the effects of discrimination on depressive symptoms among firefighters. Methods We analyzed a national cross-sectional survey of 6369 firefighters in South Korea. Workplace discrimination during the past year was measured and main reasons for the discriminatory experience (gender, birth region, age, education, field/office work, job division) were identified separately by gender and job division. Depressive symptoms during the previous week were measured by the CES-D11. Results Overall, 30.3% of firefighters experienced workplace discrimination and the main reasons for discrimination differed by gender and job division. Firefighters who experienced workplace discrimination had a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms than those who did not after adjusting for potential confounders (PR: 1.73; 95%CI: 1.55, 1.92). Conclusions This finding suggests that experience of workplace discrimination could aggravate the mental health of firefighters who provide an important public service.

AB  - Abstract Population maps of the corpus callosum (CC) and cortical lobe connections were generated by combining cortical gray matter parcellation with the diffusion tensor fiber tractography of individual subjects. This method is based on the fact that the cortical lobes of both hemispheres are interconnected by the corpus callosal fibers. T1-weighted structural MRIs and diffusion tensor MRIs (DT-MRI) of 22 right-handed, healthy subjects were used. Forty-seven cortical parcellations in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, sensory-motor cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, and occipital cortex were semi-automatically derived from structural MRIs, registered to DT-MRI, and used to identify callosal fibers. The probabilistic connections to each cortex were mapped on entire mid-sagittal CC voxels that had anatomical homology between subjects as determined by spatial registration. According to the population maps of the callosal connections, the ventral prefrontal cortex and parts of the dorsal prefrontal cortex both project fibers through the genu and rostrum. The CC regions through which the superior frontal cortex passes extend into the posterior body. Fibers arising from the parietal lobe and occipital lobe run mainly through the splenium, while fibers arising from the sensory-motor cortex pass through the isthmus. In general, dorsal or medial cortical lobes project fibers through the dorsal region of the CC, while lateral cortical lobes project fibers through the ventral region of the CC. The probabilistic subdivision of the CC by connecting cortical gray matter provides a more precise understanding of the CC. Hum Brain Mapp 2008. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Macrophages are critically involved in wound healing, from dampening inflammation to clearing cell debris and coordinating tissue repair. Within the wound, the complexity of macrophage function is increasingly recognized, with adverse outcomes when macrophages are inappropriately activated, such as in fibrosis or chronic non-healing wounds. Recent advances in in vivo and translational wound models, macrophage-specific deletions and new technologies to distinguish macrophage subsets, have uncovered the vast spectrum of macrophage activation and effector functions. Here, we summarize the main players in wound-healing macrophage activation and function, including cytokines, apoptotic cells, nucleotides and mechanical stimuli. We highlight recent studies demonstrating cooperation between these factors for optimal wound healing. Next, we describe recent technologies such as cell tracking and single-cell RNA-seq, which have uncovered remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity in blood-derived or tissue-resident macrophages and discuss the implications for wound healing. Lastly, we evaluate macrophage dysfunction in aberrant wound healing that occurs in aging, diabetes and fibrosis. A better understanding of the longevity and plasticity of wound-healing macrophages, and identification of unique macrophage subsets or specific effector molecules in wound healing, would shed light on the therapeutic potential of manipulating macrophage function for optimal wound healing.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Summary Conifers have evolved complex oleoresin terpene defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In co-evolved bark beetles, conifer terpenes also serve chemo-ecological functions as pheromone precursors, chemical barcodes for host identification, or nutrients for insect-associated microbiomes. We highlight the genomic, molecular and biochemical underpinnings of the large chemical space of conifer oleoresin terpenes and volatiles. Conifer terpenes are predominantly the products of the conifer terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Terpene diversity is increased by cytochromes P450 of the CYP720B class. Many conifer TPS are multiproduct enzymes. Multisubstrate CYP720B enzymes catalyse multistep oxidations. We summarise known terpenoid gene functions in various different conifer species with reference to the annotated terpenoid gene space in a spruce genome. Overall, biosynthesis of terpene diversity in conifers is achieved through a system of biochemical radiation and metabolic grids. Expression of TPS and CYP720B genes can be specific to individual cell types of constitutive or traumatic resin duct systems. Induced terpenoid transcriptomes in resin duct cells lead to dynamic changes of terpene composition and quantity to fend off herbivores and pathogens. While terpenoid defenses have contributed much to the evolutionary success of conifers, under new conditions of climate change, these defences may become inconsequential against range-expanding forest pests.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this investigation was to quantify the discolouration of tooth roots caused by various medicaments and sealers. The roots of extracted teeth were chemo-mechanically prepared and the smear layer removed. The roots were filled with either Multi-Cal (Pulpdent Corporation, Watertown, MA, USA), Ledermix (Lederle Laboratories, Wolfratshausen, Germany), 2% chlorhexadine acetate in polyethylene glycol (PEG), 5% clindamycin in PEG, PEG alone (as a vehicle control), sealers AH26 (De Trey Dentsply, Zurich, Switzerland), AH Plus (De Trey Dentsply), an experimental epoxy resin with zirconium dioxide (Millenium Chemicals, Rockingham, Western Australia) or Araldite (Selleys Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia). The roots were maintained at 37°C in dark humid conditions and standardised images of the coronal surfaces recorded over 12?months. Ledermix caused the most darkening of the introduced medicaments, while calcium hydroxide and the materials in PEG did not cause darkening. AH26 caused more darkening than did the other sealers. It was concluded that the use of alternatives to Ledermix and AH26 should be considered when aesthetics are important.

Methods A cross-sectional study of visits by children 3 months to 18 years of age with SCD and fever evaluated in 36 U.S. children's hospital PEDs within the 2010 Pediatric Health Information System database. The main outcome measures were the proportions of SCD visits that received evaluation (laboratory testing and chest radiographs [CXRs]) and treatment (parenteral administration of antibiotics) and were admitted for fever. Results Of the 4,853 PED visits for SCD and fever, 91.7% had complete blood counts (CBCs), 93.8% had reticulocyte counts, 93% had blood cultures obtained, 68.5% had CXRs, and 91.7% received antibiotics. Most (81.4%) patients received the recommended National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluation (CBC, reticulocyte count, and blood culture) and treatment (parenteral antibiotics). In multivariate regression modeling controlling for hospital- and patient-level effects, age groups ≥1 to <5 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.40) and ≥5 to <13 years (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.50), and those visits that did not have CXRs had lower odds of hospital admission. After adjusting for age, payor status, receipt of laboratory testing, antibiotics, and CXRs, admission rates varied by sevenfold across U.S. children's hospitals (p < 0.001). Conclusions Standardization of practice exists across children's hospitals regarding obtaining laboratory studies and administering antibiotics for patients with SCD and fever. However, admission rates vary significantly. Evaluating the causes and consequences of such significant variation needs further exploration to improve the quality of care for patients with SCD.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.
