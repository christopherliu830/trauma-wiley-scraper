AB  - Abstract Stroke is a multi-factorial polygenic disease and is a major cause of death and adult disability. Administration of bone marrow stem cells protects ischemic rat brain by facilitating recovery of neurological functions. But the molecular mechanism of stem cells action and their effect on gene expression is not well explored. In this study, we have transplanted 1 ? 106 human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) adult male Wistar rats through intracarotid artery route at 24 h after surgery. Motor behavioral tests (rotarod and open field) were performed to assess the changes in motor functions at day 0 and day1, 4, 8 and 14. The expression of studied genes at mRNA and protein level was quantified by using Q-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Further, we have assessed the methylation pattern of promoter of these genes by using methylation-specific PCR. Data were analyzed statistically and correlated. A significant improvement in behavioral deficits was observed in stem cells treated group after 14th day post stroke. Significantly (p < 0.05) increased mRNA and protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ANP genes in hBMMSCs treated group along with decrease in methylation level at their promoter was observed. On the other hand, significantly decreased mRNA and protein level of TSP1 and WNK1 in hBMMSCs treated group was observed. In conclusion, hBMMSCs administration significantly improves the behavioral deficits by improving motor and locomotor coordination. The promoter of TSP1 and WNK1 genes was found to be hyper-methylated in hBMMSCs group resulting in their decreased expression while the promoter of ANP and brain derived neurotrophic factor was found to be hypo-methylated. This study might shed a light on how hBMMSCs affect the gene expression by modulating methylation status.

AB  - Abstract Aims To test the hypothesis that young people with perceived parental alcohol problems have poorer parent?child relationships and more emotional symptoms, low self-esteem, loneliness and depression than young people without perceived parental alcohol problems. Design Cross-sectional analysis using data from the Danish National Youth Study 2014, a web-based national survey. Setting Denmark. Participants A total of 71.988 high school and vocational school students (aged 12?25, nested in 119 schools and 3.186 school classes) recruited throughout 2014. Measurements Outcome variables included internalizing problems such as emotional symptoms, depression, self-esteem, loneliness and aspects of the parent?child relationship. The main predictor variable was perceived parental alcohol problems, including the severity of the perceived problems and living with a parent with alcohol problems. Control variables included age, sex, education, ethnicity, parents? separation and economic problems in the family. Findings Boys and girls with perceived parental alcohol problems had statistically significant higher odds of reporting internalizing problems (e.g. frequent emotional symptoms: odds ratio (OR)= 1.58 for boys; 1.49 for girls) and poor parent?child relationships (e.g. lack of parental interest: OR = 1.92 for boys; 2.33 for girls) compared with young people without perceived parental alcohol problems. The associations were not significantly stronger for mother's alcohol problems or if the young person lived with the parent with perceived alcohol problems. Conclusion Boys and girls in secondary education in Denmark who report perceived parental alcohol problems have significantly higher odds of internalizing problems and poorer parent?child relationships compared with young people without perceived parental alcohol problems.

AB  - Abstract Degeneration of motor neurons and their associated axons is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but reliable noninvasive lesion detection is lacking. In vivo diffusion tensor imaging was performed to evaluate neurodegeneration in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord of wild-type and G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice, an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A statistically significant reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient was observed in the motor nuclei VII and XII of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice relative to wild-type mice. No significant difference in diffusion anisotropy was observed in dorsal white or gray matter in cervical and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. In contrast, statistically significant decreases in axial diffusivity (diffusivity parallel to the axis of the spinal cord) and apparent diffusion coefficient were found in the ventrolateral white matter of G93A-SOD1 mice in both the cervical and lumbar spinal cord. The reduction in axial diffusivity, suggestive of axonal injury, in the white matter of the spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 mice was verified by immunostaining with nonphosphorylated neurofilament. The present study demonstrates that in vivo diffusion tensor imaging-derived axial diffusivity may be used to accurately evaluate axonal degeneration in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - The integrity of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) is critical to normal brain function. Traditional techniques for the assessment of BBB disruption rely heavily on the spatiotemporal analysis of extravasating contrast agents. However, such methods based on the leakage of relatively large molecules are not suitable for the detection of subtle BBB impairment or for the performance of repeated measurements in a short time frame. Quantification of the water exchange rate constant (WER) across the BBB using strictly intravascular contrast agents could provide a much more sensitive method for the quantification of the BBB integrity. To estimate WER, we have recently devised a powerful new method using a water exchange index (WEI) biomarker and demonstrated BBB disruption in an acute stroke model. Here, we confirm that WEI is sensitive to even very subtle changes in the integrity of the BBB caused by: (i) systemic hypercapnia and (ii) low doses of a hyperosmolar solution. In addition, we have examined the sensitivity and accuracy of WEI as a biomarker of WER using computer simulation. In particular, the dependence of the WEI?WER relation on changes in vascular blood volume, T1 relaxation of cellular magnetization and transcytolemmal water exchange was explored. Simulated WEI was found to vary linearly with WER for typically encountered exchange rate constants (1?4?Hz), regardless of the blood volume. However, for very high WER (>5?Hz), WEI became progressively more insensitive to increasing WER. The incorporation of transcytolemmal water exchange, using a three-compartment tissue model, helped to extend the linear WEI regime to slightly higher WER, but had no significant effect for most physiologically important WERs (WER?<?4?Hz). Variation in cellular T1 had no effect on WEI. Using both theoretical and experimental approaches, our study validates the utility of the WEI biomarker for the monitoring of BBB integrity.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To visualize the perforating arteries originating from basilar artery (BA) by using ultra-high resolution 7T MR angiography (MRA) and optimizing MR parameters as well as radio frequency (RF) coils, which may provide important information for neurosurgery and understanding diseases of the pons, but was unable to clearly visualize with conventional MRA techniques. Materials and Methods: Seven healthy volunteers (five males and two females, age [mean ± SD] = 28.71 ± 7.54 years) were scanned using optimized MR parameters to obtain images of pontine arteries (PAs) originating from the main trunk of BA. Two different volume coils and a phased array coil were designed and compared for this study. The images obtained at 7T MRA were compared with those at 1.5T and 3T MRA. Results: The results showed that PA imaging at 7T MRI consistently provided clearly identifiable vessels, which were difficult to visualize in MR angiograms obtained at 1.5T and 3T MRIs. Volume RF coils had higher sensitivity for the center of the brain, which enhanced PA imaging compared to phased array coil. The average number of PA branches in all seven subjects observable by 7T MRA was 7.14 ± 2.79, and the visualized PA branches were found to mainly propagating on the surface of the pons. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that ultra-high resolution 7T MRA could delineate the PAs using optimized imaging parameters and volume RF coils compared to commercially available 1.5T and 3T MRIs.

AB  - Abstract This review focuses on the application of nanomaterials for neural interfacing. The junction between nanotechnology and neural tissues can be particularly worthy of scientific attention for several reasons: (i) Neural cells are electroactive, and the electronic properties of nanostructures can be tailored to match the charge transport requirements of electrical cellular interfacing. (ii) The unique mechanical and chemical properties of nanomaterials are critical for integration with neural tissue as long-term implants. (iii) Solutions to many critical problems in neural biology/medicine are limited by the availability of specialized materials. (iv) Neuronal stimulation is needed for a variety of common and severe health problems. This confluence of need, accumulated expertise, and potential impact on the well-being of people suggests the potential of nanomaterials to revolutionize the field of neural interfacing. In this review, we begin with foundational topics, such as the current status of neural electrode (NE) technology, the key challenges facing the practical utilization of NEs, and the potential advantages of nanostructures as components of chronic implants. After that the detailed account of toxicology and biocompatibility of nanomaterials in respect to neural tissues is given. Next, we cover a variety of specific applications of nanoengineered devices, including drug delivery, imaging, topographic patterning, electrode design, nanoscale transistors for high-resolution neural interfacing, and photoactivated interfaces. We also critically evaluate the specific properties of particular nanomaterials?including nanoparticles, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes?that can be taken advantage of in neuroprosthetic devices. The most promising future areas of research and practical device engineering are discussed as a conclusion to the review.

AB  - SUMMARY:? Since 1998, by law, all school children in Korea must have an annual urinalysis. The first early morning urine specimen is examined by a simple dipstick method for the detection of proteinuria, haematuria and glucose. If a urine test is positive, a second test is performed by paediatric nephrologists. We analysed urinalysis data of school urinalysis screening. We also analysed the results of clinical data and the renal biopsy findings of patients referred to our medical centre due to abnormal urinalysis result. To date, about five million students have been screened since annual school urinalysis started in January 1998. Among them, isolated proteinuria was about 0.2%, occult blood was about 0.8%, and glucosuria was about 0.07% from January 1998 to December 2004. Among referred patients, renal biopsy was taken in 63.1% of isolated haematuria, 10.5% of isolated proteinuria and 69.9% of haematuria combined with proteinuria. Histopathological findings are IgA nephropathy in 43.8%, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 38.4%, Henoch?Schönlein nephritis in 2.7%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1.6% and lupus nephritis in 0.5%. Alport disease showed 0.6% as a hereditary disease. In conclusion, the school urinalysis screening could detect chronic renal disease in its early stage. Early detection using school urinalysis screening and confirmatory diagnosis by renal biopsy seems to be helpful for assessment of prognosis and intervention of chronic renal disease progression.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2010; 17:e110?e129 ? 2010 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Preface All of us who have worked on this curriculum are career emergency physicians (EPs) who have become leaders with a focus on emergency medicine (EM) quality and safety. About 2?years ago, I approached my colleagues of the American College of Emergency Physicians Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (ACEP QIPS) Section and dreamed an idea of creating an EM quality and safety curriculum: an outline that would explain a topic few EPs understand. That outline would be used as a curriculum to teach our EM residents (and even our attendings, physician?s assistants, and nurse leaders) about EM quality and safety. My goal is for this curriculum to become an integral part of every EM residency program and department. We know that quality and safety in patient care does not happen by accident. We must teach these concepts to everyone on our emergency department (ED) team. The safety of our patients depends on this. I would like to thank each of the authors who spent many months on this project, along with the ACEP QIPS Section and ACEP Quality and Performance Committee. Also, I would like to thank ACEP staff Angela Franklin and Idania Lorenti for their help in getting this project to completion. I must also sincerely acknowledge the early work and ideas generated by Drs. Shari Welch and David John: their contributions clearly helped shape this article. ?John J. Kelly, DO

AB  - Abstract This research examines how social trust translates into dynamics of mobilisation for inclusion or exclusion in Swiss cantons by studying how social trust is linked to equality-directed protest intention versus radical right support, comparing individual-level and contextual-level relationships. The study is based on data from the Swiss Household Panel collected between 2002 and 2008. The impact of individual-level and contextual-level social trust is analysed in three-level regression models of repeated observations, nested in individuals who are nested in cantons. The results indicate complex patterns that depend on the level at which social trust is assessed and confirm the need for a contextualised view of social trust and social capital. For individuals, higher social trust is associated with higher protest intention and lower radical right support. However, in cantons characterised by higher rates of social trust, individuals are less likely to engage in protest actions and more likely to support the radical right. Further analyses show that canton-level social trust is intertwined with other contextual factors, suggesting that in certain configurations, that is, combined with low levels of cultural and social diversity, climates of social trust may be linked to more restricted forms of solidarity and the persistence of inequality.

AB  - Abstract The underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis are ill understood. The mortality rate of this disease has not significantly improved over the past few decades. Current treatment options are limited, and predominantly aimed at supportive therapy. A key feature of severe acute pancreatitis is the presence of extensive tissue necrosis with both local and systemic manifestations of inflammatory response syndromes. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis may lead to more targeted therapeutic options, potentially leading to improved survival. Animal models of acute pancreatitis are therefore an essential investigative tool for these aims to be achieved. This review discusses the suitability of recent non-invasive models of acute pancreatitis such as hormone-induced, alcohol-induced, immune-mediated, diet-induced, gene knockout and L-arginine; and invasive models including closed duodenal loop, antegrade pancreatic duct perfusion, biliopancreatic duct injection, combination of secretory hyperstimulation with minimal intraductal bile acid exposure, vascular-induced, ischaemia/reperfusion and duct ligation.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - Background:? A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidizing gene monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) has been associated with behavioral sensitivity to adverse environmental conditions in multiple studies (e.g., Caspi et al. 2002; Kim-Cohen et al., 2006). The present study investigates the effects of genotype and early physical discipline on externalizing behavior. We expand on the current literature in our assessment of externalizing, incorporating information across multiple reporters and over a broad developmental time period, and in our understanding of environmental risk. Method:? This study uses data from the Child Development Project, an ongoing longitudinal study following a community sample of children beginning at age 5. Physical discipline before age 6 was quantified using a subset of questions from the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, 1979). Externalizing behavior was assessed in the male, European-American sub-sample (N = 250) by parent, teacher, and self-report using Achenbach?s Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, and Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1991), at 17 time points from ages 6 to 22. Regression analyses tested the influence of genotype, physical discipline, and their interaction on externalizing behavior, and its subscales, delinquency and aggression. Results:? We found a significant interaction effect between genotype and physical discipline on levels of delinquent behavior. Similar trends were observed for aggression and overall externalizing behavior, although these did not reach statistical significance. Main effects of physical discipline held for all outcome variables, and no main effects held for genotype. Conclusion:? The adverse consequences of physical discipline on forms of externalizing behavior are exacerbated by an underlying biological risk conferred by MAOA genotype.

AB  - Five to ten percent of fractures fail to heal normally leading to additional surgery, morbidity, and altered quality of life. Fracture healing involves the coordinated action of stem cells primarily coming from the periosteum which differentiate into the chondrocytes and osteoblasts, forming first the soft (cartilage) callus followed by the hard (bone) callus. These stem cells are accompanied by a vascular invasion that appears critical for the differentiation process and which may enable the entry of osteoclasts necessary for the remodeling of the callus into mature bone. However, more research is needed to clarify the signaling events that activate the osteochondroprogenitor cells of periosteum and stimulate their differentiation into chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Ultimately a thorough understanding of the mechanisms for differential regulation of these osteochondroprogenitors will aid in the treatment of bone healing and the prevention of delayed union and nonunion of fractures. In this review, evidence supporting the concept that the periosteal cells are the major cell sources of skeletal progenitors for the fracture callus will be discussed. The osteogenic differentiation of periosteal cells manipulated by Wnt/?-catenin, TGF/BMP, Ihh/PTHrP, and IGF-1/PI3K?Akt signaling in fracture repair will be examined. The effect of physical (hypoxia and hyperoxia) and chemical factors (reactive oxygen species) as well as the potential coordinated regulatory mechanisms in the periosteal progenitor cells promoting osteogenic differentiation will also be discussed. Understanding the regulation of periosteal osteochondroprogenitors during fracture healing could provide insight into possible therapeutic targets and thereby help to enhance future fracture healing and bone tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - Summary Objective Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance is increased, despite relatively preserved bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and composite indices of femoral neck strength in Koreans. Design A population-based, cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants About 1243 men and 1433 women Measurements Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Femoral neck width and axis length were measured from hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and combined with BMD, weight and height to calculate composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load: compression (CSI), bending (BSI) and impact strength indices (ISI). Results HOMA-IR showed an inverse relationship with CSI, BSI and ISI in both genders before and after adjusting for confounders (P < 0·001?0·029). CSI was more strongly associated with HOMA-IR than BSI and/or ISI in both genders (P < 0·001?0·013). When men were stratified according to HOMA-IR quartiles, all strength indices decreased as the quartile increased, after adjusting for all potential confounders (P for trend <0·001?0·001), whereas CSI and ISI did in women (P for trend = 0·012 and 0·002, respectively). Fasting insulin levels, but not glucose levels, were negatively associated with all strength indices regardless of confounders (P < 0·001?0·044). Conclusions Insulin resistance is associated with low femoral neck strength, particularly against the compressive load. These findings suggest a better approach to evaluate bone health in insulin-resistant individuals.
