AB  - Abstract We report details of the first seven equine cases of confirmed West Nile neuroinvasive disease in Austria. The cases presented during summer and autumn of 2016 (n = 2), 2017 (n = 3) and 2018 (n = 2). All horses showed gait abnormalities and 6 of 7 horses exhibited fasciculations and/or tremors, and we provide video recordings of these. Three horses also showed cranial nerve involvement. Following rapid improvement, three horses were discharged. Four horses were euthanized due to the severity of clinical signs and subjected to neuropathological examination. West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 nucleic acid was detected in 5 of 7 horses, and WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies in all 7 horses. In addition, serologic evidence of WNV infection was found in two out of fourteen in-contact horses. Horses may be considered a sentinel species for human WNV infections, integrating human and veterinary medicine and thus contributing to the one health concept.

AB  - Summary Objective Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance is increased, despite relatively preserved bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and composite indices of femoral neck strength in Koreans. Design A population-based, cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants About 1243 men and 1433 women Measurements Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Femoral neck width and axis length were measured from hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and combined with BMD, weight and height to calculate composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load: compression (CSI), bending (BSI) and impact strength indices (ISI). Results HOMA-IR showed an inverse relationship with CSI, BSI and ISI in both genders before and after adjusting for confounders (P < 0·001?0·029). CSI was more strongly associated with HOMA-IR than BSI and/or ISI in both genders (P < 0·001?0·013). When men were stratified according to HOMA-IR quartiles, all strength indices decreased as the quartile increased, after adjusting for all potential confounders (P for trend <0·001?0·001), whereas CSI and ISI did in women (P for trend = 0·012 and 0·002, respectively). Fasting insulin levels, but not glucose levels, were negatively associated with all strength indices regardless of confounders (P < 0·001?0·044). Conclusions Insulin resistance is associated with low femoral neck strength, particularly against the compressive load. These findings suggest a better approach to evaluate bone health in insulin-resistant individuals.

AB  - Summary von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a recognized cause of secondary ankle osteoarthritis (OA). Few studies have examined orthopaedic complications and outcomes in VWD patients treated for end-stage ankle OA with total ankle replacement (TAR). To determine the clinical presentation, intraoperative and postoperative complications and evaluate the mid-term outcome in VWD patients treated with TAR. Eighteen patients with VWD with mean age 47.3 years (range = 34.0?68.7) were treated for end-stage ankle OA with TAR. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (range = 2.9?13.2). Intraoperative and perioperative complications were recorded. Component stability was assessed with weight-bearing radiographs. Clinical evaluation included range of motion (ROM) tests using a goniometer and under fluoroscopy using a lateral view. Clinical outcomes were analysed by a visual analogue scale, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) health survey. One patient sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In two patients delayed wound healing was observed. Two secondary major surgeries were performed. Pain level decreased from 8.2 ± 0.9 (range = 7?10) preoperatively to 1.1 ± 1.2 (range = 0?4) postoperatively. Significant functional improvement including ROM was observed. All categories of SF-36 score showed significant improvement in quality of life. Mid-term results of TAR in patients with VWD are encouraging. The total rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications was 33.3%. However, longer term outcomes are necessary to fully understand the clinical benefit of TAR in patients with VWD.

AB  - Abstract Childhood maltreatment is associated with alterations in neural architecture that potentially put these children at increased risk for psychopathology. Alterations in white matter (WM) tracts have been reported, however no study to date has investigated WM connectivity in brain networks in maltreated children to quantify global and local abnormalities through graph theoretical analyses of DTI data. We aimed for a multilevel investigation examining the DTI-based structural connectome and its associations with basal cortisol levels of 25 children with documented maltreatment experiences before age 3, and 24 matched controls (age: 10.6?±?1.75 years). On the global and lobar level, maltreated children showed significant reductions in global connectivity strength, local connectivity and increased path length, suggesting deviations from the small-world network architecture previously associated with psychopathology. Reductions in global connectivity were associated with placement instability, attenuated cortisol secretion and higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Regional measures revealed lower connectivity strength especially in regions within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in maltreated children. These findings show that childhood maltreatment is associated with systemic global neurodevelopmental alterations in WM networks next to regional alterations in areas involved in the regulation of affect. These alterations in WM organization could underlie global functional deficits and multi-symptom patterns frequently observed in children with maltreatment experiences.

AB  - This Annotation highlights recent research on the role of peer group and friendship factors in the development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. Several processes are considered, including peer rejection (e.g., exclusion and victimization), social withdrawal and avoidance of peer interaction, and the socialization of deviant behavior and internalizing problems. The mediating influences of several proximal components are examined, including cognitive-perceptual factors and emotion regulation. In addition, the moderating ifluences of close friendship, age, gender, ethnicity, and group norms are considered. Several promising avenues for future directions in research are highlighted, including the examination of heterogeneity in developmental processes, further investigation of gender-based norms, and the application of multi-level modeling techniques and gene-environment process models.

AB  - Aims:? To determine the immediate and long-term results of endoscopic drainage and necrosectomy for symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections. Methods:? The data of 80 patients with symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections (mean diameter: 11.7?cm, range 3?20; pseudocysts: 24/80, abscess: 20/80, infected walled-off necrosis: 36/80) referred for endoscopic management from October 1997 to March 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. Results:? Endoscopic drainage techniques included endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided aspiration (2/80), EUS-guided transenteric drainage (70/80) and non-EUS-guided drainage across a spontaneous transenteric fistula (8/80). Endoscopic necrosectomy was carried out in 49/80 (abscesses: 14/20; infected necrosis: 35/36). Procedural complications were bleeding (12/80), perforation (7/80), portal air embolism (1/80) and Ogilvie Syndrome (1/80). Initial technical success was achieved in 78/80 (97.5%) and clinical resolution of the collections was achieved endoscopically in 67/80 (83.8%), with surgery required in 13/80 (perforation: four; endoscopically inaccessible areas: two; inadequate drainage: seven). Within 6?months five patients required surgery due to recurrent fluid collections; over a mean follow up of 31?months, surgery was required in four more patients due to recurrent collections as a consequence of underlying pancreatic duct abnormalities that could not be treated endoscopically. The long-term success of endoscopic treatment was 58/80 (72.5%). Conclusions:? Endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections is safe and effective, with excellent immediate and long-term results. Endoscopic necrosectomy has a risk of serious complications. The underlying pancreatic duct abnormalities must be addressed to prevent recurrence of fluid collections.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess dimensionality of the underlying constructs. All three versions of the PSS demonstrated acceptable reliability. Two shorter versions retained good psychometric properties and demonstrated convergent and concurrent validity with measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms and mental health quality of life. Factor analysis provided further evidence of their usefulness as brief and valid measures of perceived stress in acutely bereaved adult survivors of suicide. In a sub-sample of closely related survivors, the psychometric properties of the 4-item version of the PSS were retained. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 31:576?585, 2008

AB  - Abstract The monoamine neurotransmitter, serotonin, critically regulates the function of the cerebral cortex and is involved in psychiatric disorders. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin with the neuron-specific TPH2 isoform present exclusively in the brain and encoded by the TPH2 gene on chromosome 12q21. The haplotype structure of TPH2 was defined for 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a healthy subject population and a haplotype block analysis confirmed the presence of a six SNP haplotype in a yin configuration that has previously been associated with risk for suicidality, depression, and anxiety disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess the influence of TPH2 variation on brain function related to cognitive control using the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). The MSIT-related blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response was increased with increasing copies of the TPH2 yin haplotype for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and anterior striatum. A functional connectivity analysis further revealed that increasing numbers of the TPH2 yin haplotype was associated with diminished functional coupling between the dACC and the right IFC, precentral gyrus, parietal cortex and dlPFC. A moderation analysis indicated that the relationship between neural processing networks and cognitive control was significantly modulated by allelic variation for the TPH2 yin haplotype. These findings suggest that the association of risk for psychiatric disorders with a common TPH2 yin haplotype is related to the inefficient functional engagement of cortical areas involved in cognitive control and alterations in the mode of functional connectivity of dACC pathways. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Smart Management Strategy for Health Assessment Tool (SAT), which we developed to enable cancer patients to assess their self-management (SM) strategies of health by themselves. Patients and methods The development of the questionnaire included four phases: item generation, construction, pilot testing, and field testing. To assess the instrument's sensitivity and validity, we recruited 300 cancer patients from three Korean hospitals who were 18 or more years old and accustomed to using the Internet or email. Using the appropriate and priority criteria for pilot and field testing, we tightened the content and constructed the first version of the SAT. Results We developed the core strategies with 28 items, preparation strategies with 30 items, and implementation strategies with 33 items. Factor analysis of data from 300 patients resulted in core strategies with four factors, preparation strategies with five factors, and implementation strategies with six factors. All the SAT subscales demonstrated a high reliability with good internal consistency. The total scores of the three SAT sets differentiated participant groups well according to their stage of goal implementation and proportions of action of the 10 Rules for Highly Effective Health Behavior. Each factor of the three SAT sets correlated positively with the scores for additional assessment tool. Conclusion The SAT is a three-set, 16-factor, 91-item tool that assesses the SM strategies of health that patients use to overcome a crisis. Patients can use the SAT to assess their SM strategies of health and obtain feedback from clinicians in the practice setting. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Abstract Introduction To assess the reliability of short versions of the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). Methods A short form of the ANU-ADRI (ANU-ADRI-SF) was developed by assessing risk and protective factors with single questions where possible and with short forms of sub-questionnaires where available. The tick box form of the ANU-ADRI (ANU-ADRI-TB) was developed with unique questions for each risk and protective factor for Alzheimer's disease. The short versions were evaluated in an independent community sample of 504 participants with a mean age of 45.01 (SD = 14.85, range = 18?81). Results The short versions demonstrated high reliabilities when compared with the ANU-ADRI. However, the proportion of misclassification was high for some risk factors and particularly for the ANU-ADRI-TB. Discussion The ANU-ADRI-SF may be considered if less reliable questions from the ANU-ADRI-SF can be replaced with more reliable questions from the ANU-ADRI for risk/protective factors with high misclassification.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors and investigations, smart testing and management for cardiovascular problems in elderly patients. Coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), valvular heart disease, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arrhythmia and most cardiovascular (CV) pathophysiologic processes become endemic among older populations as a function of aging physiology, especially in relation to CV risk factors over a lifetime. In older patients, the symptoms can be subtle or even misleading because of the presence of multi-morbidity. The baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in older adults is more likely to have baseline waveform abnormalities that may confound assessment of ischemia. Management choices entail a constant balance between rationale for aggressive therapy vs. rationale for reduced therapy. Medication reconciliation is an essential part of comprehensive care, and should be repeated at every transition (at home, admission into the hospital, transfer within the hospital, and at discharge).
