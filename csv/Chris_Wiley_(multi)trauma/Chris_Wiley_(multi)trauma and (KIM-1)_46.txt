AB  - Summary For over a century, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) has linked white pines (Strobus) with currants and gooseberries (Ribes) in a complex and serious disease epidemic in Asia, Europe, and North America. Because of ongoing changes in climate, societal demands for forests and their amenities, and scientific advances in genetics and proteomics, our current understanding and management of the white pine blister rust pathosystem has become outdated. Here, we present a review and synthesis of international scope on the biology and management of blister rust, white pines, Ribes, and other hosts. In this article, we provide a geographical and historical background, describe the taxonomy and life cycle of the rust, discuss pathology and ecology, and introduce a series of invited papers. These review articles summarize the literature on white pines, Ribes, and blister rust with respect to their status, threats, and management through genetics and silviculture. Although the principal focus is on North America, the different epidemics in Europe and Asia are also described. In the final article, we discuss several of the key observations and conclusions from the preceding review articles and identify prudent actions for research and management of white pine blister rust.

AB  - Abstract Low level sarin nerve gas and other anti-cholinesterase agents have been implicated in Gulf War illness (GWI), a chronic multi-symptom disorder characterized by cognitive, pain and fatigue symptoms that continues to afflict roughly 32% of veterans from the 1990?1991 Gulf War. How disrupting cholinergic synaptic transmission could produce chronic illness is unclear, but recent research indicates that acetylcholine also mediates communication between axons and oligodendrocytes. Here we investigated the hypothesis that oligodendrocyte development is disrupted by Gulf War agents, by experiments using the sarin-surrogate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). The effects of corticosterone, which is used in some GWI animal models, were also investigated. The data show that DFP decreased both the number of mature and dividing oligodendrocytes in the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC), but differences were found between PFC and corpus callosum. The differences seen between the PFC and corpus callosum likely reflect the higher percentage of proliferating oligodendroglia in the adult PFC. In cell culture, DFP also decreased oligodendrocyte survival through a non-cholinergic mechanism. Corticosterone promoted maturation of oligodendrocytes, and when used in combination with DFP it had protective effects by increasing the pool of mature oligodendrocytes and decreasing proliferation. Cell culture studies indicate direct effects of both DFP and corticosterone on OPCs, and by comparison with in vivo results, we conclude that in addition to direct effects, systemic effects and interruption of neuron?glia interactions contribute to the detrimental effects of GW agents on oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that oligodendrocytes are an important component of the pathophysiology of GWI.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the impact of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents on long-term clinical events according to the newly proposed Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) classification. Background Current evidence about the impact of the BARC classification is limited. Methods Out of a total of 6,166 patients who underwent PCI in a prospective IRIS-DES registry, the impact of in-hospital bleeding defined as the BARC classification on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) comprising death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke was analyzed. Results In-hospital bleeding occurred in 235 patients (3.8%) according to BARC classification. During the 2-year follow-up, MACE occurred in 599 patients (9.7%). The 2-year incidence of MACE was significantly higher in patients with bleeding (16.7% vs. 8.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2?2.3; P?=?0.002) than in those without bleeding. We observed a higher risk of MI (12.4% vs. 6.4%; adjusted HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2?2.6, P?=?0.005), stroke (3.0% vs. 0.6%; adjusted HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4?6.2, P?=?0.005) in patients with bleeding. Death (3.8% vs. 1.6%; adjusted HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9?3.0, P?=?0.120) and target vessel revascularization (4.3% vs. 1.9%; adjusted HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9?2.9, P?=?0.108) were statistically insignificant. Incidence, adjusted HR and P-value were similar between BARC and TIMI classification. Conclusions In-hospital bleeding events according to the newly proposed BARC definition were significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse long-term events in patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Statistical interpretation of data collected in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is conducted on the intention-to-treat (ITT) and/or the per-protocol (PP) study populations. ITT analysis is a comparison of treatment groups including all patients as originally allocated after randomisation regardless if treatment was initiated or completed. PP analysis is a comparison of treatment groups including only those patients who completed the treatment as originally allocated, although it is often criticised because of its potential to instil bias. A previous report from an RCT conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (EpiFix) as an adjunct to standard comprehensive wound therapy consisting of moist dressings and multi-layer compression in the healing of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) only reported PP study results (n?=?109, 52 EpiFix and 57 standard care patients), although there were 128 patients randomised: 64 to the EpiFix group and 64 to the standard care group. Primary study outcome was the incidence of healing at 12?weeks. The purpose of the present study is to report ITT results on all 128 randomised subjects and assess if both ITT and PP data analyses arrive at the same conclusion of the efficacy of EpiFix as a treatment for VLU. Rates of healing for the ITT and PP populations were, respectively, 50% and 60% for those receiving EpiFix and 31% and 35% for those in the standard care cohort. Within both ITT and PP analyses, these differences were statistically significant; P = 0.0473, ITT and P = 0.0128, PP. The Kaplan-Meier plot of time to heal within 12?weeks for the ITT and PP populations demonstrated a superior wound-healing trajectory for EpiFix compared with VLUs treated with standard care alone. These data provide clinicians and health policymakers an additional level of assurance regarding the effectiveness of EpiFix.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Background Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease of dogs and humans. Objectives Our objectives were to describe clinical phenotypes, histopathology and treatment outcomes of canine EBA. Animals Twenty dogs diagnosed with EBA based on a subepidermal blister formation and collagen VII autoreactivity. Results Most dogs were young (median: 1.2-year-old) with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Nine of 20 dogs (45%) developed lesions before one year of age and 11 of 20 dogs (55%) were great danes. Tense vesicles and bullae (18 of 20; 90%) and deep erosions and ulcers (20 of 20; 100%) were the most common lesions and these affected predominantly the oral cavity (19 of 20; 95%), pinnae (16 of 20; 80%), axillae (15 of 20; 75%) and footpads (14 of 20; 70%). Histopathology identified neutrophilic perivascular dermatitis (17 of 17; 100%) without or with (12 of 17; 71%) eosinophils, which occasionally equalled (four cases) or outnumbered neutrophils (two cases). Subepidermal vesicles were either devoid of inflammation or contained neutrophils with or without eosinophils, fibrin and/or haemorrhage. A complete remission of skin lesions was obtained in 14 dogs with a median time of 58 days. Glucocorticoids were used in these dogs either as a monotherapy (3 of 14; 21%) or in combination with other immunomodulating drugs (11 of 14; 79%). The median dose of prednisone was 3 mg/kg/day. The remaining six dogs were euthanized. Conclusions and clinical importance Canine EBA is a rare subepidermal blistering disease with an inflammatory phenotype and a predilection for young great danes and male dogs. The outcome of treatment appears more favourable than assumed previously.

AB  - Abstract This study used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate whole brain networks in patients with persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). We compared rsfMRI data from 38 patients with PPPD and 38 healthy controls using whole brain and region of interest analyses. We examined correlations among connectivity and clinical variables and tested the ability of a machine learning algorithm to classify subjects using rsfMRI results. Patients with PPPD showed: (a) increased connectivity of subcallosal cortex with left superior lateral occipital cortex and left middle frontal gyrus, (b) decreased connectivity of left hippocampus with bilateral central opercular cortices, left posterior opercular cortex, right insular cortex and cerebellum, and (c) decreased connectivity between right nucleus accumbens and anterior left temporal fusiform cortex. After controlling for anxiety and depression as covariates, patients with PPPD still showed decreased connectivity between left hippocampus and right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral temporal lobes, bilateral insular cortices, bilateral central opercular cortex, left parietal opercular cortex, bilateral occipital lobes and cerebellum (bilateral lobules VI and V, and left I?IV). Dizziness handicap, anxiety, and depression correlated with connectivity in clinically meaningful brain regions. The machine learning algorithm correctly classified patients and controls with a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 76.9%, and area under the curve = 0.88 using 11 connectivity parameters. Patients with PPPD showed reduced connectivity among the areas involved in multisensory vestibular processing and spatial cognition, but increased connectivity in networks linking visual and emotional processing. Connectivity patterns may become an imaging biomarker of PPPD.

AB  - The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) system has been characterized as the principal tissue level response to hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of HIF-1alpha has been reported to act though a Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) promoter region on a range of hypoxia-induced genes. A plasmid was constructed consisting of a fivefold HRE repeat conjugated to a luciferase gene, used as a marker for HRE activation. Plasmid HRE-luciferase was then transfected into a well-established ischemic rabbit ear wound healing model. Ischemia was induced using a variety of published models for interruption of arterial inflow and compared with a nonischemic control. Central artery, caudal artery and rostrocaudal artery models were tested for induction of ischemia. Tissue specimens were harvested from the transfected areas and solubilized. Luminescence of each specimen was measured using a standard luminometer to quantify luciferase induction. To provide correlation on a regional level, tissue level oxygen tension was measured directly for each wound model. Profound and statistically significant differences were found in the induced luciferase production. Marked differences in the tissue hypoxia between the various ischemic wound healing models correlated in graded fashion with the ischemia induced on an anatomic basis. The least ischemic model showed no significant difference in hypoxia readings versus control. The intermediate model showed a significant fourfold greater ischemia signaling. The most ischemic model showed a highly significant 72-fold greater ischemic response compared to controls. The use of gene transfection is described as a sensitive and effective method for quantification of tissue hypoxia at a cellular level in ischemic wounds. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is a complex vascular structure consisting of microvascular endothelial cells that line the vessel wall, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, as well as the basal lamina. BBB cells act in concert to maintain the characteristic impermeable and low paracellular flux of the brain vascular network, thus ensuring a homeostatic neuronal environment. Alterations in BBB stability that occur during injury have dire consequences on disease progression and it is clear that BBB cell-specific responses, positive or negative, must make a significant contribution to injury outcome. Reduced oxygenation, or hypoxia, is a characteristic of many brain diseases that significantly increases barrier permeability. Recent data suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), the master regulator of the hypoxic response, probably mediates many hypoxic effects either directly or indirectly via its target genes. This review discusses current knowledge of physiological cell-specific regulation of barrier function, their responses to hypoxia as well as consequences of hypoxic- and HIF-1-mediated mechanisms on barrier integrity during select brain diseases. In the final sections, the potential of current advances in targeting HIF-1 as a therapeutic strategy will be overviewed.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Objective This study evaluated the proficiency in executing closed, fluoroscopic-assisted reduction of unicondylar humeral fractures. The following were hypothesised: experienced surgeons would be highly successful in performing closed reduction; body weight, time to surgery and surgeon experience would influence the reduction method; and the reduction method would not affect technical aspects of the repair. Methods All unicondylar humeral fractures stabilised between January 2007 and January 2017 were reviewed. Signalment and time to surgery, experience of the attending surgeon, and the initial and definitive reduction methods were recorded. Initial and subsequent postoperative radiographs were used to assess fracture reduction, implant placement and complications. Univariate polychotomous logistic regressions, Fisher?s exact test, Kruskal-Wallis rank sums non-parametric test or equivalence tests were used to compare parameters evaluated based on the approach employed (P?<?0.05 significant). Results A total of 36 dogs with 37 fractures were identified (median weight: 5.4?kg; median time to surgery: 3?days). Of these, 11 of 15 attempted closed reductions were successful. Successful closed reductions had shorter times to surgery than limited open or open reductions (P = 0.009). Age, weight and surgeon experience did not influence the definitive reduction method. Technical aspects of reduction and stabilisation were similar among the reduction methods. Surgery times were shorter for closed reductions (P = 0.034). Of the fractures, 75% healed without complications and 85% had excellent long-term function. Conclusion The results suggested that closed, fluoroscopic-assisted reduction is a proficient (73% successful) and efficient (shorter surgery times with comparable technical results compared with other limited open and open reduction) means of stabilising acute unicondylar humeral fractures.

AB  - Abstract Nanomedicine is a rapidly emerging technology and represents an innovative field for therapy. Nanomaterials have intrinsically defined features for biomedical applications due to the high specific surface area, the amazing diversity, versatility in structure and function and the possibility of surface charge. In particular, the functionalization of targeting or stimuli-responsive unit on the surface of these materials gives them specific targeted therapeutic properties. There are many pediatric lung diseases that could potentially benefit from nanomedicine. Herein, we aim to review various drug carrier systems and release systems specifically targeting pediatric lung diseases. The injection of nanomedicine into in vivo models and their elimination will also be discussed. Finally, the potential toxicity of nanomaterials will be addressed.
