AB  - Abstract: Polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, are naturally present at high concentration in grape skin, seeds, and red wine. Resveratrol is present in cis and trans isoforms and the major trans isomer is the biologically active one. Epidemiologic studies have revealed a reduced incidence of cardiovascular risk associated with consumers of red wine; this has been popularized as the French paradox. Resveratrol has been shown to have significant antioxidant properties in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models. It can reduce ischemic damage in heart ischemia reperfusion injury and also in brain ischemia/reperfusion in rodent models. Due to the high rate of oxygen consumption in the brain, and especially low levels of antioxidant defense enzymes, this organ is particularly susceptible of free radical damage. Most of the protective biological actions associated with resveratrol have been associated with its intrinsic radical scavenger properties. We have investigated the possibility of other indirect pathways by which resveratrol can exert its neuroprotective abilities. We have specifically tested whether heme oxygenase neuroprotective enzyme could be stimulated after resveratrol treatment. Using primary neuronal cultures, resveratrol was able to significantly induce heme oxygenase 1, whereas vehicle control showed no effect. No detectable toxicity was quantified. It is well established that after stroke significant levels of intracellular heme levels increase. The source of free heme comes mainly from several heme-containing enzymes. Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is a pro-oxidant and its rapid degradation by heme oxygenase is believed to be protective. Moreover, the generation of heme metabolites can also have their own intrinsic cellular properties. All together, increased heme oxygenase activity by resveratrol is a unique pathway by which this compound can exert its neuroprotective actions.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Aims and objectives.  To examine interventions and practices carried out by the emergency department professionals. Background.  Developing the related practices provides an opportunity for early intervention in women exposed to intimate partner violence who visit the emergency department. Design.  The descriptive, cross-sectional multi-centre designed study with a convenience sample was used to acquire more information to illustrate the situation of intervening in intimate partner violence at Finnish emergency departments. Participants.  A total of 24-hour emergency departments from all over Finland participated in the study. Methods.  Research materials were collected by questionnaires given to emergency department professionals (n?=?950) and 51% were returned. Data analysis.  The data were analysed using quantitative methods. Chi-square test was used to test the statistical significance of the data. A p-value of <0·05 was considered to indicate statistical significance of each analysis. Results.  The findings of this study reveal that the emergency department professionals who had common practices and written procedures for handling intimate partner violence reported having helped both women and perpetrators more often than those without. Good cooperation with different help providers, opportunities to consult them and training received facilitated intervention methods. Conclusions.  There is a need for more effective change of information and cooperation with different help providers concerning how to act with women and their family members in intimate partner violence situations. Emergency department professionals do not know enough about the legislation concerning intimate partner violence and their professional duty, e.g. if a child?s health and well-being are in danger. Relevance to clinical practice.  This information can be utilised in research, professional education, further training and practical work and when planning the prevention of intimate partner violence.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

(Charcoal Hemoperfusion) Blood ? evidence of massive hemolysis intra-vascular hemolysis, shown in table (no evidence of HUS/TTP). She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - The high prevalence of substance use, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental illness in the veteran population presents unique public health and social justice challenges. Veteran involvement in the justice system has been identified as a national concern. Criminal justice involvement compounds pre-existing socioeconomic stressors and further strains support systems. The point of contact with the criminal justice system, however, presents an opportunity to establish mental health treatment. This is consistent with the concept of the sequential intercept model that seeks to divert offenders with mental illness from the criminal justice system into treatment. In recent years, many jurisdictions have established veterans treatment courts (VTCs), a type of problem-solving court serving this diversion function for military veterans. This article presents an overview of the problem, the ethical basis for their development, a brief history of the courts, and their potential for success. The Harris County Veterans Court is presented as an example.

AB  - Cartilage engineering facilitates repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage using engineered tissue that restores the functional properties of the impaired joint. The seed cells used most frequently in tissue engineering, are chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Seed cells activity plays a key role in the regeneration of functional cartilage tissue. However, seed cells undergo undesirable changes after in vitro processing procedures, such as degeneration of cartilage cells and induced hypertrophy of mesenchymal stem cells, which hinder cartilage tissue engineering. Compared to monoculture, which does not mimic the in vivo cellular environment, co-culture technology provides a more realistic microenvironment in terms of various physical, chemical, and biological factors. Co-culture technology is used in cartilage tissue engineering to overcome obstacles related to the degeneration of seed cells, and shows promise for cartilage regeneration and repair. In this review, we focus first on existing co-culture systems for cartilage tissue engineering and related fields, and discuss the conditions and mechanisms thereof. This is followed by methods for optimizing seed cell co-culture conditions to generate functional neo-cartilage tissue, which will lead to a new era in cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - Congenital left-sided cardiac lesions (LSLs) are a significant contributor to the mortality and morbidity of congenital heart disease (CHD). Structural copy number variants (CNVs) have been implicated in LSL without extra-cardiac features; however, non-penetrance and variable expressivity have created uncertainty over the use of CNV analyses in such patients. High-density SNP microarray genotyping data were used to infer large, likely-pathogenic, autosomal CNVs in a cohort of 1,139 probands with LSL and their families. CNVs were molecularly confirmed and the medical records of individual carriers reviewed. The gene content of novel CNVs was then compared with public CNV data from CHD patients. Large CNVs (>1?MB) were observed in 33 probands (?3%). Six of these were de novo and 14 were not observed in the only available parent sample. Associated cardiac phenotypes spanned a broad spectrum without clear predilection. Candidate CNVs were largely non-recurrent, associated with heterozygous loss of copy number, and overlapped known CHD genomic regions. Novel CNV regions were enriched for cardiac development genes, including seven that have not been previously associated with human CHD. CNV analysis can be a clinically useful and molecularly informative tool in LSLs without obvious extra-cardiac defects, and may identify a clinically relevant genomic disorder in a small but important proportion of these individuals.

AB  - ABSTRACT Within the central nervous system, the olfactory system represents one of the most exciting scenarios since it presents relevant examples of long-life sustained neurogenesis and continuous axonal outgrowth from the olfactory epithelium with the subsequent plasticity phenomena in the olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerve is composed of nonmyelinated axons with interesting ontogenetic interpretations. However, the centripetal projections from the olfactory bulb are myelinated axons which project to more caudal areas along the lateral olfactory tract. In consequence, demyelination has not been considered as a possible cause of the olfactory symptoms in those diseases in which this sense is impaired. One prototypical example of an olfactory disease is Kallmann syndrome, in which different mutations give rise to combined anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, together with different satellite symptoms. Anosmin-1 is the extracellular matrix glycoprotein altered in the X-linked form of this disease, which participates in cell adhesion and migration, and axonal outgrowth in the olfactory system and in other regions of the central nervous system. Recently, we have described a new patho-physiological role of this protein in the absence of spontaneous remyelination in multiple sclerosis. In the present review, we hypothesize about how both main and satellite neurological symptoms of Kallmann syndrome may be explained by alterations in the myelination. We revisit the relationship between the olfactory system and myelin highlighting that minor histological changes should not be forgotten as putative causes of olfactory malfunction.

AB  - Objectives To investigate thalidomide as an adjuvant treatment for canine haemangiosarcoma. Materials and Methods Fifteen dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma, initially treated by splenectomy, were included. Following recovery from surgery, all dogs received thalidomide continuously until their death. Tumour stage was established using CT scans of the chest and abdomen immediately before starting thalidomide treatment and again three months later. Cause of death was confirmed by post mortem examination. Results The median survival time of dogs receiving thalidomide was 172?days (95% confidence interval: 93 to 250?days). Five dogs (33% of the population receiving thalidomide) survived more than 1 year (range 458 to 660?days) after surgery. Dogs with stage 2 disease that received thalidomide also had a longer survival time than dogs with stage 3 disease (median survival time 303 versus 40?days). Of 15 dogs, 13 died from metastatic haemangiosarcoma. Clinical Significance Treatment using thalidomide may improve survival of dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma and should be considered a possible adjuvant therapy.

Recent work shows how multiple-trait approaches better capture senescence as it occurs at different rates among individuals. Furthermore, a Bayesian statistical framework of analysis provides more useful age estimates. The component-scoring method of Transition Analysis (TA) may resolve many of the functional and statistical limitations of traditional phase-aging methods and is applicable to both paleodemography and forensic casework. The present study contributes to TA-research by validating TA for multiple, differently experienced observers using a collection of modern forensic skeletal cases. Materials and methods Five researchers independently applied TA to a random sample of 58 documented individuals from the William M. Bass Forensic Skeletal Collection, for whom knowledge of chronological age was withheld. Resulting scores were input into the ADBOU software and maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were produced using the forensic prior. Krippendorff's alpha was used to evaluate interrater reliability and agreement. Inaccuracy and bias were measured to gauge the magnitude and direction of difference between estimated ages and chronological ages among the five observers. Results The majority of traits had moderate to excellent agreement among observers (≥0.6). The superior surface morphology had the least congruence (0.4), while the ventral symphyseal margin had the most (0.9) among scores. Inaccuracy was the lowest for individuals younger than 30 and the greatest for individuals over 60. Consistent over-estimation of individuals younger than 30 and under-estimation of individuals over 40 years old occurred. Individuals in their 30s showed a mixed pattern of under- and over-estimation among observers. Discussion These results support the use of the TA method by researchers of varying experience levels. Further, they validate its use on forensic cases, given the low error overall.
