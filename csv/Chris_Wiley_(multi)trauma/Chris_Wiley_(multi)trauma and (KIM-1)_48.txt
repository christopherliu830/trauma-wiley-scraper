AB  - Abstract Aims to describe additional cases of nodular and polypoid sclerosing lesions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that are associated with numerous IgG4 plasma cells, review the pertinent literature to ascertain the relationship with systemic IgG4-related disease and provide a reporting framework for such lesions. Methods and results 5 new cases of sclerosing polyps or nodules were collected over a 10-year period occurring in 4 females and 1 male ranging in age from 32 to 56 years (mean: 41.6 years). Patients were asymptomatic or had epigastric pain and 1 had rectal bleeding. None had autoimmune or other obvious IgG4-related disease and serum IgG4 levels were normal. All were solitary nodules in the stomach (2 cases), ileum, caecum and rectum. Four lesions were submucosal and 1 was subserosal, well circumscribed, composed of hyalinized, keloidal fibrous tissue with lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Obliterative phlebitis was not seen. Lineage-specific immunomarkers were negative. In excess of 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high power field were seen and the IgG4:IgG ratios were greater than 0.4. Conclusions very few IgG4-related lesions in the tubular GIT are associated with disease at other sites and/or elevated serum IgG4. The majority may represent a lesion in the spectrum of IgG4-related disease. The use of the term, ?IgG4-nodule or polyp with probable histological features of IgG4-related disease? is advocated for nodular and/or polypoid lesions in the GIT with 10 or more igG4-positive plasma cells in a high power field/IgG:IgG4 ratio greater than 0.4.

AB  - Abstract This longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of prosocial behavior and related predictors among adolescents exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. At 6-, 18-, and 30-months postearthquake, we followed a sample of 1,573 adolescents. Self-report measures were used to assess earthquake exposure, postearthquake negative life events, prosocial behavior, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, social support, and coping style. Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling and multinomial logistic regressions. Four trajectories of postearthquake prosocial behavior were identified in the sample: (a) high/enhancing (35.0%), (b) high/stable (29.4%), (c) low/declining (33.6%), and (d) low/steeply declining (2.0%). Female gender, more social support, and greater positive coping were significant factors related to a higher probability of developing the high/enhancing trajectory. These findings may be helpful for us to identify adolescents with poor prosocial behavior after exposure to earthquakes so as to provide them with appropriate intervention.

AB  - Through an ongoing project, we have been reviewing the literature addressing school planning for climate change related ecological disruptions and disasters, particularly for the special needs of children with disabilities. We have also examined related state education department policies from across Australia. Our preliminary results suggest scant attention has been paid either by researchers or educational policy makers to the needs of children with disabilities and their caregivers in response to climate change induced disaster scenarios. Here, we advocate for better preparedness among institutions serving children with disabilities to support their health in the context of climate change, and describe how health promotion principles can be brought to bear on this issue. So what? We believe health promotion principles and health promotion professionals can (and should) play a pivotal role in preparing educational and other institutions to improve the health and safety of this large group of vulnerable children as they face the effects of climate change. Additional multidisciplinary research exploring school-based disaster planning specific to children with disabilities is needed.

AB  - An 11-year-old, female, spayed cocker spaniel was presented with dysphonia caused by a solitary laryngeal mass. Excisional biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made on the basis of histological examination. Further investigations showed no signs of systemic involvement. Coarse fractionated radiation therapy failed to control the tumour. Therapy was successfully instituted with a conventional combination chemotherapy protocol over a period of 14 months. The dog remains disease free 30 months after diagnosis. Most solitary, extramedullary plasmacytomas in dogs arise in the gastrointestinal tract, with fewer reports in other sites. The larynx is an uncommon sight of involvement in any species, and to the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this tumour type in the canine larynx. In contrast to the therapeutic benefits reported in humans, the combination of surgery and radiation therapy was unsuccessful in this case, although sustained remission was gained following chemotherapy.

AB  - QUOKKA is a 40?m pinhole small-angle neutron scattering instrument in routine user operation at the OPAL research reactor at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Operating with a neutron velocity selector enabling variable wavelength, QUOKKA has an adjustable collimation system providing source?sample distances of up to 20?m. Following the large-area sample position, a two-dimensional 1?m2 position-sensitive detector measures neutrons scattered from the sample over a secondary flight path of up to 20?m. Also offering incident beam polarization and analysis capability as well as lens focusing optics, QUOKKA has been designed as a general purpose SANS instrument to conduct research across a broad range of scientific disciplines, from structural biology to magnetism. As it has recently generated its first 100 publications through serving the needs of the domestic and international user communities, it is timely to detail a description of its as-built design, performance and operation as well as its scientific highlights. Scientific examples presented here reflect the Australian context, as do the industrial applications, many combined with innovative and unique sample environments.

AB  - Objectives The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) has been speculated to play an important role in complex processes that allow emotional factors to influence human cognition. Accumulating evidence from human neuroimaging studies, in conjunction with studies of patients with lesions and animal models, shed light on the role of the vlPFC in emotion regulation (ER). This review aims to discuss and integrate recent findings related to vlPFC's role in ER in the context of aging, drawing from diverse sources, and suggest future directions for research utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Methods/Design We summarize findings from the existing literature investigating the neural basis of frontal-lobe mediated ER and then highlight major findings from recent studies directly comparing healthy younger and older adult groups. We conclude by pointing to unaddressed questions worth pursuing in future research. Results and Discussion We propose future research directions utilizing TMS to answer key unaddressed questions. Moreover, we discuss the potential advantages, challenges, and limitations of using TMS as a complement to the existing neuroimaging methods in ER.

AB  - Abstract Diabetic hyperglycemia can lead to stress-related cellular apoptosis of cardiac tissue. However, the mechanism by which hyperglycemia inflicts this damage on the structure and function of the heart is unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between proteome alterations, mitochondrial function, and major biochemical and electrophysiological changes affecting cardiac performance during simulated short-term hyperglycemia. Two-dimensional comparative proteomics analysis of rat hearts perfused with glucose at high (30?mM) or control (5.5?mM) levels revealed that glucose loading alters cardiomyocyte proteomes. It increased expression levels of initial enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and of enzymes of fatty acid ?-oxidation, with consequent up-regulation of enzymes of mitochondrial electron transport. It also markedly decreased expression of enzymes of glycolysis and the final steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose loading increased the rate of Bax-independent apoptosis. High glucose increased the duration of the action potential and elevated level of intracellular cytoplasmic calcium. Surprisingly, glucose loading did not influence levels of nitric oxide or mitochondrial superoxide in isolated cardiomyocytes. In summary, short-term simulated hyperglycemia attenuated expression of many anti-apoptotic proteins. This effect was apparently mediated via alterations in multiple biochemical pathways that collectively increased apoptotic susceptibility.

AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - Abstract Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing ?cultures of support? for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research.

AB  - Abstract Aim To investigate the potential application of concentrated growth factor (CGF) to promote pulp regeneration within immature teeth. Methodology Concentrated growth factor clots produced from peripheral blood samples were investigated histologically by haematoxylin?eosin (HE) staining and evaluated morphologically by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The cytokines were extracted from the CGF, and representative cytokines were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The biological effects of the CGF on human stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) were then investigated and quantified, including cell proliferation, cell migration, mineralized nodule formation, and the gene expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and dentine matrix protein (DMP)-1. The results were analysed statistically using one-way analysis of variance (anova). Results Concentrated growth factor had a complex three-dimensional structure with a high density of platelets and nucleated cells. Representative growth factors including PDGF-BB, IGF-1, TGF-?1, bFGF and VEGF were detected. The growth rate and migratory cell numbers of the CGF groups were significantly greater than those in the control groups (P < 0.05). The mineralization areas in the CGF groups were significantly larger than those in the control groups (P < 0.05). The expression levels of ALP, DSPP and DMP-1 were significantly up-regulated after induction by CGF (P < 0.05). Conclusions Concentrated growth factor promoted the proliferation, migration and differentiation of SCAPs and could be a promising biomaterial applied in regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Objectives.? The phenomenon of inflammatory masses at the tips of intrathecal drug administration catheters was the subject of a recent case-compilation report and a number of animal studies. We sought to synthesize current clinical and preclinical data to formulate hypotheses about the etiology of catheter-tip masses. Methods.? We reviewed the published human clinical data, new unpublished clinical data, and the results of preclinical studies in two mammalian species, beagle dogs and sheep. Results. Intrathecal morphine sulfate studies in beagle dogs suggested that the observed inflammatory reaction was dose or concentration dependent. Masses occurred after 28 days in one of three animals at 1.5 mg/day (the lowest morphine dose tested); in two of three animals at 3 and 9 mg/day; and in three of three animals at 12 mg/day. The addition of various amounts of clonidine to 1.5 mg/day of morphine revealed no mass formation when the clonidine dose was>0.25 mg/day. A morphine sulfate study that was performed in sheep using a commercially marketed drug administration system found catheter tip masses in two of three animals that received 12 or 18 mg/day of morphine, the highest doses tested. Human cases have occurred only in pain patients who received intrathecal opioids, alone or mixed with other drugs, or in patients who received investigational agents (such as superoxide dismutase or the partial ??opioid-receptor agonist, tramadol) that were not labeled for long-term intrathecal use. Discussion/Conclusions. The evidence suggests that the long-term administration of opioids, especially morphine, caused the masses that were observed in humans and in two species of animals. A relationship probably exists between mass formation and intrathecal morphine doses or concentration. Other factors remain to be investigated.

AB  - Abstract Cognitively impaired or mentally ill older individuals placed in community accommodation specifically for the elderly mentally infirm (EMI) may not always be viewed as successfully placed by residence staff. This sometimes necessitates a move to alternative care. This article examines several factors that may influence care staff views about current success of residents' placement and finds that affective behavioural factors correlate more strongly with this than either cognitive function as measured by Mini Mental State or behaviour reflected in Crichton Rating Scale scores.
