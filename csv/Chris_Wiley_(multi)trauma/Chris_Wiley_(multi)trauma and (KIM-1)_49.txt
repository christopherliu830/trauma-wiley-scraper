AB  - Abstract Cognitively impaired or mentally ill older individuals placed in community accommodation specifically for the elderly mentally infirm (EMI) may not always be viewed as successfully placed by residence staff. This sometimes necessitates a move to alternative care. This article examines several factors that may influence care staff views about current success of residents' placement and finds that affective behavioural factors correlate more strongly with this than either cognitive function as measured by Mini Mental State or behaviour reflected in Crichton Rating Scale scores.

AB  - Abstract Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are endogenous bioactive lipids that participate in the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. These processes are each critical for successful embryogenesis, raising the possibility that lysophospholipid signaling may contribute to normal animal development. In fact, recent studies in developmental model systems have established that S1P and LPA are necessary for diverse developmental programs including those required for morphogenesis of vertebrate reproductive, cardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), as well as the establishment of maternal-fetal circulation and the immune system. Genetic, morphological, and biochemical characterization of developmental model systems offer powerful approaches to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of lysophospholipid signaling and its contributions to animal development and postnatal physiology. In this review, the routes of S1P and LPA metabolism and our current understanding of lysophospholipid-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells will be summarized. The evidence implicating lysophospholipid signaling in the development of specific vertebrate systems will then be reviewed, with an emphasis on signals mediated through G protein-coupled receptors of the Edg family. Lastly, recent insights derived from the study of simple metazoan models and implications regarding lysophospholipid signaling in organisms in which Edg receptors are not conserved will be explored. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A novel, non-invasive study of goggles, flight helmets, airplane windows, and canopies in Smithsonian collections is the first known large-scale technical survey of historic aviation plastics and leverages the world's largest air and space collection as evidence of the materials and technologies used to create transparent plastic objects in the early-20th century. Transparent windows in these artifacts were analyzed with Fourier transform and portable dispersive Raman spectrometers to identify polymers and plasticizers present. The study demonstrates the potential of Raman spectroscopy to objectively and non-destructively measure historic plastic compositions, including formulations that have become obsolete. Data was interpreted in combination with archival research of historical documents to identify window materials including glass, laminated safety glass, and sheets of plasticized cellulose nitrate, plasticized cellulose acetate, and poly(methyl methacrylate). Results are contextualized into a coherent history of the role transparent plastics played in enclosing airplane cockpits. Published 2014.

AB  - ABSTRACT Well documented limitations associated with primary chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering applications have led to increased interest in the use of multi-potent stem/progenitor cells. The objective of this study was to firstly investigate if infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (FPSCs) could be used to engineer cartilage-like tissues through a self-assembly (SA) process, and secondly to compare the properties of such grafts to those engineered by agarose hydrogel encapsulation (AE). Self-assembled cartilaginous tissues were first engineered by geometrically confining FPSCs on tissue culture plastic, and then either continuously or transiently supplementing these constructs with transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF-?3). Transient supplementation with TGF-?3 (for the first 21 days of culture) enhanced the development of self-assembled grafts, with sGAG accumulation reaching levels of 8.4?±?1.5% w/w after 6 weeks of culture. While overall levels of matrix synthesis were higher with AE compared to SA, when normalized to tissue wet weight, ECM accumulation was significantly greater in the lighter SA constructs. A potential drawback with the SA approach on tissue culture plastic was that it often led to the development of contracted, geometrically inconsistent tissues. We therefore next explored if SA on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) transwell membranes would lead to the development of more morphologically stable and homogenous tissues. At high seeding densities, SA on such transwell membranes led to the formation of geometrically uniform constructs that underwent minimal contraction during culture. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the potential of SA using FPSCs for cartilage tissue engineering, with grafts attaining relatively high levels of sGAG content within clinically relevant timeframes. Such an approach is easily scalable and may lend itself to treating large, full thickness cartilage defects. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 1686?1698. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine patient characteristics and outcomes in children with undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) using a multi-institutional database. Summary Background Data UESL is a rare disease (incidence is one per million). Therefore, the current literature is mostly limited to small case series. Methods The National Cancer Database was queried for primary UESL diagnosed between 1998 and 2012. Results A total of 103 patients (<18 years) were identified. The 5-year overall survival of the entire group was 86%. The best outcomes were seen in children who had tumors smaller than 15 cm and were able to undergo surgical resection with or without chemotherapy. Margin status did not appear to significantly affect survival. The most common type of resection was hemihepatectomy (37%), followed by sectionectomy (10%) and trisectionectomy (10%). Orthotopic liver transplant was performed in 10 children, all of whom survived to 5 years. Conclusion Surgical resection with or without chemotherapy should be the mainstay of treatment in children with UESL, and is associated with very favorable outcomes. Negative surgical margins were not associated with improved survival. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be a viable method of attaining local control in tumors, which would otherwise be unresectable.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of computed tomography (CT) based radiomic features of primary tumors to predict pathological nodal involvement in clinically node-negative (N0) peripheral lung adenocarcinomas. Methods A total of 187 patients with clinical N0 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas who underwent preoperative CT scan and subsequently received systematic lymph node dissection were retrospectively reviewed. 219 quantitative 3D radiomic features of primary lung tumor were extracted; meanwhile, nine radiological semantic features were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to explore the role of these features in predicting pathological nodal involvement. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were compared between multivariate logistic regression models. Results A total of 153 patients had pathological N0 status and 34 had pathological lymph node metastasis. On univariate analysis, fissure attachment and 17 radiomic features were significantly associated with pathological nodal involvement. Multivariate analysis revealed that semantic features of pleural retraction (P = 0.048) and fissure attachment (P = 0.023) were significant predictors of pathological nodal involvement (AUC = 0.659); and the radiomic feature F185 (Histogram SD Layer 1) (P = 0.0001) was an independent prognostic factor of pathological nodal involvement (AUC = 0.73). A logistic regression model produced from combining radiomic feature and semantic feature showed the highest AUC of 0.758 (95% CI: 0.685?0.831), and the AUC value computed by fivefold cross-validation method was 0.737 (95% CI: 0.73?0.744). Conclusions Features derived on primary lung tumor described by semantic and radiomic could provide information of pathological nodal involvement in clinical N0 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Abstract Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies can leverage cone beam computed tomography data for production of objects used in surgical and nonsurgical endodontics and in educational settings. The aim of this article was to review all current applications of 3D printing in endodontics and to speculate upon future directions for research and clinical use within the specialty. A literature search of PubMed, Ovid and Scopus was conducted using the following terms: stereolithography, 3D printing, computer aided rapid prototyping, surgical guide, guided endodontic surgery, guided endodontic access, additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, autotransplantation rapid prototyping, CAD, CAM. Inclusion criteria were articles in the English language documenting endodontic applications of 3D printing. Fifty-one articles met inclusion criteria and were utilized. The endodontic literature on 3D printing is generally limited to case reports and pre-clinical studies. Documented solutions to endodontic challenges include: guided access with pulp canal obliteration, applications in autotransplantation, pre-surgical planning and educational modelling and accurate location of osteotomy perforation sites. Acquisition of technical expertise and equipment within endodontic practices present formidable obstacles to widespread deployment within the endodontic specialty. As knowledge advances, endodontic postgraduate programmes should consider implementing 3D printing into their curriculums. Future research directions should include clinical outcomes assessments of treatments employing 3D printed objects.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim To compare the effectiveness of two-ridge preservation treatments. Materials and Methods Forty subjects with extraction sockets exhibiting substantial buccal dehiscences were enrolled and randomized across 10 standardized centres. Treatments were demineralized allograft plus reconstituted and cross-linked collagen membrane (DFDBA + RECXC) or deproteinized bovine bone mineral with collagen plus native, bilayer collagen membrane (DBBMC + NBCM). Socket dimensions were recorded at baseline and 6 months. Wound closure and soft tissue inflammation were followed post-operatively, and biopsies were retrieved for histomorphometric analysis at 6 months. Results Primary endpoint: at 6 months, extraction socket horizontal measures were significantly greater for DBBMC + NBCM (average 1.76 mm greater, p = 0.0256). Secondary and Exploratory endpoints: (1) lingual and buccal vertical bone changes were not significantly different between the two treatment modalities, (2) histomorphometric % new bone and % new bone + graft were not significantly different, but significantly more graft remnants remained for DBBMC; (3) at 1 month, incision line gaps were significantly greater and more incision lines remained open for DFDBA + RECXC; (4) higher inflammation at 1 week tended to correlate with lower ridge preservation results; and (5) deeper socket morphologies with thinner bony walls correlated with better ridge preservation. Thirty-seven of 40 sites had sufficient ridge dimension for implant placement at 6 months; the remainder were DFDBA + RECXC sites. Conclusion DBBMC + NBCM provided better soft tissue healing and ridge preservation for implant placement. Deeper extraction sockets with higher and more intact bony walls responded more favourably to ridge preservation therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The regrowth of amputated appendage extremities and the distal tips of digits represent models of tissue regeneration in multiple vertebrate taxa. In humans, digit tip injuries, including traumatic amputation and crush injuries, are among the most common type of injury to the human hand. Despite clinical reports demonstrating natural regeneration of appendages in lower vertebrates and human digits, current treatment options are suboptimal, and are complicated by the anatomical complexities and functions of the different tissues within the digits. Results: In light of these challenges, we focus on recent advancements in understanding appendage regeneration from model organisms. We pay special attention to the cellular programs underlying appendage regeneration, where cumulative data from salamanders, fish, frogs, and mice indicate that regeneration occurs by the actions of lineage-restricted precursors. We focus on pathologic states and the interdependency that exists, in both humans and animal models, between the nail organ and the peripheral nerves for successful regeneration. Conclusions: The increased understanding of regeneration in animal models may open new opportunities for basic and translational research aimed at understanding the mechanisms that support limb regeneration, as well as amelioration of limb abnormalities and pathologies.

AB  - Abstract The advent of antibiotics revolutionized the medical care resulting in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. However, excessive use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance and indeed, the incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is considered as a major disadvantage in the medication strategy, which led the scholar?s attention toward innovative antibiotic sources in recent years. Medicinal plants contained a variety of secondary metabolites with a wide range of therapeutic potential against the resistant microbes. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the antibacterial potential of traditional herbal medicine against bacterial infections. About more than 200 Published research articles reporting the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against drug resistant microbial infections were searched using different databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) etc. with various keywords like Medicinal plants having antibacterial activities, antimicrobial potentials, phytotherapy of bacterial infection etc., and articles were selected related to the efficacious herbs easily available to local population addressing common pathogens. Various plants such as Artocarpus communis, Rheum emodi, Gentiana lutea L., Cassia fistula L., Rosemarinus officinalis, Argemone maxicana L, Hydrastis canadensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Cymbopogon citrates, Carica papaya, Euphorbia hirta etc. were found to have significant antibacterial activities. Although, herbal preparations have promising potential in the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infection, but still, more research is required to isolate phytoconstituents, their mechanism of action as well as to find their impacts on human body.

AB  - Abstract Aims To explore tobacco dependence (TD) diagnosis and treatment utilization, and identify predictors of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among veterans with substance use disorders (SUDs) enrolled in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) SUD residential treatment programs (SRTPs). Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting VHA SRTPs, which treat veterans with SUD and multiple severe psychosocial deficits, from 1 October 2009 to 31 September 2010. Participants Identified tobacco users among veterans with SUD treated in SRTPs during fiscal year 2010 (FY10). Measurements Rates of documented TD diagnosis and pharmacotherapy were assessed nationally, regionally and by facility. Patient-level predictors of NRT were examined using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with facility as a random effect. Findings A total of 12?097 of the 15?320 veterans in SRTPs in FY10 (79%) were identified as probable tobacco users. Among these, 33% had a documented TD diagnosis, 34% were treated with pharmacotherapy and only 11% were both diagnosed and treated for TD while in SRTP. NRT was more common among patients with a current documented TD diagnosis, recent history of TD treatment, comorbid mental health disorder, age 55 years or younger and identified as white. Conclusions Most veterans in Veterans Health Administration substance use disorders residential treatment programs appear to use tobacco, yet only one in 10 receives a documented ICD-9 TD diagnosis and pharmacotherapy while in a substance use disorders residential treatment program.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of 3D bioprinting technology is to design and create functional 3D tissues or organs in situ for in vivo applications. 3D cell-printing, or additive biomanufacturing, allows the selection of biomaterials and cells (bioink), and the fabrication of cell-laden structures in high resolution. 3D cell-printed structures have also been used for applications such as research models, drug delivery and discovery, and toxicology. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to fabricate tissues and organs by using various 3D printing techniques. However, challenges such as vascularization are yet to be solved. This article reviews the most commonly used 3D cell-printing techniques with their advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, up-to-date achievements of 3D bioprinting in in vivo applications are introduced, and prospects for the future of 3D cell-printing technology are discussed. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
