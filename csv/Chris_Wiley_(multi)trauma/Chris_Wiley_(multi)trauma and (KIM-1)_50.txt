AB  - Summary Objective Our aim was to explore the association between plasma cytokines and febrile status epilepticus (FSE) in children, as well as their potential as biomarkers of acute hippocampal injury. Methods Analysis was performed on residual samples of children with FSE (n = 33) as part of the Consequences of Prolonged Febrile Seizures in Childhood study (FEBSTAT) and compared to children with fever (n = 17). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained as part of FEBSTAT within 72 h of FSE. Cytokine levels and ratios of antiinflammatory versus proinflammatory cytokines in children with and without hippocampal T2 hyperintensity were assessed as biomarkers of acute hippocampal injury after FSE. Results Levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were significantly elevated after FSE in comparison to controls. IL-1? levels trended higher and IL-1RA trended lower following FSE, but did not reach statistical significance. Children with FSE were found to have significantly lower ratios of IL-1RA/IL-1? and IL-1RA/IL-8. Specific levels of any one individual cytokine were not associated with FSE. However, lower ratios of IL-1RA/IL-1?, IL-1RA/1L-6, and IL-1RA/ IL-8 were all associated with FSE. IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly higher and ratios of IL-1RA/IL-6 and IL-1RA/IL-8 were significantly lower in children with T2 hippocampal hyperintensity on MRI after FSE in comparison to those without hippocampal signal abnormalities. Neither individual cytokine levels nor ratios of IL-1RA/IL-1? or IL-1RA/IL-8 were predictive of MRI changes. However, a lower ratio of IL-1RA/IL-6 was strongly predictive (odds ratio [OR] 21.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17?393) of hippocampal T2 hyperintensity after FSE. Significance Our data support involvement of the IL-1 cytokine system, IL-6, and IL-8 in FSE in children. The identification of the IL-1RA/IL-6 ratio as a potential biomarker of acute hippocampal injury following FSE is the most significant finding. If replicated in another study, the IL-1RA/IL-6 ratio could represent a serologic biomarker that offers rapid identification of patients at risk for ultimately developing mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).

AB  - Abstract Objective To identify the clustering of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that best characterize child welfare?involved children with known complex health concerns. Data Source Multi-informant data were obtained from Wave I of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II). Study Design This study used a cross-sectional design and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses. Data Collection Data were collected from families with children, aged birth to 17, investigated for child maltreatment and their child protective services caseworkers, including demographic characteristics of the children, their histories of adversity, and a wide range of health concerns. Principal Findings Results indicate that for children between the ages of six and 17, experiences of physical abuse alone, as well as experiences of physical abuse combined with having a caregiver with mental illness, are most strongly associated with complex health concerns. For children aged 2-5 years, results suggest that caregiver mental illness is a key adverse experience associated with complex health concerns. Conclusions Identifying specific combinations of ACEs may be a critical next step for child- and youth-serving agencies to allow providers to better calculate risk of health problems among children exposed to adversity.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the special applications, which are advanced principles for maximising the full potential of digital dental photography. These include taking additional images for elucidating certain features, or analysing images for effective communicating with patients and fellow colleagues. Whilst the essential dental portfolio, essential portrait portfolio and optional images are sufficient for most modalities, some procedures require specific types of imagery for multi-diagnosis and facilitating collaborative care. In order to demonstrate detailed analysis of hard and soft tissues, the case study shows replacement of defective composite restorations in the maxillary sextant. The photographic set-up uses a single compact flash as the key light on one side, which alternates from the right to left with a silver reflector on the opposite side. Treatment sequencing involves documenting step-by-step clinical or laboratory techniques. Also, a sequence of images can demonstrate the use of particular instruments or materials for a restorative or surgical modality.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To examine plaque accumulation on silk and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sutures at different time intervals. Methodology? Twenty-one male albino rabbits received sutures under general and local anaesthesia. After 3, 5 and 7?days sutures were removed and processed for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The Friedman and the Wilcoxon tests were used to compare contamination on PVDF and silk suture materials at different time intervals. Results? At all time intervals, the whole surface of silk sutures was covered with a thick layer of bacterial plaque and debris. Microorganisms and blood cells on the surface and between the filaments of the silk suture material were observed. Light debris appeared around the knot area of PVDF sutures after 3?days. At 5 and 7?days, contamination could be seen in scattered areas along the suture material. The average contaminated area was smaller on PVDF suture materials, which were removed at 5 than at 7?days after insertion. At 3?days, PVDF sutures showed significantly less contamination than at 5 and 7?days (P?=?0.002). There were statistically significant differences between silk and PVDF sutures at 3, 5 and 7?days. Conclusion? SEM observation showed that PVDF sutures were contaminated less than silk sutures at 3, 5 and 7?days.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore the deliberation and enactment processes of nurses in relation to pain and other discomforts in the critically ill patients after the implementation of an analgosedation protocol. Background Nurses in intensive care units (ICU) face great challenges when managing pain and other discomforts and distinguishing between patients? needs for analgesics and sedatives. An analgosedation protocol favouring pain management, light sedation and early mobilization was implemented in a university hospital ICU in Norway in 2014. Changing sedation paradigms resulting in an increasing number of awake patients during critical illness is expected to affect nursing practice. Design Exploratory, single-unit study in a mixed adult ICU. Methods Data collection with participant observation and semi-structured interviews in sixteen clinical situations in 2014 and 2015. Thirteen experienced certified critical care nurses were included. Thematic content analysis was conducted. Results An overall theme ?Having the compass?drawing the map? emerged from the analysis. The protocol or strategy of analgosedation appeared to provide a direction for treatment and care, although requiring extensive interpretation of needs and individualization of care, often in challenging situations. The overall theme was abstracted from three themes: ?Interpreting a complex whole,? ?Balancing conflicting goals? and ?Experiencing strain from acting across ideals.? Conclusion Nurses seem to attend adequately to patient pain, but the approach to discomforts other than pain appears unsystematic and haphazard. More explicit goals of care and strategies to handle discomfort as distinct from pain are needed. More research is needed to identify effective comfort measures for ICU patients.

AB  - Summary Background Antifibrinolytic therapy significantly decreases blood loss and transfusion in pediatric cranial vault reconstructive surgery; however, concern regarding the side effects profile limits clinical use. Aims The aim was to utilize the Pediatric Craniofacial Surgery Perioperative Registry database to identify the safety profile of antifibrinolytic therapy for cranial vault reconstructive surgery by reporting the incidence of adverse events as they relate to exposure to tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid compared to no exposure to antifibrinolytics. Methods The database was queried for cases of open cranial vault reconstructive surgery. Less invasive procedures such as neuro-endoscopic and spring-mediated cranioplasties were excluded. The outcomes evaluated included any perioperative neurological adverse event including seizures or seizure-like movements and thromboembolic events. Results Thirty-one institutions reported a total of 1638 cases from 2010 to 2015. Total antifibrinolytic administration accounted for 59.5% (tranexamic acid, 36.1% and aminocaproic acid, 23.4%), with 40.5% not receiving any antifibrinolytic. The overall incidence of postoperative seizures or seizure-like movements was 0.6%. No significant difference was detected in the incidence of postoperative seizures between patients receiving tranexamic acid and those receiving aminocaproic acid [the odds ratio for seizures being 0.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.07?1.85) controlling for American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical class] nor in patients receiving antifibrinolytics compared to those not administered antifibrinolytics (the odds ratio for seizures being 1.02 (confidence interval 0.29?3.63) controlling for ASA physical class). One complicated patient in the antifibrinolytic group with a femoral venous catheter had a postoperative deep venous thrombosis. Conclusions This is the first report of an incidence of postoperative seizures of 0.6% in pediatric cranial vault reconstructive surgery. There was no significant difference in postoperative seizures or seizure-like events in those patients who received the tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid vs those that did not. This report provides evidence of the safety profile of antifibrinolytic in children having noncardiac major surgery. Caution should prevail however in using antifibrinolytic in high-risk patients. Antifibrinolytic dosage regimes should be based on pharmacokinetic data avoiding high doses.

AB  - Abstract Background Distant metastases (DMs) increase in patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We evaluated the ability of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to detect DMs in these patients. Method We evaluated 82 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed recurrent HNSCC. Patients with previous DMs were excluded. All patients received whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for restaging of recurrent HNSCC and follow-up after salvage surgery. Any suspected DMs were confirmed by histology and further imaging workups. The diagnostic ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT to detect DMs was assessed. Results Of the 82 patients, 14 (17%) had DMs. The lung (93%) and bone (43%) were the most frequent metastatic sites. 18F-FDG PET/CT correctly diagnosed the presence of DMs in 12 of 14 patients and their absence in 57 of 68 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting DMs were 86% (95% confidence interval, 57?98%), 84% (72?91%), 84% (74?91%), 52% (30?73%), and 97% (88?99%), respectively. Conclusions 18F-FDG PET/CT may be useful in the detection of DMs prior to and after salvage surgery in the high-risk patients with recurrent HNSCC. J. Surg.

AB  - Abstract To assess relationships between parental socialization of emotion and children's coping following an intensely emotional event, parents' beliefs and behaviours regarding emotion and children's coping strategies were investigated after a set of terrorist attacks. Parents (n=51) filled out the Parents' Beliefs about Negative Emotions questionnaire and were interviewed within two weeks of the attacks. Their elementary and middle school-aged children were interviewed eight weeks later. First, parents' beliefs were related to two kinds of parental behaviours. Parents' beliefs about both the value of and the danger of children's emotions were positively related to their discussion with their children. Parents' belief about children's emotions as dangerous was also negatively related to parents' expressiveness with their children. Second, parents' beliefs were related to five kinds of coping strategies reported by their children. Parents' belief about children's emotions as valuable predicted children's problem-solving, emotion-oriented, and support-seeking coping following the terrorist attacks. Parents' belief about children's emotions as dangerous predicted children's avoidance and distraction coping following the attacks. Parents' beliefs about the importance of children's emotions may foster a family atmosphere that facilitates children's coping with intensely emotional events. Results support differentiated, multi-faceted analysis of the broader construct of parental beliefs. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract What motivates minority group members to support other minorities, rather than compete for resources? We tested whether inclusive victim consciousness ?i.e., perceived similarities between the ingroup's and outgroups? collective victimization?predicts support for other minority groups; and whether personal and family experiences of group-based victimization moderate these effects. Study 1 was conducted among members of historically oppressed groups in India. As hypothesized, inclusive victim consciousness predicted support for refugees. Personal experiences of group-based victimization moderated this effect. Conceptually replicating these findings, in Study 2 (among Vietnamese Americans, mostly second-generation immigrants) inclusive victim consciousness predicted less hostility toward other refugees and immigrants, and greater perceived responsibility to help victims of collective violence. This effect was moderated by family experiences of victimization.

AB  - A child's adjustment to wartime stress is reliant not only on individual responses and qualities, but very significantly on the availability of support that they may receive from their parent or caregivers and quality of relationships. Strengthening parental support has the potential to be valuable. A pilot two-arm randomised controlled trial investigated the feasibility of delivering and evaluating the ?Caring for Children Through Conflict and Displacement? intervention with caregivers in the West Bank. Feasibility to recruit and train non-specialist staff on-the-ground to screen families for eligibility, collect outcome data, deliver the intervention and to recruit and retain families in the study were examined. Research staff and intervention facilitators were successfully appointed in the field, screened participants and delivered the intervention to 120 caregivers, collecting outcome measures pre-and post-delivery. All families completed the outcome measures, with very little missing data. This indicated that the intervention can be delivered feasibly and evaluated with families in this humanitarian context. Preliminary outcome data showed promise that the intervention may have the potential to both improve family functioning and reduce children's problem behaviour. Implications of family-focused initiatives, particularly within a conflict/post-conflict context for the prevention of several negative health and social outcomes directions, are discussed.

AB  - Summary This study reports our experience using deceased donor liver grafts from HBsAg-positive donors. We performed eight cases of liver transplantation (LT) using grafts from deceased HBsAg-positive donors between November 2005 and October 2010. The median age of donors was 48 years (range: 26?64). HBV DNA in the serum of donors ranged from 44 to 395 IU/ml, but HBeAg in all donors was negative. Preoperative laboratory and liver biopsy samples revealed the absence of definitive cirrhotic features and hepatitis. All recipients showed HBsAg positive preoperatively except one patient with HBsAg(?) status post previous LT for HBV related liver cirrhosis. The median age was 60 years (range: 46?76) at LT. Post-LT antiviral management consisted of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogues. The median follow-up period was 25.5 months (range: 14?82). Of eight recipients, two recipients experienced serum HBsAg and HBV DNA disappearance postoperatively. Three recipients died of HBV-unrelated causes. The remaining five recipients were stable with normal liver function and no marked pathologic changes on follow-up biopsies. This experience shows that LT using grafts from deceased HBsAg-positive donors is feasible, and may represent a valuable expansion of the pool of organ donors with appropriate antiviral management and monitoring.

AB  - This is the author's third revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 250 new references from 135 different journals. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by the concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Background:? Despite evidence indicating high morbidity associated with pediatric bipolar disorder (BP), little is known about the prevalence and clinical correlates of suicidal behavior among this population. Objective:? To investigate the prevalence of suicidal behavior among children and adolescents with BP, and to compare subjects with a history of suicide attempt to those without on demographic, clinical, and familial risk factors. Methods:? Subjects were 405 children and adolescents aged 7?17?years, who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for BPI (n?=?236) or BPII (n?=?29), or operationalized criteria for BP not otherwise specified (BP NOS; n?=?140) via the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children. As part of a multi-site longitudinal study of pediatric BP (Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth), demographic, clinical, and family history variables were measured at intake via clinical interview with the subject and a parent/guardian. Results:? Nearly one-third of BP patients had a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Attempters, compared with non-attempters, were older, and more likely to have a lifetime history of mixed episodes, psychotic features, and BPI. Attempters were more likely to have a lifetime history of comorbid substance use disorder, panic disorder, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, family history of suicide attempt, history of hospitalization, and history of physical and/or sexual abuse. Multivariate analysis found that the following were the most robust set of predictors for suicide attempt: mixed episodes, psychosis, hospitalization, self-injurious behavior, panic disorder, and substance use disorder. Conclusions:? These findings indicate that children and adolescents with BP exhibit high rates of suicidal behavior, with more severe features of BP illness and comorbidity increasing the risk for suicide attempt. Multiple clinical factors emerged distinguishing suicide attempters from non-attempters. These clinical factors should be considered in both assessment and treatment of pediatric BP.
