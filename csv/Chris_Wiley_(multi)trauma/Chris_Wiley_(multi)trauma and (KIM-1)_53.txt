AB  - Acta Ophthalmol. 2010: 88: 700?704 Abstract. Purpose:? This case report describes serious postoperative complications and markedly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with the NewColorIris cosmetic implant. Methods:? We report an interventional case series of two patients who suffered multiple complications after NewColorIris implantation carried out in Panama. Assessment included visual acuity, photography, endothelial cell count and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) when possible. Results:? Both patients presented with endothelial cell loss, uveitis, pigment dispersion and elevated IOP. Anterior segment OCT demonstrated irregularities in the position and configuration of the implants within the anterior chamber with resultant areas of implant?iris and implant?endothelial contact. One patient had acute postoperative hyphaema that resolved with anterior chamber tissue plasminogen activator injection. Both patients required explantation OU, one eye has required trabeculectomy, and one eye with bullous keratopathy is being evaluated for Descemet?s stripping endothelial keratoplasty. Conclusions:? Implantation of the NewColorIris cosmetic implant can lead to serious complications including hyphaema, uncontrolled IOP, severe endothelial cell loss, bullous keratopathy and anterior uveitis. Explantation may lead to improvement, but permanent damage to the trabecular meshwork and corneal endothelium persists.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The purpose of the study was to assess patients' postoperative discomfort after implantations according to the All-on-4 concept with and without using Zygoma implants. Material and methods Three treatment groups were formed for this prospective study: All-on-4 rehabilitation in the maxilla (group 1, N = 25), All-on-4 rehabilitation in the maxilla using at least two Zygoma implants (group 2, N = 25), and All-on-4 rehabilitation in the mandible (group 3, N = 20). Principal outcome parameters were postoperative pain (100 mm VAS) and perceived swelling (100 mm VAS). Also, the use of analgesics was documented. Results The worst postoperative pain of 21.3 (SD 18.9) VAS was observed in group 2, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (mixed ANOVA p = .791). The postoperative total intake of painkillers was significantly higher in group 2 than in the other groups (p < .001). On postoperative day 28, the mean pain scores in all groups declined to values below 5 VAS. Postoperative perceived swelling in group 2 was significantly more severe than it was in group 1 and 3 (p < .001). Conclusions The use of Zygoma implants in All-on-4 surgical interventions had an essential effect on postoperative swelling, but less so on postoperative pain. The slightly increased, but statistically not significantly different postoperative pain in group 2 was compensated by an overall higher postoperative intake of painkillers compared to the other groups.

AB  - Summary Over-nutrition and its late consequences are a dominant theme in medicine today. In addition to the health hazards brought on by over-nutrition, the medical community has recently accumulated a roster of health benefits with obesity, grouped under ?obesity paradox.? Throughout the world and throughout history until the 20th century, under-nutrition was a dominant evolutionary force. Under-nutrition brings with it a mix of benefits and detriments that are opposite to and continuous with those of over-nutrition. This continuum yields J-shaped or U-shaped curves relating body mass index to mortality. The overweight have an elevated risk of dying in middle age of degenerative diseases while the underweight are at increased risk of premature death from infectious conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies, major concerns of nutritional science in the 20th century, are being neglected. This ?hidden hunger? is now surprisingly prevalent in all weight groups, even among the overweight. Because micronutrient replacement is safe, inexpensive, and predictably effective, it is now an exceptionally attractive target for therapy across the spectrum of weight and age. Nutrition-related conditions worthy of special attention from caregivers include excess vitamin A, excess vitamin D, and deficiency of magnesium.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Reduced port surgery has been attracting attention in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Although the use of SILS is becoming widespread, technical difficulty has delayed its adoption for laparoscopic liver resection. Recently, advances in laparoscopic liver resection have been made in tandem with advances in surgical skill and devices. The main driver in conventional laparoscopic liver resection's evolution to become less surgically invasive seems to be single-incision laparoscopic liver resection (SILLR). To date, most reports on SILLR have been single case reports or case series. Only a few cohort studies on conventional laparoscopic surgery and SILLR have been conducted. Recent reports have described the use of SILLR for well-localized lesions and solitary tumors located in the anterolateral segments of the liver or left liver lobe, but its application remains limited to partial resection and left lateral sectionectomy. The feasibility and safety of SILLR have been demonstrated, but additional work is needed for standardization of the procedure.

AB  - Abstract Objective Quadriceps strength (knee extensor torque) is an important correlate of physical function in individuals with hip osteoarthritis (OA). However, it remains unclear whether the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque in the early phase of muscle contraction (maximal rate of torque development [MRTD]) is also associated with physical function. The purpose of this study was to quantify the independent impact of quadriceps strength and quadriceps MRTD on self-report and physical performance measures of physical function in community-dwelling adults with hip OA. Methods Ninety-two adults with radiographically confirmed symptomatic hip OA (mean age 62 years) participated. Unilateral isometric quadriceps strength and MRTD were measured using a dynamometer. Self-report measure of physical function was assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, and physical performance was assessed by the timed stair and step tests. Results In the hierarchical regression models, high maximal quadriceps strength and high quadriceps MRTD uniquely covaried with high SF-36 physical function scores after accounting for demographic, anthropometric, and pain measures. For the timed stair test, all else being equal, in 2 participants with low but identical levels of quadriceps strength, the one with a higher MRTD had better stair-climbing function. For the step test, quadriceps MRTD was not associated with step test performance over and above that of quadriceps strength. Conclusion In individuals with hip OA, maximal quadriceps strength and quadriceps MRTD positively impact self-report and physical performance measures of physical function. These findings are of importance in developing intervention strategies, but they call for further study.

AB  - Abstract Knowledge about co-occurring personality disorders in drug users is important for planning therapy and prevention. The objective of this study was to assess whether the SCID-II (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R) Screen for antisocial personality disorder was feasible and acceptable in a population of opioid users. A qualitative study on veridicality and emotional quality in responses to SCID-II Screen was carried out by personal interview in a multifunctional addiction centre. The subjects were 10 outpatient participants (six female, four male) in methadone substitution treatment. The SCID-II Screen triggered a high level of emotions. Some questions were mainly interpreted from a victim's perspective, even though the intention was the perpetrator's view. Questions were seen as sex-biased. Provision of support to deal with potential emotional problems should be supplied. Potential revision should be considered to include the female perspective in the screen.

AB  - Abstract Bone fragility and loss are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the lack of effective therapeutic options means that treatment is more often palliative rather than curative. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is necessary to develop new therapies. Defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and chronic inflammation in bone are important components of the CFBD development. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) drive the regulation of bone turnover. To investigate their roles in CFBD, we evaluated the involvement of defective CFTR in their production level in CF primary human osteoblasts with and without inflammatory stimulation, in the presence or not of pharmacological correctors of the CFTR. No major difference in cell ultrastructure was noted between cultured CF and non-CF osteoblasts, but a delayed bone matrix mineralization was observed in CF osteoblasts. Strikingly, resting CF osteoblasts exhibited strong production of RANKL protein, which was highly localized at the cell membrane and was enhanced in TNF (TNF-α) or IL-17-stimulated conditions. Under TNF stimulation, a defective response in OPG production was observed in CF osteoblasts in contrast to the elevated OPG production of non-CF osteoblasts, leading to an elevated RANKL-to-OPG protein ratio in CF osteoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of CFTR chloride channel conductance in non-CF osteoblasts replicated both the decreased OPG production and the enhanced RANKL-to-OPG ratio. Interestingly, using CFTR correctors such as C18, we significantly reduced the production of RANKL by CF osteoblasts, in both resting and TNF-stimulated conditions. In conclusion, the overexpression of RANKL and high membranous RANKL localization in osteoblasts are related to defective CFTR, and may worsen bone resorption, leading to bone loss in patients with CF. Targeting osteoblasts with CFTR correctors may represent an effective strategy to treat CFBD. Copyright ? 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
