AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Background The economic impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks has rarely been studied. We examined the association between 9/11-related chronic health conditions with or without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and one important aspect of the economic impact, retirement, and job loss before age 60. Methods A total of 7,662 workers who participated in the World Trade Center Health Registry surveys were studied. Logistic regression models examined the association of 9/11-related health and labor force exit. Results Workers with chronic conditions were more likely to experience early retirement and job loss, and the association was stronger in the presence of PTSD comorbidity: the odds ratios for reporting early retirement or job loss were increased considerably when chronic conditions were comorbid with PTSD. Conclusions Disaster-related health burden directly impacts premature labor force exit and income. Future evaluation of disaster outcome should include its long-term impact on labor force. Am. J.

AB  - Harmful algae (HA) and their toxins present increasing obstacles to routine protein production in aquatic systems. Preventing, controlling, or mitigating harmful algal blooms (HAB) and cyanobacterial HAB (cyanoHAB) have become major foci for many geographic areas and systems of the world, from freshwater ponds to openocean fish cages, problems potentially exacerbated with continued anthropogenic loading and a changing climate selecting for some bloom-forming taxa. Worldwide, aquaculture production of aquatic food in inland waters exceeds that of marine waters, but use of the sea for fish and shellfish mariculture is rapidly increasing in many coastal oceans. Multi-step linear food webs have also been used, with fish, shellfish, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and abalone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can test fish tissue for toxin content, generally in response to reported human illnesses or to identify whether newly identified toxins or other compounds might pose health risks to consumers.

AB  - Objectives Over the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research regarding bipolar disorder (BD) among children and adolescents (ie, pediatric BD [PBD]). The primary purpose of this article is to distill the extant literature, dispel myths or exaggerated assertions in the field, and disseminate clinically relevant findings. Methods An international group of experts completed a selective review of the literature, emphasizing areas of consensus, identifying limitations and gaps in the literature, and highlighting future directions to mitigate these gaps. Results Substantial, and increasingly international, research has accumulated regarding the phenomenology, differential diagnosis, course, treatment, and neurobiology of PBD. Prior division around the role of irritability and of screening tools in diagnosis has largely abated. Gold-standard pharmacologic trials inform treatment of manic/mixed episodes, whereas fewer data address bipolar depression and maintenance/continuation treatment. Adjunctive psychosocial treatment provides a forum for psychoeducation and targets primarily depressive symptoms. Numerous neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies, and increasing peripheral biomarker studies, largely converge with prior findings from adults with BD. Conclusions As data have accumulated and controversy has dissipated, the field has moved past existential questions about PBD toward defining and pursuing pressing clinical and scientific priorities that remain. The overall body of evidence supports the position that perceptions about marked international (US vs elsewhere) and developmental (pediatric vs adult) differences have been overstated, although additional research on these topics is warranted. Traction toward improved outcomes will be supported by continued emphasis on pathophysiology and novel therapeutics.

AB  - ABSTRACT Online health infomediaries are emerging as a critical element in the healthcare sector to support and influence individuals? health and wellness decisions. The business success and effectiveness of health infomediaries depend on the active and sustained engagement of patients. Although the growth in the number of participants in an infomediary is expected to add value by increasing the diversity of information that is potentially exchanged, the infomediary cannot survive without the sustained engagement of existing users. The challenge is to understand the underlying processes at the operational workflow level of an infomediary that can lead to sustained engagement of patients. For an infomediary to increase engagement, it needs to know not only what motivates participants to join an infomediary but also what keeps them engaged in various stages of participation or transitions. In this study, we employ a Markov Chain modeling approach, along with an analysis of the user activities data, to understand the underlying mechanism of patient engagement along with several transition states in an online health infomediary. We tracked 127,610 members, with more than 1 million activities involved in an online health infomediary that supports cosmetic and reconstructive surgery patients over one year. Patients? decisions for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery are health and well-being choices that rely not only on patients? current situation but also on the knowledge and experience of others. This relevance of the health infomediary context is explored in this study. We sampled the activities of 32,505 active users? activities with data on more than 500,000 activities. We analyzed the dynamics of user behaviors by modeling longitudinal transition probabilities across different states of participation. Additional analyses and robustness checks, using text-mined data from the users? activities, are introduced to gain nuanced insights into user engagement. Our study provides several practical implications for the design and management of an online health infomediary.

AB  - Aims A meta-analysis was conducted of the prevalence rates of compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout to identify the factors influencing these rates. Background The extents of compassion fatigue and burnout adversely affect nursing efficiency. However, the reported prevalence rates vary considerably. Methods Data were acquired from electronic databases. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain pooled estimates of the prevalence rates of compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout and their respective instrumental scores. Meta-regression analyses were performed to identify factors influencing these rates. Results Data from 21 studies were used for the meta-analysis. The prevalence rates of compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout were 47.55%, 52.55% and 51.98%, respectively. The possession of Bachelor's or Master's degrees by the nurses was significantly inversely associated with the percent prevalence of compassion fatigue (coefficient: ?1.187) and burnout (coefficient: ?0.810). The compassion fatigue score was also significantly inversely associated with nursing status as registered or licensed practical nurse (coefficient: ?0.135). Conclusion In nursing, the prevalence rates of compassion fatigue and burnout are high. Better education and training may have a moderating effect on compassion fatigue and burnout and could improve the quality of life of nurses.

AB  - Psychiatry research has long experienced a stagnation stemming from a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of phenomenologically defined mental disorders. Recently, the application of computational neuroscience to psychiatry research has shown great promise in establishing a link between phenomenological and pathophysiological aspects of mental disorders, thereby recasting current nosology in more biologically meaningful dimensions. In this review, we highlight recent investigations into computational neuroscience that have undertaken either theory- or data-driven approaches to quantitatively delineate the mechanisms of mental disorders. The theory-driven approach, including reinforcement learning models, plays an integrative role in this process by enabling correspondence between behavior and disorder-specific alterations at multiple levels of brain organization, ranging from molecules to cells to circuits. Previous studies have explicated a plethora of defining symptoms of mental disorders, including anhedonia, inattention, and poor executive function. The data-driven approach, on the other hand, is an emerging field in computational neuroscience seeking to identify disorder-specific features among high-dimensional big data. Remarkably, various machine-learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data, and the extracted disorder-specific features have been used for automatic case?control classification. For many disorders, the reported accuracies have reached 90% or more. However, we note that rigorous tests on independent cohorts are critically required to translate this research into clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the utility of the disorder-specific features found by the data-driven approach to psychiatric therapies, including neurofeedback. Such developments will allow simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders using neuroimaging, thereby establishing ?theranostics? for the first time in clinical psychiatry.

AB  - Abstract Several attempts have been made to engineer a viable three-dimensional (3D) bone tissue equivalent using conventional tissue engineering strategies, but with limited clinical success. Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.

AB  - Use of photostimulation including low-level light emitting diode (LED) therapy has broadened greatly in recent years because it is compact, portable, and easy to use. Here, the effects of photostimulation by LED (610 nm) therapy on ischemic brain damage was investigated in mice in which treatment started after a stroke in a clinically relevant setting. The mice underwent LED therapy (20 min) twice a day for 3 days, commencing at 4 hours post-ischemia. LED therapy group generated a significantly smaller infarct size and improvements in neurological function based on neurologic test score. LED therapy profoundly reduced neuroinflammatory responses including neutrophil infiltration and microglia activation in the ischemic cortex. LED therapy also decreased cell death and attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome, in accordance with down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and IL-18 in the ischemic brain. Moreover, the mice with post-ischemic LED therapy showed suppressed TLR-2 levels, MAPK signaling and NF-kB activation. These findings suggest that by suppressing the inflammasome, LED therapy can attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and tissue damage following ischemic stroke. Therapeutic interventions targeting the inflammasome via photostimulation with LED may be a novel approach to ameliorate brain injury following ischemic stroke. Effect of post-ischemic low-level light emitting diode therapy (LED-T) on infarct reduction was mediated by inflammasome suppression.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, there has been increasing demand for personalized anatomy modelling for medical and industrial applications, such as ergonomics device development, clinical radiological exposure simulation, biomechanics analysis, and 3D animation character design. In this study, we constructed deformable torso phantoms that can be deformed to match the personal anatomy of Chinese male and female adults. The phantoms were created based on a training set of 79 trunk computed tomography (CT) images (41 males and 38 females) from normal Chinese subjects. Major torso organs were segmented from the CT images, and the statistical shape model (SSM) approach was used to learn the inter-subject anatomical variations. To match the personal anatomy, the phantoms were registered to individual body surface scans or medical images using the active shape model method. The constructed SSM demonstrated anatomical variations in body height, fat quantity, respiratory status, organ geometry, male muscle size, and female breast size. The masses of the deformed phantom organs were consistent with Chinese population organ mass ranges. To validate the performance of personal anatomy modelling, the phantoms were registered to the body surface scan and CT images. The registration accuracy measured from 22 test CT images showed a median Dice coefficient over 0.85, a median volume recovery coefficient (RCvlm) between 0.85 and 1.1, and a median averaged surface distance (ASD) < 1.5 mm. We hope these phantoms can serve as computational tools for personalized anatomy modelling for the research community.

AB  - Objectives Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to expand in nontraditional risk groups, and the prevalence of undiagnosed infection remains relatively high in the patient populations of urban emergency departments (EDs). Unfortunately, HIV testing in this setting remains uncommon. The objectives of this study were 1) to develop a physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing model, 2) to implement this model in a high-volume urban ED, and 3) to prospectively characterize the patients who were targeted by physicians for testing and determine the proportions who completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral; tested positive for HIV infection; and were successfully linked into medical and preventative care. Methods An interdisciplinary group of investigators developed a model for performing physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing in the ED. This model was then evaluated using a prospective cohort study design. Emergency physicians identified patients at risk for undiagnosed HIV infection using clinical judgment and consensus guidelines. Testing was performed by the hospital's central laboratory, and clinical social workers performed pretest and posttest counseling and provided appropriate medical and preventative care referrals, as defined by the model. Results Over the 30-month study period, 105,856 patients were evaluated in the ED. Of these, 681 (0.64%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60% to 0.69%) were identified by physicians and completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral. Of the 681 patients, 15 (2.2%; 95% CI = 1.2% to 3.6%) patients tested positive for HIV infection and 12 (80%; 95% CI = 52% to 96%) were successfully linked into care. Conclusions A physician-based diagnostic HIV testing model was developed, successfully implemented, and sustained in a high-volume, urban ED setting. While the use of this model successfully identified patients with undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED, the overall level of testing remained low. Innovative testing programs, such as nontargeted screening, more specific targeted screening, or alternative hybrid methods, are needed to more effectively identify undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED patient population.
