AB  - Abstract The desire for control of healthcare is a significant moderator of outcomes related to childbirth. Researchers have shown that a sense of control of healthcare during childbirth is strongly correlated with postpartum maternal well-being. The aims of this study were to examine (a) the psychometric characteristics of an instrument to assess women's desire for control of healthcare during childbirth, and (b) examine desire for control in relation to parity, medical complications of pregnancy, and women's choices of childbirth providers and setting. The study design was cross-sectional using two different samples totaling 385 pregnant women. In Sample 1, (n?=?193) we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to reduce the initial item pool. In Sample 2, (n?=?192) we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the final 12-item instrument and examined factors related to the desire for control. Results of the analysis in Sample 1 were supportive of a single-factor structure reflecting women's desire to influence the childbirth healthcare environment and decision-making. The final 12-item instrument had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha?=?0.93). CFA in Sample 2 was supportive of the single-factor structure with good model fit. The desire for control was directly correlated with an internal locus of control. Nulliparous women reported a lower desire for control compared with multiparous women. The desire for control among women with self-reported medical complications of pregnancy was comparable to that among women without pregnancy complications. The desire for control was a predictor of choosing midwives (vs. obstetricians), home or birth center (vs. hospitals), and professional labor support (e.g., doulas). Implications for future research on the impact of desire for control on maternal health outcomes are discussed.

AB  - Impaired illness awareness or not accepting that one has hypertension (HTN) may be an important predictor of treatment adherence and optimal blood pressure control. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of available instruments to evaluate HTN awareness, and subsequently present a novel scale that measures the core domains of subjective illness awareness in HTN. Based on the absence of any validated HTN specific measure identified through our review, the Blood Pressure Awareness and Insight Scale (BASIS) was developed (www.illnessawarenessscales.com). An online survey platform was used to collect data on 100 participants. BASIS showed good concurrent (r(98) = .65, P < 0.001) and discriminant validity, internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .75), and 1-month test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.77). BASIS is a comprehensive, easy-to-use instrument specifically designed to measure subjective HTN awareness. BASIS may be used in research studies and clinical practice to assess the impact of HTN awareness on treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of multi-ingredient sacha inchi microemulsion (SIME) eye drops designed to target (1) tear film instability, (2) tear hyperosmolarity, and (3) ocular surface damage and inflammation in moderate or severe dry eye. Methods This randomized, quadruple-masked, active-controlled parallel study in 64 adult patients comprised three parts. Part 1 (n = 3): one eye was treated with SIME for one day. Part 2 (n = 9): randomized eyes were treated with SIME and 0.2% hyaluronic acid (HA) control eye drops 3 times a day for 10 days. Part 3 (n = 26 + 26): randomized treatment was applied on both eyes 3 times a day for 30 days. OSDI change was tested for superiority of SIME over HA. Ocular assessments were performed at baseline and after the last dose. Results Both treatments were well tolerated without adverse device effects. Tear film break-up time (p = 0.0025) and ocular protection index (p = 0.0026; change vs. HA, p = 0.047) increased significantly with SIME after 30 days. Tear osmolarity decreased more in SIME than in the HA group and significantly with both eye drops in hyperosmolar subgroups. Corneal (p = 0.014) and nasal conjunctival staining (p = 0.043) were reduced with SIME in per-protocol patients (n = 24). Conjunctival (p = 0.001) and lid redness (p = 0.012) decreased with SIME in all patients (n = 26). Symptoms decreased by about 25 OSDI units with both treatments (p < 0.0001) and with nonsignificant difference between treatments. Conclusions Sacha inchi microemulsion (SIME) proved safe and efficacious in improving each aetiologic factor for dry eye as revealed through objective tests. Hyperosmolar stress dominating blink cycles must be disrupted by biophysical protection of the ocular surface to facilitate resolution of cellular damage and inflammation, and relief of ocular symptoms.

AB  - Summary Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer predisposing condition caused by germline mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the TP53 transcription factor. LFS is typified by the development of a wide spectrum of childhood and adult-onset malignancies, which includes, among others, the lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and, to a lesser extent, lymphoma. Accordingly, it is important that haematologists/oncologists be familiar with this pleiotropic hereditary cancer syndrome. The high cancer risk and variability in type and age of cancer onset have raised questions about the underlying biology and optimal treatment approaches for individuals with LFS. Since its description almost 50 years ago, many clinical and basic research investigations have provided insights into the pathogenesis, manifestations, genetic testing and management strategies for individuals with LFS. Here we provide an update on the current state of knowledge regarding LFS with an emphasis, where possible, on information relevant to practicing haematologists.

AB  - Abstract New and continuing environmental demands and competitive forces require healthcare organizations to be increasingly careful in thinking about their strategies. They must do so in a highly unusual (multi-actor) marketplace where a variety of system interdependencies complicate decision-making. A good strategy requires an attempt to understand the real, as distinct from the perceived, environment, and is characterized by explicit tradeoffs along three dimensions: service or program variety, patient needs, and patient access. The quality of these tradeoffs can be assessed in terms of whether the strategy is (a) attuned to critical success factors in the organization's environment, (b) highly focused, (c) linked to the organization's capabilities, and (d) accompanied by an activity set that is difficult for competitors to imitate. An organization also must be capable of adapting appropriately to changes in its environment. Thus, even the best strategy must be reviewed constantly if it is to remain viable. A strategy's sustainability can be adversely affected by increased buyer or supplier power, lowered barriers to entry, growing rivalry, the threat of substitutes, and increased slack in resource usage. By thinking more creatively in the future than they have in the past, healthcare organizations can make tradeoffs and choose a focused strategic position. They then can design an activity set that is appropriate for that position, and that will assist them to achieve both financial viability and superior programmatic performance. A well-designed activity set also will assist them to sustain their performance in the face of changing environmental demands and competitive forces. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Although the clinical manifestations of severe haemophilia A (HA) are well studied, the challenges, if any, of living with mild HA are not clearly delineated to date. Aim To assess available evidence of clinical risks and societal/economic impacts of disease in adult patients with mild HA using a systematic literature review. Methods Prespecified study selection criteria were applied in a comprehensive literature search. Included studies varied in design and reported outcomes of interest for adults (≥13 years of age) with mild HA. Results Seventeen studies with a total of 3213 patients met eligibility criteria (published or presented in English, 1966-2017). Most studies were observational, and the outcomes reported were too sparse and dissimilar to support a formal meta-analysis. Mean annual bleeding rates ranged from 0.44 to 4.5 episodes per patient per year. Quality of life (QoL; SF-36 General Health) was impacted compared to healthy controls. Health care costs and productivity were seldom assessed and no robust comparisons to healthy controls were available. Conclusion Quantifying outcomes for adult patients with mild HA remains challenging, with estimates of key QoL and cost data often based on small data sets and without comparison to population norms. Therefore, the clinical impact of mild haemophilia may be under-represented and unmet needs may remain unaddressed. As paradigm-changing therapies for HA emerge, stronger knowledge of mild HA can guide the development of care options that minimize burden and enhance the QoL for this segment of the haemophilia community, and for the haemophilia community in totality.

AB  - Poststroke fatigue is a common and disabling condition. However, few studies on or therapeutic trials addressing poststroke fatigue have appeared in the literature. We aimed to review the prevalence, natural course, potential predisposing factors (physiological, psychocognitive, and organic), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of poststroke fatigue. Using PubMed CINAHL and PsycINFO, we reviewed all the available literature on poststroke fatigue and related issues. The prevalence of poststroke fatigue ranges from 23% to 75%, depending on the definition of fatigue and the characteristics of the patients included. Poststroke fatigue seems to be of complex etiology. Predisposing factors were physiological ones including functional disability, prestroke fatigue, medical comorbidities, medication, sleep disturbances, and nutritional problems; psychocognitive ones including depression and cognitive dysfunction; and organic ones including damage to particular brain areas with consequent neurochemical alterations, perfusion deficit, and neuroinflammation. Poststroke fatigue is a persistent and debilitating symptom in some patients, and can have adverse affects on patient's neurological recovery, quality of life, and mortality. Few therapeutic trials have been reported, and the therapy was rarely successful, possibly because of the complex nature of poststroke fatigue. Poststroke fatigue is a common and frequently disabling problem of complex etiology. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of poststroke fatigue and to develop better treatments for this condition.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To determine population-based rates and outcomes of pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (pre-GDM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy. Methods? This was a cross-sectional study, using linked population databases, of all women, and their infants, discharged from hospital following birth in New South Wales (NSW) between 1 July 1998 and 31 December 2002. Women with, and infants exposed to pre-GDM or GDM were compared with those without diabetes mellitus for pregnancy characteristics and outcomes. Results? Women with a singleton pregnancy (n = 370 703) and their infants were included: 1248 women (0.3%) had pre-GDM and 17 128 (4.5%) had GDM. Of those women with pre-GDM, 57% had Type 1 diabetes, 20% had Type 2 diabetes and for 23% the type of diabetes was unknown. Major maternal morbidity or mortality was more common in women with pre-GDM (7.9%) [odds ratio (OR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6, 3.9] and in women with GDM (3.1%) (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1, 1.4) when compared with women without diabetes (2.6%). Major infant morbidity or mortality occurred more frequently in infants exposed to pre-GDM compared with no diabetes (13.6% vs. 3.1%) (OR 5.0, 95% CI 4.2, 5.8) and in infants exposed to GDM compared with no diabetes (3.2% vs. 2.3%) (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3, 1.5). Conclusions? Pre-GDM and GDM continue to be associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, women with GDM have adverse outcomes less frequently. Rates of GDM and pre-GDM appear to be increasing over time. Clinicians should consider the potential for adverse outcomes, and arrange referral to appropriate services.
