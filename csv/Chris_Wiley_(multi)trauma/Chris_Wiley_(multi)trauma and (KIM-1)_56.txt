AB  - Abstract Objective Blood component transfusion is increasingly promoted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but is resource-intensive so whole blood is often used. We examined SSA recommendations about whole blood and packed red cell transfusions for pregnancy-related bleeding or anaemia, and paediatric anaemia, and evaluated the evidence underpinning these recommendations. Method Relevant SSA guidelines were identified using five electronic databases, websites for SSA Ministries of Health, blood transfusion services and WHO. To facilitate comparisons, indications for transfusing packed red cells or whole blood within these guidelines and reasons given for these recommendations were recorded on a pre-designed matrix. The AGREE II tool was used to appraise guidelines that gave a reason for recommending either packed red cells or whole blood. We systematically searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane library and NHSBT Transfusion Evidence Library, using PRISMA guidelines, for clinical studies comparing whole blood with packed red cells or combined blood components in obstetric bleeding or anaemia, or paediatric anaemia. Characteristics and findings of included studies were extracted in a standardised format and narratively summarised. Results 32 English language guidelines from 15 SSA countries mentioned packed red cell or whole blood use for our conditions of interest. Only seven guidelines justified their recommendation for using packed red cells or whole blood. No recommendations or justifications had supporting citations to research evidence. 33 full-text papers, from 11 234 citations, were reviewed but only one study met our inclusion criteria. This was a single-centre study in post-partum haemorrhage. Conclusion Evidence comparing whole blood and packed red cell transfusion for common paediatric and maternal indications is virtually absent in SSA. Therefore, it is unclear whether policies promoting red cells over whole blood transfusion are clinically appropriate. Building a relevant evidence base will help develop effective policies promoting the most appropriate use of blood in African settings.

AB  - Abstract Membrane lesions play an early role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Using a new albumin-targeted contrast agent (MS-325), sarcolemmal integrity of two animal models for muscular dystrophy was studied by MRI. Intravenously injected MS-325 does not enter skeletal muscle of normal mice. However, mdx and Sgca-null mutant mice, animal models for Duchenne and sarcoglycan-deficient limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, respectively, showed significant accumulation of MS-325 in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that contrast agent-enhanced MRI could serve as a common, noninvasive imaging procedure for evaluating the localization, extent, and mechanisms of skeletal muscle damage in muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, this method is expected to facilitate assessment of therapeutic approaches in these diseases. Magn Reson Med 44:655?659, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold with increased mechanical strength may be an essential requirement for more advanced bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Various material- and chemical-based approaches have been explored to enhance the mechanical properties of engineered bone tissue scaffolds. In this study, the effects of pore architecture and stacking direction on the mechanical and cell proliferation properties of a scaffold were investigated. The 3D scaffold was prepared using solid freeform fabrication technology with a multihead deposition system. Various types of scaffolds with different pore architectures (lattice, stagger, and triangle types) and stacking directions (horizontal and vertical directions) were fabricated with a blend of polycaprolactone and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid. In compression tests, the triangle-type scaffold was the strongest among the experimental groups. Stacking direction affected the mechanical properties of scaffolds. An in vitro cell counting kit-8 assay showed no significant differences in optical density depending on the different pore architectures and stacking directions. In conclusion, mechanical properties of scaffolds can be enhanced by controlling pore architecture and stacking direction. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A, 2012.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? The purpose of the study was to explore the meaning(s) that emergency department nurses ascribe to acts of violence from patients, their family and friends and what impact these meaning(s) have upon how they respond to such acts. Background.? Violence in the health sector is of international concern. In high acuity areas such as emergency departments, nurses have an increased risk of violence. The literature further suggests that violence towards nurses in emergency departments is under-reported. Design and methods.? This study was undertaken in 2005, at a regional Australian Emergency Department with 20 consenting registered nurses. Using an instrumental case study design, both qualitative and quantitative data were generated. Qualitative data were collected using participant observation, semi-structured interviews, informal field interviews and researcher journaling. Quantitative data of violent events were generated using a structured observational guide. Textual data were analysed thematically and numeric data were analysed using frequency counts. Mixed methods and concurrent data analysis contributed to the rigour of this study. Findings.? Emergency department nurses made judgments about the meaning of violent events according to three factors: (i) perceived personalization of the violence; (ii) presence of mitigating factors; and (iii) the reason for the presentation. The meanings that were ascribed to individual acts of violence informed the responses that nurses initiated. Conclusions.? The findings show that violence towards emergency department nurses is interpreted in a more systematic and complex way than the current definitions of violence make possible. The meanings given to violence were contextually constructed and these ascribed meaning(s) and judgments informed the actions that the nurses took in response to both the act of violence and the agent of violence. Relevance to clinical practice.? Understanding the meaning(s) of violence towards nurses contributes to the discussions surrounding why nurses under-report violence. Further, these findings bring insights into how nurses can and do, handle violence in the workplace.

AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives This qualitative study explored the experiences of neonatal nurses with facilitating closeness between parents and babies with congenital abnormalities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Background Babies with congenital abnormalities often require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Parents may experience emotional distancing from their baby, due to their response to their baby's congenital abnormality, as well as physical separation due to their baby's hospitalisation in the NICU. NICU nurses can help facilitate the development of closeness between babies and parents in the NICU. Method This qualitative interpretive description study involved face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with twelve neonatal nurses following which the data collected were thematically analysed. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist were used in preparing this paper. Results Three major themes emerged from the analysis??Everyone copes differently,? ?You have to focus on what is the normal thing? and ?It's very much an individualised approach.? Participants often felt unprepared to care for babies with congenital abnormalities and implemented coping mechanisms to overcome the emotional labour they experienced. Skin-to-skin cuddles were considered the most beneficial strategy for parents to develop closeness with their baby. Participants recognised that they sometimes ?pushed? parents into engaging with their baby. Participants highlighted the importance of individualised, supportive care for these parents. Conclusions Neonatal nurses require increased education about congenital abnormalities and individualised care to support them in caring for babies with congenital abnormalities. Relevance to clinical practice Further research is needed on parental experience of developing closeness with a baby with a congenital abnormality in the NICU.

AB  - ABSTRACT Some aspects of an obese body habitus may protect against fracture risk (higher bone mineral density [BMD] and greater tissue padding), while others may augment that risk (greater impact forces during a fall). To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed data from a multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI)?>?30?kg/m2. Composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces were constructed from DXA-derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow-up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower composite strength indices, suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase is not sufficient to compensate for the increase in fall impact forces. During the follow-up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall impact forces in obese individuals. Adjusted for composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces, obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft tissue padding. Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft tissue padding, attenuated the obesity?fracture association. Our findings support that there are at least three major mechanisms by which obesity influences fracture risk: increased BMD in response to greater skeletal loading, increased impact forces, and greater absorption of impact forces by soft tissue padding. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - This is the second annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 200 new references. Since the literature pertinent to geriatrics is growing ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Almost all of the references date from the past four years. Preference is given to recent publications, since they provide a list of the important earlier articles. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional review article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, studies of which, it will be noted, are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. A few articles concern diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study specifically from a geriatric viewpoint exists; e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, and the fourth (IV) with non-physician services available to the elderly, including ethical quandaries. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract An estimated 47 million people worldwide are living with dementia in 2015, and this number is projected to triple by 2050. In the absence of a disease-modifying treatment or cure, reducing the risk of developing dementia takes on added importance. In 2014, the World Dementia Council (WDC) requested the Alzheimer's Association evaluate and report on the state of the evidence on modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. This report is a summary of the Association's evaluation, which was presented at the October 2014 WDC meeting. The Association believes there is sufficient evidence to support the link between several modifiable risk factors and a reduced risk for cognitive decline, and sufficient evidence to suggest that some modifiable risk factors may be associated with reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, the Association believes there is sufficiently strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, to conclude that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension) reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of dementia. The Association also believes there is sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong learning/cognitive training may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Patients with musculoskeletal tumors can face large bone deficiency, deformity, and nonunion. Distraction osteogenesis via the Ilizarov method may be useful for reconstruction of these deficiencies allowing limb preservation and optimizing function. Methods We reviewed 20 patients with a range of musculoskeletal tumors necessitating surgical treatment. The group included 9 females and 11 males with a mean age of 22.6 (8?58) years at a mean follow up of 81.7 (26?131) months. The mean bone deficiency was 7.9 (1.2?18.0)?cm. Results The mean lengthening achieved was 7.1 (3.5?18.0)?cm over an EFI of 33.5 (range, 9.5?58.3)?days/cm. This treatment resulted in 10 excellent and 3 good ASAMI bone scores, 10 excellent and 3 good ASAMI function scores, a mean lower extremity MSTS score of 93% and a mean upper extremity MSTS score of 87%. Treatment resulted in 2 complications, 18 obstacles, and 6 problems. Conclusion The Ilizarov method is an effective technique for limb reconstruction of bone tumors, although extended time in external fixation is required. Since no one in this group received simultaneous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, we cannot comment on use of the Ilizarov method with these treatments. Further use and clinical follow-up is warranted.

AB  - Parsimony is important for the interpretation of causal effect estimates of longitudinal treatments on subsequent outcomes. One method for parsimonious estimates fits marginal structural models by using inverse propensity scores as weights. This method leads to generally large variability that is uncommon in more likelihood-based approaches. A more recent method fits these models by using simulations from a fitted g-computation, but requires the modeling of high-dimensional longitudinal relations that are highly susceptible to misspecification. We propose a new method that, first, uses longitudinal propensity scores as regressors to reduce the dimension of the problem and then uses the approximate likelihood for the first estimates to fit parsimonious models. We demonstrate the methods by estimating the effect of anticoagulant therapy on survival for cancer and non-cancer patients who have inferior vena cava filters.

AB  - Clinicians should possess current knowledge about the prognosis and expected outcome of endodontic treatment, including apical surgery. This knowledge cannot be acquired by indiscriminate review of the many available studies because they vary in the level of evidence they provide. Therefore, seven studies that best comply with methodology criteria defining the levels of evidence were selected and used as the basis of this review. In spite of their methodological consistency, the outcomes reported in these studies still differ considerably, mainly because of differences in inclusion criteria. According to these studies, 37?91% of teeth can be expected to be healed, while up to 33% can still be healing several years after surgery. Importantly, 80?94% of teeth can remain in symptom-free function, even if they are not healed. Several pre-operative factors may influence the outcome of treatment; the outcome may be better in teeth with small lesions and excessively short or long root canal fillings, and it may be poorer in teeth treated surgically for the second time. With regard to intra-operative factors, the choice of the root-end filling material and the quality of the root-end filling may influence the outcome, while the retrograde retreatment procedure clearly offers a better outcome than the standard root-end filling. In summary, the expected outcome of apical surgery is good and therefore, before considering tooth extraction and replacement, apical surgery should be attempted when it is feasible.
