AB  - Abstract Background Neglect is often overlooked in adolescence, due in part to assumptions about autonomy and misinterpretation of behaviors being part of normal adolescent development. Emotional maltreatment (abuse or neglect) has a damaging effect throughout the lifespan, but is rarely recognized amongst adolescents. Our review aims to identify features that adolescents experiencing neglect and/ or emotional maltreatment report. Method A rapid review methodology searched 8 databases (1990-2014), supplemented by hand searching journals, and references, identifying 2,568 abstracts. Two independent reviews were undertaken of 279 articles, by trained reviewers, using standardised critical appraisal. Eligible studies: primary studies of children aged 13-17 years, with substantiated neglect and/ or emotional maltreatment, containing self-reported features. Results 19 publications from 13 studies were included, demonstrating associations between both neglect and emotional maltreatment with internalising features (9 studies) including depression, post traumatic symptomatology and anxiety; emotional maltreatment was associated with suicidal ideation, while neglect was not (1 study); neglect was associated with alcohol related problems (3 studies), substance misuse (2 studies), delinquency for boys (1 study), teenage pregnancy (1 study), and general victimization for girls (1 study), while emotionally maltreated girls reported more externalising symptoms (1 study). Dating violence victimization was associated with neglect and emotional maltreatment (2 studies), while emotional abuse of boys, but not neglect, was associated with dating violence perpetration (1 study), and neither neglect nor emotional maltreatment had an association with low self-esteem (2 studies). Neither neglect nor emotional maltreatment had an effect on school performance (1 study), but neglected boys showed greater school engagement than neglected girls (1 study). Conclusions If asked, neglected or emotionally maltreated adolescents describe significant difficulties with their mental health, social relationships, and alcohol or substance misuse. Practitioners working with youths who exhibit these features should recognize the detrimental impact of maltreatment at this developmental stage, and identify whether maltreatment is a contributory factor that should be addressed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Damage to DNA and disruption of membrane integrity by lipid peroxidation processes are two of the proposed causes of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants. However, the relative significance of these different types of molecular damage has not been established in experiments carried out under realistic physiological conditions. Plants of Gunnera magellanica (a native herb from southern Patagonia) were exposed to a gradient of biologically effective UV-B doses (from 0 to 6.5?kJ?m?2?d?1 of UV-Bbe) in a greenhouse study. Leaf expansion was measured and sensitive techniques were used to detect damage to DNA (in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; CPDs) and lipid peroxidation (via electronic-paramagnetic resonance; EPR). Leaf expansion decreased and the CPD density increased with increasing UV-B doses, but the degree of lipid peroxidation remained unaffected. The highest UV-B dose induced a transient oxidative stress situation (as evaluated using the ratio of ascorbyl radical to ascorbate, A·/AH?), which was rapidly controlled by an increase in the ascorbate pool. The present results suggest that under a range of UV-Bbe doses that overlaps the range of doses that G. magellanica plants experience in their natural environment, growth inhibition is better explained by DNA damage than by increased lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Abstract Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) is a rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin that can be identified by its propensity for children and adolescents combined with a characteristic histologic arrangement of histiocytes and osteoclast-like giant cells whorled within tumor islands. A 5-year-old female presented with a raised, intermittently tender, and slowly enlarging tumor on her chest, which was histologically confirmed to be a PFT. We present this case along with a comprehensive review of PFT cases reported in the literature to describe the demographic, histologic, and rarely metastatic behavior of this entity. It is important to include PFT on the differential diagnosis of an enlarging tumor in the pediatric population.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy in routine clinical practice of balloon dilatation procedures in the treatment of paediatric airway stenosis. Design Observational data collection in prospective online research database. Setting Acute NHS Trusts with ENT department undertaking complex paediatric airway work. Participants Children (<18) undergoing balloon dilatation treatment for airway stenosis. Main outcome measures Airway diameter, complications, hospital resource usage. Results Fifty-nine patients had 133 balloon procedures during 128 visits to 10 hospitals. Sixty-nine (52%) of balloon procedures were conducted with a tracheostomy. Intra-operative Cotton-Myer grade decreased in 43 (57%). The mean pre-balloon subglottic diameter was 4.2 [95% CI: 3.8 to 4.5] mm, and its rate of increase was 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2] mm per year modelled on 30 patients' long-term data. As the primary treatment of stenosis, the procedural success rate of balloon dilatation (n = 52) was 65% (22% with tracheostomy, 88% without tracheostomy), and 71% as an adjunct to open reconstructive surgery (n = 7). In the 64 hospital visits where a balloon procedure was conducted with a tracheostomy in place, only one in-hospital complication (lower respiratory tract infection) occurred. For those without a tracheostomy in place, in-hospital complications occurred in seven of 64 balloon hospital visits, all related to ongoing or worsening stenosis. Six out-of-hospital complications were deemed related to ongoing or worsening stenosis following the procedure, and two complications were a combination of lower respiratory infection and ongoing or worsening stenosis. Conclusions Balloon dilation increases the size of the airway intraoperatively and is associated with long-term increase in airway diameter. Safety outcomes mostly relate to ongoing or worsening stenosis and are more common in patients without a tracheostomy.

AB  - Abstract This research examines psychological distress among 955 economically disadvantaged New York City residents surveyed during high school and again after the September 11th terrorist attacks (9/11), when they were young adults. As part of the longitudinal Reach for Health study, young adult surveys were conducted from 6?19 months post-9/11 (average 8 months), providing opportunity to assess types of exposures and psychological distress, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, hopelessness, and anger. Regressions of psychological distress on 9/11 exposure were performed, controlling for high school distress, prior exposure to violence victimization, and socio-demographic characteristics. Exposure to 9/11 was positively associated with anger, hopelessness, and PTSD symptoms and a measure of global distress. The relationship was greater among women for PTSD symptoms. Although those who reported high school distress also reported more distress in young adulthood, prior psychological distress did not moderate the relationship between exposure and psychological outcomes. Greater exposure is related to distress among those who, during high school, reported lower distress, as well as among those who reported prior greater distress.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.

AB  - Summary Peyronie's disease (PD) is a localized connective tissue disorder that involves the tunica albuginea (TA) of the penis. While surgical correction remains the gold standard, the search for an effective and less invasive therapy continues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intratunical injection of adipose tissue?derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the prevention and treatment of erectile dysfunction in a rat model of PD. Twenty-four male Sprague?Dawley rats (300?350 g) were randomly divided into four groups: sham, PD, PD + ADSC (prevention) and PD + ADSC (treatment). All rats underwent penile injections into the TA with 50 ?L vehicle (sham) or 0.5 ?g transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 (remaining groups). The ADSC groups received intratunical injections with 0.5 million rat-labelled ADSCs on day 0 (prevention) or day 30 (treatment). Forty-five days following TGF-?1 injection, rats underwent cavernous nerve stimulation (CNS) with total intracavernous-to-mean arterial pressure ratio (ICP/MAP) and total ICP recorded to measure response to therapy. Tissues were evaluated histologically and for mRNA expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and zymographic activity of MMPs. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test for post hoc comparisons. In both prevention and treatment groups, intratunical injection of ADSCs resulted in significantly higher ICP/MAP and total ICP in response to CNS compared with the PD group. Local injection of ADSCs prevented and/or reduced Peyronie's-like changes by decreasing the expression of TIMPs, and stimulating expression and activity of MMPs. This study documents the preventive and therapeutic benefits of ADSC on penile fibrosis and erectile function in an animal model of PD.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence?4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Over the last few years, minimally invasive urological surgery has evolved towards less invasive, ?scarless? procedures. New surgical concepts, such as those of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) have been introduced. Mini-laparoscopy has been rediscovered in an attempt to reduce the invasiveness of standard laparoscopy. This study is the first to compare the perception of surgeons when first facing three different scarless options for performing a porcine nephrectomy and when dealing with the constraints of each technique. The study findings suggest that: (i) when first approaching these techniques, surgeons tend to perform equally well under expert guidance in the porcine model; (ii) mini-laparoscopy is perceived as less difficult to perform; (iii) for all the techniques, surgeon's impressions are in line with their expectations. OBJECTIVE ?? To evaluate the perception and performance of urological surgeons when first applying scarless surgical techniques. METHODS ?? The study was conducted during the 2nd Minimally Invasive Urological Surgical Week annual course in Braga, Portugal. ?? Fourteen attendees performed three porcine nephrectomies by using each of the following techniques: mini-laparoscopy, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)-assisted laparoscopy. ?? Peri-operative data were recorded, and operating performance was scored by one experienced surgeon for each working station, using a global rating scale. ?? The surgeons' subjective perceptions of degree of difficulty were graded and their expectations before the procedures were recorded. RESULTS ?? Forty-two porcine nephrectomies were performed. ?? There were no differences in overall operating time, or time to dissect and manage the renal vascular hilum, whereas time to gain access was faster for LESS than for mini-laparoscopy or NOTES-assisted laparoscopy (mean [sd] 8 [6] min vs 10.2 [5.3] min vs 9.9 [5.3] min, respectively; P= 0.59). ?? A better visualization of the surgical field was obtained with mini-laparoscopy and there was a higher degree of difficulty of bimanual dexterity for LESS, but no significant differences were found among the three techniques for any variable (operating field view: P= 0.52; bimanual dexterity: P= 0.49; efficiency: P= 0.77; tissue handling: P= 0.61; autonomy: P= 0.2). ?? Subjective perception of the degree of difficulty trended in favour of mini-laparoscopy (P= 0.17), but no significant difference was found in terms of surgeons' impression as compared with their expectations (P= 0.34). CONCLUSIONS ?? When first approaching new scarless techniques, surgeons tend to perform equally well under expert guidance in the porcine model. ?? Mini-laparoscopy is perceived as less difficult to perform and, for all the techniques, surgeons' impressions are in line with their expectations.

AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) exist in vascularized niches. Although there has been ample evidence supporting a role for endothelial cell-derived soluble factors as modulators of neural stem cell self-renewal and neuronal differentiation there is a paucity of data reported on neural stem cell modulation of endothelial cell behavior. We show that co-culture of NSCs with brain-derived endothelial cells (BECs) either in direct contact or separated by a porous membrane elicited robust vascular tube formation and maintenance, mediated by induction of vascular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of vascular VEGFR2 and TrkB by NSC NO. Nitric oxide (NO) scavengers and sequestration of VEGF and BDNF blunted this induction of tube formation, whereas addition of exogenous NO donor, rBDNF and rVEGF rescued the induction of tube formation. Further, rBDNF enhanced NSC eNOS activation and NO generation, suggesting an inducible positive feed-back signaling loop between NSCs and BECs, providing for homeostasis and responsiveness of the resident NSCs and BECs comprising the neurovascular niche. These findings show the importance of reciprocal modulation of NSCs and BECs in induction and maintenance of the neurovascular niche and underscores their dynamic interactions. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
