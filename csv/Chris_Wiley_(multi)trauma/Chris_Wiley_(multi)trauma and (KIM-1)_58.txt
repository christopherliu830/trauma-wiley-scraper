AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence?4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Over the last few years, minimally invasive urological surgery has evolved towards less invasive, ?scarless? procedures. New surgical concepts, such as those of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) have been introduced. Mini-laparoscopy has been rediscovered in an attempt to reduce the invasiveness of standard laparoscopy. This study is the first to compare the perception of surgeons when first facing three different scarless options for performing a porcine nephrectomy and when dealing with the constraints of each technique. The study findings suggest that: (i) when first approaching these techniques, surgeons tend to perform equally well under expert guidance in the porcine model; (ii) mini-laparoscopy is perceived as less difficult to perform; (iii) for all the techniques, surgeon's impressions are in line with their expectations. OBJECTIVE ?? To evaluate the perception and performance of urological surgeons when first applying scarless surgical techniques. METHODS ?? The study was conducted during the 2nd Minimally Invasive Urological Surgical Week annual course in Braga, Portugal. ?? Fourteen attendees performed three porcine nephrectomies by using each of the following techniques: mini-laparoscopy, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)-assisted laparoscopy. ?? Peri-operative data were recorded, and operating performance was scored by one experienced surgeon for each working station, using a global rating scale. ?? The surgeons' subjective perceptions of degree of difficulty were graded and their expectations before the procedures were recorded. RESULTS ?? Forty-two porcine nephrectomies were performed. ?? There were no differences in overall operating time, or time to dissect and manage the renal vascular hilum, whereas time to gain access was faster for LESS than for mini-laparoscopy or NOTES-assisted laparoscopy (mean [sd] 8 [6] min vs 10.2 [5.3] min vs 9.9 [5.3] min, respectively; P= 0.59). ?? A better visualization of the surgical field was obtained with mini-laparoscopy and there was a higher degree of difficulty of bimanual dexterity for LESS, but no significant differences were found among the three techniques for any variable (operating field view: P= 0.52; bimanual dexterity: P= 0.49; efficiency: P= 0.77; tissue handling: P= 0.61; autonomy: P= 0.2). ?? Subjective perception of the degree of difficulty trended in favour of mini-laparoscopy (P= 0.17), but no significant difference was found in terms of surgeons' impression as compared with their expectations (P= 0.34). CONCLUSIONS ?? When first approaching new scarless techniques, surgeons tend to perform equally well under expert guidance in the porcine model. ?? Mini-laparoscopy is perceived as less difficult to perform and, for all the techniques, surgeons' impressions are in line with their expectations.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and risk of tricuspid valve replacements and to compare bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves. Methods Between 1991 and 2009, 104 consecutive patients (71 women; mean age, 57?±?10.8 years) with tricuspid valvular disease underwent mechanical TVR (mechanical group; n?=?59) or bioprosthetic TVR (bioprosthesis group; n?=?45). Follow-up was complete in 97.1% (n?=?101) with a median duration of 49.9 months (range 0?230 months). Results Hospital mortality after mechanical TVR and bioprosthetic TVR was not different on adjusted analysis by propensity score. Ten-year actuarial survival after mechanical and bioprosthetic TVR was 83.9?±?7.6% and 61.4?±?9.1%, respectively (p?=?0.004). However, there was also no significant difference in terms of adjusted analysis by propensity score (p?=?0.084). No statistically significant difference was detected between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves in regard to event-free survival. Conclusions Mechanical TVR is not inferior to bioprosthetic TVR in terms of occurrence of valve-related events, especially anticoagulation-related complications. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12093 (J Card Surg 2013;28:212?217)

AB  - Abstract Although negative outcomes from intimate partner violence (IPV) are not inevitable, IPV is recognized to have profound negative effects on child development. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study of service providers' understandings of the impact of IPV on mothers, young children (birth to 36 months), and mother?infant/child relationships, and of the support needs of these mothers and young children. Service providers suggested that IPV negatively influenced caregiving and identified a pressing need for information and strategies to help mothers promote and protect their young children's development. Although service providers struggled to articulate ideal forms of assistance to promote maternal?infant/child relationships, they agreed that mothers and young children experiencing IPV required more support than is currently available. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Sutureless anastomosis devices are designed to reduce surgical time and difficulty, which may lead to quicker and less invasive cardiovascular anastomosis. The implant uses a barb-and-seat compression fitting composed of one male and two female components. The implant body is resorbable and capable of eluting heparin. Custom robotic deposition equipment was designed to fabricate the implants from a self-curing silk solution. Curing did not require deleterious processing steps but devices demonstrated high crush resistance, retention strength, and leak resistance. Radial crush resistance is in the range of metal vascular implants. Insertion force and retention strength of the anastomosis was dependent on fit sizing of the male and female components and subsequent vessel wall compression. Anastomotic burst strength was dependent on the amount of vessel wall compression, and capable of maintaining higher than physiological pressures. In initial screening using a porcine implant, the devices remained intact for 28 days (the length of study). Histological sections revealed cellular infiltration within the laminar structure of the male component, as well as at the interface between the male and female components. Initial degradation and absorption of the implant wall were observed. The speed per anastomosis using this new device was much faster than current systems, providing significant clinical improvement. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Previously, we demonstrated that extracellular zinc plays a key role in transient global ischemia-induced microglial activation through sequential activation of NADPH oxidase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1. However, it remains unclear how zinc causes the sequential activation of microglia. Here, we examined whether transporter-mediated zinc uptake is necessary for microglial activation. Administration of zinc to microglia activated them through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) formation, which were suppressed by intracellular zinc chelation with 25 ?M TPEN (N,N,N?,N?-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine) or 2 ?M BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N?,N?-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester). The 65Zn uptake by microglia was temperature- and dose-dependent, and it was blocked by metal cations, but not by L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and nimodipine. Expression of Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP)1, a plasma membrane-type zinc transporter, was detected in microglia, and nickel, a relatively sensitive substrate/inhibitor of ZIP1, showed cis- and trans-inhibitory effects on the 65Zn uptake. Exposure of microglia to zinc increased the extracellular ATP concentration, which was suppressed by intracellular zinc chelation and inhibition of hemichannels. mRNA expression of several types of P2 receptors was detected in microglia, and periodate-oxidized ATP, a selective P2?7 receptor antagonist, attenuated the zinc-induced microglial activation via NADPH oxidase and PARP-1. Exogenous ATP and 2?(3?)-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) ATP also caused microglial activation through ROS generation and PAR formation. These findings demonstrate that ZIP1-mediated uptake of zinc induces ATP release and autocrine/paracrine activation of P2X(7) receptors, and then activates microglia, suggesting that zinc transporter-mediated uptake of zinc is a trigger for microglial activation via the NADPH oxidase and PARP-1 pathway. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic injury, and currently, the only recommended pharmacotherapy is high-dose methylprednisolone, which has limited efficacy. Estrogen is a multi-active steroid with anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Estrogen may modulate intracellular Ca2+ and prevent inflammation. For this study, male rats were divided into three groups. Sham-group animals received a laminectomy at T12. Injured rats received both laminectomy and 40 gram centimeter force SCI. Estrogen-group rats received 4 mg/kg 17?-estradiol (estrogen) at 15 min and 24 hr post-injury, and vehicle-group rats received equal volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. Animals were sacrificed at 48 hr post-injury, and 1-cm segments of the lesion, rostral penumbra, and caudal penumbra were excised. The degradation of 68 kD neurofilament protein (NFP) and estrogen receptors (ER) was examined by Western blot analysis. Protein levels of calpain and the activities of calpain and caspase-3 were also examined. Levels of cytochrome c were determined in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Cell death with DNA fragmentation was examined using the TUNEL assay. At the lesion, samples from both vehicle and estrogen treated animals showed increased levels of 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, cytochrome c release, and degradation of ERα and ER?, as compared to sham. In the caudal penumbra, estrogen treatment significantly attenuated 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, and ER? degradation. At the lesion, vehicle-treated animals displayed more TUNEL+ cells, and estrogen treatment significantly attenuated this cell death marker. We conclude that estrogen may inhibit cell death in SCI through calpain inhibition. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - 1 Anu Muraja-Murro, 1 Ari Pääkkönen, 2 Leena Jutila, 2 Reetta Kälviäinen, 3 Arto Immonen, 1 Sara Määttä, and 1 Esa Mervaala ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; 2 Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mismatch-negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential (ERP) produced by a deviant stimuli that occurs infrequenty among standard stimuli. MMN is thought to reflect the activation of an automatic change-detector system that compares new auditory input with a short-term memory trace generated by the previous auditory stimuli. MMN in human has been demonstrated from several cortical sites, but not to our knowledge from hippocampus or amygdala. This is surprising, given that these limbic structures are so essential for learning and memory functions. We could obtain MMN from these temporomesial structures using intracranial electrodes in adult patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Methods: 4 adults with intractable temporal lobe seizures (age 32?48 years) had each 2?4 stereotactically implanted 6-contact depth-electrodes at amygdalo-hippocampal complex. The electrodes were implanted via lateral approach and their exact anatomical localizations were confirmed by MRI and CT in situ. After the post hoc anatomical localization of the depth-electrodes, the presence of MMN could be studied from 6 hippocampi and 5 amygdalas (i.e., the electrode tips were exactly within amygdalo-hippocampal complex). The most mesial depth-electrode contacts were chosen for the MMN analysis with the MMN latency range of 120?250 ms, as well as with the P300 range of 250?500 ms. We analyzed possible statistically significant differences between the ERPs to deviant and standard tones. Results: A definite MMN within 120?250 ms latency range could be recorded from 4/6 hippocampi and 3/5 amygdalas. MMN was also detected within 250?500 ms latency range in 3/6 hippocampi and 2/5 amygdalas, respectively. In only one patient the hippocampal MMN resembled typical scalp-recorded MMN. In all, the MMN decreased from the deepest contacts towards the cortex, suggesting a local maximum of MMN at the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Conclusions: Our data implicates that a local and early (120?500 ms post-stimuli) automatic electrophysiological change-detector system exists within the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. This data is the first to demonstrate that also these temporomesial structures are activated and involved in mismatch detection, and is in line with recent sensory mismatch fMRI studies. Other sensory stimuli might also produce MMN in the same structures, possibly thus revealing a common function for hippocampus and amygdala in early sensory stimulus detection. 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 2 Gabriel Moeddel, 1 Elia M. Pestana, 1 Deepak K. Lachhwani, 1 Ajay Gupta, 1 Prakash Kotagal, and 1 Elaine Wyllie ( 1 Department of Epilepsy and Sleep Disorder, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Westfalen, Germany ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is part of the presurgical workup of patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery to determine language and memory lateralization. Most information on results and complications are derived from adults. Little is known about children undergoing IAT. Difficulties arise from anxiety, need for barbiturate dosage adjustment, and impaired baseline memory in children with mental retardation [4]. The goal of this study was 1) to describe language lateralization in children with epilepsy and 2) to outline complications during IAT. Methods: 126 consecutive pediatric IAT performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a seven year period were reviewed. Results: 44 patients were age 5?12 years, 82 were age 13?18. 102 were right-handed. Amobarbital (n = 96, average dose: 100 +- 25 mg) or Methohexital (n = 30, average dose 5 +- 1 mg) was injected into the left (n = 18), right (n = 13), or both (n = 95) ICA. Language was localized in 95 patients (75.4%): 75 [78.9%] were left, 6 [6.3%] were right, 14 [14.7%] bilateral language dominant. Neurological complications included prolonged lethargy impairing language and memory evaluation in 4 patients. Four children had a seizure after injection. Additionally, valid data could not be obtained due to fear or agitation in three children age 5?9 years. No lasting neurological deficits were seen. General complications included shortness of breath after contrast injection in one boy. One girl presented with fever of 38.5 C the night after the procedure complaining of groin pain. No other major complications were seen. Conclusions: This is one of the largest pediatric IAT series studied so far. The data on language lateralization agree with those previously reported [1, 2, 3]. The IAT in children is an invasive test with a potential for complications, as in adults, occuring in 10 out of 126 patients [7.9%]. Our series highlights the need for refinement and further development of novel methods to establish language lateralization in children during the evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Isojärvi ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ; and 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: To prospectively evaluate changes in interictal heart rate (HR) variability in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after 4 years follow-up. Methods: A 24-hour ECG recording was obtained at baseline and four years after first recording in 18 patients with refractory TLE, 18 patients with well controlled TLE, and once in 36 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Time and frequency domain measures, along with fractal and complexity measures of HR variability, were analysed from the ECG recordings. Results: At baseline most of the measures showed decreased HR variability in the TLE patients compared to control subjects. After four years follow-up, most of the HR variability measures were further decreased in patients with TLE, and the RR interval (p = 0.015), the Poincaré component SD2 (p < 0.002), and ApEn (p = 0.000) value decreases from the baseline were statistically significant. Conclusions: TLE was associated with reduced HR variability at the baseline of the study. Further decrease in HR variability in patients with TLE was observed after four-year follow-up 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Shalini Mukherjee, 1 K.K. Deepak, and 1 Padma Vasantha ( 1 Department of Neurology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; and Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India ) Rationale: Changes in cardiovascular tone is noted in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients. The dysfunction of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients. The present study was aimed at finding out the effect of epilepsy surgery on autonomic functions in intractable epileptic patients. Methods: 27 patients of mean age 27.3 +/?10.8 who were intractable for over two years or more and selected for surgery. They underwent a battery of tests that assessed their autonomic reactivity. Baseline autonomic activity (tone) was also measured by Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The patients underwent the same tests again 3 months later. Results: The indices of Deep Breathing test (DBT)- before and after surgery, i.e. E:I ratio (1.27 +/?0.13 vs. 1.4 +/? 0.1) and delta changes in heart rate (20.5 +/? 8.75 vs. 23.0 +/? 1.3) show an increase, though not significant, in parasympathetic reactivity after surgery. No changes were observed in the Valsalva Maneuver or in the 30:15 ratio in the Head Up Tilt test (HUT). The rise in Diastolic BP in Hand Grip Test (28.0 +/? 7.0 vs. 16.0 +/? 10.4) was significantly less after surgery. The reactivity tests show that there may be a trend towards increase in parasympathetic and decrease in sympathetic reactivity after surgery. Among the parameters in the HRV which denote the autonomic tone, most of the time domain measures between pre and post surgery patients, i.e. SENN (1.4 +/? 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/? 1.2), SDSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), RMSSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), NN50 (0.55 +/? 3.3 vs. 5 +/? 26.1), pNN50 (0.4 +/? 0.1 vs. 0.51 +/? 0.2) showed an increase in values post surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone. In the frequency domain measures, LF (nu) and% LF denote the sympathetic tone; LF (nu) ((45.5 +/? 19.6 vs. 34 +/? 14.6) showed a significant decrease after surgery and%LF (20.8 +/? 13.1 vs. 22.2 +/? 8.8) was also reduced, thereby showing a decrease in sympathetic tone. HF (nu) and% HF denote parasympathetic tone and HF (nu) showed an increase (48.6 +/? 21.5 vs. 57.2 +/? 22.8), while%HF (36.5 +/? 21.8 vs. 43.2 +/? 16.9) showed a significant increase after surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone after surgery. The LF/HF ratios, which show the sympathovagal balance, also showed a significant decrease (1.1 +/? 1.1 vs. 0.63 +/? 0.4) after surgery. Two patients who had abnormal tone before surgery showed normalization after surgery. Conclusions: The present study shows that the autonomic functions are modulated after surgery; exhibiting a decrease in sympathetic reactivity and increase in parasympathetic reactivity. An increase in parasympathetic tone and a significant decrease in sympathetic tone is also noted after surgery.

AB  - Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a frequently used form of vascular access in children receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). Whereas standard dual-lumen catheters (DL) are used in many centers, the Tesio catheter has proven to be superior to the DL catheter in terms of catheter survival and infection rates in at least one pediatric study (Sheth RD et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001). Recently, the Ash Split catheter became available which, while similar to the Tesio internally, being comprised of 2 separate catheters, may be preferable because of the requirement for only one skin puncture for placement vs. two for the Tesio. However, no pediatric data pertaining to the Ash Split catheter have been published to date. Therefore, we reviewed and compared our experience with a small number of Ash Split (# 16) and Tesio (# 8) catheters used for semipermanent vascular access in our chronic HD population with reference to survival, infectious complications, patency, and dialysis adequacy. The results of this experience are as follows: Tesio Ash Split Survival >3 months 6/8 12/15 Sepsis (epi/catheter mo) 1/30 1/25 Exit-site infection (epi/catheter mo) 1/8.6 1/19 sp Kt/V urea 1.67 1.88 % sp Kt/V urea >1.2 100 90 Reasons for the removal of Tesio catheters were transplant (4), sepsis (1), deterioration of tubing (1), and accidental (1). Ash Split catheter removal resulted from sepsis (2), fistula placement (4), thrombosis (1), and accidental (2). This preliminary experience reveals similar outcome data for the Tesio and Ash Split catheters when used in pediatric HD patients. Definitive statements regarding the superiority of either catheter awaits additional data collection and analysis.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a treatment option for chronic pain patients. The most common indication for SCS is the failed back syndrome with leg pain. In the last decade, advances in our understanding of appropriate stimulation programming, lead placement and the physiology of SCS, have led to changes in multi-site stimulation, and stimulation with differing programs. In the past, low back, axial neuropathic type pain was not responsive to SCS. With dual electrode arrays, and dual stimulation with alternating programs of stimulation, steering of stimulation paresthesia, and versatile programmable stimulation parameters, SCS has become a more versatile form of analgesia. Purpose: To describe the current treatment rational for SCS and the results of that treatment. Results: The SCS is most efficient in patients with neuropathic pain of the extremities and less efficacious in patients with axial pain. Conclusion: SCS is the most effective treatment for limb pain not amenable to surgical decompression. The success of SCS in this chronic pain group is 80% successful in treatment of leg pain, and much less effective in treatment of axial pain.
