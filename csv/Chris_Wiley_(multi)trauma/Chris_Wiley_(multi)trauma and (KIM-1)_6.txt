AB  - Abstract The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in both the developing and adult brain by providing structural support and mediating cell-cell interactions. In this review, we focus on the major constituents of the ECM and how they function in both normal and injured brain, and summarize the changes in the composition of the ECM as well as how these changes either promote or inhibit recovery of function following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Modulation of ECM composition to facilitates neuronal survival, regeneration and axonal outgrowth is a potential therapeutic target for TBI treatment.

AB  - Abstract Any discussion of the regulation of effector class must include feedback control on the magnitude of the response. The induced effector activities are biodestructive and ridding. They are, in and of themselves, unspecific with respect to self and nonself. Consequently all responses include some level of innocent bystander pathology. The regulation of magnitude is essential to keeping this level of pathology at an evolutionarily acceptable level. This is my postulated role of suppressor T-cells, more popularly referred to as Treg. In order to perform this function they must be somatically selected to be anti-nonself like all other T/B-cells. If correct, any role that they might play in determining normal tolerance is excluded. As the commentary of Ellestad illustrates, their function to regulate autoimmunity is the consensus view today and, therefore, this competing concept and my analysis of suggested papers should invite a wide ranging debate.

Growth/differentiation factor-5 significantly enhances periodontal wound healing/regeneration compared with platelet-derived growth factor-BB in dogs. J Clin Periodontol 2010; 37: 739-746 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01576.x. Abstract Objective: Recombinant human growth/differentiation factor-5 (rhGDF-5) in a particulate ?-tricalcium phosphate (?-TCP) carrier is being evaluated to support periodontal regeneration. The objective of this study was to evaluate periodontal wound healing/regeneration following an established clinical (benchmark) protocol including surgical implantation of rhGDF-5/?-TCP in comparison with that following implantation of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF) combined with a particulate ?-TCP biomaterial using an established canine defect model. Materials and Methods: Bilateral, 4 ? 5?mm (width ? depth), one-wall, critical-size, intrabony periodontal defects were surgically created at the mandibular second and fourth pre-molar teeth in five adult Beagle dogs. Defect sites were randomized to receive rhGDF-5/?-TCP or the rhPDGF construct followed by wound closure for primary intention healing. The animals were sacrificed following an 8-week healing interval for histological and histometric examination. Results: Clinical healing was generally uneventful. Sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP exhibited a significantly enhanced cementum formation compared with sites receiving the rhPDGF construct, averaging (±SD) 4.49±0.48 versus 2.72±0.91?mm (p<0.001). Similarly, bone regeneration height and area were significantly enhanced at sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP versus that of the rhPDGF construct averaging, 3.08±0.74 versus 1.29±0.78?mm (p<0.001) and 6.03±1.28 versus 2.98±2.61?mm2 (p<0.01), respectively. Cementum regeneration included cellular/acellular mixed (extrinsic/intrinsic) fibre cementum at sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP; sites receiving the rhPDGF/?-TCP showed a pre-dominantly acellular cementum. Newly formed cementum generally extended above the adjoining alveolar bone. Both protocols displayed ?-TCP residues apparently undergoing resorption. Application of both materials appears safe, as they were associated with limited, if any, adverse events. Conclusion: rhGDF-5/?-TCP shows a significant potential to support/accelerate periodontal wound healing/regeneration. Application of rhGDF-5/?-TCP appears safe and should be further evaluated in human clinical trials.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis is increasingly applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). However, there are a few long-term survival data of the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) over 10 years. Aim.? To determine the long-term mechanical reliability of AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis in patients with ED. Methods.? A total of 438 consecutive patients with ED received implantation of an AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis at our institution from January 1991 to April 2009. In 397 patients (90.7%), the medical records were available and current status of penile prosthesis could be obtained by a direct telephone interview. The overall and mechanical survival rates of penile prosthesis were evaluated using Kaplan?Meier method. Main Outcome Measures.? Assessing the mechanical and overall survival rates of the AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis using Kaplan?Meier analysis, and looking for clinical factors related to survival of the CX/CXM using log-rank test. Results.? Mean age of 397 patients was 63.1 years (range, 24-93) and follow-up duration was 113 months (range 1-219). Eighty-two patients (20.6%) experienced mechanical failure at a median follow-up of 82 months. Mechanical survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 97.6%, 93.2% and 78.2% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. 12 patients (3.0%) experienced nonmechanical failure including infections, tissue erosion resulting in cylinder protrusion at the meatus and chronic discomfort. Overall survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 95.0%, 91.0% and 75.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. Patients with neurogenic cause for ED showed lower median overall survival of penile prosthesis compared with patients with non-neurogenic cause. Patient age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus had no association with overall survival of penile prosthesis after implantation. Conclusions.? The AMS 700CX/CXM could be accepted and applied in more patients as a reliable treatment alternative of ED. Kim DS, Yang KM, Chung HJ, Choi HM, Choi YD, and Choi HK. AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis has high mechanical reliability at long-term follow-up. J Sex Med 2010;7:2602?2607.

AB  - This systematic literature review examined the clinical utility of the construct of self-disgust in understanding mental distress. Specifically, the review assessed whether there is a shared conceptual definition of self-disgust, the face and construct validity of the quantitative assessment measures of self-disgust, and the predictive validity of self-disgust in formulating the development of a range of psychological difficulties. A systematic database search supplemented by manual searches of references and citations identified 31 relevant papers (27 quantitative, 3 qualitative, and 1 mixed). Analysis of qualitative papers indicated a number of shared features in the definition of self-disgust, including a visceral sense of self-elicited nausea accompanied by social withdrawal and attempts at cleansing or suppressing aspects of the self. Quantitative assessment measures appeared to capture these dimensions and evidenced good psychometric properties, although some measures may have only partially captured the full self-disgust construct. Strong relationships were observed between self-disgust and a range of mental health presentations, in particular, depression, body-image difficulties, and trauma-related difficulties. However, these relationships are smaller when the effects of other negative self-referential emotions were controlled, and stronger conclusions about the predictive validity of self-disgust are limited by the cross-sectional nature of many of the studies.

AB  - Abstract Subtle mutations in the growth hormone 1 (GH1) gene have been regarded as a comparatively rare cause of short stature. Such lesions were sought in a group of 41 individuals selected for short stature, reduced height velocity, and bone age delay; a group of 11 individuals with short stature and idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (IGHD); and a group of 154 controls. Heterozygous mutations were identified in all three groups but disproportionately in the individuals with short stature, both with (odds ratio 25.2; 95% CI, 5.1?132.2) and without (odds ratio 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0?12.9) IGHD. Twenty-four novel GH1 gene lesions were found. Thirteen novel missense mutations were characterized by assaying the signal transduction activity of in vitro expressed variants; six (T27I, K41R, N47D, S71F, S108R, and T175A) exhibited a reduced ability to activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Molecular modeling suggested that both K41R and T175A might compromise GH receptor binding. Seven GH variants (R16C, K41R, S71F, E74K, Q91L, S108C, and a functional polymorphism, V110I) manifested reduced secretion in rat pituitary cells after allowance had been made for the level of expression attributable to the associated GH1 proximal promoter haplotype. A further leader peptide variant (L-11P) was not secreted. Eleven novel mutations in the GH1 gene promoter were assessed by reporter gene assay but only two, including a GH2 gene-templated gene conversion, were found to be associated with a significantly reduced level of expression. Finally, a novel intron 2 acceptor splice-site mutation, detected in a family with autosomal dominant type II IGHD, was shown to lead to the skipping of exon 3 from the GH1 transcript. A total of 15 novel GH1 gene mutations were thus considered to be of probable phenotypic significance. Such lesions are more prevalent than previously recognized and although most may be insufficient on their own to account for the observed clinical phenotype, they are nevertheless likely to play a contributory role in the etiology of short stature.
