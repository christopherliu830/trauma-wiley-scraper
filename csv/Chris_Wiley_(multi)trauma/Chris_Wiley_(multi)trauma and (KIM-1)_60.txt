AB  - This study aims to explore rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) behaviors and their psychological and psychopathological correlates within a sample of nonclinical young adults (N?=?365; 63% women; M age?=?23?±?4.06). Participants completed the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory and other self-report questionnaires assessing clinical (borderline personality, dissociative, and depersonalization traits) and nonclinical (body perception, behavioral inhibition and activation, cognitive emotional regulation, and the Big Five traits) dimensions of their personality. The rate of DSH in the present sample was 39%, comparable to that found in previous studies of young adults in other countries. Further, consistent with past research, DSH was found to be associated with clinical dimensions of personality pathology, including borderline personality and dissociative symptoms. Finally, results revealed an association between DSH and nonclinical dimensions of personality, including the behavioral activation dimension of fun-seeking, more negative body perception and lower body protection, the use of more nonadaptive cognitive strategies for regulating emotions, higher levels of openness to experience, and lower levels of emotional stability. This pattern of results is consistent with those found for other impulsive behaviors and impulse control disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To evaluate the efficacy of a novel variant of electroencephalograph biofeedback, the Low Energy Neurofeedback System (LENS), that utilizes minute pulses of electromagnetic stimulation to change brainwave activity for the amelioration of fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms. Design.? Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting.? Tertiary referral academic medical center, outpatient. Patients.? Thirty-four patients diagnosed with FM according to 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Interventions.? Active or sham LENS, depending on randomization, for 22 treatment sessions. Outcome Measures.? Primary outcome measure was the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire total score. Secondary outcome measures included number of tender points (TPs) and pressure required to elicit TPs on physical examination, quantitative sensory testing heat pain threshold, and self-reported cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, sleep problems, global psychological distress, and depression obtained at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results.? Participants who received the active or sham interventions improved (Ps?<?0.05) on the primary and a variety of secondary outcome measures, without statistically significant between group differences in evidence at post-treatment or 3- or 6-month follow-up. Individual session self-reported ratings of specific symptoms (cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, pain, and sleep, and overall activity level) over the course of the 22 intervention sessions indicated significant linear trends for improvement for the active intervention condition only (Ps?<?0.05). Conclusion.? LENS cannot be recommended as a single modality treatment for FM. However, further study is warranted to investigate the potential of LENS to interact synergistically with other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for improving symptoms in FM.

AB  - The authors review findings related to mechanisms of resilience in an ongoing longitudinal study of a cohort of 558 focal youth and their families. The ongoing study began when the cohort of adolescents was in 7th grade. Findings demonstrate that resilience to economic adversity for the parents of the focal adolescents was promoted by marital support, effective problem solving skills, and a sense of mastery. For the cohort of youth, resilience to economic hardship was promoted by support from parents, siblings, and adults outside the family. Resilience to the difficult transitions from childhood to adolescence and from adolescence to early adulthood was especially fostered by nurturant-involved parenting and by less angry or hostile parenting.

International Endodontic Journal00, 000?000, 2012. Abstract Aim? To compare cells from normal and inflamed human dental pulps regarding the presence of stem cells, their proliferation and differentiation potential. Methodology? Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from normal (DPSC-N) and inflamed dental pulps (DPSC-I). They were compared in respect to proliferation (MTT assay), morphology and STRO-1 expression. STRO-1-positive cells were subject to proliferation (MTT and CFU counting) and morphological analyses and then submitted to odonto-osteogenic, adipogenic and condrogenic differentiation. Differentiated cells were evaluated concerning morphology and the expression, by qRT-PCR, of BSP, LPL and SOX-9 genes. The amount of mineralized matrix produced after odonto-osteogenic differentiation was compared with quantitative Alizarin Red staining. Results? No difference was observed in the morphology and in the proliferation rate of DPSC-N and DPSC-I either before or after separation of STRO-1-positive cells. These cells represented 0.46% (±0.14) and 0.43% (±0.19) of the cell population from normal and inflamed dental pulps, respectively. Both DPSC-N and DPSC-I were capable of differentiating under the three assayed conditions and presented similar patterns for BSP, LPL and SOX-9 expression. Mineralized matrix production was also compatible. In all the quantitative experiments, differences were found between cells from each patient, either from normal or from inflamed pulps. Nonetheless, there was no statistical difference between these two groups. Conclusion? The morphology, proliferation rate and differentiation potential of DPSC-I were similar to the observed in DPSC-N, thus demonstrating that the inflammatory process did not affect the stem cell properties that were assessed.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this prospective, observational cohort study were to examine current practice of analgesia in adults with acute abdominal pain presenting to emergency department (ED), to assess patient?physician agreement on pain severity, and to measure patients? satisfaction with pain management. Methods: Emergency room nurse assessed initial patient's and physician's ranking on a 0?100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) as well as patient's VAS rankings 5min, 15min, and 60min after starting treatment for pain, and on discharge. In patients who received no therapy VAS scores were assessed 5min, 15min, and 60min after initial examination, and on discharge. Patient's satisfaction with pain management on discharge from ED was assessed using a four-point categorical scale in which 1=completely unsatisfied, 2=mostly unsatisfied, 3=mostly satisfied, and 4=completely satisfied. Results: A total of 185 patients were enrolled. Patients? mean initial VAS was higher than physicians? (76±20mm, vs. 59±20mm, p<0.001). Physician's VAS ≥60mm was the sole independent predictor of receiving analgesic therapy (p<0.001). On discharge from ED, 111 patients (60%) were predominantly satisfied with analgesia (satisfaction score ≥3). Drug titration (p=0.026) and decrease in VAS score ≥20mm between initial and discharge score (p<0.001) independently predicted patients? satisfaction. Conclusions: Patients with acute abdominal pain rated pain significantly higher than physicians who's pain estimation in turn tailored analgesia. Only 60% of patients were satisfied with analgesia. Analgesic drug titration and a decrease of ≥20mm on VAS predicted patients? satisfaction.

The first presentation will review recent research findings related to the prevalence and nature of behavioral and cognitive comorbidities as well as their risk and protective factors. Two presentations will focus on underlying biological mechanisms related to behavioral and cognitive co-morbidities. The first will discuss the effects of changes associated with epileptogenesis in the developing brain. The second will address the effects of seizures and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognition with an emphasis on what is happening at the circuit level. Research findings related to remediation of behavioral and cognitive effects in animals will also be discussed. The final presentation will discuss the complexities of addressing behavioral and cognitive problems in the clinical setting and describe strategies for assessing and treating these problems.

AB  - Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive breakdown of striatal neurons. Standard white matter integrity measures like fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging were analyzed in prodromal-HD subjects; however, they studied either a whole brain or specific subcortical white matter structures with connections to cortical motor areas. In this work, we propose a novel analysis of a longitudinal cohort of 243 prodromal-HD individuals and 88 healthy controls who underwent two or more diffusion MRI scans as part of the PREDICT-HD study. We separately trace specific white matter fiber tracts connecting the striatum (caudate and putamen) with four cortical regions corresponding to the hand, face, trunk, and leg motor areas. A multi-tensor tractography algorithm with an isotropic volume fraction compartment allows estimating diffusion of fast-moving extra-cellular water in regions containing crossing fibers and provides quantification of a microstructural property related to tissue atrophy. The tissue atrophy rate is separately analyzed in eight cortico-striatal pathways as a function of CAG-repeats (genetic load) by statistically regressing out age effect from our cohort. The results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in isotropic volume fraction (atrophy) bilaterally in hand fiber connections to the putamen with increasing CAG-repeats, which connects the genetic abnormality (CAG-repeats) to an imaging-based microstructural marker of tissue integrity in specific white matter pathways in HD. Isotropic volume fraction measures in eight cortico-striatal pathways are also correlated significantly with total motor scores and diagnostic confidence levels, providing evidence of their relevance to HD clinical presentation.

AB  - This paper explores the provision of disaster-related behavioural and mental health (DBH) services as a problem of institutional collective action in the United States. This study reviews the challenges that providers have in surmounting multi-organizational disconnects, unstable professional legitimacy, ambiguous information, and shifting disaster needs in developing a system for delivering DBH services. Based on the adaptive governance framework, it argues that existing protocols such as the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) may be helpful in advancing collective action, but that real progress will depend on a recognition of norms, expectations, and credentials across many spheres?in other words, on the ability of responders to continuously adjust their procedures and administrative boundaries for behavioural health institutions.

AB  - Background Evidence-based approaches and early intervention have improved the long-term prognosis of individuals with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the therapeutic processes involved in individual therapy in first-episode psychosis. A comprehensive psychosocial/psychiatric programme for this population, NAVIGATE, includes an individual therapy component, individual resiliency training (IRT). Fidelity of clinicians? adherence to the IRT protocol has been collected to ensure proper implementation of this manual-based intervention. These data can provide insight into the elements of the therapeutic process in this intervention. Materials and Methods To achieve this goal, we first examined the factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale with exploratory factor analysis. Second, we explored the relationships among the IRT fidelity ratings with clinician years of experience and years of education, as well as client's baseline symptom severity and duration of untreated psychosis. Results and Conclusions Results supported a 2-factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale. Correlations between clinician years of education and fidelity ratings were statistically significant.

AB  - Cellular blue nevus is composed of dendritic melanocytes, together with islands of epithelioid and plump spindle cells. We examined 58 cases of blue nevi. Fourteen cases were common blue nevi. The remaining 44 blue nevi were divided into three types according to its silhouettes. These were nodular (type 1, 18 cases), nodular with notch (type 2, 16 cases), and rounded pushing patterns (type 3, 10 cases). Well circumscribed top heavy nodule was observed in type 1, and it was limited to the dermis. Type 2 showed budding appearance into the subcutaneous tissue. Type 3 revealed bottom heavy with downward pushing margin. Both type 2 and type 3 were demonstrated biphasic patterns of epithelioid and spindle cells. Perineural distribution of melanocytes was also observed in type 2 and 3. The size of these types was 3.3?mm in type 1, 4.7?mm in type 2, and 7.4?mm in type 3. The thickness of these types was 1.6?mm in type 1, 2.5?mm in type 2, and 5.2?mm in type 3. Our results suggest that cellular blue nevi may be divided into three stages. Type 1 is its early stage, and may be misinterpreted as common blue nevi.

A total of 279 patients were diagnosed according to the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research. Interrater reliability, calculated by kappa statistics, was found to be between 0.74 and 0.91 on 2-character categories and between 0.64 and 0.90 on 3-character categories except schizotypal disorder (F21). On the 4-character categories, the agreement in the affective states between raters was lower. The reasons are discussed based on cultural differences.

AB  - Summary The Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale (FEATS) is a rating system designed to measure global variables in a specific drawing. This chapter provides an overview of the FEATS and its key principles, and describes some recent projects. The FEATS has 14 equal-appearing interval scales for rating a ?Person Picking an Apple from a Tree? (PPAT). The scales measure global variables, some of which can be applied to other drawings, and several that are specific to the PPAT. Other variables can be measured on nominal scales such as colors used for particular elements, clothing of the person, and action of the person. The key principles of FEATS: numbers can be applied to drawings with considerable precision; art tracks psychological states; and information is obtained from structure. The chapter also discusses some recent developments in FEATS research.

AB  - We sought to determine the clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and pathological features of inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve. Five patients were identified. All cases presented with a gradually progressive mononeuropathy with symptoms of weakness, sensory loss, and prominent neuropathic pain. The median duration of symptoms was 7 months (range 3?36 months). Electrophysiological results were in keeping with chronic axonal mononeuropathies with variable findings of active denervation and reinnervation. MRI demonstrated irregular, large masses involving and surrounding nerve with heterogenous signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted and post-contrast sequences. Histopathological features of the nerve slightly varied but shared commonalities including chronic inflammatory infiltrates, increased collagen, and increased numbers of microvessels. Axonal degeneration and decreased density of myelinated fibers were also noted. Three patients were treated with weekly courses of intravenous steroids for 3 months. All reported improvement in pain and weakness. Inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve is not a neoplasm and has reactive features of inflammation, increased vascularity, and marked fibrosis. It presents as a progressive axonal mononeuropathy with weakness, sensory loss, and pain that may be episodic. The primary pathophysiology is unknown but the inflammation and response to treatment suggests that there may be an immune component.

AB  - Abstract Biocompatible tissue growth has excellent prospects for tissue engineering. These tissues are built over scaffolds, which can influence aspects such as cell adhesion, proliferation rate, morphology, and differentiation. However, the ideal 3D biological structure has not been developed yet. Here, we applied the electro-hydrodynamic jet (E-jet) 3D printing technology using poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) solution to print varied culture platforms for engineered tissue structures. The effects of different parameters (electrical voltage, plotting speed, and needle sizes) on the outcome were investigated. We compared the biological compatibility of the 3D printed culture platforms with that of random fibers. Finally, we used the 3D-printed PLGA platforms to culture fibroblasts, the main cellular components of loose connective tissue. The results show that the E-jet printed platforms could guide and improve cell growth. These highly aligned fibers were able to support cellular alignment and proliferation. Cell angle was consistent with the direction of the fibers, and cells cultured on these fibers showed a much faster migration, potentially enhancing wound healing performance. Thus, the potential of this technology for 3D biological printing is large. This process can be used to grow biological scaffolds for the engineering of tissues. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Delays in commencing adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer beyond 12 weeks are associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study was to identify factors delaying chemotherapy in an inner metropolitan, outer metropolitan, small rural and large rural cancer centre in New South Wales, Australia. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 400 consecutive patients that received adjuvant chemotherapy for stages I?III breast cancer. We evaluated factors affecting time from primary and definitive surgery until commencing chemotherapy. Results The primary factor associated with chemotherapy delays was the geographic location of the cancer centre. The median time from primary surgery to chemotherapy was longer for the large rural centre (median 58 days), compared with the outer metropolitan (45 days), small rural (39 days) and inner metropolitan centre (33 days). Treatment delays in the large rural centre were associated with higher rates of multiple operations (43% versus 31% elsewhere), mainly because of more staged axillary dissections (34% versus 19%), and longer time from definitive surgery to oncology assessment. Conclusion Patients in the large rural centre, who are served by fly-in medical oncology services, are more likely to experience delays in receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Strategies to reduce delays include use of intraoperative frozen section analysis, multidisciplinary meetings, improving efficiency in pathology reporting and employment of a breast cancer care coordinator and an on-site medical oncologist.

AB  - Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (>3·8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2? resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2? and NO3? generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3·5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2·0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2?. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2·0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2·0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1·0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx.per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).
