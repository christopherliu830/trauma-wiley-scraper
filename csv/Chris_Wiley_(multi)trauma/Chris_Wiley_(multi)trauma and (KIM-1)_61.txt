AB  - Abstract Background Delays in commencing adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer beyond 12 weeks are associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study was to identify factors delaying chemotherapy in an inner metropolitan, outer metropolitan, small rural and large rural cancer centre in New South Wales, Australia. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 400 consecutive patients that received adjuvant chemotherapy for stages I?III breast cancer. We evaluated factors affecting time from primary and definitive surgery until commencing chemotherapy. Results The primary factor associated with chemotherapy delays was the geographic location of the cancer centre. The median time from primary surgery to chemotherapy was longer for the large rural centre (median 58 days), compared with the outer metropolitan (45 days), small rural (39 days) and inner metropolitan centre (33 days). Treatment delays in the large rural centre were associated with higher rates of multiple operations (43% versus 31% elsewhere), mainly because of more staged axillary dissections (34% versus 19%), and longer time from definitive surgery to oncology assessment. Conclusion Patients in the large rural centre, who are served by fly-in medical oncology services, are more likely to experience delays in receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Strategies to reduce delays include use of intraoperative frozen section analysis, multidisciplinary meetings, improving efficiency in pathology reporting and employment of a breast cancer care coordinator and an on-site medical oncologist.

AB  - Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (>3·8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2? resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2? and NO3? generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3·5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2·0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2?. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2·0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2·0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1·0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx.per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).

AB  - BACKGROUND Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for emotional distress symptoms, but symptom comorbidity has not been previously examined. This study examined distress profiles for adult survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. METHODS Self-reported depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms from Brief Symptom Inventory 18 were examined in survivors (n = 16,079) and siblings (n = 3085) from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. A latent profile analysis identified clusters of survivors with individual and comorbid symptoms. Disease, treatment, and demographic predictors of distress comorbidity patterns were examined with multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS Four clinically relevant profiles were identified: low distress on all subscales (asymptomatic, 62%), high distress on all subscales (comorbid distress, 11%), elevated somatization (somatic symptoms, 13%), and elevated depression and anxiety (affective distress, 14%). Compared with siblings, fewer survivors were asymptomatic (62% vs 74%, P < .0001), and more had comorbid distress (11% vs 5%, P < .0001). Survivors of leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.61), central nervous system tumors (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), and sarcoma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57) had a greater risk of comorbid distress than survivors of solid tumors. Psychoactive medications were associated with comorbid distress (P < .0001), and this suggested that this group was refractory to traditional medical management. Comorbid distress was associated with poor perceived health (OR, 31.7; 95% CI, 23.1-43.3), headaches (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7), and bodily pain (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.2-5.0). CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of survivors are at risk for comorbid distress, which may require extensive treatment approaches beyond those used for individual symptoms.

AB  - An eight-year-old, spayed, female golden retriever was presented with progressive right hindlimb lameness and polyuria/polydipsia. Multiple soft tissue masses were palpable within the hindlimb muscles. A tentative diagnosis of sarcoma was made on fine needle aspiration. A computed tomography scan of the hindlimb and thorax confirmed the presence and location of the masses, none of which were associated with the bones of the hindlimb. In addition, two pulmonary lesions were identified in the right cranial lung lobe. A diagnosis of chondrosarcoma was confirmed on histopathology with a final diagnosis of extraskeletal chondrosarcoma. A high, hindlimb amputation was performed, and chemotherapy was initiated. Polyuria and polydipsia resolved 2 weeks postoperatively. Numerous lung lesions, suspected to be metastases were found on routine followup radiographs, 73 days post surgery after which the dog was lost to follow-up.

AB  - Abstract The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Apheresis Applications Committee is charged with a review and categorization of indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (fourth edition), the subcommittee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Fifth ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by refining the category definitions and by adding a grade of recommendation based on widely accepted GRADE system. The concept of a fact sheet was introduced in the Fourth edition and is only slightly modified in this current edition. The fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis. The article consists of 59 fact sheets devoted to each disease entity currently categorized by the ASFA as category I through III. Category IV indications are also listed. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract The effect of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands on free radical production was investigated in primary cultures of rat brain astrocytes and neurons as well as in BV-2 microglial cell lines using the fluorescent dye dichlorofluorescein-diacetate. Free radical production was measured at 2, 30, 60 and 120?min of treatment with the PBR ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) (all at 10?nm). In astrocytes, all ligands showed a significant increase in free radical production at 2?min. The increase was short-lived with PK11195, whereas with Ro5-4864 it persisted for at least 2?h. PpIX caused an increase at 2 and 30?min, but not at 2?h. Similar results were observed in microglial cells. In neurons, PK11195 and PpIX showed an increase in free radical production only at 2?min; Ro5-4864 had no effect. The central-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand, clonazepam, was ineffective in eliciting free radical production in all cell types. As the PBR may be a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, and free radical production may occur following induction of the MPT, we further investigated whether cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of the MPT, could prevent free radical formation by PBR ligands. CsA (1?µm) completely blocked free radical production following treatment with PK11195 and Ro5-4864 in all cell types. CsA was also effective in blocking free radical production in astrocytes following PpIX treatment, but it failed to do so in neurons and microglia. Our results indicate that exposure of neural cells to PBR ligands generates free radicals, and that the MPT may be involved in this process.

AB  - A multimethod, multi-informant design was used to examine links among sociodemographic risk, family adversity, parenting quality, and child adjustment in families experiencing homelessness. Participants were 245 homeless parents (Mage = 31.0, 63.6% African American) and their 4- to 6-year-old children (48.6% male). Path analyses revealed unique associations by risk domain: Higher sociodemographic risk predicted more externalizing behavior and poorer teacher?child relationships, whereas higher family adversity predicted more internalizing behavior. Parenting quality was positively associated with peer acceptance and buffered effects of family adversity on internalizing symptoms, consistent with a protective effect. Parenting quality was associated with lower externalizing behavior only when sociodemographic risk was below the sample mean. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background The present study assessed the feasibility of delivering peer support for couples coping with prostate cancer within a trial design. Methods/Design Ten peer volunteers completed training in research protocols and delivering tele-based couples support to men with prostate cancer and their partners. Twenty couples received an eight session intervention and were assessed before surgery and 3 and 6?months subsequently for adjustment outcomes. A focus group investigated the peers' experiences. Results Peers were motivated by altruism, a belief in research, and reported personal growth. The research protocol at times conflicted with lay models of helping, and the focus on sexuality and couples was challenging. Distress decreased over time but more so for partners; unmet sexuality needs did not improve. Conclusion Peer support appears promising as a model to support couples facing prostate cancer.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - Abstract In a rat model of spinal cord compression-induced injury, we have tested the hypothesis that intrathecally administered methylprednisolone will improve long-term recovery of the injured rats. The effect of the treatment was evaluated quantitatively as 1, behavioral testing of spontaneous locomotion and 2, morphometric measurement of the tissue loss in the white matter and grey matter, respectively. Intrathecal methylprednisolone elicited remarkable motor reactions in the paraplegic animals immediately after administration. However, during 4 weeks' survival, no significant differences were observed in the parameters of recovery between the methylprednisolone-treated and placebo-treated group. We conclude that intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone had no effect on the outcome after compressive spinal cord injury in the rat at the doses and timing used in the present study.
