AB  - A multimethod, multi-informant design was used to examine links among sociodemographic risk, family adversity, parenting quality, and child adjustment in families experiencing homelessness. Participants were 245 homeless parents (Mage = 31.0, 63.6% African American) and their 4- to 6-year-old children (48.6% male). Path analyses revealed unique associations by risk domain: Higher sociodemographic risk predicted more externalizing behavior and poorer teacher?child relationships, whereas higher family adversity predicted more internalizing behavior. Parenting quality was positively associated with peer acceptance and buffered effects of family adversity on internalizing symptoms, consistent with a protective effect. Parenting quality was associated with lower externalizing behavior only when sociodemographic risk was below the sample mean. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Background/Aims:? Procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a new marker of severe infection and sepsis. In this study, we investigated the serum levels of PCT during the hemodialysis (HD) in chronically hemodialyzed patients and whether the PCT levels were correlated with other cytokines. Methods:? We measured pre- and post-HD PCT, interleukin (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations in 24 stable patients undergoing chronic HD [11 males and 13 females; age 41.2?±?18.0 years, 12?h/week, with a Kt/V of 1.41?±?0.35, polysynthane (PSN) membrane being used in all patients, without reuse]. Pre- and post-HD PCT concentrations were compared with cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and clinical parameters including age, blood pressure, leukocyte, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), epoetin (EPO) doses, BUN, creatinine, parathormone (PTH), ferritin, and transferrin levels. Results:? Pre- and post-HD serum PCT levels were similar (0.77?±?0.40 and 0.83?±?0.61 ng/mL), and higher than upper normal level of 0.5?ng/mL. The levels of IL-2 and IL-10 decreased and the levels of IL-1 and TNF-α increased. Post-HD PCT correlated with PTH, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10. Conclusion:? About 60% of patients had elevated PCT levels, HD with low-flux PSN membrane did not change serum PCT and IL-6. While IL-1 and TNF-α increased, IL-2 and IL-10 decreased by PSN membrane during HD. So that PCT levels can be measured just after HD as do prior to start of HD. Is there any relationship between PCT and PTH? PCT may be important in uremic bone disease.

AB  - Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. started its nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) program in September 1997. Purpose of study:? To evaluate episodes of exit site infections, catheter sepsis, safety, and longevity of accesses for patients doing NHHD. Methods:? If IJ catheter was chosen, patient was started on Coumadin 2?mg/day when catheter was placed. If catheter malfunctioned, it was locked with a thrombolytic agent and Coumadin was adjusted to meet a goal INR of 1.5?2.25. If the problem persisted, the catheter was exchanged. For catheters, the B-D InterLink device was used to prevent air emboli and infection, and a locking device was used to prevent disconnects. If AV fistula was used, 4 buttonholes were established using 16 gauge needles. If AV graft was used, patients were taught the ladder cannulation technique using 16 gauge needles. Results:? As of September 1, 2003, 45 patients have completed training and have performed 27,063 treatments at home. Total catheter time at home was 930 months. Total AV fistula and AV graft time at home was 190 and 20 months, respectively. Upon completion of training, 34 patients were using tunneled IJ catheters, 10 using AV fistulas, and 1 using an AV graft. The IJ catheter exit site and sepsis infection rate was 0.35 and 0.49 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Average catheter life was 8.5 months with the longest 66.7 months and the shortest 0.2 months. The AV fistula and graft exit site and sepsis infection rates were 0.16 and 0 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Catheter complications included 1 episode of disconnect due to patient's failure to use locking device, 1 episode of central stenosis, and 1 episode of intracranial hemorrhage, due to prolonged INR, with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:? Data support that tunneled IJ catheters, AV fistulas, and AV grafts were effective and safe permanent accesses for patients on NHHD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Interaction between keratinocytes and fibroblasts plays a critical role in maintaining skin integrity under both normal and pathological conditions. We have previously demonstrated that keratinocyte-releasable factors influence the expression of key extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and matrix metalloproteinases in dermal fibroblasts. In this study, we utilized DNA microarray analysis to examine the effects of keratinocyte-releasable factors on the expression of several cytokines in human dermal fibroblasts. The results revealed significantly higher granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) expression in fibroblasts co-cultured with keratinocytes relative to mono-cultured cells, which was verified by RT-PCR and western blot. G-CSF is an important hematopoietic factor also thought to play a beneficial role in wound healing through stimulating keratinocyte proliferation. To partially characterize the keratinocyte-releasable factors responsible for stimulating G-CSF production, keratinocyte-conditioned medium (KCM) was subjected to thermal treatment and ammonium sulfate precipitation before treating fibroblasts. The results showed that keratinocyte-releasable G-CSF-stimulating factors remain stable at 56°C and upon 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation. Knowing that keratinocytes release IL-1, which stimulates G-CSF expression in various immune cells, several experiments were conducted to ask whether this might also be the case for fibroblasts. The results showed that the addition of recombinant IL-1 markedly increased G-CSF expression in fibroblasts; however, IL-1 receptor antagonist only partially abrogated KCM-stimulated G-CSF expression, indicating the role of additional keratinocyte-releasable factors. These findings underline the importance of cross-talk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts, suggesting that communication between these cells in vivo modulates the production of cytokines required for cutaneous wound healing and maintenance.

AB  - Abstract Aim To assess patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), aesthetics and stability of root coverage procedures from a previous 6-month RCT after 1 year. Material & Methods Forty-five patients (90 recessions) had received a coronally advanced flap (CAF = control) only or a xenogeneic collagen matrix in addition (CAF + CMX = test). Visual analogue scales (VAS) and questionnaires were used for PROMs and the root coverage aesthetic score (RES) for professional aesthetic evaluations. Results VAS scores (patient satisfaction) amounted to 8.58 ± 1.86 (test) versus 8.38 ± 2.46 (control). Six patients preferred CAF + CMX concerning surgical procedure and aesthetics, six preferred CAF and 29 were equally satisfied. RES was 7.85 ± 2.42 for the test group versus 7.34 ± 2.90 for the controls. Root coverage (RC) was 76.28% for test and 75.05% for control defects. The mean increase in keratinized tissue width was higher in test (from 1.97 to 3.02 mm) than in controls (from 2.00 to 2.64 mm) (p = 0.0413). Likewise, test sites showed more gain in gingival thickness (0.52 mm) than control sites (0.27 mm) (p = 0.0023). Compared to 6 months, clinical outcomes were stable. Conclusions Results for PROMs, RES and RC did not significantly differ between treatment groups. Thickness and width of keratinized tissue were enhanced following CAF + CMX compared to CAF alone.

AB  - Abstract The ?first night effect? (FNE) is the alteration of sleep architecture observed on the first night of polysomnographic (PSG) studies. It is unclear whether the FNE reflects adaptation to the equipment, sleeping environment, or both. Moreover, it is possible that certain patient populations, such as those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), demonstrate greater adaptation effects that are highly context dependent. We assessed FNE in participants with PTSD and healthy controls in a cross-sectional study consisting of PSG testing at home and in the hospital. Contrary to our expectations, the PTSD group showed no adaptation effects in either setting. Only the control group assigned to the ?hospital first? condition showed significant decreases in total sleep time on night 1 versus night 2 of the study. The results suggest that the FNE is related to adaptation to the combination of the hospital environment and the recording equipment.

AB  - Retinoic X receptor-b (RXR-b) is a heterodimerization partner for vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 activation of VDR leads to growth inhibition in numerous cell lines, including some melanoma lines. Evaluation of VDR and RXR-b expression in vivo in melanocytic neoplasms will increase our understanding of this pathways potential role in growth control. Previous studies in our laboratory showed decreased VDR expression in superficially invasive melanoma, and progressive loss of expression in deeply invasive melanomas and metastatic melanomas (MET). We next sought to evaluate RXR-b expression. Twenty-eight melanocytic neoplasms including 8 melanomas in situ (MIS), 9 primary invasive melanomas (PIM), and 11 MET were evaluated for RXR-b expression by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear labeling was assessed as 0 (0%), 1+(<5%), 2+(>5% but <50%), or 3+(>=50%). A significant increase in RXR-b expression from low (0?1+) to high (>1+) was found when comparing MIS to PIM and MET (chi2 p?<?0.05). These data suggest: 1) potential loss of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced growth inhibition during melanoma progression may be due to decreased VDR expression without concomitant loss of RXR-b; and 2) increased RXR-b expression during melanoma progression may offer selective advantage through alternative signaling pathways.

AB  - Summary Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but despite its proven therapeutic efficacy, the molecular mechanisms of action are not fully understood. The present study was undertaken to explore lithium effects of the MEK/ERK cascade of protein kinases in astrocytes and neurons. In asynchronously proliferating rat cortical astrocytes, lithium decreased time- and dose-dependently the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, with 1?mm concentrations achieving 60 and 50% inhibition of ERK and MEK, respectively, after a 7-day exposure. Lithium also inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest. In serum-deprived, quiescent astrocytes, pre-exposure to lithium resulted in the inhibition of cell cycle re-entry as stimulated by the mitogen endothelin-1: under this experimental setting, lithium did not affect the rapid, peak phosphorylation of MEK taking place after 3?5?min, but was effective in inhibiting the long-term, sustained phosphorylation of MEK. Lithium inhibition of the astrocyte MEK/ERK pathway was independent of inositol depletion. Further, compound SB216763 inhibited Tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and stabilized cytosolic ?-catenin, consistent with the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?), but failed to reproduce lithium effects on MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest. In cerebellar granule neurons, millimolar concentrations of lithium enhanced MEK and ERK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, again through an inositol and GSK-3? independent mechanism. These opposing effects in astrocytes and neurons make lithium treatment a promising strategy to favour neural repair and reduce reactive gliosis after traumatic injury.

AB  - Background: Recurrent nevi may histologically resemble malignant melanoma Design: Recurrent nevi with clinical history, original melanocytic neoplasm and recurrence were included. Proliferation marker Ki-67 was used when residual and recurrent nevus was present on the same slide. Results: There were 356 biopsies from 328 patients (ages 6 to 93 years (mean?=?31), female: male?=?255:101, time to recurrence 1?63 months (mean?=?7.85)). Sites: back (170), abdomen (46), arm (46), leg (34), head and neck (26), chest (26), and buttock (8). Initial biopsies: 208 nevi, 142 dysplastic nevi, 1 blue, 1 pigmented spindle cell, 2 Spitz nevi, and 2 melanomas in situ. 3 patterns of recurrence were observed: 1) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with epidermal effacement and scar, 2) compound melanocytic proliferation with epidermal effacement and scar, and 3) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with retained retiform epidermis. Recurrent and residual nevi had similar proliferation rates. Conclusion: Recurrent nevi occurred more commonly in females and on the trunk. Cytologic atypia, asymmetry, and retention of retiform epidermis were worrisome histologic features. Clinical history, effacement of the epidermis and limitation of changes to the scar, distinguished recurrence from melanoma. Low proliferation rate may be a useful adjunct to distinguish recurrent nevi from melanoma.

AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

AB  - Intra-site prophylactic vancomycin in spine surgery is an effective method of decreasing the incidence of postsurgical wound infection. However, there are differences in the prophylactic programs used for various spinal surgeries. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using intra-wound vancomycin during spinal surgery and to explore the effects of dose-dependence and the method of administration in a subgroup analysis. A total of 628 citations or studies were searched in PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Google Scholar that were published before August 2016 with the terms ?local vancomycin?, ?intra-wound vancomycin?, ?intraoperative vancomycin?, ?intra-site vancomycin?, ?topical vancomycin?, ?spine surgery?, and ?spinal surgery?. Finally, 19 retrospective cohort studies and one prospective case study were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The odds of developing postsurgical wound infection without prophylactic local vancomycin use were 2.83-fold higher than the odds of experiencing wound infection with the use of intra-wound vancomycin (95% confidence interval, 2.03?3.95; P = 0.083; I2 = 32.2%). The subgroup analysis including the dosage and the method of administration, revealed different results compared to previous research. The value of I2 in the 1-g group was 27.2%, which was much lower than in the 2-g group (I2 = 57.6%). At the same time, the value of I2 was 0.0% (P = 0.792, OR = 2.70) when vancomycin powder was directly sprinkled into all layers of the wound. However, there is high heterogenicity (I2 = 60.0%, P = 0.007, OR = 2.83) when vancomycin powder is not exposed to the bone graft and instrumentation. There are differences found with the method of local application of vancomycin for reducing postoperative wounds and further studies are necessary, including investigations focusing on the dose-dependent effects during spinal or the topical pharmacokinetic and other orthopaedic surgeries.
