AB  - Abstract Background The medial sural artery perforator (MSAP) flap shows advantages for reconstruction in the foot and ankle, where bulk is a liability. We evaluated the versatility of this flap and provide further evidence on its use for covering small-to-moderate size defects by comparing the outcome depending on the region of reconstruction. Methods Twenty-two patients with variable defects of 4 ? 4 to 18 ? 7 cm underwent MSAP flap reconstruction. Final outcomes of all patients were evaluated 12-months postoperatively using the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot, midfoot and hallux scale for clinical-functional evaluation, and the SF-36 health survey for quality-of-life measurement. The scores were compared in three groups according to the anatomic region of MSAP flap reconstruction. Results The flap size ranged between 6 ? 4 and 21 ? 9 cm. One venous congestion was salvaged by venous thrombectomy and reanastomosis, and one marginal flap necrosis healed by secondary intention. All flaps survived, and all patients returned to ambulation. Patients with reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux showed significantly lower AOFAS ankle-hindfoot (P?=?0.021) or hallux scores (P?=?0.034), whereas reconstruction of the midfoot led to equal AOFAS midfoot scores (P?=?0.265) as compared with patients without reconstruction in the respective region. Comparison of SF-36 physical (P?=?0.936) and mental (P?=?0.855) scores of all three regions remained insignificant. Conclusion The MSAP flap provides thin soft tissue coverage, enabling good functional recovery after defect reconstruction all around the foot and ankle, with evident advantages in the midfoot. However, the functional outcomes after reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux region depend on the preexistent functional impairment.

AB  - SUMMARY Calcium plays a central role as a second messenger in plant and fungal cells and as such is involved in controlling numerous biological processes. Direct demonstration of signal-response coupling via Ca2+ requires the measurement and localization of changes in cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, during these processes in living cells. In recent years this has become possible with the introduction of a range of fluorescent dyes (e.g. Indo-1 Fura-2 and Fluo-3) which have a high affinity and selectivity for free Ca2+. When used with recently developed microscope technologies (e.g. fluorescence ratio imaging or confocal scanning laser microscopy), subcellular localization and precise quantification of [Ca2+]i dynamics in single cells can be achieved. This review describes the principles of [Ca2+]i imaging and measurement using fluorescent dyes, the equipment required to do it, the problems with botanical material and how they are being overcome, future developments for this approach in plant cell biology, and an entirely different strategy for the imaging and measurement of [Ca2+]i involving genetic transformation with the aequorin gene.

AB  - Abstract In response to a call to better integrate culture in community psychology (O'Donnell in American Journal of Community Psychology 37:1?7 2006), we offer a cultural-community framework to facilitate a collaborative engagement between community psychologists and ethnic minority communities, focusing on Asian American communities as illustrations. Extending Hays' (Addressing cultural complexities in practice: Assessment, diagnosis, and therapy, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 2008) ADDRESSING framework for considering cultural influences on a counseling relationship, the proposed framework provides a broad but systematic guidepost for considering three major cultural-ecological influences on Asian American communities: Race and Ethnicity (R), Culture (C), and Immigration and Transnational Ties (I). We provide a sequence of steps that incorporate the ADDRESSING and the RCI frameworks to facilitate the collaborative community-based research or social action.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe a protocol for the measurement of tibial rotational alignment using CT multiplanar reconstructions. To establish the feasibility of producing general guidelines for the amount of torsional contouring to apply to a bone plate applied to the medial aspect of the tibia during repair of a non-reducible tibial fracture. METHODS CT scans of the pelvic limbs of 15 chondrodystrophic and 34 non-chondrodystrophic dogs were studied. Medial tibial cortex torsion angle and distal medial tibial cortex angle were determined from CT multiplanar reconstructions. Medial plate application was simulated using a plate contoured to the group mean medial tibial cortex torsion angle and post-simulation tibial rotational alignment was assessed. RESULTS Mean medial tibial cortex torsion angles were 23° (chondrodystrophic) and 26° (non-chondrodystrophic). Following simulated plate application the change in medial tibial cortex torsion was less than 10° in 73% of chondrodystrophic and 93% of non-chondrodystrophic tibias. In total, 93% of chondrodystrophic and 97% of non-chondrodystrophic tibias had post-simulation distal medial tibial cortex angle less than 10° from the group mean pre-simulation distal medial tibial cortex angle. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Medial tibial cortex torsion and tibial rotational alignment can be measured using the protocol described in this study. 26° of internal torsional tibial plate pre-contouring may be appropriate for non-chondrodystrophic dogs, but further clinical validation is required.

The goals of the symposium are: 1)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of acute provoked seizures in children with congenital heart disease, CNS and non-CNS neoplasms, and organ transplantation. 2)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of chronic epilepsy in these patients, including interactions between anti-epileptic drugs and anti-arrhythmic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressive agents. 3)? Recognize opportunities for translational research in this area, including neuro-protection, pharmacology and immunology.

AB  - Abstract Endothelins (ETs) contribute to the sensory changes seen in animals models of inflammatory, cancer and diabetic neuropathic pain, but little is known about their nociceptive role following peripheral nerve injury. The current study evaluated mechanisms by which ETs can drive changes in nociceptive responses to thermal stimulation of the hind paw of rats induced by unilateral lumbar L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) injury. SNL sensitizes rats to acetone-evoked cooling of and radiant heat application (Hargreaves test) to the ipsilateral hind paw (throughout 3?40 and 9?40 days after surgery, respectively). At 12 days after SNL, intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10 pmol) induces greater overt nociception that was reduced only by treatment with the selective ETA peptidic antagonist (BQ-123, 10 nmol, i.pl), but unchanged by the selective ETB peptidic antagonist (BQ-788). Cold allodynia evoked by cooling the ipsilateral hind paw with acetone was reduced by i.pl. injection of both antagonists BQ-123 or BQ-788 (3 or 10 nmol). In contrast, heat hyperalgesia evaluated by Hargreaves method was reduced only by BQ-123. SNL enhanced the [Ca+2] i increases induced by ET-1 (100 nM) in neurons from L5/L6 (injured) and L4 (intact) cultured dorsal root ganglion, but did not change the responses of non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that SNL increased ETA and ETB receptor protein expression in spinal nerves. Thus, SNL induces marked hind paw hypersensitivity to thermal stimulation in part via up-regulation of peripheral sensory nerve pronociceptive ETA and ETB receptor-operated mechanisms.

AB  - Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN-IV) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually begins in infancy and is characterized by anhidrosis, insensitivity to noxious stimuli leading to self-mutilating behavior, and intellectual disability. HSAN-IV is caused by mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene, NTRK1, encoding the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF) which maps to chromosome 1q21-q22. Patients with HSAN-IV lack all NGF-dependent neurons, the primary afferents and sympathetic postganglionic neurons leading to lack of pain sensation and the presence of anhidrosis, respectively. Herein, we report nine patients from nine unrelated families with HSAN-IV due to various mutations in NTRK1, five of which are novel. These are three missense and two nonsense mutations distributed in various domains of NTRK1 involved in binding of NGF. The affected patients had variable intellectual deficits, and some had delayed diagnosis of HSAN-IV. In addition to being the first report of HSAN-IV from the Arabian Peninsula, this report expands the mutational spectrum of patients with NTRK1 mutations and provides further insights for molecular and clinical diagnosis.

A new term, ?evidence-based clinical algorithms? is suggested to encompass evidence-based information codified into clinical pathways, clinical practice guidelines, and clinical decision rules. Examples of poor knowledge translation (KT) relevant to the specialty of emergency medicine are identified, followed by brief descriptions of important research and concepts that inform the research recommendations. Four broad themes for research to improve the KT of evidence-based clinical algorithms are suggested: organizational factors, cognitive factors, social factors, and motivational factors. In all cases, research regarding optimizing KT for the subthemes identified by Glasziou and Haynes, ?getting the evidence straight,? and ?getting the evidence used,? are interwoven into the thematic research recommendations. Consensus was reached that the majority of research efforts to evaluate means to improve KT need to be centered on the factors that show promise to enhance ?getting the evidence used,? focused especially on organizational factors.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - Objective? To explore why South African women still abort outside designated services where there is substantial legal service provision. Design? Descriptive study. Setting? Three hospitals in Gauteng Province in South Africa. Sample? Forty-six women attending hospital with incomplete abortion who had abortions induced outside of designated facilities. Methods? An interviewer-administered questionnaire with open and closed questions was completed. Induction status was determined from answers to a set of closed questions. Open-ended questions explored the circumstances of induction. Main focus of interviews? Methods of induction used, barriers to legal service use. Results? Nearly two-thirds of women (n= 38) had self-induced or had consulted a traditional healer. A minority of these women (n= 11) indicated that they did this because they experienced barriers to legal service use. For others it was presented as a ?natural? response to a health problem (unwanted pregnancy). Several women (n= 10) were given misoprostol by a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. Fifty-four percent of the women had not used legal services because they did not know about the law, while 15% knew of their legal rights, but did not know of a legal facility. Others did know where to access legal services but feared rude staff (17%) or breaches of confidentiality (6.5%). Others (6.5%) had been unable to get a legal abortion early enough in pregnancy to comply with the law. Conclusions? Lack of information on abortion rights under the Act and perceived poor quality of designated facilities were the most important barriers to access and should be addressed by policymakers and health service management. The willingness of women to self-medicate and visit traditional healers in these circumstances may influence the overall ability of the new legislation to reduce abortion morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNALys aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.

AB  - Abstract Aim Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute paediatric vasculitis. The psychosocial consequences of this sudden illness for parents are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate health related quality of life (HRQOL) and parental perceptions of child vulnerability (PPCV) in parents of children with KD, and to identify variables associated with PPCV. Methods This cross-sectional study included 288 parents (83% mothers) of KD patients (mean age 8.7 years). HRQOL was assessed using the TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Adult's HRQOL (TAAQOL) and PPCV using the Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS). Scores of KD parents were compared with reference groups of Dutch parents. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associated variables. Results The HRQOL of KD parents was comparable to the HRQOL of parents of healthy children. However, KD parents showed significantly higher PPCV, regarding both the median CVS total score and the percentage in the clinical range. No differences were found in CVS outcomes between KD parents and parents of a chronically ill child. None of the studied parental, child and disease characteristics were significantly associated with PPCV. Conclusion Parents perceived their KD child more vulnerable to illness than healthy children, while in reality the majority had fully recovered from KD.
