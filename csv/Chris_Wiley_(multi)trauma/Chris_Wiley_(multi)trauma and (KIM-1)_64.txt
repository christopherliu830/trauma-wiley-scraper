AB  - Background:? The need for prevention to reduce the number of occupational hand eczema is high. Occupational hand eczema is the most frequently recognised work-related disease in Denmark. Previous findings have shown that almost half of all cases develop a chronic condition with persistent dermatitis, and the annual cost to society is immense. Aims:? The aim of this study was to survey the trends and development of occupational hand eczema in Denmark and thereby help to ensure future successful prevention of chronic disabling occupational hand eczema. Methods:? 758 patients with recognised occupational hand eczema were included prospectively in the period October 2001- November 2002. Data on diagnoses, disease duration, severity, absence from work and occupation was obtained from The Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries and an additional questionnaire was administered by mail. Results:? 621 patients answered the questionnaire (response rate 82%). Irritant contact dermatitis was the most frequent diagnosis and the female/male ratio was 2:1. High prevalence was found in particularly wet occupations. 19 per cent had sick leave more than 5 weeks per year and the mean disease duration was 4.8 years (median 2.1 years). 68.2% had chronic changes. Conclusion:? The results showed a marked gender difference in the pattern of diagnosis and occupation. The impact of occupational hand eczema is still high with prolonged absence from work and a high percentage of chronic disease. The results of the study give important suggestions for future preventive strategies for health authorities.

AB  - Abstract Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNALys aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.

AB  - Abstract For decades, clinical psychologists have catalogued cultural group differences in symptom presentation, assessment, and treatment outcomes. We know that ?culture matters? in mental health ? but do we know how it matters, or why? Answers may be found in an integration of cultural and clinical psychology. Cultural psychology demands a move beyond description to explanation of group variation. For its part, clinical psychology insists on the importance of individual people, while also extending the range of human variation. Cultural?clinical psychology integrates these approaches, opening up new lines of inquiry. The central assumption of this interdisciplinary field is that culture, mind, and brain constitute one another as a multi-level dynamic system in which no level is primary, and that psychopathology is an emergent property of that system. We illustrate cultural?clinical psychology research using our work on depression in Chinese populations and conclude with a call for greater collaboration among researchers in this field.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Abstract Recent evidence suggests the aging process is accelerated by HIV. Degradation of white matter (WM) has been independently associated with HIV and healthy aging. Thus, WM may be vulnerable to joint effects of HIV and aging. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was conducted with HIV-seropositive (n = 72) and HIV-seronegative (n = 34) adults. DWI data underwent tractography, which was parcellated into 18 WM tracts of interest (TOIs). Functional Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Tract Statistics (FADTTS) regression was conducted assessing the joint effect of advanced age and HIV on fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) along TOI fibers. In addition to main effects of age and HIV on WM microstructure, the interactive effect of age and HIV was significantly related to lower FA and higher MD, AD, and RD across all TOIs. The location of findings was consistent with the clinical presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. While older age is related to poorer WM microstructure, its detrimental effect on WM is stronger among HIV+ relative to HIV? individuals. Loss of WM integrity in the context of advancing age may place HIV+ individuals at increased risk for brain and cognitive compromise.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study was an ex vivo evaluation of the marginal adaptation of mineral trioxide aggregate as an apical barrier using teeth with an open apex and scanning electron microscopy. Materials and methods Eighteen single-rooted human teeth were used. An artificial open apex was created using Gates Glidden drills #6?1 in a crown-down manner until the #1 bur passed through the foramen. A 1.36-mm divergent open apex was created at the foramen by retrograde apical transportation using a #40 Profile 0.6 taper instrument inserted to the length of the cutting blade. The teeth were divided into four groups (n = 4), and two teeth served as controls. The GI = mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was placed as a 5-mm-thick apical barrier without removal of the smear layer; GII = MTA was placed with indirect ultrasonic activation; GIII = apical plug was placed after removal of the smear layer without indirect ultrasonic activation; and GIV = MTA was placed with indirect ultrasonic activation, but the smear layer had been previously removed. The root apices were visualized with SEM (1000?), and 12 predetermined material/dentine interface points were measured (gaps). One-way anova and Bonferroni's post hoc tests were used to compare the linear measurements of the gaps between the groups. Results GIV had the lowest gap when compared with other groups, and no statistical differences were found among GI, GII, and GIII. Conclusions The technique of MTA placement using passive ultrasonic vibration in association with smear layer removal improved the marginal adaptation of the material.

AB  - The presence of persistently high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is well known to be associated with a state of inflammation, malnutrition, and erythropoietin resistance in hemodialysis (HD) population. Meanwhile, a substantial group of patients present with intermittent elevations of CRP levels, and its clinical consequences are unclear. We designed this study to compare the inflammatory and nutritional parameters and erythropoietin requirements in HD patients with persistent or intermittent CRP elevation and those with CRP levels in without. We included 100 HD patients [age: 48.4?±?14.3 years; HD duration: 69.3?±?49.0 months (minimum 12 months)]. The 6-month retrospective clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the patient records, and those with chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, infectious complications, and surgery were excluded. The monthly determined CRP levels (at least 6 for each patient) were reviewed, and the patients were grouped according to their CRP levels as those with persistent (group 1), intermittent (at least one level of CRP?10?mg/L) (group 2), and those with CRP in normal ranges set by the laboratory (group 3). We compared the fibrinogen, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, albumin, prealbumin, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct results of the patient groups. The patient groups revealed significant differences in terms of fibrinogen (p?<?0.001), albumin (p?<?0.0001), prealbumin (p?<?0.007), ICAM-1 (p?<?00.2) levels and nPCR (p?<?0.03), IDWG (p?<?0.02), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct (p?<?0.03) values. Group 2 presented to be in risk of inflammation and malnutrition with a decrease in albumin levels and nPCR and presence of rHUEpo resistance when compared to patients in group 3. We conclude that, similar to HD patients with persistently high CRP levels, those with intermittent elevation of CRP must also be considered to be in a state of chronic inflammatory response associated with malnutrition and erythropoietin resistance. This signifies the importance of regulatory monitoring of CRP in HD population.

AB  - We have undertaken a review of the Massachusetts General Hospital experience of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). Twelve cases were identified, and the dermatopathologic features of lesional skin biopsies were examined. We looked systematically at nine parameters and graded each on a scale of 0 (minimal or none) to 3 (highest or most): 1) extent of fibrocytic proliferation, 2) extent of collagen thickening, 3) extent of vascularity, 4) extent of pannicular involvement, 5) extent of elastolysis, 6) presence of mucin, 7) presence of calcification, 8) presence of giant cells, and 9) presence of inflammation. Results demonstrate that fibrocytic proliferation, collagen thickening, inflammation, and vascularity most commonly were classified as grade 1?2; mucin deposition and elastolysis varied from 0?2; pannicular involvement ranged from 1?3; nearly all had calcification grade of 0, and there were no giant cells detected in any of the twelve cases. Comparing our results to published reports suggests that there are some interesting observations. Our cases tended to be less fibrocellular, have less mucin, and have more vascularity than the initial 14 cases described by Cowper et?al (2001). The implications of the dermatopathologic findings for clinical course and prognosis are currently being evaluated.

AB  - Objectives Permanent injury to the cranial nerves can often result in a substantial reduction in quality of life. Novel and innovative interventions can help restore form and function in nerve paralysis, with bioelectric interfaces among the more promising of these approaches. The foreign body response is an important consideration for any bioelectric device as it influences the function and effectiveness of the implant. The purpose of this review is to describe tissue and functional effects of chronic neural implantation among the different categories of neural implants and highlight advances in peripheral and cranial nerve stimulation. Data Sources: PubMed, IEEE, and Web of Science literature search. Review Methods: A review of the current literature was conducted to examine functional and histologic effects of bioelectric interfaces for neural implants. Results Bioelectric devices can be characterized as intraneural, epineural, perineural, intranuclear, or cortical depending on their placement relative to nerves and neuronal cell bodies. Such devices include nerve-specific stimulators, neuroprosthetics, brainstem implants, and deep brain stimulators. Regardless of electrode location and interface type, acute and chronic histological, macroscopic and functional changes can occur as a result of both passive and active tissue responses to the bioelectric implant. Conclusion A variety of chronically implantable electrodes have been developed to treat disorders of the peripheral and cranial nerves, to varying degrees of efficacy. Consideration and mitigation of detrimental effects at the neural interface with further optimization of functional nerve stimulation will facilitate the development of these technologies and translation to the clinic.

Materials and Methods Retrospective review of medical records of dogs with confirmed vertebral chondrosarcoma and magnetic resonance imaging of the lesions, from four different veterinary referral institutions. Results A total of six dogs were included in this report. In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated mass involving the dorsal vertebral compartment, markedly hyperintense with few foci of hypointensity on T2-weighted images, iso to hypointense on T1-weighted images with contrast enhancement after gadolinium administration. Intralesional surgical resection was performed in three dogs and medical management in one, two dogs were euthanased and all lesions were submitted for histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging findings correlated with histological findings of a low tumour grade. Rapid clinical improvement was noted after surgery but two of three dogs had local regrowth. Clinical Significance Chondrosarcomas show local aggressiveness and resistance to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and so prognosis depends on feasibility of en bloc resection. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis and prognosis based on the feasibility of surgical resection.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Many traditional medicines have demonstrated immune activity, however, research has largely neglected their effects on cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). This review reports on extracts from 37 medicinal plant species, similar to or replicating traditional preparations, that up- or downregulate either gene or protein activity of CAMs. The majority of the investigations were in vitro, primarily of the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs, specifically intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and secondarily on the integrin (CD11b or MAC-1) and selectin (E-selectin and P-selectin) families of CAMs. The following plant species have demonstrated modulation of multiple CAMs: Artemisia asiatica, Boswellia serrata, Canscora decussata, Cinnamomum povectum, Dehaasia incrassate, Ganoderma lucidum, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum, Juglans regia, Lycopus lucidus, Panax notoginseng, Rheum undulatum, Salvia miltiorrhiza. Many other species have documented activity on one CAM. Currently there are limited in vivo/ex vivo investigations, including a clinical trial on Mahonia aquifolium. Although further evidence is needed, the data suggest that the reviewed botanical medicines may have the potential to provide therapeutic potential in disease processes involving CAMs. Additionally, the reported success of many of these plant extracts by traditional cultures and modern phytotherapists may involve the modulation of CAMs. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.
