AB  - A 57-year-old woman presented with a three-week history of an erythematous nodule on her palm. The clinical diagnosis was pyogenic granuloma. Histology revealed a circumscribed dermal nodule of uniform, primitive round cells with numerous mitotic figures and apoptopic cells. The tumor cells showed strong membranous immunoreactivity for CD99 and nuclear immunoreactivity for Fli-1. The tumor cells were negative for S-100 protein, cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 20, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and actin. The diagnosis of Ewing?s sarcoma was made. CT scans showed no evidence of an osseous or deep soft tissue primary tumor or metastatic disease. The tumor was excised with 1?cm margins, and the patient received six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. One year after diagnosis, the patient is alive without evidence of disease. Extraosseous Ewing?s sarcoma (EES) rarely presents as a primary skin tumor and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors involving the skin. It is important to distinguish primary cutaneous EES from secondary involvement of the skin by ES, as primary cutaneous EES has a more indolent course compared to classic EES or osseous ES. Immunohistochemical stains for CD99 and Fli-1 are useful markers to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous ES.

AB  - Biofilm infections are one of the modern medical world's greatest challenges. Probably, all non-obligate intracellular bacteria and fungi can establish biofilms. In addition, there are numerous biofilm-related infections, both foreign body-related and non-foreign body-related. Although biofilm infections can present in numerous ways, one common feature is involvement of the host response with significant impact on the course. A special characteristic is the synergy of the innate and the acquired immune responses for the induced pathology. Here, we review the impact of the host response for the course of biofilm infections, with special focus on cystic fibrosis, chronic wounds and infective endocarditis.

AB  - Abstract Many traditional medicines have demonstrated immune activity, however, research has largely neglected their effects on cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). This review reports on extracts from 37 medicinal plant species, similar to or replicating traditional preparations, that up- or downregulate either gene or protein activity of CAMs. The majority of the investigations were in vitro, primarily of the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs, specifically intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and secondarily on the integrin (CD11b or MAC-1) and selectin (E-selectin and P-selectin) families of CAMs. The following plant species have demonstrated modulation of multiple CAMs: Artemisia asiatica, Boswellia serrata, Canscora decussata, Cinnamomum povectum, Dehaasia incrassate, Ganoderma lucidum, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum, Juglans regia, Lycopus lucidus, Panax notoginseng, Rheum undulatum, Salvia miltiorrhiza. Many other species have documented activity on one CAM. Currently there are limited in vivo/ex vivo investigations, including a clinical trial on Mahonia aquifolium. Although further evidence is needed, the data suggest that the reviewed botanical medicines may have the potential to provide therapeutic potential in disease processes involving CAMs. Additionally, the reported success of many of these plant extracts by traditional cultures and modern phytotherapists may involve the modulation of CAMs. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy and safety of a combined 3D printed guide template (combined template) to assist iliosacral (IS) screw placement for sacral fracture and dislocation. Methods A total of 37 patients, 24 men and 13 women, age from 22 to 68?years old, diagnosed with a sacral fracture and dislocation were involved in this study for retrospective analysis from January 2016 to February 2018. There were 19 patients in the template group (42 screws) and 18 patients in the conventional group (31 screws). In the combined template group, IS screw placement was assisted by a combined 3D printed template; in the conventional group, the IS screws were placed freehand under fluoroscopy. The accuracy of the IS screw placement was evaluated by comparing the screw angle and the location of the screw entry point between the actual and the simulated screw in the combined template group. The safety of the IS screw placement was evaluated by comparing the quality of the reduction, the grading of the screws, the operation time, and radiation exposure times between groups. Results A total of 73 pedicle screws were placed in 37 patients: 42 screws (30 S1, 12 S2) in the combined template group and 31 screws (23 S1, 8 S2) in the conventional group. In the conventional group, 1?patient developed symptoms of L5 nerve stimulation. In the combined template group, the average operative time of each screw was 25.01?±?2.90 min, with average radiation exposure times of 12.05?±?4.00. In the conventional group, the average operative time of each screw was 46.24?±?9.59 min, with an average radiation exposure time of 56.10?±?6.75. There were significant differences in operation and radiation exposure times between groups. The rate of screw perforation was lower in the combined template group (2 of 42 screws, 0 at grade III and 2 at grade II) than in the conventional group (5 of 38 screws, 2 at grade III and 3 at grade III). In the combined template group, the mean distance between the entry points of the actual and simulated screws was 1.4?±?0.9?mm, with a mean angle of deviation of 2.1°?±?1.6°. All patients were followed up once every 3?months and were followed for 3 to 12?months. Conclusion Using the combined template to assist with the insertion of IS screws delivered good accuracy, less fluoroscopy and shorter operation time, and avoided neurovascular injury as a result of screw malposition.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - Summary Neck liposuction is used to remove excess fat from the neck area and minimize skin sagging. Small cannulas and multiple entry sites are necessary to achieve even fat removal without ridging or deformity. Tumescent anesthesia is key to reducing pain and bruising while facilitating fat removal. Liposuction of the neck is a procedure that is straightforward, takes 1 hour or less, and is rapidly healing with few complications. It is often a stand-alone procedure or it can be combined with other procedures that may be indicated in the aging patient or those with pre-existing anatomic factors. Proper selection of patients with fat in front of the platysma muscle and good technique that avoids overresection are key elements for achieving optimal results. Because aging of the neckline and drooping jowls are often the first major complaint of the aging patient, it is incumbent of the dermatologic surgeon to achieve mastery of this technique as it is likely to become one of his or her favorite procedures to perform.

AB  - Sensitive skin is a neolgism used by consumers for a self-perceived intolerance to environmental factors including skin care products and cosmetics. Consumer complaints focused industry on this concept and dermatology has gradually recognized it also. Identified associations range from endogenous skin disorders to irritant (including sensory) and allergic reactions. Impaired barrier function has been implicated in some instances. The consumer with sensitive skin frequently experiences adverse reactions to cosmetics, but what information is available to help them choose products they can tolerate? To answer this question, a survey is being conducted among cosmetic manufacturers inquiring if they market products for consumers with sensitive skin. They are asked what steps they take in the design of these products to insure tolerance, and what testing is done on these products that may be unique. Does the post-marketing data show these products fulfilled their goal and these cosmetics are well tolerated by this group? The manufacturers are surveyed as to what precautions they regard as important for ?sensitive skin? individuals in choosing and using cosmetics. The results of the survey are incorporated into patient recommendations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - Abstract Host stem/progenitor cells can be mobilized and recruited to a target location using biomaterials, and these cells may be used for in situ tissue regeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate whether host biologic resources could be used to regenerate renal tissue in situ. Collagen hydrogel was injected into the kidneys of normal mice, and rat kidneys that had sustained ischemia/reperfusion injury. After injection, the kidneys of both animal models were examined up to 4 weeks for host tissue response. The infiltrating host cells present within the injection regions expressed renal stem/progenitor cell markers, PAX-2, CD24, and CD133, as well as mesenchymal stem cell marker, CD44. The regenerated renal structures were identified by immunohistochemistry for renal cell specific markers, including synaptopodin and CD31 for glomeruli and cytokeratin and neprilysin for tubules. Quantitatively, the number of glomeruli found in the injected regions was significantly higher when compared to normal regions of renal cortex. This phenomenon occurred in normal and ischemic injured kidneys. Furthermore, the renal function after ischemia/reperfusion injury was recovered after collagen hydrogel injection. These results demonstrate that introduction of biomaterials into the kidney is able to facilitate the regeneration of glomerular and tubular structures in normal and injured kidneys. Such an approach has the potential to become a simple and effective treatment for patients with renal failure. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:241?250

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with those syndromes whose primary symptomatology is characterized by acquired impairments in one or more cognitive domains. Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.

AB  - Purpose? Patients with end stage renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) represent a potentially infected environment in which to use mesh for the repair of abdominal hernia. We present a review of our experience with these patients. Methodology? Retrospective review of all mesh repairs of abdominal hernia in CAPD patients performed by the senior author from 1997?2006. Results? 46 patients had 54 hernias repaired (25 umbilical, 18 inguinal, 9 incisional and 2 epigastric) using polypropylene mesh. 13 patients had simultaneous Tenckhoff catheter insertion. Median age was 63 years (range 22?85) and 22 were diabetic. CAPD was commenced or recommenced a median of 2 weeks after the repair (range 0 days?6 weeks). 6 short-term complications were recorded. 2 patients were treated for culture negative CAPD peritonitis within the first week after repair. 2 patients had localised wound bleeding and 1 patient was admitted with a wound infection. All were treated conservatively and no patient required mesh removal. 1 patient developed CAPD peritonitis at one month post-operation and required Tenckhoff removal, subsequent laparotomy and conversion to haemodialysis. At a median follow-up of 30 months (range 3?87) 29 patients were still alive and 2 patients were lost to follow-up. There were 4 documented recurrences and 1 patient had been converted to haemodialysis because of hernia recurrence. Conclusions? Mesh can be safely used to repair most hernias in CAPD patients. The results are comparable to those in healthy patients and mesh removal due to infection is extremely rare.
