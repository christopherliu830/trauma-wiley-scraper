AB  - Abstract Twenty years ago the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges published Effective Intervention in Domestic Violence and Child Maltreatment: Guidelines for Policy and Practice, which became known as the Greenbook because of its green cover. This article presents the social science research leading up to the Greenbook and the 20 years beyond the publication of this seminal document, including examination of the effect of co-occurrence of child maltreatment and exposure to domestic violence on child outcomes, the interventions for families to improve the safety of both child and adult victims, and future directions for research.

AB  - Abstract Focusing on the coexistence of competing and contested interests in intercultural natural resource management (NRM) systems in Australia and Malaysia, this paper explores the ways in which ontological pluralism and the interplay of socio-cultural, political?economic and biophysical influences shape NRM systems. We aim to foster a discursive space in which to reframe the challenges of capacity building in the rapidly changing spaces of intercultural NRM systems. The paper synthesizes the conceptual arguments of field research to conclude that capacity deficits of dominant institutions, processes and knowledge systems drive many systemic failures in land and sea management affecting Indigenous peoples. We advocate urgent action to build intercultural competence and new capacities and competencies in those institutions. The paper reframes intercultural NRM in terms of coexistence and invites wider debate about these ?new geographies of coexistence? in intercultural NRM systems.

AB  - Abstract Background Resolution of inflammation is an emerging new strategy to reduce damage following ischemic stroke. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an anti-inflammatory, pro-resolution lipid mediator that reduces neuroinflammation in stroke. Since LXA4 is rapidly inactivated, potent analogs have been synthesized, including BML-111. We hypothesized that post-ischemic, intravenous treatment with BML-111 for 1 week would provide neuroprotection and reduce neurobehavioral deficits at 4 weeks after ischemic stroke in rats. Additionally, we investigated the potential protective mechanisms of BML-111 on the post-stroke molecular and cellular profile. Methods A total of 133 male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and BML-111 administration was started at the time of reperfusion. Two methods of week-long BML-111 intravenous administration were tested: continuous infusion via ALZET? osmotic pumps (1.25 and 3.75 ?g ?l?1 hr?1), or freshly prepared daily single injections (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). We report for the first time on the stability of BML-111 and characterized an optimal dose and a dosing schedule for the administration of BML-111. Results One week of BML-111 intravenous injections did not reduce infarct size or improve behavioral deficits 4 weeks after ischemic stroke. However, post-ischemic treatment with BML-111 did elicit early protective effects as demonstrated by a significant reduction in infarct volume and improved sensorimotor function at 1 week after stroke. This protection was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, decreased M1 CD40+ macrophages, and increased alternatively activated, anti-inflammatory M2 microglia/macrophage cell populations in the post-ischemic brain. Conclusion These data suggest that targeting the endogenous LXA4 pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. More work is necessary to determine whether a different dosing regimen or more stable LXA4 analogs could confer long-term protection.

AB  - The Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative has guidelines for vascular access and states that the dialysis catheter (DC) should be limited to less than 20% of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Our center has found this target difficult to achieve. Objective:? We wondered what the reasons for use of a DC might be. Methods:? We noted the number of patients with a DC in place and assessed the reasons why the DC was being used on 8/1/03. Results:? 73 of the 170 (42.9%) patients had a DC on 8/1/03. 24 (32.9%) of the patients refused to have initial arteriovenous fistulae or grafts (AVF/G) or a secondary AVF/G revision or replacement procedure performed after initial AVF/G failure. 15 (20.5%) patients had a maturing AVF/G, 12 (16.4%) had significant medical and/or surgical contraindications for AVF/G placement, 9 (12.3%) patients were awaiting surgical thrombectomy, revision or placement of AVF/G, 6 patients (8.2%) were awaiting transfer to CPD therapy, 4 (5.5%) patients were undecided about having an AVF/G placed, and 1 (1.4%) had acute renal failure and early ESRD recovery was expected. Only 2 (2.7%) patients had no access plan by the nephrology team. Conclusions:? Patients' refusal for an AVF/G placement and patients with a maturing AVF/G or awaiting surgical revision or placement were the most common reasons for the use of a DC in our center. To significantly impact on the high use of the DC, it would be crucial to better understand the reasons for patients? refusals.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialysis is often complicated by cardiovascular instability (CVI). We studied factors contributing to this problem during 720 hemodialyses (HDs) in 20 patients; 480 dialyses were 6/week and 240 were 3/week. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR) and maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP). Independent variables were dialyses/week (DIAL), ultrafiltration (Uf), % of body weight (BW), pre-post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1?kg?1 BW), target-postdialysis BW (Ta-Po BW), Kt/V, ?PO4, ?bicarbonate, ?potassium, ?BUN, an ?unphysiology index? summing up changes in electrolytes, and BUN and BW during dialysis (UPI). The relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased 0.5?±?11/min; MAX BP fall was 23?±?17?mmHg; OV BP fall was 12?±?19?mmHg. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=?38???DIAL???4?+?T???0.1?+?Uf???1.8?+?PO4 ??1.8???UPI??0.2???K/V???2, r?=?0.30, p?<?0.0001; MAX BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+??PO4???2.6?+?11, r?=?0.34, p?<?0.0001; OV BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+?PO4???2.7 +?1, r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001. Conclusion:? To prevent BP fall and tachycardia during hemodialysis, the most important factor to decrease is unphysiology, i.e., the oscillations in electrolytes, fluid spaces, and osmolality that occur during dialysis. The best way to do this is to dialyze patients daily. An unexpected finding worthy of further investigation was the large detrimental influence of ?PO4 on CVI.

AB  - A new fragrance mix (FM II) with 6 frequently used chemicals was evaluated in consecutive patients patch tested in 6 dermatological centres in Europe. 28% FM II contained 5% Lyral, 1% citral, 5% farnesol, 5% coumarin, 1% citronellol and 10% alpha-hexyl cinnamic aldehyde (AHCA); in 14% FM II the single constituents? concentrations was lowered to 50% and in 2.8% FM II to 10%. Each patient was classified regarding a history of adverse reactions to fragrances: certain, probable, questionable and none. The frequency of positive reactions to the currently used 8% fragrance mix (FM I) and the new mix in 1703 patients was as follows: FM I, 6.6%; 2.8% FM II, 1.3%; 14% FM II, 2.9%; 28% FM II, 4.1%. The number of doubtful/irritant reactions was 7.2% for FM I and ranged from 1.8% to 10.6% for FM II. 8.7% of tested patients had a certain fragrance history. Of these 25.2% were positive to FM I, reactivity to FM II was dose-dependent and ranged from 8.1% to 17.6% in this subgroup. Comparing 2 groups of history ? certain and none ? values for sensitivity (sens) and specificity (spec) were calculated. Sens: FM I, 27.2%; 2.8% FM II, 8.7%; 14% FM II, 15.9%; 28% FM II, 21.5%. Spec: FM I, 96.3%; 2.8% FM II, 99.5%; 14% FM II, 98.7%; 28% FM II, 97.9%. 31/70 (44.3%) patients positive to 28% FM II were negative to FM I. In the group of patients with a certain history a total of 6 patients was found reacting only to FM II. Simultaneous break-down testing with the single constituents produced positive reactions in 54.3% for 28% FM II and 48% for 14% FM II. Lyral was the dominating single constituent with positive reactions (37.1% for 28% FM II, 36% for 14% FM II), followed by citral, farnesol, citronellol, AHCA and coumarin. Chemical analysis for the 6 constituents of FM II was performed on 25 products used by 12 patients being patch test positive to FM II. Lyral was detected in 76% of these products, citral in 16% and AHCA in 8%. In conclusion, the new FM II detects additional patients with contact allergy to fragrances missed by the currently used FM I. The medium concentration, 14% FM II, is probably the most useful one for diagnostic screening.

AB  - Purpose? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most frequently reported malignancy in Australian cancer registries. A large proportion of these cancers are managed by general surgeons with no specific sub-specialist training. Our study aims to examine anastamotic leak rates after surgery for CRC in a regional hospital, performed by non sub-specialty trained general surgeons and to compare this data with those of other specialist colorectal units. Method? An audit of all patients treated for colorectal cancer at Toowoomba Base Hospital between 1 January 1990 and 1 April 2006 was undertaken. An anastamotic leak was defined as a clinical diagnosis documented in the patients? medical chart or operative report. Findings? 580 patients were treated for colorectal cancer during the prescribed period. Of these, 444 had surgery which included a gastrointestinal anastamosis. There were 13 anastamotic leaks (2.9%). The following commonest procedures had respective leak rates of: right hemicolectomy 2.2%; anterior resection 2.2%; sigmoid colectomy 3.28%; ultra-low anterior resection 6.67%. Of the 13 leaks, 1 occurred in Dukes A cancers (1.89%), 9 in Dukes B cancers (4%) and 3 in Dukes C cancers (1.5%). Conclusion? The anastamotic leak rates over the past 16 years at Toowoomba Hospital appear to be comparable to those of other specialist colorectal surgical units. It may be that leak rates are more dependent on the quality of the individual surgeons performing the procedure and the soundness of their surgical techniques, irrespective of their level of sub-specialization. However, research needs to be done to prospectively compare the leak rates of different surgical units before further conclusions can be made.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1? (IL-1?) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1? expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 ± 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 ± 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This paper aims to clarify current knowledge on the contribution of communication to crisis management in the case of terrorism incidents. This is done by means of a systematic review of the scientific literature on terrorism communication over the last 10 years to identify the many challenges facing communication in such crises, and represents the first attempt of its kind. To date, within the literature on terrorism communication, much attention has been paid to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear hazards. Terrorism crises are complex and challenging. Preparedness for such diverse low-probability high-impact crises can best be included in a wider educative approach. Terrorism crises call for fast information updates that, using a multi-channel approach, can be tailored to fit different needs and (social) media habits.
