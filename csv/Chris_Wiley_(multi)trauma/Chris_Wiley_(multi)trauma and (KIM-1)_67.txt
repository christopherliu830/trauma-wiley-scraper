AB  - Abstract Background Like other types of care for disabled or elderly adults, consumer-directed personal assistance services may present multi-factorial risks for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). Methods Using survey data, we compared providers experiencing WRMSDs in the previous year to those who did not, seeking to identify functional, temporal, physical, and relationship risk factors for transient and chronic conditions. Results Longer work experience with the recipient and more frequent bending increased the risk of being in the most chronic group (≥12 painful episodes), whereas predictable work hours with rest breaks and greater social support from the recipient appeared protective. For transient conditions (one to two episodes), longer work experience with the recipient and predictable hours with rest breaks appeared protective. Conclusions We offer recommendations to improve hazard assessment as well as training and information distribution related to home care programs. With the population aging, home care jobs require increasing oversight to prevent WRMSDs. Am. J. Ind. Med. 56:454?468, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study aims to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) distress on body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression among breast cancer patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the breast cancer advocacy events held at 16 hospitals in Korea. Alopecia distress was assessed using the ?Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia Distress Scale?, body image and psychosocial well-being were measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and breast specific module (BR23), and depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Means of outcomes were compared between low and high CIA distress groups. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between the CIA distress and body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression. Results One hundred sixty-eight breast cancer patients participated in the study; the mean age was 48.4 (SD?=?8.4) years, and 55.3% of the patients experienced higher distress from alopecia. In fully adjusted models, the high distress group was more likely to have a poorer body image than the low distress group (35.2 vs. 62.0; p?<?0.001). Distressed patients were also more likely to report lower emotional (55.3 vs. 76.9; p?<?0.001), role (58.6 vs. 72.0; p?<?0.001), and social functioning (51.3 vs. 70.9; p?<?0.001). The high distress group was also more likely to have depression compared with the low distress group (19.6 vs. 14.8; p?<?0.001). Conclusions Chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress was negatively associated with body image, psychosocial well-being, and depression in women with breast cancer. It is necessary to develop specific interventions to minimize distress due to alopecia for women with breast cancer. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary: The Burch colposuspension operation is an accepted and effective technique for the correction of genuine stress incontinence. It is, however, associated with a number of well-recognized complications. Ureteric injury at the time of colposuspension is a potentially severe, if uncommon, complication of this procedure with legal ramifications for the surgeon as well as health risks for the patient. To date, only 19 cases have been described in the literature. This paper highlights 4 cases of this injury occurring amongst the patients of 1 urogynaecologist (2) and gives an incidence for its occurrence as well as discussing the aetiology and management of this complication.

AB  - Abstract Cataract surgery is the most common ophthalmological surgical procedure, and it is predicted that the number of surgeries will increase significantly in the future. However, little is known about the recovery after surgery. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, severity and duration of pain and other ocular discomfort symptoms experienced after cataract surgery. The other objectives were to identify the factors associated with lower postoperative patient satisfaction and to measure the effect of cataract surgery on patients? health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and visual function in everyday life. The study design was a prospective follow-up study. The course of the recovery and the presence of ocular symptoms were evaluated by interviewing the patients via a questionnaire at 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks and one year after surgery The visual functioning in everyday life was measured with Visual Functioning Index VF-7 and Catquest-9SF-questionnaires and furthermore the HRQoL was measured with the 15D-instrument before surgery and at 12 months after surgery. The patients returned the questionnaires by mail and were interviewed in the hospital on the day of the surgery. The same patients filled-in all the questionnaires. The patient reports were used to collect the data on medical history. A total of 303 patients were approached at Kuopio University Hospital in 2010?2011 and of these 196 patients were eligible and willing to participate, with postoperative data being available from 186 (95%) patients. A systematic review article was included in the study procedure and it revealed the wide range in the reported incidence of postoperative ocular pain. Some of the identified randomized controlled studies reported no or only minor pain whereas in some studies significant pain or pain lasting for several weeks has been described in more than 50% of the study patients. In the present study setting, pain was reported by 34% during the first postoperative hours and by approximately 10% of patients during the first six weeks after surgery. During the early recovery in the hospital, only a minority of the patients reporting pain were provided with pain medication. The ocular discomfort symptoms such as itchiness, burning, foreign-body sensation and tearing were common both before (54%) and after surgery (38?52%). These symptoms can also be described as painful symptoms and are often difficult to distinguish from ocular pain. The symptoms are also typical of ocular surface disease, and some patients may benefit from the postoperative administration of tear substitutes. The patients reporting postoperative ocular symptoms were less satisfied with the treatment outcome at 12 months after surgery (p = 0.001) compared to the patients who experienced no symptoms. Those patients reporting less disability in visual functioning before surgery were more satisfied than patients with more reported disability. The HRQoL improved significantly after cataract surgery (p = 0.002). However, when compared to an age-and gender-standardized control population, in cataract subjects the HRQoL remained slightly worse both before and at 12 months after surgery.

AB  - Heparin-free anticoagulation in hemodialysis (HD) is advocated for patients with clotting abnormalities and risk of bleeding. Objective:? First publication on regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in children. RCA is free from systemic effects, guarantees excellent dialyzer life, but requires careful monitoring. Methods:? We report on 3 patients treated by intermittent RCA HD (4?h each, high-flux dialyzer F40, Fresenius): (1) 17-year-old boy (renal transplant failure, access via cubital Cimino fistula) after hypertensive intra-cerebral hemorrhage (2 sessions); (2) 13-year-old girl (hemolytic uremic syndrome, access via jugular vein Shaldon catheter) after abdominal surgery and bleeding (8 sessions); and (3) 7-year-old boy (hyperoxaluria, access via PermCath? jugular vein catheter) after renal transplant biopsy (3 sessions). Sodium citrate 30% was infused into the extra corporeal circuit (blood flow 150?mL/min) before dialyzer (initial flow 30?mL/min) and calcium gluconate 10% for antidote into venous line near of catheter or fistula (initial flow 40?mL/min). Post-dialyzer extracorporeal serum Ca++ (aim?<?0.3?mmol/L) and pre-dialyzer intra-corporeal Ca++ (aim?>?0.9) were measured for every 30?min. Serum Na+, K+, base excess (BE), blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood out-flow and in-flow pressure were also monitored. Results:? For adequate RCA (mean extracorporeal serum Ca++ 0.24?±?0.04?mmol/L), a mean citrate flow of 36.1?±?5.9?mL/h and a mean calcium substitution rate of 40.8?±?3.4?mL/h were needed. Intra-corporeal Ca++ was kept at 1.10?±?0.07?mmol/L. Extracorporeal activated clotting time (ACT) was 194?±?41 and intra-corporeal ACT 90?±?12?sec. Serum Na+, K+, and BE during HD were 138?±?2, 3.5?±?0.3, and ?0.6?±?1.1?mmol/L, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressures of patients 1?3 were 117?±?5, 103?±?5, and 102?±?6?mmHg. All patients were stable and without any bleeding during HD. The only adverse event was 1 episode of hypocalcemia (Ca++?<?0.6?mmol/L) cured by stopping dialysis. Conclusions:? Local anticoagulation with sodium citrate during intermittent HD can be applied safely in children and adolescents.

AB  - Within the last two decades, globalization has emerged as one of the most popular topics for study among the social sciences. In contrast, however, to other social science disciplines that immediately grasped the importance of globalization as a trans-disciplinary macro-level concept capable of describing, explaining, and predicting social phenomena, globalization has not yet achieved widespread popularity in psychology. This article discusses the concept of globalization, its emergence, definitions, meanings, consequences, and critical implications for psychology.

AB  - It is unlikely that there is a solitary hospital-based dialysis unit that can claim an unlimited amount of available chronic spots. Many units, in fact, constantly face a problem of overcrowding, long patient waiting lists, and ongoing shortages of nurses trained in highly specialized areas such as dialysis. In addition, conventional dialysis does not afford the best outcomes to patients with lifestyle, fluid control, hypotension, or hypertension issues. Objective:? We developed an in-hospital nocturnal program with the goal of solving some of these issues related to wait lists, overcrowding, and shortages of trained hemodialysis nurses. Method:? In the first year, a four-bed room was converted into a 4 station unit. Nurses from the 24 bed in-patient Nephrology/Urology/Ophthalmology unit were trained to perform hemodialysis. Stable, hospitalized dialysis patients or in-center dialysis patients were selected if they met criteria drawn up by the medical director. Staffing for the unit was established at 3?:?1 or 4?:?1 patient to nurse ratio. Support staff included a hemodialysis-trained ward nurse with an assignment of 5?6 hospitalized patients. Back-up support included assistance with trouble-shooting and break coverage for the nocturnal nurse. Results:? We currently have 12 nurses from the ward trained to do hemodialysis. The nocturnal unit has been operating 3 nights/week, with plans to expand to 6 nights/week within the year. We have 3 patients on the program with plans to increase to 6?8 patients as more nurses are trained. Initiation of hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis has led to the opening of in-center dialysis spots as well as shortening wait periods for patients in the Pre-Renal Clinic, awaiting initiation of chronic dialysis. This model has also provided the in-center dialysis unit with a greater pool of skilled hemodialysis nurses to draw from during shortages. Anecdotal reports from patients indicate that they feel much better, and 1 patient no longer requires antihypertensives for their blood pressure control. Conclusion:? We conclude that hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis is a novel and extremely viable solution for many of the issues facing dialysis units today.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Previously, donors with asymptomatic stones found incidentally on CT were not considered ideal donor candidates because of the presumed risk of morbidity to both the donor and recipient. Increasingly, studies show that these risks are low. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety of using ex vivo ureteroscopy to remove the stones from the donor kidney on the bench before donation. Outcomes so far suggest that this technique can safely render a kidney stone-free before transplantation. This has led to 20 more transplants in our institution than would otherwise be possible. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones in our potential donor population. To assess the safety and success of ex vivo ureteroscopy (ExURS) to remove stones from explanted donor kidneys before transplantation. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 377 computed tomography (CT) angiograms of potential kidney donors between October 2004 and May 2007 to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones in our donor population. Between October 2005 and October 2011, kidneys from suitable donors underwent ExURS. Stones were removed using basket extraction or were fragmented with holmium laser on bench before transplantation. Immediate and long-term complications of the transplanted recipients were recorded. Donors were followed with yearly ultrasonography of the remaining kidney in addition to standard follow-up protocol. Results Review of 377 CT angiograms between October 2004 to May 2007 showed a 5% prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones. Out of 55 potential donors (19 identified between October 2004 to May 2007 and a further 36 identified since May 2007), 20 donors with stones proceeded to donation, with stone size ranging from 2 to 12?mm. Of the patients, 17 proceeded to ExURS. Stones were removed in 10 patients; five with basket retrieval, four with laser fragmentation and one with both laser fragmentation and basket retrieval. There were no early or late allograft stone-related complications and no evidence of stones on follow-up imaging at a mean (range) of 10 (1?24) months. There has been no reported stone recurrence in any of the donors to date and no stone on ultrasonography of eight donors with >1-year follow-up (mean 26 months, range 12?49 months). Conclusions Asymptomatic renal stones are present in 5% of our donors. ExURS can be safely used to remove stones in these kidneys before transplantation, without the risk of subjecting the donor to an additional stone-removing procedure. Continued long-term follow-up of donors and recipients is still required to ensure the safety of this approach.

AB  - Trafficking in women and girls is a serious human rights violation that has deleterious consequences for many individuals and communities worldwide. Although numerous anti-trafficking programs and policies have been implemented, the majority have adopted a law enforcement approach that has yielded little progress. In this article, we draw on the public health lens to discuss a set of principles that aim to guide anti-trafficking interventions toward a more comprehensive framework of action to address trafficking in women and girls. Given the complex causes and consequences associated with the issue, anti-trafficking interventions must address a range of factors, from the social determinants enabling the gender discriminatory norms and conditions that facilitate the problem, to the diverse health needs of individuals throughout the trafficking process. Additionally, anti-trafficking policies and programs should be implemented with the best available evidence and in partnership with relevant stakeholders, including the survivors themselves, while incorporating the unique opportunities and challenges of the different trafficking contexts.

AB  - Overview Cancer of the prostate is the most commonly diagnosed nonskin neoplasm and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in the United States. Considerable advances have been made in screening, diagnosis, and therapy options, particularly in advanced disease, but controversies about the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer, especially in the areas of screening and choice of therapy, continue to evolve. Controversies in advanced disease states have shifted from prognostication to prediction, and current treatment considerations are focused on optimization of sequence or combinations of therapy, determining the role of local control and bone targeting. It is anticipated that addressing these knowledge gaps will lead to an integrated and more effective treatment strategies. Further advances in therapy can be achieved by development of new agents with unique mechanisms of action and rational integration into combination therapies. Prostate cancer awareness, clinical application of improved biopsy schemes, and advances in imaging combined with the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have resulted in increased detection of prostate cancer. The evolving use of the serum PSA concentration and its change over time have not been paralleled by studies that tested the relevance of those findings until the results of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were first published in 2009. Though many of the apparent discrepancies between these trials can be accounted for by trial design and patient cross-contamination, they brought to the forefront the dilemma of overdiagnosis and overtreatment and the urgent need to improve the accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer. It is hoped that replacement of the current morphologic and anatomic classification of prostate cancer with one based on improved understanding of biology will lead to molecular classification and bring closer a personalized management of this complex disease. Salient features that distinguish prostate cancer from other malignancies and that frame the dilemmas surrounding it are its striking age-dependent incidence, with progressively increasing frequency with increasing age; the variable lethality of morphologically identified cancers; the central role of androgen signaling; and the preponderance of bone-forming metastases on its lethal progression. The important advances made in each of these areas will, in the near future, modify the approaches currently used to prevent, prognosticate, and treat prostate cancer.

AB  - AbstractThis article uses the distinction between the person and the variable orientations as a frame for structuring (1) research on IPV, (2) results of this research, and (3) an agenda for future research. The main tenet of this agenda is that causes, processes, and effects of IPV are person and context specific; therefore, results that relate variables to each other are of limited value if it can be shown that the processes that take place, the meaning of the variables, the profile of the transgressors and the women who experience IPV depend on time, environment, and research design. Examples of valuable variable-oriented research are given; examples of the growing contribution made by person-oriented research are given as well. Sample theories are sketched out, for the variable-oriented, the person-oriented, and the theoretical research arenas, the need for future research is derived from inconsistencies and shortcomings in both current research and theory. Sample research questions are proposed. The contributions made by the authors of this Special Section are embedded within the discussion of research and theory of IPV. It is shown that each of the contributions is valuable within a particular segment of the research landscape.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%
