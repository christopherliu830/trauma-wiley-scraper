AB  - Purpose: To examine cultural incommensurability between clients of Japanese ancestry and Western therapists. Design: Aggregated case-study method was used to analyze psychotherapy cases of Japanese individuals seen by Western therapists. Eight cases were selected for this study from a private practice client pool. Findings: Themes were: (a) only observable data were valued for diagnosis and treatment; (b) cultural stereotypes hampered treatment; (c) individuation and separation occurred within a social web of norms in Japanese culture; (d) key concepts in mental health such as ?death and dying? and ?rape? were interpreted by clients within a Japanese cultural framework, resulting in unique psychological reactions and behaviors, which had not been recognized by Western therapists; (e) psychological effects of immigration were minimized or ignored by Western therapists; (f) culturally unfamiliar behaviors were ?pathologized? by Western therapists; and (g) Western therapists showed ethnocentric biases regarding the effects of immigration. Conclusions: Various forms of misunderstanding and culturally ignorant practices were found in the treatment of eight Japanese clients by these Western therapists. These ineffective and often harmful practices were unrecognized by the Western therapists.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%

AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Objective:? Bone involvement in chronic renal failure is manifested long before the initiation of dialysis and is more prevalent in patients receiving inadequate conservative phase management. This study aimed at identifying the extent of renal bone disease among pre-dialysis and maintenance dialysis patients. Method: Thirty-two patients (gr 1) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for variable period of time were compared to twenty newly detected, irregularly treated, (gr 2) pre-dialysis severe renal failure patients for their clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. Result:?Mean age of gr 1 and gr 2 patients was 45?±?14 vs. 34?±?15 years (p?<?0.05). Comparison of blood biochemistry between group 1 and 2 showed serum creatinine 9.9?±?2.9 vs. 13.4?±?4.4?mg/dl (P?<?0.01), calcium 10?±?1.4 vs. 7.4?±?1?mg/dl (p?<?0.001); phosphate 4.4?±?1 vs. 8?±?2?mg/dl (p?<?0.008); ionized calcium 4.7?±?0.1 vs. 3.9?±?0.7?mg/dl (p?<?0.05); alkaline phosphatase 116?±?31 vs. 86?±?31?IU/l (p?<?0.05); and iPTH 72?±?48 vs. 147?±?92?pg/ml (p?<?0.05). Radiological changes present in the two groups were osteopenia-63% vs. 65%(P?=?NS); trabecular resorption-53% vs. 20%(p?<?0.05); soft tissue calcification-31% vs. 10%(p?<?0.05); bone cyst-16% vs. 25%(P?=?NS) and subperiosteal bone resorption-16% vs. 20%(P?=?NS). Tc 99MDP bone scan combined in both groups of patients (n?=?52) showed increased uptake in wrist joint (29%), tibia-fibula (25%), costochondral junction, vertebral column (15% each), sternum (13%), radius and ulna (10%), and calvaria and mandible (8% each). X-ray finding was positive for bone involvement in 59% cases and Tc 99 scan was positive in 80%(p?<?0.05). Association study showed iPTH had a negative correlation with serum calcium (r?=??0.5, p?<?0.05) and a positive correlation with serum phosphate (r?=?0.7, p?<?0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (r?=?0.9, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:?It is concluded that pre-dialysis newly detected renal failure patients may present with deranged calcium homeostasis and can manifest high prevalence of bone involvement when compared to maintenance hemo-dialysis patients.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To monitor the quality of life of patients after periradicular surgery when two different flap designs were used. Methodology? Forty patients with teeth having a periradicular lesion of endodontic origin were included according to specific selection criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. In one group a sulcular incision (SI) with complete papilla mobilization was made, and in the other group a papilla-base incision (PBI) was used. Periradicular surgery was performed using a surgical microscope. Parameters related to life quality were recorded daily in the first week post-surgery using a questionnaire. Pain was evaluated with a 0?100 visual analog scale (VAS). Other symptoms (swelling, bleeding and nausea), plus functions (chewing, speaking, sleeping, daily routine and work) were assessed using a five-point scale. Analgesic intake was recorded. Fisher?s test and unpaired t-test were used to assess the difference between groups. Results? The VAS score for pain, and the scores for swelling, chewing and phonetic impairment, peaked on days 1 and 2 postoperatively. A significant difference in favour of the PBI group was found for chewing and swelling in the first 4?days. Starting from day 3 post-surgery, the PBI group reported a significantly more rapid decrease in pain levels and analgesics use than the SI group (P?<?0.05). The other parameters were similar in the two groups. Conclusions? The papilla-base incision technique may be preferred as reduction of pain levels, swelling and drug intake were more rapid in the first week postoperatively compared with cases in which a sulcular incision was used.

AB  - Abstract This study provides an empirical test of a culturally grounded theoretical model for prevention of alcohol abuse and suicide risk with Alaska Native youth, using a promising set of culturally appropriate measures for the study of the process of change and outcome. This model is derived from qualitative work that generated an heuristic model of protective factors from alcohol (Allen et al. in J Prev Interv Commun 32:41?59, 2006; Mohatt et al. in Am J Commun Psychol 33:263?273, 2004a; Harm Reduct 1, 2004b). Participants included 413 rural Alaska Native youth ages 12?18 who assisted in testing a predictive model of Reasons for Life and Reflective Processes about alcohol abuse consequences as co-occurring outcomes. Specific individual, family, peer, and community level protective factor variables predicted these outcomes. Results suggest prominent roles for these predictor variables as intermediate prevention strategy target variables in a theoretical model for a multilevel intervention. The model guides understanding of underlying change processes in an intervention to increase the ultimate outcome variables of Reasons for Life and Reflective Processes regarding the consequences of alcohol abuse.

AB  - The present study evaluates the effectiveness of a supervisor support training programme on both supervisor attitudes and employee sleep and stress outcomes by drawing on a multi-level rigorous randomized controlled trial in 35 organizations. Utilizing theory from the social support and training literatures, the purpose of the current study was to understand ways to improve the transition, and ultimately the health and well-being, of military veteran employees in the workplace via a supervisor support training intervention. Drawing on a sample of 982 supervisors and a subsample of 189 matched supervisor?employee dyads, the current study demonstrated that supervisor support training led to improved supervisor attitudes towards veteran employees. Additionally, supervisors? attitudes towards veteran employees at baseline significantly moderated the effects of the training on employee sleep and stress outcomes, suggesting that the training was more effective when supervisors started out with more positive attitudes towards veterans. These results demonstrate the importance of training supervisors to support employed veterans and employees more generally, and have implications for research, practice, and theory development. Practitioner points The Veteran Supportive Supervisor Training (VSST) promotes more positive supervisor attitudes towards veteran employees. When supervisor attitudes towards veteran employees are more positive, the supportive supervisor training improves sleep and stress outcomes for veteran employees. The VSST effects suggest that the training has promise to be extended to other leadership support domains, such as supervisor support for health; to other types of vulnerable and underserved workers, such as those with disabilities; and to other employee well-being outcomes, such as engagement and satisfaction at work and at home.

AB  - Purpose? The Abdominal Wall Components Separation Technique (AWCST), allows closure of ventral defects by transposition of the abdominal wall muscle(1). The aim of this audit of our initial experience was to evaluate the technique for repairing defects after removal of infected mesh or for uncomplicated incisional hernia. Methodology? A prospective audit was conducted on the initial experience of 9 consecutive patients under the care of one surgeon (BPW) from August to December 2006. Results? Of the 9 patients, 5 had infected mesh and 4 had large incisional hernias. The median follow up was 62 days range 7?125 days. Significant wound infections occurred in 4 patients requiring re-operation. In all 4 abdominal wall repair remained in tact. 1 patient has developed a recurrent incisional hernia. Conclusion? AWCST is an useful procedure for the closure of large defects, particularly for incisional hernia and may avoid the use of mesh. We recommend avoiding primary skin closure after removing infected mesh and follow the principle of delayed primary closure. No specific conclusions can be made from this small series with a short follow up, but the technique has merit and requires further evaluation.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Interest in quotidian (daily) hemodialysis (DHD) seems to be growing. DHD improves quality of life, blood pressure control, and nutrition, and decreases the need of medications, including erythropoiesis stimulating factors (ESF). We evaluate the short daily dialysis (SDHD) efficacy in 14 patients in conventional hemodialysis (HD) (3 weekly sessions/4?h), mean age 52.1 years, range 25?75, 10 males and 4 females, and found that they needed to increase dialysis efficiency by different medical indications: in 11 cases traditional indications ? 5 cases with hypertensive myocardiopathy and severe LVH (2 of them with low left ventricle ejection fraction), 2 cases with symptomatic, ischemic cardiopathy 2 patient with big body-surface area and elevated phosphorus levels, and 2 patients by inadequate dialysis (infradialysis conditioning malnutrition status) secondary to HD with permanent catheter. In one female (25 yr old), SDHD was prescribed to improve cardiac toxicity secondary to chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The index resistance of ESF decreased since the first month, and the Aranesp doses decreased by more than 40%. 1 male (49 years) with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy showed skin lesions with osteoblastic transformation. The skin lesions were improving since the first week, obtaining a decrease of the index resistance ESF higher than 60% in the first month. 1 male with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy showed improvement of symptoms and quality of life since the first weeks, as well as echocardiograpic signs and improvement in Hb levels and decreasing dose of ESF. The schedule in all of them was 5?6 days/week sessions between 2.15?h and 3?h, depending on body-surface area. To obtain a weekly Kt/V nearest to 4, HD sessions were realized in the hospital (7?pts) or in satellite unit (7?pts). The time remaining in this schedule was between 1 and 42 months. All the patients showed clinical improvement, subjective and objective, since the first week of start of SDHD. 3 patients could be included in Tx waiting list again. Anemia improved, decreasing index resistance of ESF. In relation with this, the time necessary to improve the response to ESF was different, showing a decrease in the first month higher than 40% in two cases dialyzing with a membrane high-flux with pore size 100?A, appearing high Hb levels also in a polycystic patient always without ESF. We observed by analyzing the results in 12 stable patients; the patients with high-flux dialyzers showed better response to ESF. Perhaps it could offer a better clearance of large molecules (inhibitor erythropoiesis factor and high molecular weight toxins) that participate to respond to ESF. Conclusion:? Our experience shows new indications for SDHD with very good results. Anemia was improved in relation with SDHD, when synthetic high-flux membranes and high pore size were used.

AB  - Abstract Neuroprosthetics and neuromodulation represent a promising field for several related applications in the central and peripheral nervous system, such as the treatment of neurological disorders, the control of external robotic devices, and the restoration of lost tactile functions. These actions are allowed by the neural interface, a miniaturized implantable device that most commonly exploits electrical energy to fulfill these operations. A neural interface must be biocompatible, stable over time, low invasive, and highly selective; the challenge is to develop a safe, compact, and reliable tool for clinical applications. In case of anatomical impairments, neuroprosthetics is bound to the need of exploring the surrounding environment by fast-responsive and highly sensitive artificial tactile sensors that mimic the natural sense of touch. Tactile sensors and neural interfaces are closely interconnected since the readouts from the first are required to convey information to the neural implantable apparatus. The role of these devices is pivotal hence technical improvements are essential to ensure a secure system to be eventually adopted in daily life. This review highlights the fundamental criteria for the design and microfabrication of neural interfaces and artificial tactile sensors, their use in clinical applications, and future enhancements for the release of a second generation of devices.

AB  - Pallister?Killian syndrome (PKS) is a rare sporadic multi-systemic developmental disorder caused by a mosaic tetrasomy of the short arm of chromosome 12. A wide range of clinical characteristics including intellectual disability, seizures, and congenital malformations has previously been described. Individuals with PKS show a characteristic facial phenotype with frontal bossing, alopecia, sparse eyebrows, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, telecanthus, and posteriorly rotated ears. Oro-dental features, such as ?Pallister lip,? macroglossia, delayed eruption of primary teeth, high arched-palate, prognathism, and cleft palate have been occasionally reported in the medical literature. The aim of the study was to assess the oro-dental phenotype of PKS and to describe the oral health status in a cohort participating in the First European Workshop on PKS. A clinical dental examination was performed in 21 Caucasian probands and data regarding medical and dental history collected. Twelve probands (57%) showed an atypical dental pattern, with multiple missing teeth (primarily the first permanent molars) and 2 (10%) a double teeth. The severity of gingivitis and dental caries increased with age and gingival overgrowth was a common finding. A characteristic occlusive phenotype was found: a high-arched palate with mandibular prognathism associated with an anterior openbite and crossbite and with posterior crossbite (unilateral or bilateral). The prevalence of oral habits (non-nutritive sucking, mouth breathing, bruxism) was high, even in older probands. This study suggests that individuals affected by PKS should be observed closely for oro-dental diseases and a multidisciplinary approach is needed to implement the right preventive measures. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - The histological findings in tinea corporis are variable, but include parakeratosis, often with neutrophils, spongiosis, and dermal inflammation. A recent study found some degree of papillary dermal edema in 17 to 23% of tinea cases. We report five cases of tinea corporis in which prominent papillary dermal edema (PDE) was the salient histological finding. Prominent PDE is often associated with diagnoses such as Sweet syndrome, polymorphous light eruption, allergic contact dermatitis and arthropod bite reactions. Interestingly, the submitted clinical diagnoses for our cases included Sweet syndrome (2), arthropod bite reaction (2), immunobullous disease (2), fixed drug eruption (1), eczema (1) and tinea (2). Our first case was a 25-year-old female with recurrent edematous plaques in fixed sites. Her lesions completely cleared with repeated courses of systemic steroids, but recurred after steroid taper. One fungal hypha was overlooked on her first biopsy and she was erroneously diagnosed with fixed drug eruption or a blistering disease (immunofluorescence negative). Six months later, repeat biopsy showed PDE, and numerous hyphae were seen on PAS stain. This prompted us to carefully examine PAS-stained sections on subsequent cases with prominent PDE. Prominent papillary dermal edema may be a clue to dermatophyte infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Human carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated sarcomeric mutations have abnormal collagen metabolism before overt left ventricular hypertrophy is detectable. This study investigated whether differences in collagen biomarkers were present in blood samples of ragdoll cats positive for the MYBPC3:R820W mutation compared with negative controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS Linear regression analyses showed that genotype was independently associated with CITP concentration. CITP was higher in mutation carriers (25?·?4?µg/L, interquartile range 16?·?0?29?·?2?µg/L) than non-carriers (14?·?6?µg/L, interquartile range 9?·?38?19?·?2?µg/L; P?=?0?·?024). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Circulating CITP was higher in MYBPC3-positive ragdoll cats than negative controls and may indicate altered collagen metabolism. Further studies are necessary to determine whether alterations in circulating collagen biomarker concentration relate to an early stage of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Background: Sun exposure plays an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Melanocytic lesions occur in sun-exposed skin and protected skin. Here we study the histologic interaction of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and solar elastosis (SE). Design: We selected 15 invasive malignant melanomas (MM) and 6 benign melanocytic nevi (MN) occurring in sun exposed areas in patients with significant SE. We measured SE thickness in perilesional skin and SE displacement in lesional skin. Results: SE thickness was 0.64?+/??0.11?mm in MM, and 0.38?+/??0.06 in MN (P?<?0.05). SE displacement was 1.02?+?/?0.85?mm in MM, and 0.44?+/??0.30 in MN (P?<?0.05). Tumor cells and host response were responsible for displacement of SE in MM. Thickness of displaced SE was decreased in 6?MM and 1?MN (attenuation), unchanged in 7?MM and 4?MN and increased in 2?MM and 1?MN. Conclusion: Displacement of SE may be helpful in the diagnosis of MM. In MM the newly formed tumor and associated host response appear to push down the preexisting solar elastosis. Conversely, long standing benign MN in sun exposed areas appear to coexist with the SE without significant displacement.
