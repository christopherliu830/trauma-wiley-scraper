AB  - Mature cystic ovarian teratomas (MCOT) are the most common ovarian neoplasm and contain components of one or more embryonic germ cell layers. Ectodermal components are most common. Rarely (1?3%), malignant transformation can occur in MCOT and are usually epidermoid, although multiple case reports of melanomas have been described. Four compound nevi and three blue nevi have also been reported; however, atypical (dysplastic) nevi have not been reported to our knowledge. A 28-year-old woman presented with a right ovarian mass. A 5???4???2.5?cm cystic ovarian mass was filled with hair and grumous keratinaceous debris. The lining was smooth with a 1?cm dark macule. Histologically, the mass was predominantly lined by epidermis and appendages. The pigmented lesion consisted predominantly of melanocytic nests irregularly disposed on sides and tips of distorted rete ridges, some with bridging between adjacent rete ridges, and junctional extension lateral to the small dermal component of nevus. Slight fibrosis invested some rete ridges. Moderate atypia was present. Although melanomas and melanocytic nevi have rarely been described previously in MCOT, we present the first atypical (dysplastic) compound nevus, to our knowledge. This case expands the spectrum of melanocytic lesions arising in MCOT.

AB  - Over the last 50 years, the significance of the immune system in the development and control of cancer has been much debated. However, recent discoveries provide evidence for a role of immunological mechanisms in the detection and destruction of cancer cells. Forty years ago veterinary oncologists were already investigating the feasibility of treating neoplasia by enhancing anticancer immunity. Unfortunately, this research was hindered by lack of a detailed understanding of cancer immunology, this limited the specificity and success of these early approaches. The great forward strides made in our understanding of onco-immunology in recent years have provided the impetus for a resurgence of interest in anticancer immunotherapy for canine patients. In this article both these initial trials and the exciting novel immunotherapeutics currently in development are reviewed.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a small round cell tumor which does not characteristically stain with S-100 protein. We report a case of an 83 year-old male with a two-month history of an ulcerated nodule on the right arm. Histopathology revealed small blue round cells arrayed in a trabecular pattern and in diffuse sheets, with scattered mitoses and necrosis. The cells were negative for vimentin, positive for NSE, focally positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins and diffusely positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins, including CK20. The findings were diagnostic of MCC, however, foci of S-100 protein positive cells were also present in the tumor. Upon reviewing cases from Skin Pathology Laboratory at BUSM received between 1/1/2000 to 7/30/2004, we documented a total of 34 cases diagnosed as MCC; 24 were stained with S-100 protein and this case was the only one that stained positively. S-100 protein positivity of MCC, while having been previously reported, is an uncommon finding. We report our case to stress the importance of morphological and immunoperioxidase features for the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, particularly in the exceptional cases which exhibit S-100 protein positivity.

AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - Skin conditions in individuals with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) are poorly classified and characterised. We reviewed 892 consecutive cases of individuals who had a workup for UCTD. ATAbs were positive in 526(59%). The ATAb(+) and ATAb(?) groups had similar antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (32% versus 28% respectively), average age (59 versus 58), and female-male ratio (8:1 versus 6:1). ATAb positivity was significantly associated with a dermatitis, manifested as erythematous macules/patches or papules on legs, shoulders or upper backs, in 9%(47/526) individuals versus 2%(7/366) in ATAb(?) individuals (Pearson?s chi-square?=?18.7, p?<?0.0001). Sixteen individuals with dermatitis had biopsies, 14 ATAb(+) and 2 ATAb(?). Routine hematoxylin-eosin and colloidal iron-stained sections were examined. Eleven biopsies (79%) from ATAb(+) individuals (5 ANA-negative, 5 with thyroid disease) and one from ATAb(?) ANA(?) individuals showed interface/lichenoid dermatitis with mild basal keratinocyte vaculopathy, variable dermal mucin deposition, and perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates in the upper dermis. The interface dermatitis was not significantly associated with ANA positivity or thyroid disease. In summary, we report an ATAb-associated interface dermatitis in UCTD patients which may represent a new subset of autoimmune disease, and suggest that ATAb tests may be a useful marker for UCTD.

AB  - Background: Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins. The role of cyclin D1 in the development, progression and prognosis of melanomas is controversial. The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of cyclin D1 in benign and malignant melanocytic lesions of the skin. Methods: A total of 101 melanocytic lesions of the skin including compound nevi (21), intradermal nevi (18), melanoma in situ (3), primary invasive melanoma (30), and metastatic melanoma (29) were evaluated for cyclin D1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The following tiered system was used for scoring: 0% of cells with nuclear staining (score 0), 1?19% nuclear staining (score 1), 20?49% nuclear staining (score 2), and 50% or greater nuclear staining (score 3). Results: The average score for primary melanomas was significantly higher compared to nevi (p?=?0.0046), and for in situ melanomas compared to primary invasive melanomas (p?=?0.011). There was slightly higher level of expression in compound nevi versus intradermal nevi. Conclusion: Our study indicates that cyclin D1 expression is increased in malignant compared to benign melanocytic lesions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the biological role of cyclin D1 in melanocytic lesions of the skin.

AB  - Abstract The National Organ Transplant Act stipulates that deceased donor organs should be justly and wisely allocated based on sound medical criteria. Allocation schemes are consistent across the country, and specific policies are publicly vetted. Patient selection criteria are largely in the hands of individual organ transplant programs, and consistent standards are less evident. This has been particularly apparent for patients with developmental disabilities (DDs). In response to concerns regarding the fairness of transplant evaluations for patients with DDs, we developed a transplant centerwide policy using a multidisciplinary, community-based approach. This publication details the particular policy of our center. All patients should receive individualized assessments using consistent standards; disability should be neither a relative nor an absolute contraindication to transplantation. External review can increase trust in the selection process. Patients in persistent vegetative states should not be listed for transplantation.

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Research involving nonhuman primates (NHPs) has played a vital role in many of the medical and scientific advances of the past century. NHPs are used because of their similarity to humans in physiology, neuroanatomy, reproduction, development, cognition, and social complexity?yet it is these very similarities that make the use of NHPs in biomedical research a considered decision. As primate researchers, we feel an obligation and responsibility to present the facts concerning why primates are used in various areas of biomedical research. Recent decisions in the United States, including the phasing out of chimpanzees in research by the National Institutes of Health and the pending closure of the New England Primate Research Center, illustrate to us the critical importance of conveying why continued research with primates is needed. Here, we review key areas in biomedicine where primate models have been, and continue to be, essential for advancing fundamental knowledge in biomedical and biological research. Am. J.

AB  - Porocarcinomas are thought to be differentiated into the acrosyringeal portion of the sweat duct, and they are relatively rare. It may develop from a long standing eccrine poroma undergoing malignant transformation or may arise de novo. We evaluated pathological and immunohistocheimical findings of six cases of eccrine porocarcinoma. Special stains (PAS and PAS with diastase) and immunohistochemical stainings (CEA, CAM5.2, CK7, bcl-2, p53 protein, and MIB-1) were performed. We observed asymmetrical architecture, cytological pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, ductal differentiation, intracytoplasmic lumina, mitotic activity, and melanin colonization. Three patients were male and four patients were female. The average age was 76 years. The time interval from tumor onset to treatment ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The mean size was 3.2?cm, and the mean depth of invasion was 1.0?cm. Four tumors were found on the head, one on the hip, and one on the foot. Regional lymph node metastases were noted in one case. Microscopically, luminal spaces and intracytoplasmic lumina were noted in all cases. Immunohistochemically, the mean MIB-1 index was 41%. P53 immunoreactivity was detected in five cases. Interestingly, a case of porocarcinoma with lymph node metastases showed high mitotic figures as well as less lymphocytic infiltration.

AB  - The recognized breadth of dysplastic nevi has quickly shrunk. We now present very small dysplastic nevi below any described breadth. A cluster of mostly punched-out nevi derived from a single clinician who recognizes as ?atypical? even very small lesions was also assigned histologic dysplasia on architectural and cytologic basis. From 536 junctional nevi with dysplasia ranging from mild to moderate, 136 (25.3%) were 1?mm. in vitro or less while 371 (69.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Among 155 compound nevi with the same range of dysplasia, 19 (12.2%) were 1?mm or less and 95 (61.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Moderate or, less so, severe atypia was even seen in more than half of either 18 junctional and 18 compound nevi of dysplastic type between 2.1 and 3?mm. While the above threshold for dysplasia may not be similar to the one than many dermatopathologists could use, it is still evident that sliding down our higher-grade nevi to meet milder degrees of perceived atypia in a more conservative diagnostic scale, the breadth of these nevi still remains minuscule in general. In sum, we adhere to the idea that dysplastic nevi are not only common but can be extremely small: ?bonsai nevi.?

AB  - Neurotoxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy treatment, with unclear molecular mechanisms. Clinical studies suggest that the most frequent neurotoxic adverse events affect memory and learning, attention, concentration, processing speeds and executive function. Emerging preclinical research points toward direct cellular toxicity and induction of neuroinflammation as key drivers of neurotoxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment. Emerging data now show detectable levels of some chemotherapeutic agents within the CNS, indicating potential disruption of blood brain barrier integrity or transport mechanisms. Blood brain barrier disruption is a key aspect of many neurocognitive disorders, particularly those characterized by a proinflammatory state. Importantly, many proinflammatory mediators able to modulate the blood brain barrier are generated by tissues and organs that are targets for chemotherapy-associated toxicities. This review therefore aims to explore the hypothesis that peripherally derived inflammatory cytokines disrupt blood brain barrier permeability, thereby increasing direct access of chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS to facilitate neuroinflammation and central neurotoxicity.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric drug development is challenging when a product is studied for a pediatric disease that has a different underlying etiology and pathophysiology compared to the adult disease. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) is such a therapeutic area with multiple unsuccessful development programs. The objective of this study was to critically evaluate clinical trial design elements that may have contributed to unsuccessful drug development programs for pediatric NBD. Trial design elements of drugs tested for pediatric NBD were identified from trials submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Data were extracted from publically available FDA reviews and labeling and included trial design, primary endpoints, enrollment eligibilities, and pharmacokinetic data. A total of four products were identified. Although all four programs potentially provided clinically useful information, only one drug (oxybutynin) demonstrated efficacy in children with NBD. The lack of demonstrable efficacy for the remainder of the products illustrates that future trials should give careful attention to testing a range of doses, using objectively measured, clinically meaningful endpoints, and selecting clinical trial designs that are both interpretable and feasible. Compiling the drug development experience with pediatric NBD will facilitate an improved approach for future drug development for this, and perhaps other, therapeutic areas.
