AB  - The aim of this study was to specify the latent construct structure of the Friends and Family Interview (FFI: Steele & Steele, 2005) based on its dimensional scale coding protocol. The FFI is a semi-structured interview measuring attachment in middle childhood. We analyzed data from 341 FFI interviews with children aged 7?12 years, recruited in the Scandinavian Öresund Region. Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed a three-component model as best fitting the data. The first component, denoting attachment security, gathered all dimensional scales for evidence of secure base/safe haven regarding mother/father and coherence in the child?s narrative style, along with scales regarding reflective functioning, self-perception, and social functioning. The second component comprised preoccupying feelings of anger, but also derogation. The third component gathered all scales coding idealization. Inter-relations among the components were consistent with attachment theory, and respondents? scores for all three components differed significantly across the four categorical attachment classifications. Affect regulation of negative emotion through anger and through derogation co-occurred, and was distinct from regulation through maintaining a belief that things are better than they appear (idealization). These two affect regulation strategies appeared commonly when reflective functioning, and an organized self-perception, and positive peer relations were less in evidence. The multi-dimensional FFI coding system appears to measure successfully these diverse features of the child?s narrative provided in response to the interview. Overall, our findings support the construct validity of the FFI and provide further evidence of its usefulness for assessing attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.

AB  - Abstract ?Micromotions? is a term signifying the presence of localized microcontractions and microelongations, alongside non-motile areas. The motile areas tend to shift over the bladder surface with time, and the intravesical pressure reflects moment-by-moment summation of the interplay between net contractile force generated by micromotions and general bladder tone. Functionally, the bladder structure may comprise modules with variable linkage, which supports presence of localized micromotions (no functional linkage between modules), propagating contractions (where emergence of linkage allows sequential activation) and the shifting of micromotions over time. Detrusor muscle, interstitial cells and intramural innervation have properties potentially relevant for initiating, coordinating and modulating micromotions. Conceptually, such activity could facilitate the generation of afferent activity (filling state reporting) in the absence of intravesical pressure change and the ability to transition to voiding at any bladder volume. This autonomous activity is an intrinsic property, seen in various experimental contexts including the clinical setting of human (female) overactive bladder. ?Disinhibited autonomy? may explain the obvious micromotions in isolated bladders and perhaps contribute clinically in neurological disease causing detrusor overactivity. Furthermore, any process that could increase the initiation or propagation of microcontractions might be anticipated to have a functional effect, increasing the likelihood of urinary urgency and detrusor overactivity respectively. Thus, models of bladder outlet obstruction, neurological trauma and ageing provide a useful framework for detecting cellular changes in smooth muscle, interstitial cells and innervation, and the consequent effects on micromotions.

Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - Objectives:? This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between QoL scores for patients with ACD and confounders, such as gender, race, age, and occupation. Methods:? A total of 428 subjects with ACD were, at varying times after diagnosis, mailed a QoL questionnaire modified from Skindex-16 to include an additional 5 items pertaining to occupational impact. The QoL scores were analyzed by gender, race, age, and occupation to ascertain factors that impact QoL in subjects with ACD. Results:? Three of the four confounders examined have a significant connection with QoL in patients with ACD. Non-Caucasians had significantly worse QoL scores than Caucasians within the functioning scale, and had more emotional distress secondary to their disease. There were no statistically significant gender-related differences in QoL scores, although females felt a higher degree of embarrassment and depression. Age significantly impacted items within the functioning and occupational scales, with subjects nearing retirement age and older reporting better QoL. In contrast, younger subjects, especially those in the 5th decade, were more likely to have difficulty pursuing daily activities, have more fear that they might need to leave their jobs, and have more concern for their financial futures. Office workers, students, and homemakers were primarily diagnosed with non-occupational ACD, while more industrial, health care and other wet workers suffered from occupationally related ACD. In the analyses of QoL by occupation, industrial workers reported significantly more impaired QoL than subjects in other professions.

AB  - There is a recent trend to feed pet dogs and cats in Britain and other developed countries on raw meat and animal by-products using either commercial preparations or home recipes. This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria. Other infectious organisms that may be of concern include Listeria, shiga toxigenic E scherichia coli , parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and exotic agents such as the zoonotic livestock pathogen Brucella suis, recently identified in European Union and UK raw pet meat imported from Argentina.

AB  - 1 Ronald Emerson ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Until recently, functional neurological assessment of neurologically critically ill patients has been limited largely to periodic physical examinations, often compromised by medication effects, along with occasional, brief EEG's. This is changing with the availability of continuous/EEG monitoring, made practical by recent advances in computer and network technology. Indeed, in some centers, continuous EEG monitoring, with or without concurrent video, has become part of routine neuro-critical care. Its greatest initial impact has been on the recognition and management of non-convulsive seizures. The use of EEG monitoring for real-time detection of cerebral ischemia will likely become compelling as effective treatments for acute stroke emerge. Practical implementation of EEG-based cerebral ischemia detection in the ICU, however, awaits development of reliable, robust automated detection algorithms capable of triggering bedside alarms. Concurrent monitoring of other physiological parameters, including blood pressures, intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation along with EEG-derived parameters may provide the basis for development of better treatment models incorporating multivariable feedback systems. Evoked potentials can provide useful prognostic information, with long latency evoked potentials attracting recent attention as possible predictors of recovery of consciousness in comatose patients.

AB  - Purpose? The use of adjuvant therapies in colorectal carcinoma is becoming more common. However, it can be logistically difficult for patients of regional hospitals to have access to such treatments. Our aim was to document the proportion of regional patients with colorectal cancer who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Method? An audit of all patients treated for colorectal cancer at Toowoomba Base Hospital between 1 January 1990 and 1 April 2006 was undertaken. Chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, anatomical location and histological grade of the cancers were examined. Findings? Of the 225 patients who had surgery for Dukes B colonic carcinomas, 22.7% were given chemotherapy. This rate increased to 59.6% for Dukes C colon cancers. 141 rectal cancers were curatively excised during the prescribed period. 39 of these patients received radiotherapy (27.7%). Of these, only 2 (5.13%) had pre-operative radiotherapy. 19 patients had rectal cancers which were considered non resectable and of these, 5 (26.3%) were treated with radiotherapy. Conclusion? Despite the paucity of high level evidence showing a benefit in using adjuvant therapy in node negative colon cancers, a relatively large proportion of our regional patients with Dukes B adenocarcinomas were given chemotherapy. The rate of such therapy for Dukes C cancers was comparable to other studies. Fewer than expected patients with rectal adenocarcinomas had radiotherapy. Of those who did receive this, only a very small proportion received pre-operative radiotherapy. It may be that the lower than expected rates of radiotherapy were due to this service being located about 130?km from Toowoomba Hospital.

AB  - Purpose:? Identify practices to reduce HD catheter access related bacteremias (ARB). Methods:?Data was collected per the CDC Dialysis Surveillance Network protocol. ARB was defined as a patient with a positive blood culture with no apparent source other than the vascular access catheter. ARB's were calculated in events per 100 patient months with 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 was observed for 12 months, Cohort 2 for the subsequent 10 months, and Cohort 3 for the final 10 months. Cohort 1 had weekly transparent dressing changes, cleansing of the skin and 5 minute soaking of the connection lines with 10% povidone-iodine (PI) solution, and HCW use of clean gloves and face shield without a mask. Cohort 2 changes consisted of thrice weekly gauze dressing changes, skin cleansing with ChloraPrep, a 2% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol applicator, masks on the patients, adding a face mask to the shield, and application of 10% PI ointment to the exit site. Cohort 3 changes included weekly application of BioPatch (BioP), an antimicrobial dressing with CHG, sterile glove use, and replacing the PI line soaks with 4% CHG. Results:?The catheter-associated ARB rate per 100 patient months was 7.9 (17ARB/216 patient months) in Cohort 1, 8.6 (13/151) in Cohort 2, and 4.7 (5/107) in Cohort 3(p?=?0.31 compared with Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). During the last 2 months, in Cohort 3, 9 catheter lumen cracks occurred, with one of the patients having a bacteremia. Conclusions:?Addition of CHG line soaks and BioP reduced tunneled catheter infections, although this is not statistically significant. The increased number of catheter lumen cracks raises concern with the use of CHG line soaks. Further investigation with use of CHG line soaks and the BioP for decreasing ARB is needed.

Design and Methods The CONSORT guidelines were followed in the current study; a randomized clinical trial, two groups, pre posttest, between subjects design with 1:1 allocation ratio was employed. Children (5?11 years of age; N?=?128) admitted for day case surgery were invited to participate in the study. Sixty-four children were assigned to the intervention group receiving combined videogame distraction and anesthesia mask exposure and shaping intervention, and 64 children were assigned to the control group. Results The results showed that children in the intervention group reported statistically significant lower anxiety scores than the children in the control group at three preoperative points of time: postintervention t?=?4.48, p?<?.001, at the time of transfer to the operation room t?=?10.18; p?<?.001 and during anesthesia induction t?=?7.76; p?<?.001. In addition, compared with the children in the control group, fewer children in the intervention group demonstrated poor anesthesia induction compliance ?2?=?3.91; p?=?.04. The results, however, did not reveal statistically significant differences in children's emergence delirium scores. Practice Implication Combined video game distraction and anesthesia mask exposure and shaping are simple, safe, and time-effective intervention that the nurses can implement at the day of surgery to mitigate children anxiety and to enhance their anesthesia induction compliance.

AB  - Obturator hernia is a very rare cause of small bowel obstruction accounting for only 0.073?1% of all hernias(1). Here we report two such cases. A 69 year old female presents with 11/2 day history of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting and left medial thigh pain. Past history includes an admission 2 year ago with small bowel obstruction treated conservatively, diverticular disease and no previous abdominal surgery. At presentation she was unwell with recurrent faeculent vomiting. The abdomen was soft but generally tender. The left medial thigh was tender. No femoral hernia. Abdominal films revealed a dilated loop of small bowel. Blood results: raised WCC 18.7 (4.0?10.0), CRP 66 (<5). Obturator hernia was suspected and CT confirmed this. Laparotomy revealed a Richter?s hernia and viable small bowel. The defect was primarily closed. Patient was discharged 4 days post operatively. An 89 year old female presented with several days of colicky abdominal pain and no bowel motions. She had multiple co-morbidities including advanced Vascular Dementia, Asthma and Hypertension. At presentation she was unwell. Abdominal exam revealed right illiac fossa guarding with a normal WCC and a raised CRP 78. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alklosis with respiratory compensation. CT abdomen reported a small bowel obstruction due to right Obturator hernia with perforation. Due to her co-morbidities she was managed conservatively and she passed away a week later. The management of Obturator hernias is still open to debate with a wide variety of methods being described.

AB  - Purpose? To assess whether evidence based proforma?s and departmental audit can improve the management of patients with acute pancreatitis as compared to published international guidelines. Methodology? From June 2005 all patients admitted with acute pancreatitis were required to have an evidence based proforma prospectively completed. In March 2006 an interim analysis was performed and presented to the department of General Surgery highlighting areas which deviated from published guidelines. Key clinical indicators were analysed pre and post presentation. Results? Two hundred and eighty one patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis, 168 (60%) of whom were analysed in the interim analysis. The median (range) age was 59 (12?96) years and the aetiology was gallstones in 149/281 (53%) patients. 140/281 (50%) patients had predicted severe pancreatitis, but there was no difference pre and post departmental presentation (85/168 (51%) vs. 56/113 (50%), p?=?0.865). On univariate analysis following the departmental presentation there was a significant reduction in the number of CT scans performed (76/168 (45%) vs. 30/113 (27%), p?=?0.002), an increase in the number of patients undergoing definitive treatment for mild biliary pancreatitis (36/65 (55%) vs. 35/43 (81%), p?=?0.006) and a reduction in mortality (9/168 (5%) vs. 1/113 (1%), p?=?0.047). Multivariate analysis confirmed departmental presentation as independent prognostic factor in reducing the number of CT scans (p?<?0.001) and increasing definitive treatment of mild biliary pancreatitis (p?=?0.02). Conclusions? For Audit to change practice evidence based protocols alone are not sufficient. Feedback to clinicians would appear to be a powerful motivator of change.
