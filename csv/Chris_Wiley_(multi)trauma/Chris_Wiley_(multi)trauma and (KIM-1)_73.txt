AB  - Abstract Research on disaster resilience has increasingly focused on the role of social capital and online social networks in disaster recovery. This study complements this field of research by investigating three under addressed issues. First, we analyzed how a social messaging application, WeChat, helped individuals access and mobilize bonding, bridging and linking social capital during Hurricane Harvey. Second, we quantitatively analyzed and identified how individuals' WeChat group usage and social capital influenced their post-disaster well-being. Lastly, our research demonstrated how a minority and immigrant community overcame disadvantages commonly observed in other disaster research by utilizing social media. Results of this study contribute to governmental and community efforts in fostering resilience during natural and man-made hazards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

AB  - Abstract Introduction ?Psychiatric disorders can start at a very young age, though prevalence of specific disorders change over time. Consequently, any study of continuities and discontinuities should start in infancy, and core concepts of developmental psychopathology are useful for understanding the data. Violence is a major societal problem, while the most effective intervention is to prevent the developmental, normative aggression in very early childhood, from turning into conduct disorders and antisocial personality disorders later in life. The aims of this study were to apply the core concepts of developmental psychopathology to the understanding of the data about how developmental aggression in infancy may turn into pathological violence and conduct disorders in childhood and then into psychopathology in adulthood. Methods ?Selective computerized review of the literature examining longitudinal studies of aggression and violence from infancy to adulthood was conducted. Results ?Pathways of continuity and discontinuity of aggression and violence were identified from infancy into adulthood. Early care-giving quality is a major contributor to the outcomes, but additional risk and protective factors are in a dynamic and complex interplay. The longer a pathway is pursued, the more difficult change becomes. Discussion ?Intervention programs aimed at reducing violence among individuals and societies should target risk and protective factors, at least as much as the symptoms.

AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Esthetic considerations are a significant contributing factor in the management of prosthodontic cases and an interdisciplinary approach is often necessary to achieve an optimal result. The visible soft-tissue architecture plays a key role in developing an esthetic smile. Furthermore, an understanding of the relationship between the restorative margin and the gingiva is important for long-term stability of the result. The gingival architecture and gingival health are important for ensuring optimal esthetics following prosthodontic work and close attention to both soft and hard tissues around the teeth, before, during and after restorative procedures, will greatly improve the likelihood of a successful outcome. Moreover, knowing the options available in periodontal plastic surgery is important in esthetic dentistry today. The relevant literature related to restorative and surgical procedures when performing esthetic dentistry are reviewed in this article, and different approaches are illustrated with appropriate cases to explain the treatment approach that was utilized to improve the esthetic appearance of the case.

AB  - Abstract Microglia have diverse actions, ranging from synapse pruning in development to cytotoxic effects in disease. Brain energy metabolism and substrate availability vary under normal and disease states, but how these variations influence microglial function is relatively unknown. Microglia, like most other cell types, express the full complement of gene products required for both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. Evidence suggests that microglia increase aerobic glycolysis and decrease respiration when activated by various stimuli. Mitochondrial function, glucose availability, and glycolytic rate influence pro-inflammatory gene expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. These effects are mediated through CtBP, an NADH?sensitive transcriptional co-repressor; through effects on NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation; through formation of advanced glycation end-products; and by less well-defined mechanisms. In addition to these transcriptional effects, microglial glucose metabolism is also required for superoxide production by NADPH oxidase, as glucose is the obligate substrate for regenerating NADPH in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Microglia also metabolize acetoacetate and ?-hydroxybutyrate, which are generated during fasting or ketogenic diet, and respond to these ketones as metabolic signals. ?-Hydroxybutyrate inhibits histone de-acetylases and activates microglial GRP109A receptors. These actions suppress microglia activation after brain injury and promote neuroprotective microglia phenotypes. As our understanding of microglial activation matures, additional links between energy metabolism and microglial function are likely to be identified.

AB  - Unlike drugs and medical devices, for which long standing and continuously improving quality assurance/quality control infrastructures exist, many nano-based products lack well-defined standards that are useful to manufacturers and regulators. Inherent variabilities in nanoparticle sizes and shapes, their large surface-to-volume ratios, and their mesoscale interactions with subcellular structures, suggest new complexities and challenges that must be met before widespread application of nanomedicines can be expected.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Over the past decade, Prigerson and her colleagues have shown that symptoms of ?complicated grief??intense yearning, difficulty accepting the death, excessive bitterness, numbness, emptiness, and feeling uneasy moving on and that the future is bleak?are distinct from depression and anxiety and are independently associated with substantial morbidity. Little is known about complicated grief experienced by family caregivers prior to the death. This study sought to examine differences in caregiver age groups and potential risk factors for complicated grief pre-death. Method: Two hundred and forty eight caregivers from multiple sites nationwide (20?86 years of age) identified themselves as primary caregivers to a terminally ill cancer patient. Each caregiver was interviewed using the following measures: the Pre-Death Inventory of Complicated Grief-Caregiver Version; the Brief Interpersonal Support Evaluation List; the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I; the Life Orientation Test-Revised; the SEPRATE Measure of Stressful Life Events; the Covinsky Family Impact Survey; and mental health access questions. Results: The study found that those under 60 years old had higher levels of complicated grief pre-death than caregivers 60 and older (t(246)=2.30, p<0.05). Significant correlations were also found between levels of complicated grief pre-loss and the following psychosocial factors: perceived social support (r=?0.415, p<0.001); history of depression (r=?0.169, p<0.05); current depression (r=?0.158, p<0.05); current annual income (Spearman rho =?0.210, p<0.01); annual income at time of patient's diagnosis (Spearman rho =?0.155, p=0.05); pessimistic thinking (r=0.320, p<0.001); and number of moderate to severe stressful life events (Spearman rho = 0.218, p=0.001). In a multi-variate analysis (R2=0.368), pessimistic thinking (Beta = 0.208, p<0.05) and severity of stressful life events (Beta = 0.222, p<0.05) remained as important factors to developing complicated grief pre-death. Conclusions: These results suggest that mental health professionals who work with caregivers should pay particular attention to pessimistic thinking and stressful life events, beyond the stress of the loved one's illness, that caretakers experience. Additionally, although not reaching significance, mental health professionals should also consider younger caregivers at greater risk for complicated grief pre-loss.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the hand hygiene (HH) practices among veterinary technicians (VT) and veterinary support staff (VSS) in small animal private practice. Methods: This was a prospective questionnaire-based study involving 182 VT and VSS from 18 small animal hospitals in the USA. Questions asked included gender, number of animals handled per work shift, frequency of hand washing, reason for not washing more frequently, most common available hand washing agent, education regarding the importance of HH and frequency of ring wearing. Results: Less than half of the respondents [76 of 182 (41¬∑7%)] reported washing their hands regularly between handling patients and 154 of 182 (85¬∑6%) believed they should have washed more frequently. The most commonly employed HH agent was hand soap [154 of 182 (84¬∑6%)] and the most common reason cited for not washing more frequently was being too busy [132 of 182 (72¬∑5%)]. Only 96 of 182 (52¬∑7%) respondents were educated by doctors at their hospital regarding the importance of HH. Clinical Significance: The HH practices among VT and VSS in small animal private practice is poor. Hand soap was the most commonly employed agent among respondents in this study. Education of VT and VSS regarding the importance of HH requires improvement.

AB  - This study was conducted to know the impact of cryopreservation on caprine fetal adnexa derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the basic stem cell characteristics. Gravid caprine uteri (2?3 months) were collected from local abattoir to derive (amniotic fluid [cAF], amniotic sac [cAS], Wharton's jelly [cWJ], and cord blood [cCB]) MSCs and expanded in vitro. Cells were cryopreserved at 3rd passage (P3) using 10% DMSO. Post-thaw viability and cellular properties were assessed. Cells were expanded to determine growth kinetics, tri-lineage differentiation, localization, and molecular expression of MSCs and pluripotency markers; thereafter, these cells were transplanted in the full-thickness (2???2cm2) rat skin wound to determine their wound healing potential. The post-thaw (pt) growth kinetics study suggested that cWJ MSCs expanded more rapidly with faster population doubling time (PDT) than that of other fetal adnexa MSCs. The relative mRNA expression of surface antigens (CD73, CD90, and CD 105) and pluripotency markers (Oct4, KLF, and cMyc) was higher in cWJ MSCs in comparison to cAS, cAF, and cCB MSCs post-thaw. The percent wound contraction on 7th day was more than 50% for all the MSC-treated groups (pre and post-thaw), against 39.55% in the control group. On day 28th, 99% and more wound contraction was observed in cAF, cAF-pt, cAS-pt, cWJ, cWJ-pt, and cCB, MSCs with better scores for epithelization, neovascularization, and collagen characteristics at a non-significant level. It is concluded that these MSCs could be successfully cryopreserved without altering their stemness and wound healing properties. J. Cell.

AB  - Degenerative disease of the spine is one of the most common clinical entities and affects the intervertebral discs, including opposing vertebral endplates, the intervertebral posterior joints and the ligaments. The most severe primary spinal degenerative changes are found in the lower cervical and lumbar spine regions. The spine contains three different types of joints, each of which presents its own pattern of degenerative disease: cartilaginous joints, synovial joints, and fibrous joints. With regard to radicular pain, root compression alone does not fully account for root pain following disc-root conflict, but it is, nevertheless, considered to be the main cause of pain. The authors pointed out that the origin of pain is multi-factorial and that inflammation probably predominates over merely mechanical mechanisms. They also considered whether vertebral arthrosis can be construed as the body's decision to favor the spine's static function over its dynamic role when joint ?hypermobility? linked to chronic load in old age could cause severe structural damage to the bony vertebral structures.
