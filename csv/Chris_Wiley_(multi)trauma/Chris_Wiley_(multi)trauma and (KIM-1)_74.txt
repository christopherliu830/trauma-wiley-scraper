AB  - Cartilage is one of the most essential tissues for healthy joint function and is compromised in degenerative and traumatic joint diseases. There have been tremendous advances during the past decade using quantitative MRI techniques as a noninvasive tool for evaluating cartilage, with a focus on assessing cartilage degeneration during osteoarthritis (OA). In this review, after a brief overview of cartilage composition and degeneration, we discuss techniques that grade and quantify morphologic changes as well as the techniques that quantify changes in the extracellular matrix. The basic principles, in vivo applications, advantages, and challenges for each technique are discussed. Recent studies using the OA Initiative (OAI) data are also summarized. Quantitative MRI provides noninvasive measures of cartilage degeneration at the earliest stages of joint degeneration, which is essential for efforts toward prevention and early intervention in OA.

AB  - Degenerative disease of the spine is one of the most common clinical entities and affects the intervertebral discs, including opposing vertebral endplates, the intervertebral posterior joints and the ligaments. The most severe primary spinal degenerative changes are found in the lower cervical and lumbar spine regions. The spine contains three different types of joints, each of which presents its own pattern of degenerative disease: cartilaginous joints, synovial joints, and fibrous joints. With regard to radicular pain, root compression alone does not fully account for root pain following disc-root conflict, but it is, nevertheless, considered to be the main cause of pain. The authors pointed out that the origin of pain is multi-factorial and that inflammation probably predominates over merely mechanical mechanisms. They also considered whether vertebral arthrosis can be construed as the body's decision to favor the spine's static function over its dynamic role when joint ?hypermobility? linked to chronic load in old age could cause severe structural damage to the bony vertebral structures.

AB  - Purpose This review examines women's risk perception of cervical cancer, the factors influencing this perception, and the relationship between risk perception of cervical cancer and screening behavior. Methods Integrative literature review method was used. Findings The search procedure resulted in the identification of 42 studies, including 1 literature review and 41 primary studies. Trends and discrepancies in the literature are presented with interpretations and recommendations. Conclusion Existing theories of health behavior appear inadequate for understanding screening behavior, and further studies are recommended to enrich the knowledge base of nursing diagnoses in knowledge deficit and health-seeking behavior. Implications for Nursing Practice Efforts would be made to improve nurses' understanding of risk perception of cervical cancer within specific cultural context.

AB  - Abstract The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), launched in 2004, has worked to accelerate drug development by validating imaging and blood/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease clinical treatment trials. ADNI is a naturalistic (nontreatment) multisite longitudinal study. A true public-private partnership, the initiative has set a new standard for data sharing without embargo and for the use of biomarkers in dementia research. The ADNI effort in North America is not the only such effort in the world. The Alzheimer's Association recognized these global efforts and formed Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI). By creating a platform for international collaboration and cooperation, WW-ADNI's goals are to harmonize projects and results across geographical regions and to facilitate data management and availability to investigators around the world. WW-ADNI projects include those based in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, Korea, and Argentina.

AB  - 1 Ajay Gupta, and 2 Mohamad Mikati ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon ) There is a unique, apparently heterogeneous, group of epilepsy syndromes in children that is characterized by sleep activation of the epileptiform abnormalities with nearly continuous sharp waves seen on the scalp EEG during sleep. These include commonly recognized childhood conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES), and benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). Most of these children have a period of normal development and healthy childhood. Besides presenting with seizures that are often not too difficult to treat, these children have other major cognitive, behavioral and academic difficulties that are disproportionate to the burden of epilepsy and medications used to treat them. It is commonly believed that abnormal electrical activity in sleep per se leads to cognitive, behavioral, and academic difficulties in these children. However, the pathophysiological understanding of this phenomenon of sleep activation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Moreover, there are also controversies regarding terminology, classification, and management of these disorders. Some experts believe that these conditions are distinct disease entities while others hypothesize that they may represent a spectrum of one condition. Similar sleep activation of epileptic discharges has also been reported in some other children with neuroimaging abnormalities in the deep gray nuclei. Some experts believe that the treatment with antiepileptic medications in these children should be titrated to the EEG response in sleep and not to the clinical response of seizures. It is unclear as to how often a sleep EEG should be done, and to what extent aggressive medical treatment and antiepileptic polytherapy be pursued. Use of steroids, recent success with high dose nightly benzodiazepine therapy, and surgical procedure like multiple subpial transactions in the insular regions continue to be controversial due to risk of serious side effects and modest benefits in reported anecdotal case reports and series. The focus of this symposium is to revisit these syndromes to: a) define the clinical spectrum of these conditions; b) formulate the best practices for management in the light of controversies in medical and surgical options; and c) discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and probe future strategies for better treatment. Margret Shouse will show similarities between kindled epileptic kittens and sleep activation of EEG in children with these conditions. She will review the potential mechanisms and generators of EEG activity during sleep, discuss how the cognitive and behavioral sequelae may occur regardless of severe seizure burden. Edouard Hirsch will discuss the available clinical evidence to suggest that these ?disorders may be a clinical spectrum of one condition? and not distinct disease entities. He will also discuss diagnostic criteria and role of neuroimaging. Jim Rivello will review the available evidence, and emphasize the best clinical practices for management in these children. First, he will discuss the goals of treatment i.e. seizure control, behavior improvement, cognition monitoring, and sleep EEG improvement. Second, he will formulate a treatment and follow-up plan with indications for various medical (anti epileptic agents, steroids, nightly benzodiazepenes etc.) and surgical (multiple subpial transactions) options. Each speaker will also formulate an important research question for the future that will improve our understanding of these conditions for devising better treatment methods. Live interaction with the diverse group of audience will also provide a forum to discuss where and how we should move forward with a collaborative effort for advancing our knowledge and treatment of these conditions.

AB  - Objectives To investigate possible interactions visible on electroencephalogram recordings caused by concomitant administration of marbofloxacin and carprofen or cimicoxib in dogs without central nervous system disease. Methods Totally 21 client-owned dogs undergoing different surgeries were included in a randomised, blinded, clinical study. Each dog was assigned to one of two groups treated with either carprofen or cimicoxib pre- and postoperatively. After anaesthetic induction both groups received marbofloxacin intravenously while recording an electroencephalogram. Offline electroencephalogram analysis included qualitative evaluation and Fast Fourier Transformation. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for 24 hours and after 10 days with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann?Whitney U test and Student's t-test with α set at 5%. Results Marbofloxacin injection caused no effects on quantitative and qualitative electroencephalogram parameters in both groups. No differences in postoperative pain scoring were found between treatment groups. Clinical Significance Concurrent use of marbofloxacin with either cimicoxib or carprofen did not induce neuroexcitatory activities in dogs without CNS disease directly after administration.

AB  - Summary: Assembly of C5b-9 on cell membranes results in transmembrane channels and causes cell death. When the number of C5b-9 molecules is limited, nucleated cells are able to escape cell death by endocytosis and by shedding of membranes bearing C5b-9. Sublytic C5b-9 induces proto-oncogenes, activates the cell cycle, and enhances cell survival. In addition, C5b-9 reverses the differentiated phenotype of post-mitotic cells, such as oligodendrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. The signal transduction pathways responsible for cell cycle activation by C5b-9 include Gi-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Cell survival enhanced by C5b-9 is mediated by the PI3-K/Akt pathway, which inhibits apoptosis through regulation of BAD. These findings indicate that complement activation and membrane assembly of sublytic C5b-9 play an important role in inflammation by promoting cell proliferation and by rescuing apoptotic cells. This work was supported by NIH grants NS36231 and NS15662 and by multiple sclerosis pilot award PP-696.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a significant public health concern, and growing recognition in Australia led to the establishment of a specialist service for young children. The aim of the current study was to report on the diagnostic profile of a group of children who attended the service, to document the extent to which there were comorbid diagnoses and to provide information on the neurocognitive functioning of the children. Design and Methods. This study was a retrospective chart review conducted by the diagnostic service. A pre-formulated tool to extract the diagnostic data from the client files was designed, a chart review was performed, and the required data was extracted. FASD diagnoses were made using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code. Results. Thirty-one families participated, and the majority of children were diagnosed with static encephalopathy (alcohol exposed) or neurobehavioral disorder (alcohol exposed) (11 children each; 36%). Only one child was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (alcohol exposed), and five children were diagnosed with partial fetal alcohol syndrome (alcohol exposed). Twenty-six children (84%) had a comorbid diagnosis, with 19 (61%) having a comorbid diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. While the majority of children were not found to display growth deficiency or significant facial features, 18 children (58%) had significant central nervous system dysfunction. Discussion and Conclusions. The current study demonstrates that with the relevant training and expertise, assessment and diagnosis of FASD can be embedded within the existing health services available in Australia.
