AB  - Abstract Drawing on dozens of in-depth life-history interviews and extensive participant observation in mosques and community centers, this article probes the interaction of religion and nationalism in the formation of individual identities within the Palestinian immigrant community in Chicago, Illinois since the late 1980s. The analysis focuses on three individuals who represent distinct approaches to negotiating the relationship of religion and nation. The first approach is context-adaptive, responding and accommodating to the diverging moral assumptions that underlie the ethos of religious and secular spaces. The second approach entails a transition from secular-nationalism to a type of Islamic nationalism or even Islamic secularism. The third approach resists both forms of nationalism, seeking a transcendent Islam in which ethnicity and nation recede within a new religious humanism. The core argument throughout is that processes of religious return, often analyzed in relation to transnational trends, take diverse and indeterminate forms. This fact results from the shaping effects of a range of ?secular? factors ? gender, generation, class, family dynamics, intercommunal interactions, traumatic events ? which register within the specific local settings of ordinary life.

AB  - ABSTRACT A multitude of morphological aspects of the human middle ear (ME) were studied qualitatively and/or quantitatively through the postprocessing and interpretation of micro-CT (micro X-ray computed tomography) data of six human temporal bones. The samples were scanned after phosphotungstic acid staining to enhance soft-tissue contrast. The influence of this staining on ME ossicle configuration was shown to be insignificant. Through postprocessing, the image data were converted into surface models, after which the approaches diverged depending on the topics of interest. The studied topics were: the ME ligaments; morphometric and mechanical parameters of the ossicles relating to inertia and the ossicular lever arm ratio; the morphology of the distal incus; the contact surface areas of the tympanic membrane (TM) and of the stapes footplate; and the thickness of the TM, round window of the cochlea, ossicle joint spaces, and stapedial annular ligament. Some of the resulting insights are relevant in ongoing discussions concerning ME morphology and mechanical functions, while other results provide quantitative data to add to existing data. All findings are discussed in the light of other published data and many are relevant for the construction of mechanical finite element simulations of the ME. J.

AB  - Abstract Background The reconstruction of complex defects in the posterior trunk is a challenging problem. Various surgical methods using local flap, propeller flap, and muscle flap have been reported. However, in case where a free flap is inevitable, due to the absence of usable recipient vessels, eventually it may fail to perform or the use of long vessel graft is mandatory. To overcome this problem, we investigated use of perforator as recipient vessel in posterior trunk region and here we report satisfactory outcomes of the cases. Patients and Methods Eighteen cases with posterior trunk defects underwent reconstruction surgeries using various free flaps. Perforating vessels, from either the base or margin of the defect, were evaluated by preoperative computed tomography and hand-held Doppler. During the dissection, preoperatively marked perforators, with visual healthy pulsation and appropriate diameter for anastomosis, were selected and used for a recipient vessel for free flap. Results Perforating vessels from the posterior trunk (0.8?1.3 mm in diameter) were used as recipient vessels and the average size of the defect was 85.2 cm2. In all cases, one artery and vein was used for anastomosis. No flap necrosis occurred. Hematoma developed in one case and partial wound disruption developed in 2 cases. Conclusion Surgical method using perforators as recipients for free flap reconstruction can be one of a good treatment option for posterior trunk reconstruction. We think that microsurgeons need not to hesitate when they use perforating vessel as a recipient vessel.

AB  - Abstract. Purpose:? To investigate the risks of implant exposure after a combined explant?implant procedure in patients with an exposed porous orbital implant. Methods:? Twenty-four consecutive patients who had a combined explant?implant procedure of an exposed hydroxyapatite (21) or porous polyethylene (3) orbital implant from January 2000 to February 2009 were included. The patient records were reviewed; patients were interviewed by telephone and invited for a clinical examination. Histopathological examination was carried out on the removed implants. Main outcome measures were: presence of exposure of the new implant or not, patient graded satisfaction with the cosmetic result, and presence of poor motility. Results:? None of the new implants became exposed or infected in the follow-up period of 25 [3?94] months (median [range]). The patients scored their satisfaction with the cosmetic result to a median score of 9 (range 5?10). Poor motility was present in six of 17 patients. Micro-organisms were identified in three removed implants and signs of inflammation were present in 20 removed implants. Conclusions:? If a decision of implant removal has been made, it is safe to replace the implant at the same procedure in sockets without profound signs of infection. The procedure carries a possible risk of poor motility.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 263?268 Objective:? The aim of this study was to investigate the proliferation, migration and death of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells after tooth replantation. Materials and methods:? Maxillary first molars were extracted from 4-week-old male (n?=?28) Sprague?Dawley rats and immediately replanted, after which, proliferation, migration and death of PDL cells were investigated. Results:? At 3?days after tooth replantation, many proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive PDL cells were observed on the alveolar bone side, but fewer on the root side. However, while a gradual decrease was observed in number of PCNA-positive PDL cells on the alveolar bone side until 7?days, an increase was seen on the root side. At 3?weeks, cells labeled with PKH26 (fluorescent dye into plasma membrane) were located in the middle of the PDL space. However, these PKH26-labeled cells did not spread to the surface of the cementum or the alveolar bone. TUNEL-positive cells were observed on both the bone and root sides at 3?days. Number of apoptotic cells increased until 7?days on the bone sides, but decreased on root sides. Conclusion:? These results suggest that both cell proliferation and apoptosis occur in different patterns and at different times to maintain regular spacing of the PDL after tooth replantation.

AB  - Abstract Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used technique for investigating functional connectivity (fc) in functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), that is, ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, has been shown to detect local fc networks in particular brain regions, including the cerebellum, brainstem, posterior cingulate cortex, operculo-insular cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. Here, we present the mICA toolbox, an open-source GUI toolbox based on FSL command line tools that performs mICA and related analyses in an integrated way. Functions include automated mask generation from atlases, essential preprocessing, mICA-based parcellation, back-reconstruction of whole-brain fc networks from local ones, and reproducibility analysis. Automated slice-wise calculation and cropping are additional functions that reduce computational time and memory requirements for large analyses. To validate our toolbox, we tested these different functions on the cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem, using resting-state and task-based data from the Human Connectome Project. In the cerebellum, mICA detected six local networks together with their whole-brain counterparts, closely replicating previous results. MICA-based parcellation of the hippocampus showed a longitudinally discrete configuration with greater heterogeneity in the anterior hippocampus, consistent with animal and human literature. Finally, brainstem mICA detected motor and sensory nuclei involved in the motor task of tongue movement, thereby replicating and extending earlier results.

There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred blood access for hemodialysis due to its longevity and resistance to infection. Little attention is given to the long-term hemodynamic consequences of large left-to-right shunts, particularly in patients with brachial artery fistulae. Materials and Methods:?We describe 9 patients (8 on dialysis, 1 post-transplant), aged 25?73, who developed clinical heart failure, primarily due to large, upper arm AVFs. Results:?4/9 had access flows in excess of 2 liters/min, assessed by blood temperature monitoring. 6/9 had cardiac output measured by right heart catheterization, before and after shunt compression. One also underwent left heart catheterization with ventriculography. 3/9 had surgical reduction of the fistula, either by banding or by serial interposition of small caliber GoreTex graft. In 2/9 the shunt was ligated. One patient had heart failure in association with 2 large, upper arm AVFs, one of which was ligated. After years of improved cardiac symptoms, heart failure recurred in association with marked hypertrophy of his remaining AVF. Resting cardiac output in this patient was in excess of 11 liters/min. 2/9 experienced acute onset of heart failure within 1?3 days of angioplasty of a venous stenosis. One of these, with very poor baseline cardiac function, expired. Surgical revision or ligation was accompanied by clinical improvement in the 5 patients so treated. One of these expired of a stroke after two months of cardiac improvement. Conclusion:?High output heart failure is under-diagnosed in dialysis patients. Patients with large upper arm shunts are particularly at risk. Access flow should be assessed regularly and those with outputs >1.5 liters/min should be monitored closely for development of heart failure. Surgical correction is beneficial and indicated in symptomatic patients.

AB  - Key points? ?? Neurons can be damaged when tissues are stretched or swollen; while astrocytes can contribute to this process, the mechanosensitive response from neurons is unclear. ?? We show here that isolated retinal ganglion cell neurons respond to mechanical strain with a rapid, sustained release of the neurotransmitter ATP. ?? The conduit for ATP release was through pannexin hemichannels, with probenicid, carbenoxelone and 10panx inhibiting release. ?? Once released, this ATP acts back on the neurons to autostimulate lethal P2X7 receptors, as A438079, AZ 10606120 and zinc reduced currents in whole cell patch clamp recordings. ?? Blocking release of ATP through pannexin channels, or activation of P2X7 receptors, might be neuroprotective for stretched or swollen neurons. ?? Stretch-dependent release of ATP through neuronal pannexins, combined with the autostimulation of the P2X7 receptors, provides a new pathway by which neuronal activity and health can be altered by mechanical strain independently of glial activity. Abstract? Mechanical deformation produces complex effects on neuronal systems, some of which can lead to dysfunction and neuronal death. While astrocytes are known to respond to mechanical forces, it is not clear whether neurons can also respond directly. We examined mechanosensitive ATP release and the physiological response to this release in isolated retinal ganglion cells. Purified ganglion cells released ATP upon swelling. Release was blocked by carbenoxolone, probenecid or peptide 10panx, implicating pannexin channels as conduits. Mechanical stretch of retinal ganglion cells also triggered a pannexin-dependent ATP release. Whole cell patch clamp recording demonstrated that mild swelling induced the activation of an Ohmic cation current with linear kinetics. The current was inhibited by removal of extracellular ATP with apyrase, by inhibition of the P2X7 receptor with A438079, zinc, or AZ 10606120, and by pannexin blockers carbenoxolone and probenecid. Probenecid also inhibited the regulatory volume decrease observed after swelling isolated neurons. Together, these observations indicate mechanical strain triggers ATP release directly from retinal ganglion cells and that this released ATP autostimulates P2X7 receptors. Since extracellular ATP levels in the retina increase with elevated intraocular pressure, and stimulation of P2X7 receptors on retinal ganglion cells can be lethal, this autocrine response may impact ganglion cells in glaucoma. It remains to be determined whether the autocrine stimulation of purinergic receptors is a general response to a mechanical deformation in neurons, or whether preventing ATP release through pannexin channels and blocking activation of the P2X7 receptor, is neuroprotective for stretched neurons.
