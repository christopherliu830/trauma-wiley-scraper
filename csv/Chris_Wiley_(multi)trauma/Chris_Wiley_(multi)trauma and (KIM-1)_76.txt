AB  - 36 I. 36 II. 37 III. 44 IV. 49 V. 53 54 References 55 Summary Anoxia tolerance in plants is distinguished by direction of the sparse supply of energy to processes crucial to cell maintenance and sometimes to growth, as in rice seedlings. In anoxic rice coleoptiles energy is used to synthesise proteins, take up K+, synthesise cell walls and lipids, and in cell maintenance. Maintenance of electrochemical H+ gradients across the tonoplast and plasma membrane is crucial for solute compartmentation and thus survival. These gradients sustain some H+-solute cotransport and regulate cytoplasmic pH. Pyrophosphate (PPi), the alternative energy donor to ATP, allows direction of energy to the vacuolar H+-PPiase, sustaining H+ gradients across the tonoplast. When energy production is critically low, operation of a biochemical pHstat allows H+-solute cotransport across plasma membranes to continue for at least for 18 h. In active (e.g. growing) cells, PPi produced during substantial polymer synthesis allows conversion of PPi to ATP by PPi-phosphofructokinase (PFK). In quiescent cells with little polymer synthesis and associated PPi formation, the PPi required by the vacuolar H+-PPiase and UDPG pyrophosphorylase involved in sucrose mobilisation via sucrose synthase might be produced by conversion of ATP to PPi through reversible glycolytic enzymes, presumably pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. These hypotheses need testing with species characterised by contrasting anoxia tolerance.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the direct effects of neighborhood supportive mechanisms (e.g., collective efficacy, social cohesion, social networks) on depressive symptoms among females as well as their moderating effects on the impact of IPV on subsequent depressive symptoms. A multilevel, multivariate Rasch model was used with data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods to assess the existence of IPV and later susceptibility of depressive symptoms among 2959 adult females in 80 neighborhoods. Results indicate that neighborhood collective efficacy, social cohesion, social interactions, and the number of friends and family in the neighborhood reduce the likelihood that females experience depressive symptoms. However, living in areas with high proportions of friends and relatives exacerbates the impact of IPV on females? subsequent depressive symptoms. The findings indicate that neighborhood supportive mechanisms impact interpersonal outcomes in both direct and moderating ways, although direct effects were more pronounced for depression than moderating effects. Future research should continue to examine the positive and potentially mitigating influences of neighborhoods in order to better understand for whom and under which circumstances violent relationships and mental health are influenced by contextual factors.

AB  - During the last two decades the incidence of contact allergy to preservatives in consumer products has increased. It is of crucial importance for the prognosis that sensitised patients avoid contact with the allergens, and they are informed how to take precautions, e.g. by reading the descriptions of contents on consumer products. Discrepancy between ?doctors orders? and patients? actions is often taken as an expressions of patients? lack of knowledge. However, sociologically inspired studies show that differences in social experiences and in social life circumstances non-consciously lead to socially different ways of coping with illness. This study investigates in a sociological perspective, how people handle contact allergy in everyday life and the social genesis of their actions. Interviews were carried out with 8 women selected according to medical and sociological criteria. The study indicates that patients with contact allergy comply with ?doctors orders? in different ways depending on patients? resources, possibilities and social class. The study also indicates, that information given by health staff to a considerable extent is directed to patients from the higher social classes, who possess the ability to read the linguistic difficult names of the preservatives and to a lesser extend to patients from lower social classes, who do not possess this ability.

AB  - Summary Hemophilia is a disorder characterized by decreased amounts of functional, circulating coagulation proteins VIII or IX. It has been well documented that by maintaining factor levels at ≥ 1% the major complications of severe disease, such as spontaneous bleeding, are averted. Successful gene transfer for hemophilia would result in persistent transgene expression at levels ≥ 1%. Hemophilia is an ideal candidate for the application of gene transfer because of the wide therapeutic window for the relevant factors, the availability of animal models, the ability of many tissues other than the liver to produce the coagulation proteins, and the desire for more convenient and cost-efficient treatments. For these reasons, hemophilia has the potential to be one of the first severe genetic disorders to be treated, if not cured, with gene therapy. This paper summarizes the progress and challenges of gene transfer studies for hemophilia.

AB  - A 35-year-old woman presented with a 8-month history of scaling, hyperkeratotic and fissured lesions of the fingertips of the first three fingers of both the hands. She referred the healing of the dermatitis during the summer holidays. She was employed in a small firm where she was used to glue together silver components with glass ones of decorative pieces. For this aim, she applied a glue (Loxeal UV 30?20) cured by exposition to UV light coming from a proper lamp. The material safety data sheet (MSDS) indicated that the glue contained hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA). Patch tests performed with the standard SIDAPA series gave negative results; patch tests carried out with an additional one (acrylic adhesive series) showed positive reactions towards glue components (HEMA,HPMA) and towards other acrylates (possible cross-reacting). An inspection performed in the work-place showed that the patient was in contact with the glue not only when she applied it on the components, but particularly when she handled the bottle cap (splashed with the glue) in its opening and closing. After the changing of her occupation, the patient has not presented relapse of the dermatitis. The UV-cured acrylic resins are known for some time to be a frequent cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in dentists and in printing industry. The case reported shows a different exposition source towards these resins, i.e. from UV-cured acrylate adhesive employed for sticking metal pieces with glass ones.

AB  - Epithelialization and vascularization are key elements involved in the repair of cutaneous wounds. One method of regulation for these pathways is expression of a signaling molecule known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which, in turn, is regulated by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). It has been suggested that chronic wounds, which are most commonly located in ischemic tissue among the elderly, may be the result of a loss of function in the VEGF regulation pathway. Using our rat back flap model, which demonstrates the negative influences of age and ischemia on wound healing, we examined the relative expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in aged and young rats at 3,7, and 10 days post-wounding. Four full-thickness biopsy punches (7?mm) were made on the back of each aged and young rat. The rostral wound pair was made ischemic by raising a transverse flap (1.8?cm wide???8?cm length). The caudal wound pair served as a non-ischemic control. Inserting a sterilized polyethylene sheet under both ischemic and nonischemic wounds prevented wound contraction. RNA was extracted from the tissue at the specified time points, and run on Real-Time PCR to determine relative expression of VEGF and HIF-1. Preliminary data suggest that, at the 3 day time point, there is a significant increase in both HIF-1 and VEGF expression in young rats under ischemic conditions and a significant increase in VEGF expression in aged rats under ischemia with a strong (but not significant) trend towards increase in HIF-1 as well. While the rat model does not produce significant differences between aged and young animals, this upregulation under ischemia indicates that HIF-1 and VEGF expression may play a vital role in the early signaling of ischemic wound repair.

AB  - Hypoglycaemia is a common, life-threatening complication that occurs as a component of a wide variety of disease processes. Despite its frequent occurrence, information concerning the aetiology, characteristics and outcomes of hypoglycaemic crises in veterinary medicine is limited. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia, the body's counter-regulatory response, underlying aetiologies, diagnosis and treatment. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence in veterinary literature regarding prognostic indicators, prevalence, diagnosis and treatment is examined for hypoglycaemia-related disease processes including insulinoma, glucose-lowering toxins and medications.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to clarify the associations between negative emotionality, avoidant coping, and alexithymia. We hypothesized that negative emotionality and avoidance strategies would interact negatively in associating with alexithymia. Design We examined, in one study conducted in Italy and another in the US (total N = 415), the associations among avoidant coping, negative emotionality, and alexithymia, using cross-sectional designs. Method Study 1: Participants completed paper-and-pencil measures of alexithymia, avoidant coping, and negative emotionality. Study 2: Participants completed the above-mentioned measures plus a measure of experiential avoidance (EA), by means of an online questionnaire. Results As expected, an antagonistic avoidant coping ? negative emotionality interaction was found to relate to alexithymia in both studies. In Study 2, EA mediated the effects of such interaction on alexithymia (mediated moderation). The interaction found implied that alexithymia would be adopted as a defence against negative affect or as a consequence of avoidant strategies. Conclusions The studies suggested that two different psychological pathways to alexithymia may be at work: Preference for avoidance and negative emotionality. This result appeared theoretically relevant and may stimulate further research. Practitioner points Alexithymia may develop from habitual avoidance, regardless of negative emotionality. Practitioners could consider addressing negative emotional regulation or automatic and habitual avoidant responses in dealing with alexithymic patients.

AB  - Abstract Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) interact with epithelial stem cells and induce hair folliculogenesis. Cell-based therapies using expanded DPCs for hair regeneration have been unsuccessful in humans. Two major challenges remain: first, expanded DPCs obtained from adult hair follicles have functional limitations; second, a clinically applicable method is needed for transplanting DPCs. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical DPC transplantation procedure for use in clinical settings. Five clinically applicable transplantation procedures were tested, termed the Pinhole, Laser, Slit, Non-vascularized sandwich (NVS) and Hemi-vascularized sandwich (HVS) methods. Labelled rat dermal papilla tissue was transplanted into rat sole skin, and hair follicle regeneration was evaluated histologically. Regenerated follicles and labelled DPCs were detected for all methods, although some follicles showed abnormal growth, i.e. a cystic or inverted appearance. The HVS method, pioneered here, resulted in significantly larger number of regenerated follicles that were more mature and regular than those observed using the other methods. Moreover, hair growth was detected after expanded adult-derived DPC transplantation using the HVS method. These results suggest that direct contact of epithelial and dermal components and better vascularization/oxygenation of the recipient site are critical for hair regeneration in cell-based therapies.
