AB  - Abstract The authors conducted a systematic BRS and English-language literature review of the last 10 years of research on the assessment, prevalence, and antidepressant treatment of major depression in the medically ill to determine the current state of knowledge and to make recommendations for future studies. Ninety-three prevalence studies (13,518 patients and 33 conditions or medical settings) met basic methodological inclusion criteria. The great majority (68.8%) of these studies did not describe their methodological approach to the diagnostic assessment of symptoms such as fatigue, which could be due to either a depression or a comorbidphysical disorder. This problem of overlapping symptomatology has been termed the ?problem of etiological assessment.? The 29 (31.2%) studies which did describe an approach to this problem used one or more of four different approaches: an ?inclusive? approach, an ?exclusive? approach, an ?etiological? approach, or a ?substitutive? approach. Prevalence rates of major depression varied greatly (0-78%). Regarding treatment, of eight controlled studies of antidepressant therapies for major depression, six reported statistically significant differences between medications and placebo. The authors conclude that many recent studies concerning the assessment, prevalence, and treatment of major depression in the medically ill have been inadequate to generate reliable and valid information. Guidelines for future research, especially focusing on the collection of validation data, are proposed. Depression 1:181-204 (1993). ? 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) interact with epithelial stem cells and induce hair folliculogenesis. Cell-based therapies using expanded DPCs for hair regeneration have been unsuccessful in humans. Two major challenges remain: first, expanded DPCs obtained from adult hair follicles have functional limitations; second, a clinically applicable method is needed for transplanting DPCs. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical DPC transplantation procedure for use in clinical settings. Five clinically applicable transplantation procedures were tested, termed the Pinhole, Laser, Slit, Non-vascularized sandwich (NVS) and Hemi-vascularized sandwich (HVS) methods. Labelled rat dermal papilla tissue was transplanted into rat sole skin, and hair follicle regeneration was evaluated histologically. Regenerated follicles and labelled DPCs were detected for all methods, although some follicles showed abnormal growth, i.e. a cystic or inverted appearance. The HVS method, pioneered here, resulted in significantly larger number of regenerated follicles that were more mature and regular than those observed using the other methods. Moreover, hair growth was detected after expanded adult-derived DPC transplantation using the HVS method. These results suggest that direct contact of epithelial and dermal components and better vascularization/oxygenation of the recipient site are critical for hair regeneration in cell-based therapies.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, severity, location, aetiology, treatment and healing of medical device-related pressure ulcers (PUs) in intensive care patients for up to 7 days. A prospective repeated measures study design was used. Patients in six intensive care units of two major medical centres, one each in Australia and the USA, were screened 1 day per month for 6 months. Those with device-related ulcers were followed daily for up to 7 days. The outcome measures were device-related ulcer prevalence, pain, infection, treatment and healing. Fifteen of 483 patients had device-related ulcers and 9 of 15 with 11 ulcers were followed beyond screening. Their mean age was 60·5 years, and most were men, overweight and at increased risk of PU. Endotracheal (ET) and nasogastric (NG) tubes were the cause of most device-related ulcers. Repositioning was the most frequent treatment. Four of 11 ulcers healed within the 7-day observation period. In conclusion, device-related ulcer prevalence was 3·1%, similar to that reported in the limited literature available, indicating an ongoing problem. Systematic assessment and repositioning of devices are the mainstays of care. We recommend continued prevalence determination and that nurses remain vigilant to prevent device-related ulcers, especially in patients with NG and ET tubes.

AB  - Abstract Policy on officer-involved shootings is critically reviewed and errors in applying scientific knowledge identified. Identifying and evaluating the most relevant science to a field-based problem is challenging. Law enforcement administrators with a clear understanding of valid science and application are in a better position to utilize scientific knowledge for the benefit of their organizations and officers. A recommended framework is proposed for considering the validity of science and its application. Valid science emerges via hypothesis testing, replication, extension and marked by peer review, known error rates, and general acceptance in its field of origin. Valid application of behavioral science requires an understanding of the methodology employed, measures used, and participants recruited to determine whether the science is ready for application. Fostering a science?practitioner partnership and an organizational culture that embraces quality, empirically based policy, and practices improves science-to-practice translation.

AB  - Abstract Acellular nerves possess the structural and biochemical features similar to those of naive endoneurial tubes, and have been proved bioactive for allogeneil graft in nerve tissue engineering. However, the source of allogenic donators is restricted in clinical treatment. To explore sufficient substitutes for acellular nerve allografts (ANA), we investigated the effectiveness of acellular nerve xenografts (ANX) combined with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on repairing peripheral nerve injuries. The acellular nerves derived from Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits were prepared, respectively, and BMSCs were implanted into the nerve scaffolds and cultured in vitro. All the grafts were employed to bridge 1 cm rat sciatic nerve gaps. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 per group): ANA group, ANX group, BMSCs-laden ANA group, BMSCs-laden ANX group, and autologous nerve graft group. At 8 weeks post-transplantation, electrophysiological study was performed and the regenerated nerves were assayed morphologically. Besides, growth-promoting factors in the regenerated tissues following the BMSCs integration were detected. The results indicated that compared with the acellular nerve control groups, nerve regeneration and functional rehabilitation for the xenogenic nervetransplantation integrated with BMSCs were advanced significantly, and the rehabilitation efficacy was comparable with that of the autografting. The expression of neurotrophic factors in the regenerated nerves, together with that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord and muscles were elevated largely. In conclusion, ANX implanted with BMSCs could replace allografts to promote nerve regeneration effectively, which offers a reliable approach for repairing peripheral nerve defects.

AB  - Abstract Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested similar neural activations for word reading in native and second languages. However, such similarities were qualitatively determined (i.e., overlapping activation based on traditional univariate activation analysis). In this study, using representational similarity analysis and an artificial language training paradigm, we quantitatively computed cross-language neural pattern similarity to examine the modulatory effect of proficiency in the new language. Twenty-four native Chinese speakers were trained to learn 30 words in a logographic artificial language for 12 days and scanned while performing a semantic decision task after 4-day training and after 12-day training. Results showed that higher proficiency in the new language was associated with higher cross-language pattern similarity in select regions of the reading network.

AB  - A porcine model of second-degree burn wound was used to evaluate the effect of a newly developed topical oxygen emulsion (TOE) on collagen deposition during wound repair. A total of 6 pigs were used for the study. The burn wounds were treated with air exposure (no treatment), vehicle control or TOE, which contains super-saturated oxygen and releases oxygen in sustained high level when applied topically. Skin wound samples were collected at days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 after wounding. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) were used to examine the mRNA expressions for type I and type III collagens and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1). RT-PCR products were run on ethidium bromide gel and analyzed under UV light with Bio-Rad Gel Document 2000 system. The expression intensity was recorded as the mean gray value. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The results showed: 1). Higher mRNA expressions of collagen III and MMP-1 were observed in TOE treatment group compared with air exposure and vehicle control groups. 2). MMP-1 expression increased shortly after wounding with peak at days 4 and 7. 3). Collagen III expression increased earlier with peak at day 10 and day 14. 4). Collagen I expression level increased later than that of collagen III. Significant increase was seen after day 10 with the highest at day 21. However, there was no significant difference between vehicle control and TOE treatment groups. The data suggests that sustained high level of oxygen release by TOE may promote wound repair through the mechanism of increased expressions of type I and type III collagens. The TOE also increased the expression of MMP-1, which might accelerate clearing damaged collagens in the earlier phase of wound healing and promote collagen remodeling in the later phase. This study was supported by grants from DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.
