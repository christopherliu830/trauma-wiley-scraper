AB  - Abstract Transient postoperative urinary retention after stress incontinence surgery is common, and there is no widely accepted method of hastening the return to normal voiding. The etiology of this retention is poorly understood. Failure of the relaxation of the striated external urethral sphincter has been proposed as an etiologic agent, but has not been documented. Ten patients about to undergo a Burch colposuspension or sub-urethral sling, who demonstrated normal preoperative voiding, were recruited to a study of postoperative retention. Hook-wire electromyographic (EMG)probes were placed into the external urethral sphincter while the patients were under anesthesia, and a suprapubic catheter was placed. We performed instrumented voiding trials 1 or 2 days after surgery while continuously recording urethral EMG and intravesical pressure. Two patients demonstrated normal voiding. Two patients were able to void but demonstrated no EMG silencing. Six patients were unable to void and demonstrated persistent EMG activity. Four of these demonstrated no detrusor contraction, whereas two demonstrated detrusor contractions. All patients resumed normal voiding by clinical parameters within 14 days of surgery. Our study supports other research that suggests that failure of relaxation of the striated urethral sphincter contributes to postoperative urinary retention. Neurourol.

AB  - Objectives Childhood psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) increase risk for concurrent and future psychiatric disorders but are common in the population. Strategies are needed to identify vulnerable individuals who may benefit from monitoring or targeted intervention. This study aimed to delineate profiles of childhood PLEs that might be differentially associated with other psychopathologies, and multiple psychopathology. Design Cross-sectional, online self-report survey. Methods Participants were 27,000 Australian children from a population cohort (13,416 girls; mean age 11.91 years) who completed an online self-report questionnaire assessing PLEs (hallucinations and delusions) and Emotional, Peer Relationship, Conduct, and Hyperactivity?Inattention psychopathology. Latent class analysis differentiated classes of children showing different patterns of PLE responses, and multinomial logistic regression determined the association between the PLE classes and the various psychopathologies, adjusted for demographic covariates and the other psychopathologies. Results Five latent profiles of PLE responses were characterized as follows: None (27.4% of children), Minor (29.7%), Moderate (11.8%), Hallucinatory (21.0%), and Strong (10.2%). These classes showed distinct associations with other psychopathologies (odds ratios between 1.27 and 4.58), and dose?response relationships indicated increasing likelihood of multiple psychopathology for the Hallucinatory and Strong classes (odds ratio = 21.87 for ≥3 psychopathologies in the Strong class). Conclusions Tailored interventions that address the particular needs of these different classes of individuals may be warranted. Practitioner points Children aged 11?12 years who report psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) can be classified into five different PLE profiles based on self-reported questionnaire responses, which may reflect different pathological processes. These PLE profiles show different patterns and magnitudes of increased risk for other types of psychopathology, and multiple psychopathology, suggesting that they present different treatment needs. Cross-sectional investigation of the associations between PLE profiles and other psychopathologies limits any conclusions as to the causal direction of these relationships. Multi-informant reports of psychopathology were unavailable.

AB  - In Australia and in countries around the world, histories of oppression and armed conflict have shattered social trust, inflicted profound physical and psychological damage, and created deeply divided societies. to break cycles of violence and build peace, it is vital to work on reconciliation, a multi-disciplinary task that has important psychological dimensions. This paper develops a tripartite framework for conceptualising reconciliation as a process of systems change that involves coming to terms with the past, building peace and nonviolent conflict resolution, and establishing social justice. Work on reconciliation needs to be multicultural, since reconciliation may have different meanings and may involve different processes in different cultural contexts. to impose western views and methods may inflict damage and continue the history of oppression. By working in partnership with local communities, psychologists may help to create culturally relevant approaches that integrate local resources with western views and tools. Using examples from an international symposium conducted at the University of Melbourne, the paper examines how psychological organisations may contribute to multicultural approaches to reconciliation. Citing examples from various sub-areas of psychology, it identifies specific, psychologically relevant tasks on which psychologists may contribute to reconciliation through research, education, training, and practice.

AB  - Teaching internal structures obscured from direct view is a major challenge of anatomy education. High-fidelity interactive three-dimensional (3D) micro-computed tomography (CT) models with virtual dissection present a possible solution. However, their utility for teaching complex internal structures of the human body is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of a realistic 3D micro-CT interactive visualization computer model to teach paranasal sinus anatomy in a laboratory setting during pre-clinical medical training. Year 1 (n = 79) and Year 2 (n = 59) medical students undertook self-directed activities focused on paranasal sinus anatomy in one of two laboratories (traditional laboratory and 3D model). All participants completed pre and posttests before and after the laboratory session. Results of regression analyses predicting post-laboratory knowledge indicate that, when students were inexperienced with the 3D computer technology, use of the model was detrimental to learning for students with greater prior knowledge of the relevant anatomy (P < 0.05). For participants experienced with the 3D computer technology, however, the use of the model was detrimental for students with less prior knowledge of the relevant anatomy (P < 0.001). These results emphasize that several factors need to be considered in the design and effective implementation of such models in the classroom. Under the right conditions, the 3D model is equal to traditional laboratory resources when used as a learning tool. This paper discusses the importance of preparatory training for students and the technical consideration necessary to successfully integrate such models into medical anatomical curricula.

AB  - Objective:? In this study, we initiated a new hemodialysate with citrate buffer, observed the factors that influence the citrate concentration of solution in hollow fibers when using citrate hemodialysate, and observed the anticoagulant effect and safety of the citrate hemodialysate in the experiment in dogs. Methods:?Ten dogs were given intermittent hemodialysis and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures. Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate; Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysis without any anticoagulant; Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and heparin. ACT, Ca++, BUN, Cr, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, Na+, Cl?, , and venous pressure were monitored in the animals of each group during hemodialysis. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous pressure increased lastingly, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 2 hours. Hemodialysis for 2 hours in Group 2 were all finished successfully. ACT was extended and Ca++ decreased obviously in the venous end during hemodialysis. And ALT, AST, Ca++, K+, Na+, Cl?, after the hemodialysis in Group 2 were not changed (P?>?0.05). Moreover, the clearance rate of the dialyzers with citrate dialysate increased significantly compared with those of saline-flush and heparin anticoagulation. Conclusions:?The anticoagulant and dialytic effects of the new type citrate hemodialysis are satisfactory and better than that of saline-flush.

AB  - Distinguishing among the various melanocytic proliferations remains one of the biggest challenges in dermatopathology. New insights into tumor proliferation may lead to the discovery of helpful immunohistochemical markers. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase which is a core component of the PI3K signalling pathway. Activation of Akt is seen in many human cancers. This study evaluated Akt activation (phospho-Akt) by immunohistochemistry on 18 intradermal nevi, 8 dysplastic nevi, 9 Spitz nevi, and 27 melanomas. Immunostaining was graded 0 (no staining), 1 (slightly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (highly positive). The mean immunostaining scores were as follows: intradermal nevi 1.16, dysplastic nevi 1.25, Spitz nevi 2.11, and melanomas 2.15. Spitz nevi exhibited significant pAkt immunoreactivity. Increased pAkt immunoreactivity is seen in melanomas and Spitz nevi as compared to benign intradermal nevi and dysplastic nevi.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Desmopathies of the suspensory ligament are relatively frequent and vary in prevalence over different anatomical regions. This variation may be because of regional differences in tissue characteristics. Objective: To characterise different regions of healthy forelimb suspensory ligaments (SLs) by means of biochemical, biomechanical and histomorphological techniques. Hypothesis: There is substantial topographical heterogeneity in the SL with respect to structural, compositional and functional characteristics. Methods: SLs were harvested from 38 limbs and used for biochemical (n = 20), biomechanical (n = 14) and histomorphological (n = 4) evaluation. Sulphated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG), DNA and collagen content, degree of lysyl hydroxylation and numbers of enzymatic and nonenzymatic cross-links were determined in 7 regions of the SL: lateral and medial part of the origin (OM, OL), mid-body (MB), axial and abaxial parts of the lateral and medial branches (ILAX, ILAB, IMAX and IMAB, respectively). Passive resistance to tensile loading was measured in 5 regions of the SL (all except OL and OM). Results: DNA content was lower in OL and OM than in all other parts. GAG content was also lower in OL and OM and highest in ILAB and IMAB. Collagen content was lower in OL/OM and highest in ILAX/IMAX. Pentosidine levels were highest in OL and significantly lower in the lateral insertion (ILAX/ILAB). There were no differences in hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) cross-links or lysyl hydroxylation. Stiffness (P<0.01) and modulus of elasticity (P<0.01) were substantially higher in the MB region than in all other regions except for IMAB. Strain at failure was lower in the MB region (P<0.0001), resulting in a comparable force at rupture as in the other regions. Conclusions: Matrix composition differs to a relatively limited extent between different regions of the SL. The mid-body of the ligament is stiffer than the branches, which have similar properties and relevance and mechanical differences between mid-body and branches/origin may explain some use-related differences in the prevalence of lesions.

AB  - Occult HCV infection in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis (anti-HCV, serum HCV RNA negative) and no renal diseases, has been reported (1). In this work we studied the existence of occult HCV infection in PBMC of HD patients. Inclusion criteria: high ALT (>28?IU/l) and/or gamma-GPT levels, negative serological HCV and HBV markers (anti-HCV, serum HCV-RNA and HBsAg negative), and exclusion of other causes of liver damage. Four Spanish HD units participated in the study and 40 patients were enrolled; 40 (25 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. HCV-RNA in PBMC was tested by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. Occult HCV infection was found in 24/40 (60%) patients by RT-PCR and all cases were confirmed by in situ hybridization. No differences were found regarding gender, etiology of renal disease, or fluctuant or persistent abnormal liver enzymes values. Among patients with occult HCV infection, 4/24 (16.7%) had only increased ALT levels; 7/24 (29.2.%) GGTP values; and both enzymes were elevated in 13/24 (54.2%). In our population, 60% HD patients with persistent or fluctuant ALT and/or GGTP values of unknown etiology and negative for serological viral markers (including serum HCV-RNA) have an occult HCV infection in PBMC and these patients could be potentially infectious.

AB  - Summary Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequent cause of severe skin infections. The ability to control the infection is largely dependent on the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (PMN). To gain more insight into the dynamics of PMN migration and host?pathogen interactions in vivo, we used intravital two-photon (2-P) microscopy to visualize S.?aureus skin infections in the mouse. Reporter S.?aureus strains expressing fluorescent proteins were developed, which allowed for detection of the bacteria in vivo. By employing LysM-EGFP mice to visualize PMN, we observed the rapid appearance of PMN in the extravascular space of the dermis and their directed movement towards the focus of infection, which led to the delineation of an abscess within 1 day. Moreover, tracking of transferred labelled bone-marrow neutrophils showed that PMN localization to the site of infection is dependent on the presence of G-protein-coupled receptors on the PMN, whereas Interleukin-1 receptor was required on host cells other than PMN. Furthermore, the S.?aureus complement inhibitor Ecb could block PMN accumulation at thesite of infection. Our results establish that 2-P microscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the orchestration of the immune cells, S.?aureus location and gene expression in vivo on a single cell level.

AB  - Key points A computational model of P2X channel activation in microglia was developed that includes downfield Ca2+-dependent signalling pathways. This model provides quantitative insights into how diverse signalling pathways in microglia converge to control microglial function. Abstract Microglia function is orchestrated through highly coupled signalling pathways that depend on calcium (Ca2+). In response to extracellular ATP, transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ driven through the activation of purinergic receptors, P2X and P2Y, are sufficient to promote cytokine synthesis. Although the steps comprising the pathways bridging purinergic receptor activation with transcriptional responses have been probed in great detail, a quantitative model for how these steps collectively control cytokine production has not been established. Here we developed a minimal computational model that quantitatively links extracellular stimulation of two prominent ionotropic purinergic receptors, P2X4 and P2X7, with the graded production of a gene product, namely the tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) cytokine. In addition to Ca2+ handling mechanisms common to eukaryotic cells, our model includes microglia-specific processes including ATP-dependent P2X4 and P2X7 activation, activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors, and TNFα production. Parameters for this model were optimized to reproduce published data for these processes, where available. With this model, we determined the propensity for TNFα production in microglia, subject to a wide range of ATP exposure amplitudes, frequencies and durations that the cells could encounter in vivo. Furthermore, we have investigated the extent to which modulation of the signal transduction pathways influence TNFα production. Our results suggest that pulsatile stimulation of P2X4 via micromolar ATP may be sufficient to promote TNFα production, whereas high-amplitude ATP exposure is necessary for production via P2X7. Furthermore, under conditions that increase P2X4 expression, for instance, following activation by pathogen-associated molecular factors, P2X4-associated TNFα production is greatly enhanced. Given that Ca2+ homeostasis in microglia is profoundly important to its function, this computational model provides a quantitative framework to explore hypotheses pertaining to microglial physiology.
