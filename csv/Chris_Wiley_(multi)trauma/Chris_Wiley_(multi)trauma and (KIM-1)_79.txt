AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Abstract Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (IHR) offers the potential for excellent cosmetic outcomes and maximization of the inherent advantages of minimally invasive surgery. LESS IHR is associated with a steep learning curve, which is attributable to both the IHR technique itself and the single-site technique. The technical obstacles in the single-site technique may be mitigated by employing certain maneuvers and strategies that minimize clashing between instruments and improve freedom of movement. The current literature consistently points out the inherent challenges in LESS IHR, with its longer operative time compared to that of conventional laparoscopic IHR. LESS IHR performed by capable operators has comparable complication rates, duration of hospital stay, and incidence of recurrence as conventional laparoscopic IHR. LESS IHR is both feasible and safe. Given its excellent cosmetic outcome, it is likely to be sought by younger patients who are concerned with scar formation. The use of robotics may bypass the technical challenges in LESS, but cost considerations in their usage will likely persist.

AB  - Abstract Background:? We performed a meta-analysis in an attempt to answer whether short-term outcomes and lymph nodes harvested after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) are comparable to those reported after conventional open gastrectomy (COG). Methods:? Prospective randomized clinical trials were eligible if they included patients with distal gastric cancer treated by LAG versus COG. End points were operating time, intra-operative blood loss, size of wound, overall post-operative complications, time to first flatus, time to start oral intake, hospital stay and lymph nodes harvested. Results:? Six trials including 668 patients were included. For four of the 13 end points, the summary point estimates favoured LAG over COG; there was a significant reduction in intra-operative blood loss (weighted mean difference (WMD) ?115.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?159.16 to ?72.04, P < 0.00001), size of wound (WMD ?5.27, 95% CI ?8.94 to ?1.60, P= 0.005), overall post-operative complications (odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.85, P= 0.008) and hospital stay (WMD ?2.65, 95% CI ?4.97 to ?0.32, P= 0.03) for LAG. However, the combined results of the individual trials show significant longer operating time (WMD 112.98, 95% CI 60.32 to 165.64, P < 0.0001) and significant reduction in lymph nodes harvested (WMD ?4.79, 95% CI ?6.79 to ?2.79, P < 0.00001) in the LAG group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in time to first flatus, time to start oral intake, wound infection, intra-abdominal fluid collection and abscess, anastomotic stenosis and leakage and pulmonary complications. Conclusion:? The results of this meta-analysis suggest that LAG for early distal cancer is a feasible and safe alternative to COG, with better short-term outcomes.

Abstract Aim: To compare histopathological characteristics of peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions. Methods: A search was conducted on publications up to July 2010. Studies carried out on human biopsy material and animal experiments were considered. Results: While comprehensive information exists regarding histopathological characteristics of human periodontitis lesions, few studies evaluated peri-implantitis lesions in human biopsy material. Experimental peri-implantitis lesions were evaluated in 10 studies and three of the studies included comparisons to experimental periodontitis. Human biopsy material: the apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate (ICT) was more pronounced in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis and was in most cases located apical of the pocket epithelium. Plasma cells and lymphocytes dominated among cells in both types of lesions, whereas neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages occurred in larger proportions in peri-implantitis. Experimental studies: placement of ligatures together with plaque formation resulted in loss of supporting tissues and large ICTs around implants and teeth. Following ligature removal, a ?self-limiting? process occurred in the tissues around teeth with a connective tissue capsule that separated the ICT from bone, while in peri-implant tissues the ICT extended to the bone crest. Conclusion: Despite similarities regarding clinical features and aetiology of peri-implantitis and periodontitis, critical histopathological differences exist between the two lesions.

AB  - This patient was a 61-year-old white female who received several years of penicillamine therapy for the treatment of cystinuria. She subsequently developed penicillamine induced cutis laxa, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum like skin lesions. In addition, she suffered from numerous chronic bilateral lower extremity skin ulcerations. Her past medical history was also significant for end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis and pulmonary fibrosis. She presented to the University of Miami Wound Care Center in 1/04 for treatment of her chronic ulcerations. On physical examination, the patient had multiple large hyperpigmented plaques with central ulcerations on her lower extremities. Some of the ulcers had overlying crust and others were covered with yellow fibrinous tissue. She also had generalized thickened, lax skin with multiple folds. On her neck, thighs, back and arms were violaceous, atrophic, serpiginous plaques with peripheral crusted erosions. A biopsy taken from the patients left thigh revealed dermal elastosis and the features of pseudo-pseudoxanthoma. Two additional biopsies taken from the left thigh demonstrated elastosis perforans serpiginosa. This case highlights multiple skin manifestations of penicillamine therapy.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Pain which persists after thoracotomy is well recognized, and activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor could be a contributing factor. This study sought to establish whether ketamine given peri-operatively could reduce persistent post-surgical pain. Trial design Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing low-dose intravenous ketamine and saline placebo. Methods Seventy patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.1 mg kg?1 hr?1) or saline placebo for 96 hr, starting 10 min prior to surgery. A bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ketamine/placebo was given prior to starting the infusion. Post-operative analgesia consisted of either an epidural infusion or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), +/? a paravertebral infusion of local anaesthetic. Pain scores and opioid consumption were collected at 24 and 48 hr after surgery. Patients completed numeric pain scores (NPS), modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the short form Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-Lanss) at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results There were no significant differences in post-operative pain, except the ketamine group reported less pain at rest 48 hr after surgery (p = 0.03). The ketamine group requested significantly less morphine via PCA in the first 24 hr (p = 0.03). There were no differences in pain measures or opioid consumption at 6 weeks, 3, 6 or 12 months. Patients in the ketamine group were more lightheaded (p = 0.02) and experienced more vivid dreams (p = 0.001). Conclusions Ketamine reduced opioid consumption compared to placebo after surgery, but we were unable to detect any differences in persistent post-surgical pain between the groups. Significance This study adds to the growing body of evidence advocating the use of ketamine to reduce opioid consumption. No previous studies of peri-operative ketamine have followed patients for a year after thoracotomy. This study found no reduction in persistent post-surgical pain.

AB  - Dimorphic fungal infections (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis) can occur in immunocompromised and healthy individuals. Cutaneous involvement is often secondary and may be the presenting sign of systemic disease. These ominous infections are frequently clinically indistinct and their prognosis is influenced by their timely diagnosis and treatment. Morphological differentiation between these organisms is not definitive and tissue cultures represent the diagnostic gold standard in current day practice. However, not uncommonly tissue cultures are not obtained and merely represent an afterthought in seemingly unsuspecting cases. Furthermore, when performed, they may take several days to weeks for completion. In situ hybridization (ISH) utilizing oligonucleotide probes directed against fungal ribosomal RNA represents a rapid and accurate assay for the diagnosis of dimorphic fungi in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We present 7 patients in whom ISH both prospecitively and retrospectively confirmed the presence of a cutaneous infection (2 histoplasmosis, 2 blastomycosis, 1 coccidiomycosis, 2 cryptococcosis). In all of the skin sections analyzed, dimorphic fungi were morphologically apparent but not diagnostically discernable. In summary, ISH represents a valuable tool in the prompt diagnosis of cutaneous deep fungal infections.

AB  - Abstract Objective To systematically review outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mind?body treatments for PTSD. Methods Inclusion criteria based on guidelines for assessing risk of bias were used to evaluate articles identified through electronic literature searches. Results Twenty-two RCTs met inclusion standards. In most of the nine mindfulness and six yoga studies, significant between-group effects were found indicating moderate to large effect size advantages for these treatments. In all seven relaxation RCT's, relaxation was used as a control condition and five studies reported significant between-group differences on relevant PTSD outcomes in favor of the target treatments. However, there were large within-group symptom improvements in the relaxation condition for the majority of studies. Conclusions Although many studies are limited by methodologic weaknesses, recent studies have increased rigor and, in aggregate, the results for mindfulness, yoga, and relaxation are promising. Recommendations for design of future mind?body trials are offered.

AB  - Abstract Blood vessel injury results in limited oxygen tension and diffusion leading to hypoxia, increased anaerobic metabolism, and elevated production of acidic metabolites that cannot be easily removed due to the reduced blood flow. Therefore, an acidic extracellular pH occurs in the local microenvironment of disrupted bone. The potential role of acidic pH and glu-leu-arg (ELR+) CXC chemokines in early events in bone repair was studied in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) treated with medium of decreasing pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.7, and 6.4). The cells showed a reciprocal increase in CXCL8 (interleukin-8, IL-8) mRNA levels as extracellular pH decreased. At pH 6.4, CXCL8 mRNA was induced >60? in comparison to levels at pH 7.4. hMSCs treated with osteogenic medium (OGM) also showed an increase in CXCL8 mRNA with decreasing pH; although, at a lower level than that seen in cells grown in non-OGM. CXCL8 protein was secreted into the medium at all pHs with maximal induction at pH 6.7. Inhibition of the G-protein-coupled receptor alpha, Gαi, suppressed CXCL8 levels in response to acidic pH; whereas phospholipase C inhibition had no effect on CXCL8. The use of specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction inhibitors indicated that the pH-dependent increase in CXCL8 mRNA is due to activation of ERK and p38 pathways. The JNK pathway was not involved. NF-?B inhibition resulted in a decrease in CXCL8 levels in hMSCs grown in non-OGM. However, OGM-differentiated hMSCs showed an increase in CXCL8 levels when treated with the NF-?B inhibitor PDTC, a pyrrolidine derivative of dithiocarbamate. J. Cell.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to survival of patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Data were collected from 8 dialysis centers, and 432 patients were recruited. Among them, patients who underwent hemodialysis thrice a week for more than 3 years and received antihypertensive therapy or had systolic blood pressure of more than 160?mm Hg before dialysis secession were selected. Subsequent survival status and cause of death were ascertained for the next 3.5 years. The logistic multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of death. Variables used for the purpose of this analysis were patient gender, age, underlying renal disease (unknown and others (0), CGN (1), DM (2)), medication, serum albumin, history of having cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular accidents (yes or no), the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hemoglobin, serum calcium and inorganic phosphate, ?2-microglobulin, intact PTH, and other laboratory data. Results:?First step logistic regression analysis indicated age, underlying renal diseases, serum creatinine, GOT, ?2-microglobulin were associated with increased relative risk (RR) of dying. According to the formula calculated in this analysis, if the levels of serum creatinine increased 1?mg/dl, the ratio of dying increased by 1.210. Also, compared to the patients aged between 50 to 64 years old, the patients aged between 65 to 90 years old had 1.521 times dying ratio. Conclusions:?From this study, it is suggested that age, creatinine, underlying renal diseases, ?2-microblobulin, past history of cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and GOT were important factors contributing to patients? survival.
