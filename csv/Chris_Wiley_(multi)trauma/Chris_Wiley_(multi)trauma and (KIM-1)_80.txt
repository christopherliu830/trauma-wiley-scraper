AB  - Summary Considered through the lens of social neuroscience, social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be conceptualized as an aberration of social behavior, and by proxy, the social brain. Because of the fundamentally social structure of the human ecological niche, a disorder of the social brain is likely to impinge upon numerous areas of human behavior. In the first part of this chapter, we review key functional neuroimaging and behavioral research findings on social brain function in SAD. The second section of this essay reviews recent social anxiety research that has explored additional dimensions of social function, as well as recommends research directions that remain unvisited in SAD thus far. We emphasize the importance of multi-dimensional and integrative approaches to gaining a holistic understanding of this complex and intriguing disorder.

AB  - Purpose This review aims to identify how the term ?resilience? is conceptualized across adult mental health research due to ongoing criticism regarding the lack of consistency in its conceptualization. Method A systematic search, including hand searches of book chapters, was conducted using search terms (?resilien*?) AND (?mental illness? OR ?mental health problem?). Papers were excluded if they did not meet the following criteria: written in English, provide a clear conceptualization of resilience, include only adults (aged 18 + ) in the sample, solely focus on individuals with a primary diagnosis of mental illness, and peer-reviewed. Data were extracted on conceptualizations of resilience, demographic, and diagnostic variables of the study population, publication year, and the research design used. Conceptualizations were combined and collapsed into overarching themes and then refined through joint discussion, consultation with a third reviewer, and input from a larger multidisciplinary team. Results Thirty-one texts (6 book chapters, 4 reviews, 2 appraisals/critical evaluations, 1 editorial, and 18 research projects) were included. Two broad understandings of resilience were identified: resilience as a process and resilience as a characteristic of an individual. Processes comprise three themes: ?immunity?, ?bouncing back?, and ?growth?, whilst characteristics are captured in two themes ?personal resources? and ?social resources?. Conclusions These findings suggest that resilience can be conceptualized in a clear and meaningful manner in adult mental health research. The five themes reflect distinct ways of using the term resilience. Whilst each one of them may have merit in future research, it appears beneficial to make clear in research which exact conceptualization of resilience has been adopted. Practitioner Points When considering and reading about ?resilience?, one should be aware that there are different concepts of it. The main difference is between resilience as a personal characteristic and resilience as a process. Therapy may address resilience as a personal characteristic by utilizing individual and social resources. The therapeutic process may be understood as resilience in form of bouncing back and personal growth.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple café au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To describe a hybrid supracricoid partial laryngectomy with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (hybrid SCPL-CHEP) combining limited transcervical and transoral robotic approaches. Study Design Preclinical cadaveric study. Methods Using six human cadavers in a series of three preclinical laboratories (July 2016?February 2018), we developed a novel hybrid technique for SCPL-CHEP. A flexible single-port robotic surgical system was utilized for the transoral aspects of the procedure. Results Detailed procedural steps are defined: 1) transoral: mucosal incisions under direct visualization of the laryngopharynx (tumor resection); 2) transcervical: incision and mobilization of the larynx and pexis; and 3) transoral: mucosal closure. Hybrid SCPL-CHEP was technically feasible and allowed for complete transoral mucosal reconstruction. We discuss potential clinical significance of adding this TORS approach to conventional open SCPL-CHEP. Conclusions This hybrid technique for SCPL-CHEP provides two main advantages over the standard technique: direct visualization during tumor resection prior to laryngotomy and full closure of the laryngopharynx defect. These technical refinements might facilitate postoperative recovery and in turn make this larynx preservation procedure more accessible to patients and surgeons. A clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of hybrid SCPL-CHEP appears warranted to validate these observations. Level of Evidence NA Laryngoscope, 129:2065?2070, 2019

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin is a rare tumor with a microscopic resemblance to lymphoepitheliomatous carcinoma of the nasopharynx. We present a 93-year-old man with papules on the left auricle to the cheek that were gradually enlarged. By the time of a biopsy, it grew to a 5.0???3.0???2.8?cm dark red mass, and necrotic debris was attached to the surface. Histologically, a relatively well-demarcated, dermal-hypodermic multiple lobules were composed of irregular islands of atypical epithelial cells. The uniform tumor cells had moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with one or two prominent nucleoli. A dense lymphocytic infiltrate was present within the neoplastic islands, obscuring the epithelial component. The neoplastic cells were unconnected to the overlying epidermis. Neither squamous nor glandular differentiation was present. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin, and negative for latent membrane protein 1. No Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) was detected by in situ hybridization. The negativity for Epstein-Barr virus may be a help in the differential diagnosis from metastatic undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is uniformly positive for EBER.

AB  - Aims and objectives The aim of this review was to examine parent education programmes for families with children with special health care needs, to better design interventions focusing on the psychosocial aspects of living with a child's chronic condition. Background Studies of familial coping with children with special health care needs indicate high levels of parenting stress, with families with children with special health care needs at risk of major psychological and social disturbances and financial strain. Despite increased knowledge of the factors affecting children with special health care needs themselves, evidence for the effectiveness of preventative and treatment interventions in the form of parent education programmes remains limited. Design Systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Method Multi database Boolean searches in EBSCO Discovery Services using the search terms ?complex/special health care needs children?, ?child/pediatric/congenital heart disease?, ?chronic illness (including diabetes, cancer and cystic fibrosis)?, ?family coping?, ?siblings? AND ?parenting/family support programs? were conducted. Results Analysis of 13 included studies showed evidence for the effectiveness of both mixed-health condition and condition-specific parenting programmes delivered in a variety of modes. Three common core intervention approaches were: use of narrative therapy enabling families to tell their own stories, thus facilitating emotional processing and (co-) construction of meaning; a focus on strengthening protective factors such as enhancing parents? skills in communication, and behavioural management and provision of psycho-education to deepen parents? understanding of their child's condition and associated developmental challenges. Conclusion Irrespective of the type of outcome measures used in the studies, the review showed that there were positive gains and improvements across a range of areas of family functioning such as mental health, parenting, communication and problem-solving skills postprogramme. Relevance to clinical practice Identification of what programme characteristics enhance functioning for families with children with special health care needs should encourage the design of effective interventions.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims Guidelines recommend anxiolytics and hypnotics (A/H) as second-line, short-term medications. We aimed to establish prevalence and associations of A/H prescribing by Australian general practice (GP) trainees. Design and Methods A cross-sectional analysis from a cohort study of vocational trainees from four GP Regional Training Providers during 2010?2013. General practice trainees act as independent practitioners (including for prescribing purposes) while having recourse to advice from a GP supervisor. Practice and trainee demographic data were collected as well as patient, clinical and educational data from 60 consecutive consultations of each trainee each training term. Analysis was at the level of individual problem managed, with the outcome factor being prescription of any anxiolytic or hypnotic. Results Overall, 645 registrars (response rate 94.0%) prescribed 68?582 medications in 69?621 consultations (with 112?890 problems managed). A/Hs were prescribed for 1.3% of problems managed and comprised 2.2% of all prescriptions. They were prescribed particularly for insomnia (28.2%) or anxiety (21.8%), but also for many ?off-label? indications. Significant associations of A/H prescriptions were: patient-level (greater age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, English-speaking background, being new to the trainee but not to the practice); trainee-level (male) and consultation-level (longer duration, pre-existing problem, specialist referral not being made). Prescribing was significantly lower in one of the four Regional Training Providers. Discussion and Conclusions GP trainees, inconsistent with most guideline recommendations, prescribe A/Hs mainly as maintenance therapy to unfamiliar and older patients. Our results suggest that changes in management approaches are needed which may be facilitated by support for psychotherapeutic training.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.

AB  - In this article, I investigate how the moral politics of HIV/AIDS activism in South Africa is contributing toward new forms of citizenship that are concerned with both rights-based struggles and with creating collectively shared meanings of the extreme experiences of illness and stigmatization of individual HIV/AIDS sufferers. I argue that it is precisely the extremity of the ?near death? experiences of full-blown AIDS, and the profound stigma and ?social death? associated with the later stages of the disease, that produce the conditions for HIV/AIDS survivors' commitment to ?new life? and social activism. It is the activist mediation and retelling of these traumatic experiences that facilitates HIV/AIDS activist commitment and grassroots mobilization. It is also the profound negativity of stigma and social death that animates the activist's construction of a new positive HIV-positive identity and understanding of what it means to be a citizen?activist and member of a social movement.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information exists on the use of any intravenous iron preparation in pediatric HD patients. This study was designed to describe the PK parameters of FG, now approved for use in children on HD. Methods:Iron-deficient pediatric HD pts (≤15?yr) were randomized to 2 doses of FG. Blood samples taken during a 1?hr infusion and at intervals over 48?hrs were analyzed for total iron, transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and FG-bound iron (FGI). Results:49% of pts were male, 88% white, 57% age 6?12?yr, wt 16.3?63.2?Kg, ht 100?177.5?cm. Mean serum iron concentrations (total iron and FGI) rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner, approximately proportional to the FG dose administered. A rapid rise in total serum iron was followed by a slower, less prominent rise in TBI. Single-dose PK of FGI was adequately described using non-compartmental analytical methods. A standard 2-compartment NONMEM model successfully fit the data and accurately described the time-course of FGI concentrations. Pharmacokinetic Parameter 1.5?mg/kg FG (n?=?22) 3.0?mg/kg FG (n?=?26) Cmax(mean?±?SD,?mcg/dL) 1287?±?285 ???2283?±?637 AUC0?48(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9327?±?4038 16,830?±?6526 AUC0?∞(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9499?±?4089 17,087?±?6776 Tmax(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???1.1?±?0.23 ???1.1?±?0.19 t1/2(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???2.0?±?0.7 ???2.5?±?1.8 Kel(mean?±?SD,?hr?1) ??0.43?±?0.30 ??0.39?±?0.27 Cl (mean?±?SD,?L/hr) ??0.69?±?0.50 ??0.66?±?0.52 Vd(mean?±?SD,?L) ???1.6?±?0.6 ???1.9?±?1.1 Conclusions: Cmax values in pediatric HD population were similar to Cmax values previously reported with similar FG doses in healthy iron-deficient adults (Ferrlecit? prescribing information). In contrast, mean AUC0?∞ values were approximately 2 times greater, and mean Cl rates were 5.4 times slower in pediatric pts.

AB  - ABSTRACT The synaptic signaling mechanisms mediating the behavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) remain poorly understood. Post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95, SAP-90, Dlg4) is a key orchestrator of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and glutamatergic synapses, which are known to be major sites of EtOH's behavioral actions. However, the potential contribution of PSD-95 to EtOH-related behaviors has not been established. Here, we evaluated knockout (KO) mice lacking PSD-95 for multiple measures of sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of EtOH (ataxia, hypothermia, sedation/hypnosis), EtOH drinking under conditions of free access and following deprivation, acquisition and long-term retention of EtOH conditioned place preference (CPP) (and lithium chloride-induced conditioned taste aversion), and intoxication-potentiating responses to NMDAR antagonism. PSD-95 KO exhibited increased sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic, but not ataxic or hypothermic, effects of acute EtOH relative to wild-type controls (WT). PSD-95 KO consumed less EtOH than WT, particularly at higher EtOH concentrations, although increases in KO drinking could be induced by concentration-fading and deprivation. PSD-95 KO showed normal EtOH CPP 1 day after conditioning, but showed significant aversion 2 weeks later. Lithium chloride-induced taste aversion was impaired in PSD-95 KO at both time points. Finally, the EtOH-potentiating effects of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 were intact in PSD-95 KO at the dose tested. These data reveal a major, novel role for PSD-95 in mediating EtOH behaviors, and add to growing evidence that PSD-95 is a key mediator of the effects of multiple abused drugs.

AB  - An 8-year-old male presented with several 1?4?cm, indurated, brownish-red nodules with superficial, punctate hemorrhagic crusts localized to the groin, which developed over several weeks. An initial biopsy was consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A work up, including a chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Treatment with a chemotherapeutic protocol resulted in shrinkage of both the mediastinal and cutaneous lesions. Late in the course of treatment the cutaneous lesions rapidly recurred and spread to various sites. A second skin biopsy showed an extensive diffuse infiltrate of histiocytic-appearing cells extending from the papillary dermis into the superficial subcutis. The cells had markedly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures were present. The neoplastic cells were S-100 protein and CD1a positive by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was Langerhans cell sarcoma. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor gamma gene in specimens from both the mediastinal mass and one of the recurrent cutaneous lesions. The sizes of the PCR products were identical demonstrating a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms.
