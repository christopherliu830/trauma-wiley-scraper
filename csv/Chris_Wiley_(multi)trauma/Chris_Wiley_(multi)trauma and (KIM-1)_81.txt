AB  - An 8-year-old male presented with several 1?4?cm, indurated, brownish-red nodules with superficial, punctate hemorrhagic crusts localized to the groin, which developed over several weeks. An initial biopsy was consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A work up, including a chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Treatment with a chemotherapeutic protocol resulted in shrinkage of both the mediastinal and cutaneous lesions. Late in the course of treatment the cutaneous lesions rapidly recurred and spread to various sites. A second skin biopsy showed an extensive diffuse infiltrate of histiocytic-appearing cells extending from the papillary dermis into the superficial subcutis. The cells had markedly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures were present. The neoplastic cells were S-100 protein and CD1a positive by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was Langerhans cell sarcoma. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor gamma gene in specimens from both the mediastinal mass and one of the recurrent cutaneous lesions. The sizes of the PCR products were identical demonstrating a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information exists on the use of any intravenous iron preparation in pediatric HD patients. This study was designed to describe the PK parameters of FG, now approved for use in children on HD. Methods:Iron-deficient pediatric HD pts (≤15?yr) were randomized to 2 doses of FG. Blood samples taken during a 1?hr infusion and at intervals over 48?hrs were analyzed for total iron, transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and FG-bound iron (FGI). Results:49% of pts were male, 88% white, 57% age 6?12?yr, wt 16.3?63.2?Kg, ht 100?177.5?cm. Mean serum iron concentrations (total iron and FGI) rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner, approximately proportional to the FG dose administered. A rapid rise in total serum iron was followed by a slower, less prominent rise in TBI. Single-dose PK of FGI was adequately described using non-compartmental analytical methods. A standard 2-compartment NONMEM model successfully fit the data and accurately described the time-course of FGI concentrations. Pharmacokinetic Parameter 1.5?mg/kg FG (n?=?22) 3.0?mg/kg FG (n?=?26) Cmax(mean?±?SD,?mcg/dL) 1287?±?285 ???2283?±?637 AUC0?48(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9327?±?4038 16,830?±?6526 AUC0?∞(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9499?±?4089 17,087?±?6776 Tmax(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???1.1?±?0.23 ???1.1?±?0.19 t1/2(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???2.0?±?0.7 ???2.5?±?1.8 Kel(mean?±?SD,?hr?1) ??0.43?±?0.30 ??0.39?±?0.27 Cl (mean?±?SD,?L/hr) ??0.69?±?0.50 ??0.66?±?0.52 Vd(mean?±?SD,?L) ???1.6?±?0.6 ???1.9?±?1.1 Conclusions: Cmax values in pediatric HD population were similar to Cmax values previously reported with similar FG doses in healthy iron-deficient adults (Ferrlecit? prescribing information). In contrast, mean AUC0?∞ values were approximately 2 times greater, and mean Cl rates were 5.4 times slower in pediatric pts.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - Background:? Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a condition with known predisposing factors, but of unknown etiology. A variety of opinions exist as to the cause of this condition, without consensus. Design: We reviewed 111 cases of CNH from 103 patients at our laboratory. p53 immunohistochemical staining, which is over expressed in basilar epidermal cells of porokeratosis, was performed in a representative sample of CNH cases. Histologic changes characteristic of porokeratosis were qualified as a 1) parakeratotic column of keratinocytes 2) an attenuated to absent granular layer, and 3) adjacent or underlying dyskeratosis of keratinocytes, present in columns or aggregates. Results: Porokeratosis-like changes were identified in 77 of 111 cases. p53 staining was noncontributory. Conclusion: The presence of these porokeratosis-like changes in 69% of cases is intriguing. It is not clear whether or not this could possibly represent a causative mechanism or, perhaps, an otherwise coincident histologic change. The presence of porokeratosis-like changes in CNH provides a possible hypothesis in relationship to its etiology, at the very least, it could provide some histologic clue as to the presence of this deep dermal process in superficial biopsies.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman developed back pain associated with a sacral mass seven years prior to presentation. Biopsy of the sacral mass showed chordoma. The patient underwent two surgical resections because of recurrent disease. She presented after developing a firm, non-tender skin nodule on the left back. Biopsy of the lesion showed a dermal neoplasm composed of nests of cells in a mucinous stroma. There was moderate cytologic atypia of the cells, and occasional mitotic figures were seen. Physaliphorous cells were present. The immunostains S-100, cytokeratin, and EMA were all positive. A diagnosis of metastatic chordoma to the skin or chordoma cutis was made. The patient died 15 months later from complications of metastatic disease. Chordomas are rare, representing only 1?4% of malignant bone tumors, which most often occur in the sacral area. Metastasis to the skin is unusual. In one study, 207 cases of chordoma were evaluated, and only 19 had skin involvement. Chordoma cutis has been described as nodules which are firm, blue domed, cystic-appearing, erythematous, translucent, flesh-colored, and reddish brown. Cutaneous metastasis of chordoma has been reported to the nose, chest, back, thigh, shoulders, left arm, face, neck, and scalp.

AB  - Tattoo pigment in sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma patients is a clinical challenge. A 77-year-old man presented with a pink nodular lesion of the right upper arm. Biopsy revealed a 1.9?mm thick, Clark level 4 nodular melanoma. A wide local excision with 2?cm margins and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was planned. Pre operative lymphoscintigraphy using technetium-99?m demonstrated a single strongly pigmented SLN in the right axilla. A prominent tattoo was located on the patient?s upper arm in the area of the melanoma. The clinical impression was highly suspicious for metastatic disease and the tissue was sent to pathology for examination. Frozen section showed a lymph node with benign histiocytes. There were black non-polarizable coarse granules in the subcapsular, sinusoidal areas and also in the histiocytes. Review of permanent hematoxylin and eosin sections as well as immunohistochemical analysis with MART-1 and HMB-45 showed no evidence of metastatic melanoma in the SLN. Pigmentation of lymph nodes is not pathognomic of malignant melanoma. Black pigmented lymph nodes can occur by carbon deposits of tattoo pigment as in our case. Histological confirmation of metastatic malignant melanoma in the SLN is imperative before proceeding to complete regional lymph node dissection.

AB  - An 81 yo male presented with several asymptomatic firm 1?5?cm red purple plaques on the trunk and lower extremities associated with a mild pancytopenia. Histological examination revealed a diffuse, monotonous dermal infiltrate of atypical medium sized cells with fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated positivity for CD 45, CD43, CD4, Bcl-2, and TdT; but was negative for cytokeratin, melan-A, CD30 and hematopoietic lineage specific markers. A subsequent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a dense population of cells that were morphologically consistent with blasts. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed lesional cells that expressed CD56, CD4, CD7, CD5, HLA-DR and TdT. However, lineage specific markers for B-cells (CD19, CD20, cCD79a, and CD10), T-cells (sCD3 and cCD3), and myeloid cells (CD13, CD33, CD117, cCD13, CD14, CD41, CD61, myeloperoxidase, and alpha napthyl butyrate esterase) were not expressed. Molecular studies by PCR exhibited no evidence of T-cell receptor or heavy chain gene rearrangements. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a primary cutaneous blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphomas are characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous involvement and an aggressive clinical course. Our patient responded dramatically to one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy with resolution of his cutaneous tumors.

AB  - A 65 year-old, well-appearing and asymptomatic man presented with a small non-healing ulcer on the right palm present for 6 weeks. He reported a 15 year history of hand and foot ?eczema? treated with topical steroids. Six months earlier his right 4th toe had been amputated for ?infection?, but additional information was not immediately forthcoming. Punch biopsy from the palm demonstrated superficial ulceration, dermal eosinophils and possible cytoplasmic inclusions within keratinocytes, leading to suspicion of parapox infection. Over the ensuing two months his condition deteriorated markedly, and he developed multiple fungated and ulcerated cutaneous nodules. Incisional biopsy of the nodule on the right palm revealed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of eosinophils, and a perivascular infiltrate of medium to large lymphocytes with irregular nuclei and mitoses. These atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD3, but were negative for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, TIA-1 and EBER in-situ hybridization. TCR-gamma gene rearrangement revealed a clonal population. Retrospective analysis of the amputated toe demonstrated similar features. He declined conventional treatment, and has been reluctant to pursue follow-up. Our case highlights the fulminant course and dense mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with eosinophils often present in peripheral T-cell lymphoma that may complicate diagnosis.

AB  - Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are classically associated with primary vasculitic syndromes, including Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and Wegeners granulomatosis. Recently, drug induced ANCA positive vasculitis has been reported, most frequently in association with propylthiouracil in Grave?s disease. Cocaine use is known to be associated with pulmonary and systemic eosinophilia as well as various vascular pathology, including vasospasm, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis. We report a case of cocaine associated perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) positive vasculitis. A 46-year-old man with a history of crack cocaine abuse presented with arthralgia, lower extremity edema, and multiple purpuric, tender papules and plaques over the hands and lower extremities. Peripheral blood studies revealed hypereosinophilia, and serologic tests demonstrated a p-ANCA titer of 1:2560. A skin biopsy demonstrated injured small dermal vessels with a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, karyorrhectic debris, erythrocytes, and abundant eosinophils. His symptoms and eosinophilia resolved with cessation of cocaine use and intravenous dexamethasone. Following a 2 year period of reported abstinence, the patient relapsed on cocaine and presented with similar clinical, serologic, and histologic findings. Although p-ANCA has been reported in patients with cocaine associated midline destructive lesions, to our knowledge, this is the first report of cocaine associated p-ANCA positive systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Case 1: A 38 year-old man presented with a painless right post auricular mass, slowly growing for ten years. Clinical impression was a salivary gland lesion. The excised mass measured 3?cm and was gelatinous. Case 2: A 28 year-old man presented with a lump in the region of the left heel, slowly growing for several years. Excision revealed a lobulated pink-gray mass measuring 2?cm. In both cases, histology demonstrated a circumscribed encapsulated proliferation of tumour cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma. There were almost exclusively hyaline cells with plasmacytoid features, arranged predominantly in nests and sheets with abundant pink cytoplasm and hyaline inclusions. Round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and rare mitotic figures were seen. Both cases stained strongly positive for low molecular weight cytokeratin, S 100 and vimentin and were negative for desmin, smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin. We describe two cases of hyaline cell-rich chondroid syringoma, a histologically benign entity. The importance in recognizing this entity is that these tumors can easily be confused with malignant neoplasms including malignant melanoma, myxoid chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Follow up for a year has shown no evidence of metastases or recurrence in both cases.

AB  - We report a 6-month old male infant who presented to our pediatric dermatology clinic with a generalized bullous eruption since three months of age. A sepsis work up performed prior to presentation did not reveal any evidence of infection. Clinical presentation revealed multiple tense bullae in a ?string of pearls? arrangement and multiple erosions on the bilateral upper extremities and trunk. This clinical presentation was strongly suggestive of chronic bullous disease of childhood. Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal complete blood cell count and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus types I and II was negative. Histological sections demonstrated a large space of separation between the epidermis and dermis which was filled by a monomorphous infiltrate composed of round to oval cells with centrally placed nuclei, consistent with mast cells. Leder and c-kit stains were strongly positive confirming the diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis. Direct immunofluorescence did not reveal IgA deposits or any other findings. Treatment included fluocinonide 0.05% cream QAM and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment QHS to active lesions, and silver sulfadiazine 1% cream to erosions. Improvement was noted during follow up examination.

AB  - A 27-year-old woman presented with a 5?mm papule on her cheek. She had no family history or stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Biopsy showed a diffuse dermal proliferation of spindle cells embedded in a slightly myxomatous stroma which entrapped adnexae. They displayed cytologic atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei and bizarre multinucleated giant cells. No mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed the spindle cells to be S-100 and collagen IV positive, but MART-1 negative. The differential diagnosis included desmoplastic melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and atypical neurofibroma. Both atypical neurofibroma and desmoplastic melanoma are S-100 positive, show variable atypia and can have bizarre multinucleated giant cells. However, the lack of epidermal melanocytic hyperplasia, mitosis and the positive collagen type IV staining, favor nerve sheath differentiation. In neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas may undergo malignant degeneration resulting in MPNST. Whether atypical neurofibroma represents a transitional stage is unknown. Mitotic activity and necrosis strongly suggest MPNST. The biologic potential of cutaneous atypical neurofibroma has not been well studied, but they appear to behave in a benign fashion. This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenge of atypia in neurofibromas and highlights the need for further studies on the behavior of these rare variants.

We describe the links between the topics reviewed in this special issue and interventions for child victims as well as the state of research concerning consequences of maltreatment more broadly. We further discuss the implications of current research for policy and practice. We close by describing important directions not only for future research, but also for interventions to reduce adverse effects of maltreatment on children. Throughout our commentary, we highlight limitations in the application of empirical findings to actual child victims and we offer concrete suggestions for ways of improving this applicability.

AB  - Materials and Methods: 247 consecutive skin specimens covering a three-month period (1/04?3/04) were reviewed to identify incidental foci of Hailey-Hailey (HH) like acantholysis and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis (FAD). Cases in which these patterns comprised the primary process were excluded. All cases were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and hematoxylin-eosin stained. Results: Six cases were identified: three shave biopsies (chest, back, face), two excisions (back, face), and one punch biopsy (scalp). This represented 2.4% of total reviewed. Four specimens had a HH like pattern (1.6%); two had FAD (0.8%). The average patient age was 68 years (range 41?86). Four patients were male; two were female. Three cases were associated with epidermal neoplasia: basal cell carcinoma (HH), actinic keratosis (HH), and malignant melanoma in situ (HH). Two were associated with significant inflammation: seborrheic keratosis (HH) and bullous lichen planus (FAD). One biopsy was of lichen simplex chronicus (FAD). The average diameter of acantholysis was 0.3?mm. Four cases showed associated prominent solar elastosis. Discussion: Incidental acantholysis with FAD and HH like patterns is uncommon. This has previously been postulated to reflect possible pre-neoplastic epidermal damage. The discussed cases show an association with epidermal neoplasia, solar change, and inflammation.

AB  - Malignant mesothelioma presenting as a primary umbilical tumor is not reported in the English literature, to our knowledge. We present a 63-year-old woman with a painless and initially skin colored nodule in the umbilical area, which within one month became erythematous. The performed biopsy revealed an infiltrating glandular and ductal proliferation involving the dermis, subcutaneous fat and underlying skeletal muscle embedded in a loose and mucinous stroma. The tumor cells were of medium size with round to oval nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were conspicuous. The tumor cells showed a positive reaction for kermix, EMA, CK5/6, calretinin and CK7 and a negative reaction for CK20, CEA, Ber-Ep4, S100 protein, TTF-1, PRP, ERP, and Leu-7. Since calretinin is both a sensitive and specific marker of reactive and neoplastic mesothelial cells, a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid variant, was made. The performed exploratory laparotomy showed no evidence of malignancy and wide excision of the umbilical area showed no evidence of residual tumor. Follow-up examinations of the patient with repeated CT scans for the past two years were negative for recurrent or metastatic disease. We conclude that this malignancy likely developed in a setting of umbilical abnormalities associated with mesothelial remnants.

AB  - We describe a 7-year old male with a 7-month history of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) presenting as an innocuous 0.5???0.5?cm nodule on the nasal dorsum. Following diagnostic sampling, Mohs? micrographic surgery was performed to ensure adequate removal and patient continues to do well 1 year post-surgery. PFT is a rare neoplasm described initially by Enzinger and Zhang in 1988. It afflicts children and young adults (median age: 14.5 years) and has a strong female predisposition. It typically occurs on the upper extremity. Histologically, the tumor has a bland appearance consisting of a biphasic population of varying numbers of fibroblast and histiocyte-like cells. Cellular atypia and pleomorphism are lacking and mitotic activity is low. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally, the tumor demonstrates myofibroblastic differentiation. The constituent cells have a diploid DNA content. Unique cytogenetic aberrations have been anecdotally identified. PFT behaves in a locally aggressive fashion and regional nodal disease can occur despite adequate excision. In rare instances, metastasis to the lungs has been described. No association between specific clinicopathologic features and outcome has been identified. In summary, PFT is a rare but distinct low-grade myofibroblastic tumor of children and young adults with a misleading clinical and histological appearance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma patients without lymph node metastases (Stage II) have a variable five-year survival. The influence of falsely negative lymph nodes on this variability is unknown. DESIGN: The Poisson distribution describes the probability of finding no positive lymph nodes when a certain number are examined. Using this model, we analysed lymph node dissection results from 780 patients with melanoma and published survival results for Stage II patients. RESULTS: In the 294 patients without positive nodes, 18% had fewer than 7 nodes examined. The Poisson probability of finding no positive nodes when 1 to 6 were examined ranged from 0.4 to to 0.8 (mean 0.6). We partitioned survival for stage II into two categories: those with truly negative nodes with a five-year survival of 80% and those with a five-year survival matching Stage III (46%). The observed five-year survival of 77% in Stage II patients implied that the fraction with false negative nodes was also 18%, which corresponded with the subgroup with fewer than 7 nodes examined. CONCLUSION: The Poisson model suggests that the variable survival in Stage II patients may reflect the incorrect staging of patients with stage III melanoma who have limited numbers of lymph nodes examined.

AB  - Abstract Housing is a key social determinant of health that contributes to the well-documented relationship between socioeconomic status and health. This study explored how individuals with histories of unstable and precarious housing perceive their housing or shelter situations, and the impact of these settings on their health and well-being. Participants were recruited from the Health and Housing in Transition study (HHiT), a longitudinal, multi-city study that tracked the health and housing status of people with unstable housing histories over a 5-year period. For the current study, one-time semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of HHiT study participants (n = 64), living in three cities across Canada: Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. The findings from an analysis of the interview transcripts suggested that for many individuals changes in housing status are not associated with significant changes in health due to the poor quality and precarious nature of the housing that was obtained. Whether housed or living in shelters, participants continued to face barriers of poverty, social marginalization, inadequate and unaffordable housing, violence, and lack of access to services to meet their personal needs.

AB  - Traditional teaching instructs us to remove a normal appendix during open appendicectomy, to avoid confusion during future presentations with right iliac fossa pain1. This ideology has been associated with a negative appendicectomy rate in the order of 15?20%2. The risk of missing submucosal appendicitis, of which the clinical significance remains unclear, has also propagated the decision to remove the ?normal? appendix. The advent of laparoscopy has lead to an improvement in the diagnosis of alternate pathology in the context of suspected appendicitis, particularly in the female population. There however still remains some confusion and concern amongst members of the surgical community as to whether appendicectomy should be performed in the context of normal other laparoscopic findings. We present the results of a retrospective review of 400 patients who underwent laparoscopy (+/? appendicectomy) at Westmead Hospital (Sydney, Australia) from July 2004 to June 2006 for suspected appendicitis, or for the investigation of right iliac fossa pain. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years. Of the 200 patients reviewed to date, in the 120 patients who underwent laparoscopy, 84% proceeded to have appendicectomies despite normal operative findings in one third of cases. This led to a high negative appendicectomy rate of 34%. In our experience, removal of the appendix is not justified when the appendix appears normal at laparoscopy, even in the absence of alternate pathology.
