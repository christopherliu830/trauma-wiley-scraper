AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that psychological stress impairs wound healing. Catecholamines released in response to stress could cause vascular changes that would restrict oxygen delivery to the healing wound. Hence, we hypothesized that stress impairs healing by disrupting oxygen balance in the wounds. 6?8 week, female SKH-1 mice were subjected to stress by confinement in well-ventilated 50-ml conical tubes. Stressing was done three days prior to wounding and five days post wounding, during the active cycle of the mice. Wounds were placed using a standard, 3.5?mm-diameter biopsy punch. Each mouse received two wounds on their dorsum, behind their shoulder blades. Wound oxygenation was measured by EPR oximetry. Gene expression was measured by real time PCR. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist was used in conjunction with EPR oximetry to determine catecholamine-mediated modulation of wound oxygenation during healing. Our results on the effects of stress on wound healing were consistent with previous results in the model, and showed 19%? 30% larger wounds in the stressed animals when compared to controls. Oxygen levels in the wounds showed a 17.49 to 34.38%(p?<?0.001) decrease in the stressed animals on days 1 through 5 post wounding. Furthermore, gene expression studies of a hypoxia driven gene, iNOS, showed an increase in expression on days 1 (205%; p?<?0.0003), 3(96%; p?<?0.04) and 5 (249%; p?<?0.0003). eNOS expression increased by 66%(p?<?0.02) on day 1 post-wounding, with no significant difference in nNOS expression. Phentolamine ameliorated the effect of stress on wound oxygenation on day 1 post wounding. These findings show that stress-impaired healing is associated with reduced tissue oxygen and altered expression of a hypoxia-induced gene. Furthermoe, the data suggests a role for catecholamines in stress-induced impairment of wound oxygenation during early healing.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - We present the findings of a rare and very aggressive primary skin tumor, composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumor (CERT) with features of rhabdomyosarcoma. Clinical history: A 53-year-old woman presented with a 2.5?cm ulcerated nodule on her right medial calf. On exam, she also exhibited inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathology: Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node and punch biopsy of the skin nodule disclosed an epithelioid cell morphology with rhabdoid cells, solid growth, and a high mitotic rate (>70 figures/10 HPF). Upon wide excision of the tumor, electron microscopy (EM) and special stains were performed. Since the differential diagnosis was broad, a large number of stains were performed: tumor was positive for vimentin, desmin, muscle specific actin, WT-1, CD56, and CD10, and negative for S-100, melan A, cytokeratins, EMA, CD34, fast myosin, myoglobin, myogenin, myoD1, smooth muscle actin, and NSE. EM revealed rhabdoid cells with perinuclear globules of intermediate filaments corresponding to the positive desmin stain. Summary: The patient was treated with chemotherapy without regression of presumed lung metastases. The CERT is a rare, aggressive tumor that extraordinarily presents as a primary skin tumor. The differential is broad and nomenclature confusing. Extensive ancillary pathology studies are required for appropriate diagnosis.

AB  - 76-year-old man presented with a hen?s egg-sized elevated nodule in his left sole in 4/04. He had been hospitalized because of icterus since 3/04. Although cancer of the pancreatic head had been strongly suspected on the imaging, he had refused surgical operation. No metastasis of the cancer had been found on the imaging. A dermatologist who biopsied the nodule in his left plantar recognized the swelling of inguinal lymph nodes on the same side. Histologically medium sized oval cells formed solid nests in the dermis, rendering them lobulated appearance. Some of the nests showed myxoid change in the stroma where tumor cells often showed cord-like arrangement. The border with surrounding tissue was relatively clear. The cells had round, and often eccentrically located nuclei with one or two small nucleoli and moderate to scarce amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was readily identifiable; >50/10HPF. Necrosis was not found. Immunohistochemically tumor cells were reactive for AE1/AE3, vimentin and S-100 protein and negative for ??SMA, CK14, EMA, HMB 45 and Melan A. MIB-1 labeling index was over 50%. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. The positivity for S-100 protein seen in this case necessitated us to differentiate it from melanoma.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced. NHD Costs ($Can) Daily (SHD) Excluding monitoring Including monitoring One-time $21,281 $19,772 $21,465 Savings $12,836 $20,484 $16,703 ROI (years) 1.7 1.0 1.3

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to observe the anticoagulant effect of the new type of citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate in renal failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Methods:?57 patients at high risk of bleeding were given hemodialysis for 4 hours and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures: Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate. Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysate and with no anticoagulant. Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and with nadroparin calcium (a low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) as anticoagulant. Bleeding complication, coagulation of extracorporeal circuit, venous blood pressure, heart rate, QTC, activated coagulation time (ACT), ionized-calcium (iCa++), total calcium and pH, , Na+, K+, Cl?, BUN, Cr, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the blood cell counts were monitored during hemodialysis, and a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of thrombus formation and cellular aggregation on the interior surface of hemodialysis membranes. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous blood pressure increased continuously, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 4 out of 19 patients. Hemodialysis for 4 hours in Group 2 were all successfully fulfilled. No bleeding episodes occurred. No severe clotting of dialyzers and blood accesses was observed. ACT was extended and iCa++ decreased obviously in the venous line, but ACT and iCa++ in vivo were normal. pH, tended to increase but not to metabolic alkalosis levels. Na+, K+, Cl?, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the counts of blood cells were all within the normal range. There was no severe thrombus observed by SEM in the hollow fibers. In Group 3, severe bleeding complication happened to 3 out of 19 patients, and one of them died. ACT was extended obviously at the arterial end. Conclusions:?The citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate was proved to be practical, safe and effective. So it is indicated for patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus.

AB  - We report a 43-year-old woman, in otherwise excellent health, who presented with a 4 year history of an asymptomatic, papular condition described as ?tiny little spines? involving the skin. On examination hundreds of discrete, palpable 1-mm projections were present on the upper torso and arms. Histopathology showed a small focus of acanthotic epidermis forming a small spire. Overlying the subtle epidermal elevation was a column of compact hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. Epidermal atrophy and dermal lymphocytic inflammation, characteristic of Flegel?s disease, were not observed. No features of keratosis pilaris were noted. A diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses was rendered. Relatively rare multiple minute digitate hyperkeratoses is a non-follicular disorder of keratinization of unclear etiology. Previously ascribed names include, but are not limited to, disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and minute aggregate keratoses. A classification scheme with sporadic, post-inflammatory (recently challenged as another entity) and familial (autosomal dominant) types has been proposed. Other classifications are based on topography and histology or age of onset: early (20?s and 30?s) and late (40?s-50?s). Paraneoplastic syndromes have been associated with late onset type. In summary, we report a sporadic case of late-onset multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, an unusual and relatively rare disorder.

AB  - A 25-year-old man presented with a large, undermined, violaceous ulcer with hemorrhagic crust on his nose for 1 year. It began as a ?pimple?. He had similar lesions on his scalp, abdomen and groin. His sister has Crohn?s and his mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Screening blood tests and CT scans revealed no underlying disease. The clinical impression was pyoderma gangrenosum. Biopsies from the nose and abdomen revealed dense superficial and mid-dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate composed of enlarged, atypical lymphocytes with focal epidermotropism and epidermal necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed the infiltrate was primarily CD3 positive T-cells without deficiency of CD4, CD7 or CD8. CD30, TIA and Granzyme were not detected. A T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected. Flow cytometry was negative. This is a case of pyoderma gangrenosum-like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of cutaneous lymphoma that clinically resembles PG, but histologically and immunohistochemically is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although rare, PG-like ulcers should be added to the list of atypical manifestations of CTCL. This case highlights the need to evaluate all atypical lymphocytic infiltrates thoroughly with immunohistochemistry and gene rearrangement. The diagnosis must be made with caution as proliferative clones of lymphocytes can be found in true PG.

AB  - A 32-year-old immunocompromised African American male on multiple medications with a history of psoriasis and prurigo nodularis presented with a new generalized, painful, pruritic, papular eruption. Histologic sections revealed epidermal changes of lichen simplex chronicus with superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and frequent eosinophils. Two important histological features also identified were eosinophilic panniculitis and prominent perineural eosinophilic infiltrate with focal areas showing eosinophils extending into the substance of the nerve. A right thigh sample was also sent for Gram stain, AFB and fungal cultures, all of which were negative. Laboratory findings at this time were significant for a peripheral blood eosinophilia. The patients? topical corticosteroid prescription was increased with minimal relief. Hypereosinophilic syndrome with dermatoses in HIV infected patients is well documented. We present a patient with advanced AIDS, generalized painful, pruritic, papular rash and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The pattern of inflammation on HIV dermatoses seen in our patient not previously described in the literature is the perineural eosinophilic infiltrate and eosinophilic panniculitis. We propose two possible explanations for these histological findings: (1) hypereosinophilic syndrome in AIDS patients is a heterogeneous disorder and may include eosinophilic neuritis with panniculitis, or (2) an exuberant drug reaction.

AB  - Abstract The spacing effect is among the most widely replicated empirical phenomena in the learning sciences, and its relevance to education and training is readily apparent. Yet successful applications of spacing effect research to education and training is rare. Computational modeling can provide the crucial link between a century of accumulated experimental data on the spacing effect and the emerging interest in using that research to enable adaptive instruction. In this paper, we review relevant literature and identify 10 criteria for rigorously evaluating computational models of the spacing effect. Five relate to evaluating the theoretic adequacy of a model, and five relate to evaluating its application potential. We use these criteria to evaluate a novel computational model of the spacing effect called the Predictive Performance Equation (PPE). Predictive Performance Equation combines elements of earlier models of learning and memory including the General Performance Equation, Adaptive Control of Thought?Rational, and the New Theory of Disuse, giving rise to a novel computational account of the spacing effect that performs favorably across the complete sets of theoretic and applied criteria. We implemented two other previously published computational models of the spacing effect and compare them to PPE using the theoretic and applied criteria as guides.

AB  - Background? A recent meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of abdominal fascial closures concluded that in order to reduce incisional hernia rates without increasing wound pain, or the rate of dehiscence slowly absorbable continuous sutures appear to achieve the best results in abdominal fascial closures. We surveyed the techniques for abdominal fascial closure among general surgeons in Canberra, Australia. Methodology? 49 out of 80 surgeons responded to the survey by form. The information collected included the seniority of the surgeon, the frequency of laparotomy closure, surgical technique and suture material utilised in abdominal fascial closure. Results? 34 (69%) of the surgeons surveyed preferred a non-absorbable monofilament suture material for abdominal fascial closure with nylon being the most popular. Most (38, 78%) also preferred a non-absorbable monofilament suture in emergency surgery. 12 (24%) surgeons preferred to use slowly absorbable suture. The majority of surgeons (37, 76%) preferred continuous suture technique, whilst only 2 (4%) used continuous followed by interrupted suture closures. Only 5 (10%) complied with the dual recommendation of continuous suture technique and slowly absorbable suture. Conclusion? The majority of surgeons preferred non-absorbable monofilament suture rather than slowly absorbable suture. Only 1 in 10 surgeons complied with both components of evidence base, which supports the use of slowly absorbable suture material and a continuous technique in abdominal fascial closure. A definitive RCT would confirm this observation.

AB  - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) may be idiopathic, drug-induced, related to infection, or may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. Our objective was to determine whether tissue eosinophilia is a reliable indicator of a drug-induced etiology in the setting of LCV. Thorough chart investigation of 63 patients with LCV was performed with division of patients into drug-induced and non-drug-induced groups. Corresponding histopathologic material was reviewed by a dermatopathologist blinded to the etiologic associations.? An eosinophil score was tabulated by averaging the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (400x) and dividing by the density of inflammation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin rank sums test. Mean eosinophil scores in the drug-induced (n?=?16) and non-drug-induced (n?=?47) groups were 5.20 and 1.05 respectively (p?=?0.0126). Vascular fibrin deposition and epidermal changes were present in both groups. Clinical evidence of systemic vasculitis was present in 6%(1/16) of the drug-induced group vs. 38%(18/47) of the non-drug-induced cases. This study establishes tissue eosinophilia as a reliable indicator of drug induction in the setting of LCV. Furthermore, this information may be useful for guiding management decisions, especially in settings of unclear etiology.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - Abstract Homocysteine (HCY) has recently been linked to fragility fractures. Moreover, HCY activates osteoclasts. Little is known about the effect of HCY on activity of human osteoblasts (OBs). We hypothesized that HCY decreases the activity of OBs. Osteoblasts obtained from tra-becular human bone specimens of eight donors were cultured with conditioned medium. Culture medium was adjusted to 0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY. After 14 days alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, pro-collagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and osteocalcin (OC) secretion in the supernatant were measured. After 20 days the formation of mineralized matrix was analyzed. HCY-stimulated AP activity gradually (100 ?M HCY: 118%, P= 0.006; 500 ?M HCY: 125%, P < 0.001). At 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY the increase of AP activity was reversible (1000 ?M HCY: 106%, P= 0.317; 2000 ?M HCY: 102%, P < 0.737). The PINP secretion was also stimulated by HCY reaching a maximum of 260 ± 154 ?g/l at 500 ?mol/l versus 205 ± 94 ?,g/l in controls. After 20 days of culture the formation of bone matrix was increased at 100 and 500 ?M HCY. OC secretion was not significantly changed. The results of the present study consistently demonstrate a moderate stimulation of primary human OB activity by increasing concentrations of HCY. However, the magnitude of this effect seems to be less pronounced than recent observations on primary human osteoclasts, suggesting a dysbalance between OBs and osteoclasts in favour of osteoclasts
