AB  - We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental well-being), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth. Results revealed that numerous stressors, such as physical abuse and running away from home more frequently, were associated with greater depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety. Having mentors and family and friends from home that youth can rely on resulted in more positive social support, which subsequently lowered the risk for depressive symptoms and anxiety at wave 2.

AB  - We describe here the case of a female patient with an otherwise classic invasive melanoma of the upper extremity, demonstrating the typical immunohistochemical profile, who presented three years later with massive ipsilateral axillary node metastases. The metastatic tumor had morphologic features similar to the primary melanoma, however at immunohistochemical level the tumor cells not only gained expression of pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) but also lost expression of all standard melanoma markers (S100, Melan-A, HMB-45, MIT-1, and tyrosinase) thus mimicking a poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma. Additional stains reveal expression of Vimentin, NSE, c-kit, CD10 and negativity for CK7, CK20, BR2, ER/PR, mucin, and LCA. To rule out a breast carcinoma, real-time RT-PCR was performed on a lymph node using six breast cancer-associated genes (>99% sensitivity), which was also negative. Clinical work-up of the patient failed to reveal abnormal masses in the breast or elsewhere. The clinical history, histological appearance, immunohistochemical profile (including negative CK7 and positive NSE, c-kit and CD10) as well as a negative RT-PCR renders almost null the possibility of a breast carcinoma and supports a diagnostic of melanoma in this case. Cases like ours may be easily misclassified unless a concerted approach is used to reach the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Laminin-5 is a basement membrane constituent that functions as an anchoring filament to integrin-derived hemidesmosomes, and has been detected at the invasive front (tumor-stromal interface) in many types of carcinomas. Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.

AB  - A 27-day-old female neonate presented with a bleeding growth on the abdomen. The clinical differential diagnosis included pyogenic granuloma and hemangioma. Histology shows an ulcerated, spindled and round cell tumor in the dermis with ill-defined margins that invade the subcutaneous fat. The tumor exhibits a biphasic growth pattern with plump spindled cells arranged in fascicles, as well as epithelioid cells arranged in sheets. Some cells show plasmacytoid features. The tumor cells have pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei. Single cell necrosis and mitotic activity is prominent. Myxoid and chondroid stromal changes are focally seen. Immunohistochemical stains show strong positivity for S100 protein, calponin, and, focally, AE1/AE3. Portions of the both the spindled and epithelioid cell components show staining with EMA. Desmin and MSA stains were negative. The tumor does not stain for CD 31, CD 30, CD 45, CD 20, CD 34, CK 20, MART-1, or HMB45. These histologic features are consistent with a cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma. Cutaneous myoepitheliomas are rare tumors of myoepithelial cells which surround eccrine and apocrine glands. While most myoepitheliomas are benign, tumors with high mitotic activity may have a risk for recurrence or metastasis. This is, to our knowledge, the youngest patient described with myoepithelial carcinoma.

AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine constitutively expressed in adipose tissue and upregulated by hypoxia in sites of tissue injury and in the placenta. Leptin has been demonstrated to play a role in normal and pathological wound healing and it is gene is acutely expressed in experimental wounds. Angiogenesis is among the most salient and well-documented biological actions of leptin. Therefore it was hypothesized that leptin may play in the modulation of wound neovascularization. Using a murine model of experimental wounds the modulation of wound angiogenesis was investigated by treatment of the wounds to either recombinant leptin or a neutralizing anti-leptin antibody. The parameters measured were: a)woundblood flow using laser Doppler imaging; b)vesseldensity by counting the number of CD-31 positive vessels in wound sections; c)angiogenic transcriptionalprofiling using quantitative real-time RT-PCR; and d)validation of transcriptionalprofiling by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The treatment of wounds with leptin had a marked effect in wound blood flow that was most significant at 24hours post-wounding with average increase of 55% with respect to the controls. The effect diminished significantly by 72 hours (24%) and became negligible thereafter. Leptin also accelerate wound neovascularization by 24 hours where the number of small caliber vessels averaged 30/mm2 in leptin treated vessels and 13/mm2 in the controls (n?=?10; P?<?0.005). However, the number of vessels measured by 72 hours not significantly different between controls and leptin-treated wounds. In addition transcriptional profiling reveled changes in gene expression of molecules related to angiogenesis such as VEGF, PlGF, Tie-1, Tie-2, Flt-1, Flk-1, FGF-2 and endothelial markers like CD-31, endoglin and eNOS. Overall, time course analysis throughout the healing process showed that leptin treatment induced an early shift in the expression of many of the analyzed transcripts. The most salient changes could be observed as early as 6 hours post-wounding and included: TSP-1 (+8.7); FLK-1(+9); Ang-2 (+18); CD31(+5.3); endoglin (+7.6); eNOS (+4.2); FGF-2 (+4.3); etc. Leptin mRNA was also significantly increased (+10) as well as the long-form of its receptor ObR-b (+9). Conversely, when wounds were exposed to anti-leptin antibodies, healing progression was impaired and changes in the transcriptional profile showed diminished expression of several genes related to wound neovascularization. Some examples by 24 hours: Endoglin(?2.5); Flk-1(?2.8); eNOS (?5.1); Ang-2 (?5.1); CD31(?3); VEGF-A (?3.6). In conclusion, leptin had and early and significant effect in modulating wound neovascularization. The effect of treatment of wounds with exogenous leptin did not elicit hypervascularization of the wound and appeared to only accelerate what appeared to be a self-limited process of wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Globally in 2000, 1.2 million deaths resulted from road traffic injury (RTI) and about 10 times this number were injured. Because of the size of the problem, its expected growth and its preventability World Health Day 2004 (April 7) was devoted to RTI. This review highlights attention to RTI by the ANZJPH and investigates relevance to the developing world, where 90% of all RTI deaths now occur. Method: All articles published by the ANZJPH over the five-year period 1999?2004, which met the World Health Organization definition of RTI, were reviewed. Results: The eight studies selected and reviewed focused particularly on young drivers, alcohol use and Indigenous Australians, using a range of research and evaluation methods. Risk factors identified including widespread risky driving behaviour by young males and alcohol involvement. Intervention successes included legislative change regarding utility passengers, current vehicle inspection certificate and effects associated with the lead-up to New Zealand's 1992 Transport Act. Conclusions: The dramatic and continued reduction in Australia's road toll following peak rates in the 1960s has relied on scientific research, such as that reviewed here, for its effective evidence base. This review indicates that RTI is established on the public health agenda in Australia?a key aim of WHO's five-year strategy, for emulation by developing regions and nations. Implications: High-income countries such as Australia and New Zealand have the knowledge, expertise and also the responsibility to assist regional low-and middle-income countries to counter the growing scourge of RTI that accompanies rapid motorisation.

AB  - Abstract This study examined how work stressors were associated with sleep quality and alcohol-related problems among U.S. Navy members over the course of deployment. Participants were 101 U.S. Navy members assigned to an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer who experienced an 8-month deployment after Operational Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Approximately 6 weeks prior to deployment, 6 weeks after deployment, and 6 months reintegration, participants completed measures that assessed work stressors, sleep quality, and alcohol-related problems. A piecewise latent growth model was conducted in which the structural paths assessed if work stressors influenced sleep quality or its growth over time, and in turn if sleep quality influenced alcohol-related problems intercepts or growth over time. A significant indirect effect was found such that increases in work stressors from pre- to postdeployment predicted decreases in sleep quality, which in turn were associated with increases in alcohol-related problems from pre- to postdeployment. These effects were maintained from postdeployment through the 6-month reintegration. Findings suggest that work stressors may have important implications for sleep quality and alcohol-related problems. Positive methods of addressing stress and techniques to improve sleep quality are needed as both may be associated with alcohol-related problems among current Navy members.

AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.
