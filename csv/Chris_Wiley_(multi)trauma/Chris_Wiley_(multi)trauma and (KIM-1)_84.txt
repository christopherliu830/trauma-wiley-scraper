AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Objective:? Societies and cultures have been described as being individualistic or collectivist (also called ego-centric or socio-centric). Similarly individuals are idiocentric or allocentric. Method:? Using migration, migrants, ethnic minorities, collectivism and individualism, four databases of Embase, Medline, PsychInfo and Social Sciences abstracts were searched. Other key words included mental disorder, mental distress, psychiatric and psychological disorders. In addition, hand searches were conducted from the relevant books, monographs and secondary references. Results:? Migration, cultural identity and mental distress are linked. In addition, social support can provide a buffer against mental illness. Other vulnerability factors in migrants include the type of society they originate from and the type of society they settle in. Conclusion:? When individuals migrate from one type of culture to another it is likely that depending upon their own personality traits (along with their biopsycho-social vulnerabilities) may develop psychiatric disorders. The cognitions and idioms of distress will be influenced by cultural factors. The clinicians must take into account cultural background when planning any interventions to enable a stronger therapeutic alliance.

AB  - ABSTRACT Consensus has not been reached regarding the ability of pathologic fracture to predict local recurrence and survival in osteosarcoma. We aim to review the available evidence to examine the association between pathologic fracture and osteosarcoma prognosis. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies published until March 2014 was performed using PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science. The studies investigating pathologic fracture of osteosarcoma patients were systematically analyzed. The overall relative risk (RR) was estimated using a fixed-effect model or random-effect model according to heterogeneity between the trials. We included nine cohort studies involving 2,187 patients (311 with pathologic fracture and 1,876 without fracture) for the analysis of survival rate and local recurrence. Studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle?Ottawa Assessment Scale. In the fixed-effects model, the meta-analysis showed that pathologic fracture in osteosarcoma patients predicted poor 3-year overall survival (OS) (RR?=?1.86, 95% CI: 1.37?2.53, p?<?0.001) and 5-year OS (RR?=?1.34, 95% CI: 1.06?1.70, p?=?0.016). Similarly, pathologic fracture was significantly correlated with worse 3-year event free survival (EFS) (RR?=?1.52, 95% CI: 1.21?1.92, p?<?0.001) and 5-year EFS (RR?=?1.24, 95% CI: 1.03?1.49, p?=?0.021), whereas no significant association was noted with local recurrence (RR?=?1.30, 95% CI: 0.84?2.02, p?=?0.233). The meta-analysis confirmed that pathologic fracture in osteosarcoma was a prognostic marker for both OS and EFS but not for local recurrence. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the development of a Yup'ik Alaska Native approach to suicide and alcohol abuse prevention that resulted in the creation of the Qungasvik, a toolbox promoting reasons for life and sobriety among youth. The Qungasvik is made up of thirty-six modules that function as cultural scripts for creating experiences in Yup'ik communities that build strengths and protection against suicide and alcohol abuse. The Qungasvik manual represents the results of a community based participatory research intervention development process grounded in culture and local process, and nurtured through a syncretic blending of Indigenous and Western theories and practices. This paper will provide a description of the collaborative steps taken at the community-level to develop the intervention modules. This process involved university researchers and community members coming together and drawing from multiple sources of data and knowledge to inform the development of prevention activities addressing youth suicide and alcohol abuse. We will present case examples describing the development of three keystone modules; Qasgiq (The Men's House), Yup'ik Kinship Terms, and Surviving Your Feelings. These modules each are representative of the process that the community co-researcher team took to develop and implement protective experiences that: (1) create supportive community, (2) strengthen families, and (3) give individuals tools to be healthy and strong.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Aim:? The comparative study of hemodialysis (HD) adequacy of Kt/V measurement between classic method (Daugirdas formula) and urea sensor monitor (online). Patients and methods:? 30 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis were studied. A comparative evaluation of HD adequacy during the same session was done with two different methods: (1) blood samples were drawn in the beginning and in the end of HD session for the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and after measurement of HD adequacy by 3rd generation Daugirdas formula and (2) urea sensor monitor use for continuous HD adequacy measurement during HD session. Results:? There was statistically significant correlation of Kt/V Daugirdas with Kt/V online (r?=?0.8, p?<?0.001). Also there was statistically significant correlation between solute removal index (SRI), Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=?0.81, p?<?0.001) and Kt/V online (r?=?0.92, p?<?0.001). From nutrition indices that were measured, the protein catabolic rate (PCR) had marginal negative correlation with the two compared adequacy indices, Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=??0.24, p?<?0.03), and Kt/V online (r?=??0.17, p?<?0.03) although the nPCR (normalized PCR) had marginal positive correlation (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.05) (r?=?0.42, p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? The use of online urea sensor monitors contributes to the easy measurement of adequacy and nutrition indices and hence complicated mathematical formulas are not necessary. The results of these measurements are reliable and comparable with classic methods of HD adequacy evaluation.

AB  - This article reports a multi-professional development project that was based on an action science design. The purpose was to develop ?acknowledging communication? in a psychiatric department for young people, and the objective to study the staffs? experiences of participating in the project. The professional part of the project has its foundation in Schibbye?s treatment theory of inter-subjective understanding of relationships, and involves three main approaches from her theory: self-reflection, self-delimitation and emotional presence. The article presents the specific action design used, where reflection processes were developed in three different arenas: multidisciplinary Reflection groups, a Leader support group for the group leaders of the Reflection groups and collective Project seminars for all employees. A formal study programme designed to increase professional expertise, 15 European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), was also offered. The research methods included the researcher?s process notes taken during the process, field notes from participating in the Leader support group, and qualitative interviews of eight informants participating in the various reflection arenas. The article presents and discusses the experiences evolved from the methods that were developed during the professional action science project: reflection on specific situations of interaction with patients in the form of oral/written narratives and the development of video presentations in combination with ?reflective teams?. The study showed that to facilitate change in the role of staff members, it is important to combine several reflection arenas where theoretical principles can be converted into practical action. By drawing data from only one study site, the study has a limited transferability, but should be of interest for professionals working with clinical change processes.

AB  - Abstract Much is known about the positive effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in regulating muscle protein metabolism. Comparatively much less is known about the effects of these amino acids and their metabolites in regulating myotube formation. Using cultured myoblasts, we showed that although leucine is required for myotube formation, this requirement is easily met by α-ketoisocaproic acid, the ketoacid of leucine. We then demonstrated increases in the expression of the first two enzymes in the catabolism of the three BCAA, branched-chain amino transferase (BCAT2) and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD), with ~3? increase in BCKD protein expression (p < .05) during differentiation. Furthermore, depletion of BCAT2 abolished myoblast differentiation, as indicated by reduction in the levels of myosin heavy chain-1, troponin and myogenin. Supplementation of incubation medium with branched-chain α-ketoacids or related metabolites derivable from BCAT2 functions did not rescue the defects. However, co-depletion of BCKD kinase partially rescued the defects. Collectively, our data indicate a requirement for BCAA catabolism during myotube formation and that this requirement for BCAT2 likely goes beyond the need for this enzyme to generate the α-ketoacids of the BCAA.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on cognitive behavioral interventions with juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent by the courts and have ongoing contact with the correctional system. The cognitive-behavioral approach assesses skills deficits and factors that provoke antisocial and immature behaviors and that reinforce and maintain poor adjustment across time and contexts. Most multicomponent programs include behavioral assessment to understand an adolescent's discrete patterns and deficit areas, a skills-based program focused on cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as on emotion regulation, and use modeling, role-play, guided homework and positive reinforcement for approximations to the desired prosocial behaviors. Treatment approaches that are based on cognitive-behavioral theory and are relevant to clinical work with juvenile offenders and their empirical evidence for overall effectiveness are reviewed. Highly structured programs that address multiple risk factors across different contexts, include a strong cognitive component, and are rehabilitative and strengths-based appear to be the most effective. To ensure positive outcomes, the inclusion of a family and/or parent treatment component is critical. Establishing a good working alliance with the family and remaining flexible during implementation are key ingredients for success. Interventions are time consuming and expensive, as staff require comprehensive training, ongoing support and supervision in order to deliver treatment that is effective in achieving the prosocial, interpersonal, and self-regulatory skills needed for healthy adolescent development.

AB  - Summary Treatment for vitiligo is difficult and prolonged. Nevertheless, at present considerable knowledge accumulated during several decades on the pathogenic mechanisms, revealed important clues for designing new strategies to improve vitiligo depigmentation. With available medical therapies, high repigmentation percentages mostly on facial and neck lesions are achieved, although they are less effective on trunk and limbs and poor on the acral parts of the extremities. Narrow band UVB and psoralens and UVA are the two most important treatments for generalized vitiligo affecting more than 10?20% of the cutaneous surface, and topical corticosteroids, or calcineurin inhibitors are the most valuable treatments for localized vitiligo. Persistence of achieved regimentation is variable and an undefined percentage of patients may have variable recurrence. When vitiligo becomes refractory, surgical methods may improve depigmentation as effectively as with medical therapy; in segmental (unilateral) or long standing, non-segmental (bilateral) stable vitiligo, repigmentation with surgical methods is usually permanent.

AB  - Aims:? The aims were to study health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hand eczema, and to compare two different instruments for assessment of HRQL. Methods:? 100 consecutive hand eczema patients (51 females and 49 males) at an occupational dermatology clinic completed the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the dermatology specific Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). To compare the instruments factor analysis, with a polychoric correlation matrix as input, was performed, thus taking the ordinal aspect of the data into account. Results:? HRQL was affected by hand eczema, measured with both SF-36 and DLQI. The mean (SD) sum scores of DLQI was 7.4 (5.8), no difference between genders. However, the SF-36 showed more impaired HRQL for females than for males in the mental health dimension. There was a high correlation between the instruments for physical health, but lower for mental health. Conclusions:? Hand eczema has an impact on HRQL, and both SF-36 and DLQI are suitable instruments. Our conclusion from the factor analysis is that the SF-36 measures mental health better than the DLQI. The choice of instrument to be used in a specific study depends on the purpose of the study. A generic instrument has the advantage of making comparisons with other diseases possible. The SF-36 also appears suitable for use in hand eczema studies where gender differences in HRQL are of interest.
