AB  - Aims:? The aims were to study health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hand eczema, and to compare two different instruments for assessment of HRQL. Methods:? 100 consecutive hand eczema patients (51 females and 49 males) at an occupational dermatology clinic completed the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the dermatology specific Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). To compare the instruments factor analysis, with a polychoric correlation matrix as input, was performed, thus taking the ordinal aspect of the data into account. Results:? HRQL was affected by hand eczema, measured with both SF-36 and DLQI. The mean (SD) sum scores of DLQI was 7.4 (5.8), no difference between genders. However, the SF-36 showed more impaired HRQL for females than for males in the mental health dimension. There was a high correlation between the instruments for physical health, but lower for mental health. Conclusions:? Hand eczema has an impact on HRQL, and both SF-36 and DLQI are suitable instruments. Our conclusion from the factor analysis is that the SF-36 measures mental health better than the DLQI. The choice of instrument to be used in a specific study depends on the purpose of the study. A generic instrument has the advantage of making comparisons with other diseases possible. The SF-36 also appears suitable for use in hand eczema studies where gender differences in HRQL are of interest.

AB  - As the techniques of arthroscopic surgery have evolved, so have the possibilities of reconstructing the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). However, the indications for this procedure have been debated. We describe the results of reconstructing the PCL in 16 consecutive patients with chronic knee instability due to isolated PCL deficiency using either a patella bone?tendon?bone (pBTB) graft with proximal fixation in one femoral tunnel or double bundle hamstring grafts in two femoral tunnels. The patients were followed prospectively and had an additional evaluation after median 35 (25?51.5) months by a blinded observer. The objective stability and subjective scores increased significantly from the preoperative condition. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between using a pBTB graft in one femoral tunnel compared with semitendinosus/gracilis grafts in two femoral tunnels. We conclude that arthroscopic reconstruction of isolated PCL ruptures improves the activity level of patients and relieves symptoms. In our study, no difference in outcome between the two techniques could be found.

AB  - Background:? Among patients receiving chronic HD, therapy with paricalcitol (Z) was associated with reduced mortality and morbidity compared to treatment with calcitriol (C). Furthermore, patients who did not receive any vitamin D therapy experienced highest mortality and morbidity. This study examined the hypothesis of a relationship between the dose of Z and subsequent hospitalization, more specifically, that patients receiving lower doses of Z would have a higher risk of being hospitalized. Methods:?We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients new to HD who received treatment with Z or C between Jan 1999 and Dec 2001 using Poisson regression models. The primary exposure variable was the average dose/day, examined as categorical data by quintiles, during a 3-month and then 12-month follow-up period excluding the days in hospitals. This latter exclusion was made due to uncertainty of the treatment during the period of hospitalization. Additional covariates included vitamin-D group (Z vs. C), age, gender, race, and diabetes status, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH. Results:?We first examined dose of Z and C over a 3-month period and then hospitalizations over the ensuing year. We did not find a dose-response relationship in these analyses ? i.e., dose over the first three months of dialysis is not associated with increased or reduced risk of hospitalizations during the ensuing 12 months. We then examined average dose of Z or C over the entire year and risk for hospitalization during the same year. Compared to total doses, average doses (total dose over the entire year divided by number of dialysis sessions during the same year) are less prone to bias. Risk of hospitalizations according to dose (lowest dose, Quintile 1) of injectable vitamin D is shown in the table below: Quintile HR 95% CI 1 1.093 1.025?1.165 2 1.073 1.007?1.143 3 1.055 0.990?1.124 4 1.050 0.978?1.116 5 1.0 REF Compared to those who received the highest doses of injectable vitamin D, those receiving the lowest had a 9% increased risk for a hospitalization. At each level, the risk for hospitalizations was 4% lower with Z compared to C. Conclusion:?This pilot study indicates that higher average doses of Z are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and suggests additional beneficial effects of vitamin D beyond mineral metabolism and PTH control.

AB  - Abstract The specialized tightly controlled microcirculation of craniofacial neurosensory organs is an essential evolutionary adaptation and yet a dilemma where angiogenic remodeling occurs. Despite extreme plasticity of neurosensory structures, the capacity to reconcile barrier phenotype of the microcirculation with an angiogenic cascade is not known. Here we provide primary evidence for such a response in an elemental neurosensory structure, human dental pulp, following chronic carious insult. In response to hypoxic challenge neurosensory odontoblasts express hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and notch-1. Associated radial rearrangement of astrocyte-like telacytes that communicate through a cell-poor zone with the microvasculature is observed. Activated pericytes characterized by expression of α-smooth muscle actin are located adjacent to the telacyte attachment to the vasculature. In this location, endothelial expression of sonic hedgehog parallels expression of notch-1 by pericytes. The angiogenic response is initiated by pericyte contraction and altered endothelial polarity and proliferation leading to intussusception of endothelial cells and extensive remodeling of basement membrane with upregulation of laminin-8 and laminin-5. These responses guide intravascular loop formation that maintains both intact basement membrane and tight junctions. This initial phase is followed by formation of anastomoses that enhance the hemodynamic capacity of the intravascular loops. The formation of anastomoses is mediated by extension of cytonemes from pericytes guided by MHC-II+/CD-163+ microglia aligned with the telacytes. The cytonemes seek out pericytes on adjacent intravascular loops to initiate migration of endothelial cells. These findings support a new paradigm for understanding angiogenic capacity of neurosensory structures and aberrations of this response manifest as neurovasculopathies. J. Comp.

AB  - Abstract Electrophysiological methods have been practised in ophthalmology for many years. In 1992 Sutter and Tran introduced the multifocal technique, which enables the recording of electrical currents derived from very localized parts of the retina. Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) has been used in animal studies, mostly in rodents and non-human primates, but also in pigs. However, the latter has been performed without the use of retinal photographic monitoring during mfERG recording, thus rendering an exact correlation with specific retinal changes impossible. By modifying the experimental set-up, as well as the settings of the mfERG software, reproducible recordings on anaesthetized pigs were obtained during continuous photographic monitoring of the fundus area. The mfERG response obtained from the porcine retina was characterized by the same three amplitude deflections as described in studies on human retinas: N1, P1 and N2. Multifocal ERG responses derived from within the visual streak of the porcine retina were characterized by significantly faster implicit times and higher amplitudes for all three peaks, compared with responses derived from within the inferior, less cone-rich part of the retina. The spatial resolution of the developed mfERG protocol enables the detection of retinal areas of reduced functionality of a size ≥?1.2?mm. In the acute and late phases, significant reductions in all peak amplitudes were observed after retinal laser photocoagulation. Implicit times were less influenced by the treatment. This corresponded with marked central tissue destruction found histologically. The following surgical procedures necessitate surgical access to the subretinal space: vitrectomy; retinal detachment bleb formation; retinal diathermia, and retinotomy. Extending the size of these interventions, which is necessary if subsequent surgery is to be carried out in the subretinal space, caused a statistically non-significant tendency towards reduced amplitudes within the first postoperative week. Only retinal diathermia significantly prolonged the implicit time of one peak (N1) after 1?week of observation. The functional consequences of the surgical procedures were all found to cause reversible changes in the mfERG within a 6-week observation period. Thus, these findings indicate that in experimental subretinal surgery on pigs, any mfERG change found 6?weeks postoperatively could be attributed to factors other than surgical access to the subretinal space. This renders the described animal model and mfERG-protocol applicable in future experiments regarding pathology, treatment, surgery and stem cell transplantation in the retina as well as in the subretinal space of the porcine eye.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: A systematic review identified randomised and other trials (1966?2006) of studies of occlusal design of crowns, complete (CRP) and partial (PRP) removable prostheses and implant-borne reconstructions, and whether occlusal design influenced diet, quality of life, bruxism and attrition. Methods: The search primarily included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Ovid Medline and PreMedline. Results: The search yielded 1315 studies: 20 on CRP ? 1 RCT, one systematic review, four clinical trials, 10 case series; 22 on PRP ? one cohort study, two experimental studies, 15 case reports or case series, three clinical trials; 23 on implant superstructures, and 24 reports on implant failure, 37 on oral health related quality of life, eight on attrition; and four studies on masticatory function. Conclusions: CRP ? Studies of occlusal form and tooth arrangements, included balanced, lingualised and monoplane arrangements ? lingualised posterior occlusion was preferred. Early studies on CRP design were observational as case reports, however data suggested that optimum function is achieved by modification of the maxillary occlusion, irrespective of the opposing mandibular occlusion. PRP ? Edentulous ridge resorption is patient-specific, has a multifactorial aetiology and there is no objective data to confirm that mechanical factors cause bone loss; oral hygiene management is crucial for long-term health. Studies on distal extension PDs confirmed a link between bite force and masticatory function; preservation of two functioning posterior tooth units ipsilateral to the distal extension optimises function. Data indicate that patient-specific factors, rather than PD design-specific features, influence long-term PD outcomes. Implant superstructures ? There is little scientific evidence specifying occlusal and superstructure design for fixed prostheses for teeth or implants. Occlusal scheme design and occlusal form have evolved through clinical experience, but there is no evidence to indicate that a particular design is superior. Complex neurophysiological mechanisms allow the jaw muscle system to accommodate to oral and dental changes.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - Background and Purpose:? Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in plasma rises by ultrafiltration during hemodialysis, and it consequently causes plasma refilling in which water moves from interstitial tissue to capillary space. Although hemodynamic stability is one of the important factors for good dialysis outcome, no informative and convenient indicators are available other than monitoring of blood pressure. Thus, we measured COP during hemodialysis whether COP can be used as an indicator for the hemodynamic status in comparison with hematocrit (Ht). Plasma osmolality, ultrafiltration volume, and the alteration of blood pressure were also measured to examine whether COP is associated with them. Method:? Sixteen patients hospitalized in this hospital were examined. Amongst them, 10 patients underwent both dialysis and ultrafiltration, while 4 patients received only dialysis and 2 patients were with ultrafiltration only by extracorporeal ultrafiltration method. Ultrafiltration was performed with constant speed to the dry weight for 4?h. The measurements of COP, plasma osmolality, Ht levels, and blood pressure were performed at 30?min (12.5% of the total water removal), 1?h (25%), 2?h (50%), and 3?h (75%) after the start of hemodialysis and also at the end of dialysis (100%). Result:? COP markedly rose by 26.0% (±13.3%) in the patients who received both dialysis and ultrafiltration, whereas Ht rose by only 13.6% (±5.21%). And the curve for COP increase was sigmoid shape, whereas that for Ht showed linear change. On the other hand, in the patients whose Ht levels showed low values, the curves for both COP and Ht showed similar pattern. Conclusion:? These results suggest that COP is a more sensitive indicator to be monitored for the hemodynamic status than Ht during hemodialysis.

AB  - The ultrastructure of the barrier to water and solute exchange between blood and a synovial cavity was studied morphometrically in five rabbit knees. The synovial surface consisted of 80% synoviocytes and 20% interstitium in direct contact with synovial fluid. The surface intercellular gaps were wide (0·1?5·5 µm). A rich network of capillaries lay just beneath the surface, the commonest (modal) depth of the capillary perimeter being 5 µm at its nearest point. Of these capillaries, 91% were fenestrated in adipose synovium, 44% in areolar synovium and 21% in posterior synovium; the remainder were continuous capillaries. The number of fenestrae per fenestrated capillary was low (?0·5 µm?1, circumference: ?6 µm?2). The fenestrae (width 52 nm; membrane thickness 3?4 nm) occupied ?1% of the fenestrated endothelial surface-area. Nuclear segments and intercellular junctions were roughly twice as frequent in continuous capillaries as in fenestrated capillaries of the same circumference, indicating that continuous endothelial cells are of smaller surface area than fenestrated cells. The basement membranes of continuous and fenestrated synovial capillaries were relatively thick (98 and 110 nm respectively), perhaps supporting the synovial endothelium during joint motion. In both fenestrated and continuous capillaries the nuclei were preferentially oriented away from the synovial surface (92 and 67% respectively), which presumably facilitates exchange with the surface.

AB  - During the last decade, the number of patients starting renal replacement therapy has increased for all ages, but the increase for patients over 65 years old has been particularly dramatic. Objective:? The aim of our study was the analysis of the outcome of all the patients who were over 65 years of age at the time they started chronic hemodialysis, in our Center (n, 52). Methods:? A total of 76 patients were treated by the chronic hemodialysis program of 251 Hellenic Air Force and VA General Hospital, between 1992 and 2002, while totally 309 patients were offered dialysis at this time. We found that 52 of them (68.4%) were over 65 years old [40 male (76.9%), 12 female (23.1%)]. Results:? Elderly patients manifest more often intradialytic complications, such as hypotensive episodes (28.8%) and arrhythmias (23.1%), due to their hemodynamic instability. Polypharmacy is a big deal for dialysis patients, especially elderly ones. Each patient was taking 9.1 PO and 1.9 IV medications on average, per day. Most of them (84.6%) required recombinant human erythropoietin. The most common co-morbid factors we observed in this population were cardiovascular diseases (36.5%), neurological problems, respiratory failure, bone disease, malignancy (17.3%), depression, malnutrition, and infections (30.8%). Deaths were often associated with more than one morbid factors. Survival and the quality of life in the elderly patients on hemodialysis are frequently acceptable. The 1, 3 and 5-year patient survival rates during 1990?2000 were 63.4%, 56.1%, and 26.8%. Conclusion:? We believe that if there are no extracontraindications, elderly patients can benefit from hemodialysis, taking into consideration that we should adapt the therapy to the geriatric special needs.

AB  - The increase in number of obese people seen in the general population, is also what is seen in the hemodialyzed population. It is generally believed that the location of deep forearm vessels in the subcutaneous fat tissue makes primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) a disadvantage because of difficulties in vessel puncturing. For obese patients, it is suggested that a fistula with PTFE is created or a central catheter inserted, but these solutions increase already high morbidity rate and significantly increase mortality rate. Methods:?The deep location of veins situated on the anterior part of the forearm involved 57 patients (45 female and 12 male) aged 13?87 years (mean 67?±?15.2 years). Patients? body mass index (BMI) ranged from 29.1 to 53.73 (mean 34.6?±?7.8). The causes of the renal failure were diabetic nephropathy in 30 patients, chronic glomerulonephritis in 4, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 5, lupus nephritis in 2, interstitial nephritis in 4, primary amyloidosis in 1, polycystic kidney disease in 3, and unknown in 3 patients.Two-step surgical procedure was performed in all patients. In the first stage, the standard distal radiocephalic AVF in the wrist region was created. In case of its failure, the next attempt was performed above the point of the first intervention. In the second stage, superficialization of the venous part of AVF was performed in the mode described by us (Kidney 2002;.1:1170). Results:?The first stage of the procedure was successful in 46 patients. In 6 cases it was necessary to perform a second attempt, and 2 cases required three operations. The second stage was undertaken in all of these patients (n?=?54), and complete success was achieved in 51. In 3 cases, in spite of superficialization, AVF was not suitable for puncturing because of poor blood flow. The causes of failure of the first stage procedure in 2 patients were severe arteriosclerosis and venous anomaly. All patients had non-altered cephalic veins in the wrist region, as opposed to patients with cannulated veins. In 51?pts (90%) an efficient flow of the blood through AVF was successfully obtained and allowed satisfactory dialyses. Conclusions:?The primary AVF creation on the forearm is feasible in 90% of obese patients. This result is similar to the general population of chronic renal disease patients of our center (95%)(NDT 1998;13:527) and is possible thanks to the location of the veins deep in the subcutaneous fat tissue, which protects against repeated cannulation and hence mechanical destruction in the pre-dialysis period.
