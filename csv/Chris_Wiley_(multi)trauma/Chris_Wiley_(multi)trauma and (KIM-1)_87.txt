AB  - Background One-stage reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects of the extremities is a challenging problem. Repair of complex soft tissue defects requires adequate skin tissues to cover the large surface wound and special tissues for obliterating the dead space. The chimeric flap is one of the most popular approaches for reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects. However, the problems of donor-site morbidity and inability to repair very large defects at one-stage remain. The purpose of this study was to present our clinical experience using sequential chimeric perforator flaps for reconstruction of complex extremity defects with primary closure of the donor site. Methods From August 2013 to March 2017, 12 patients with complex soft tissue defects underwent extremity reconstruction using sequential chimeric perforator flaps, which were composed of a chimeric anterolateral thigh perforator (ALTP) flap and an additional free perforator flap. The skin paddles were placed side-by-side to cover the large surface soft tissue defects, and the muscle component was used to obliterate the dead space. Of these patients, one was injured by a crushing accident, while the other 11 patients were injured in traffic accidents. Results The size of the skin paddles ranged from 26?cm???8 cm?10 cm???6 cm to 30?cm???8.5 cm?29?cm???9 cm. The muscle paddle size ranged from 2 cm???3 cm???4 cm to 22?cm???4 cm???2 cm. All-components of the sequential chimeric flaps survived in all-patients. Vascular compromise was observed in one case. One case suffered minor wound-edge necrosis and was treated conservatively. Primary closure of donor-site was successfully achieved in all-patients, and all-donor-site wounds healed uneventfully. The mean follow-up time was 15.25?months. Most of the cases showed a satisfactory contour, and only two patients presented with mildly bulky appearance that treated with a debulking procedure. Conclusions The sequential chimeric perforator flap is an alternative procedure for reconstruct complex soft tissue defects of the extremities. This approach allows for flexible design, a larger cutaneous area, and low donor site morbidity.

AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Aim Previous research indicates that preventive intervention is likely to benefit patients ?at risk? of psychosis, in terms of functional improvement, symptom reduction and delay or prevention of onset of threshold psychotic disorder. The primary aim of the current study is to test outcomes of ultra high risk (UHR) patients, primarily functional outcome, in response to a sequential intervention strategy consisting of support and problem solving (SPS), cognitive-behavioural case management and antidepressant medication. A secondary aim is to test biological and psychological variables that moderate and mediate response to this sequential treatment strategy. Methods This is a sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART) consisting of three steps: Step 1: SPS (1.5 months); Step 2: SPS vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management (4.5 months); Step 3: Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Antidepressant Medication vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Placebo (6 months). The intervention is of 12 months duration in total and participants will be followed up at 18 months and 24 months post baseline. Conclusion This paper reports on the rationale and protocol of the Staged Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP) study. With a large sample of 500 UHR participants this study will investigate the most effective type and sequence of treatments for improving functioning and reducing the risk of developing psychotic disorder in this clinical population.

AB  - Objective To provide a strategic framework for the prevention of bipolar disorder (BD) that incorporates a ?Big Data? approach to risk assessment for BD. Methods Computerized databases (e.g., Pubmed, PsychInfo, and MedlinePlus) were used to access English-language articles published between 1966 and 2012 with the search terms bipolar disorder, prodrome, ?Big Data?, and biomarkers cross-referenced with genomics/genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, inflammation, oxidative stress, neurotrophic factors, cytokines, cognition, neurocognition, and neuroimaging. Papers were selected from the initial search if the primary outcome(s) of interest was (were) categorized in any of the following domains: (i) ?omics? (e.g., genomics), (ii) molecular, (iii) neuroimaging, and (iv) neurocognitive. Results The current strategic approach to identifying individuals at risk for BD, with an emphasis on phenotypic information and family history, has insufficient predictive validity and is clinically inadequate. The heterogeneous clinical presentation of BD, as well as its pathoetiological complexity, suggests that it is unlikely that a single biomarker (or an exclusive biomarker approach) will sufficiently augment currently inadequate phenotypic-centric prediction models. We propose a ?Big Data?- bioinformatics approach that integrates vast and complex phenotypic, anamnestic, behavioral, family, and personal ?omics? profiling. Bioinformatic processing approaches, utilizing cloud- and grid-enabled computing, are now capable of analyzing data on the order of tera-, peta-, and exabytes, providing hitherto unheard of opportunities to fundamentally revolutionize how psychiatric disorders are predicted, prevented, and treated. High-throughput networks dedicated to research on, and the treatment of, BD, integrating both adult and younger populations, will be essential to sufficiently enroll adequate samples of individuals across the neurodevelopmental trajectory in studies to enable the characterization and prevention of this heterogeneous disorder. Conclusions Advances in bioinformatics using a ?Big Data? approach provide an opportunity for novel insights regarding the pathoetiology of BD. The coordinated integration of research centers, inclusive of mixed-age populations, is a promising strategic direction for advancing this line of neuropsychiatric research.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2011) 17, 241?251 The rapid advancement in basic biology knowledge, especially in the stem cell field, has created new opportunities to develop biomaterials capable of orchestrating the behavior of transplanted and host cells. Based on our current understanding of cellular differentiation, a conceptual framework for the use of materials to program cells in situ is presented, namely a domino vs a switchboard model, to highlight the use of single vs multiple cues in a controlled manner to modulate biological processes. Further, specific design principles of material systems to present soluble and insoluble cues that are capable of recruiting, programming and deploying host cells for various applications are presented. The evolution of biomaterials from simple inert substances used to fill defects, to the recent development of sophisticated material systems capable of programming cells in situ is providing a platform to translate our understanding of basic biological mechanisms to clinical care.

AB  - Summary Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the anatomic loss of intestine. This can be congenital in origin via intestinal atresia, or acquired via massive enterectomy or multiple resections for a variety of vascular and non-vascular reasons. Some patients will be able to retain their nutritional autonomy, while others will require varying degrees and duration of specialized nutritional support because of intestinal failure. Treatment of these patients revolves around the correction and prevention of macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance via control of dietary and other enteral as well as parenteral intake, and control of fluid losses. Individualized and tailored nutritional management for patients with SBS helps to optimize intestinal absorption, leading to nutritional independence such that a patient can resume as normal a lifestyle as possible. Complications may develop however, from either SBS or its therapy. Some of these may be life-threatening and will lead to the need for isolated intestine, intestine/liver, or multivisceral transplantation. Otherwise, surgical management includes anastomosis of residual colon to residual small intestine in order to utilize carbohydrate salvage for enhanced nutrient and fluid assimilation, and intestinal tapering procedures for dilated, nonfunctional intestinal segments.

AB  - The Dutch government has recently taken initiatives to improve the protection of labourers against diseases which are related to their work, and most especially, to reduce the rapidly increasing number of patients who have to definitely stop working and who, eventually, end up being dependent on social welfare. Firstly, a number of new laws have been adopted which define the responsibilities of both the employers and the employees. Secondly the cooperation is stimulated between the Dermatologist and the Occupational Health Physician of the patient. The latter is (according to law) employed by the employer of the patient and regularly visits the place of work. We now had the opportunity to treat and study both the social, medical and occupational aspects of a patient?s case simultaneously. We decided to eliminate the existing hesitation of consulting or referring, as well as the barriers created by matters of procedure, bureaucracy and waiting lists. In our paper we discuss the above-mentioned laws and regulations, and the way in which cooperation takes place between the doctors. We will present figures showing the effects of this approach on sickleave.
