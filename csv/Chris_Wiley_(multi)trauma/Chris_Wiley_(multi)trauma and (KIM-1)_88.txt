AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Chronic alcohol-dependent patients have reduced brain volumes and concomitant neurobehavioral deficits that may recover during abstinence. In 10 chronic alcoholic patients, using localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found reliable increases during the first 3?4 weeks of abstinence in the concentrations within the superior cerebellar vermis of choline (Cho)-containing compounds relative to the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Lesser changes were observed following 1 month of abstinence, and in one of the patients studied longitudinally over 3 months, a marked reduction in the Cho/NAA ratio was associated with relapse. After detoxification, the Cho/NAA ratio correlated with a composite clinical impression of brain functions. The lowest Cho/NAA was observed in a patient with persisting alcoholic dementia, in striking contrast to reduced relative concentrations of NAA reported in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Possible molecular explanations for these brain metabolic changes are discussed.

AB  - Abstract The Disrupted in Schizophrenia Gene 1 (DISC1) plays a role in both neural signaling and development and is associated with schizophrenia, although its links to altered brain structure and function in this disorder are not fully established. Here we have used structural and functional MRI to investigate links with six DISC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We employed a brain-wide association analysis (BWAS) together with a Jacknife internal validation approach in 46 schizophrenia patients and 24 matched healthy control subjects. Results from structural MRI showed significant associations between all six DISC1 variants and gray matter volume in the precuneus, post-central gyrus and middle cingulate gyrus. Associations with specific SNPs were found for rs2738880 in the left precuneus and right post-central gyrus, and rs1535530 in the right precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus. Using regions showing structural associations as seeds a resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed significant associations between all 6 SNPS and connectivity between the right precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus. The connection between the right precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus was also specifically associated with rs821617. Importantly schizophrenia patients showed positive correlations between the six DISC-1 SNPs associated gray matter volume in the left precuneus and right post-central gyrus and negative symptom severity. No correlations with illness duration were found. Our results provide the first evidence suggesting a key role for structural and functional connectivity associations between DISC1 polymorphisms and the precuneus in schizophrenia.

AB  - Dry eye conditions are prevalent with one in four to five patients presenting to eye care practitioners having dry eye signs and/or symptoms. An intimate relationship exists between the ocular surface and the tear film. The cycle of tear film instability and ocular surface damage characteristic of dry eye conditions suggests that dry eye represents a dysfunction of an integrated ocular surface-lacrimal gland unit. Therefore, dry eye is a multifactorial condition and an approach based on clinical subtypes is required for diagnosis and management. There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a contributing and exacerbating factor in dry eye conditions and anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for chronic dry eye conditions may facilitate ocular surface healing. Other promising new treatments for dry eye include new generation artificial tear polymers and preservative systems, secretagogues, topical androgen supplements and surgical techniques for ocular surface reconstruction.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering of corporal tissue is a new development in otherwise untreatable erectile dysfunction and in urethral reconstructions to treat hypospadias or severe urethral stricture disease. Multiple complications can arise with the current treatments, whereas engineered tissue, if well vascularized and existing of autologous cells, may lead to better results. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of literature on cell-seeded-based tissue engineering of corporal penile tissue. A literature search was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Papers describing cell-seeded tissue engineering of corporal tissue were included. Studies using different techniques, such as intracavernous injection were excluded. Fifteen articles were included in the review. Twelve of these studies described engineering of the corpus cavernosum in animal models. Two articles were found on engineering of animal corpus spongiosum and one article on engineering of the human glans. Both synthetic scaffolds and biological scaffolds were used. The advantage of a biological, acellular scaffold was that the native, complex architecture of corporal tissue was maintained. Most studies used endothelial and smooth muscle cells from corporal origin, but stem cells were also investigated. Furthermore, dynamic culturing achieved an improved cell content and functionality. This review has summarized the developments in tissue engineering of corpus cavernosum and spongiosum tissue. Functional tissue has been developed in animal studies with the use of seeded cells on scaffolds. This knowledge will form a basis for the development of tissue engineering of corporal tissue for clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the safety and efficacy between using a small-diameter tube-assisted bronchoscopic balloon dilatation (BBD) and the traditional BBD in the treatment of benign tracheal stenosis. Methods A retrospective study included 58 patients with benign tracheal stenosis from August 2009 to December 2014 was made. The patients who underwent traditional BBD were divided into group A, and who underwent a small-diameter tube-assisted BBD were divided into group B. The tracheal diameter, dyspnea index and blood gas analysis results were detected before and after BBD. Efficacy and complications were evaluated after BBD. Results There were significant differences in oxygen saturation (PaO2) during the operations comparing with before and after operations in group A (P?=?.005), while there was no significant difference in group B (P?=?.079). The tracheal diameter obviously increased (in group A, from 4.16?±?1.43 mm to 12.47?±?1.41 mm, P?=?.000; in group B: from 4.94?±?1.59 mm to 12.61?±?1.41 mm, P?=?.000). Dyspnea index obviously decreased (group A: from 3.21?±?0.93 to 0.50?±?0.59, P?=?.000; group B: from 3.24?±?0.89 to 0.65?±?0.69, P?=?.000). The immediately cure rate in both groups was 100%. Long-term effect was significantly better in group B than that in group A (85.3% vs 59.1%, P?=?.021), at the end of the follow-up period. Conclusions Small-diameter tube-assisted BBD obtains better safety and long-term efficacy than the traditional BBD in the treatment of benign tracheal stenosis. However, close attention should be given to the risk of the adverse effects caused by carbon dioxide retention.
