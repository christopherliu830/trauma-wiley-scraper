AB  - Abstract The brain is unquestionably the most fascinating organ, and the hippocampus is crucial in memory storage and retrieval and plays an important role in stress response. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the seizure origin typically involves the hippocampal formation. Despite tremendous progress, current knowledge falls short of being able to explain its function. An emerging approach toward an improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie functions of the brain and hippocampus is neuroproteomics. Mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze biological samples, and has evolved into an indispensable tool for proteomics research. In this review, we present a general overview of the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics, summarize neuroproteomics and systems biology-based discovery of protein biomarkers for epilepsy, discuss the methodology needed to explore the epileptic hippocampus proteome, and also focus on applications of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in disease research. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in epilepsy that can be applied for immediate epileptic biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of the protein regulatory networks. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of epilepsy on society. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 29:197?246, 2010

AB  - Abstract Aim? To describe the usefulness of periosteal grafts as barriers for bone regeneration in periradicular surgery when advanced periodontal breakdown occurs. Summary? The treatment of advanced periodontal breakdown as a result of an associated endodontic lesion constitutes a multifaceted challenge to the clinician. If the source of the irritation cannot be removed by orthograde endodontic treatment, nonsurgical and surgical endodontic/periodontal intervention may be required. Two cases with suppurative chronic apical periodontitis with apicomarginal communication are described. Clinical and radiological evaluations were completed immediately prior to surgery, a week later and every 2 months after surgery for 10?months. Both patients were treated using split-thickness flaps and lateral displacement of the periosteum prior to suturing, in order to close the communication between the oral and the periapical surroundings. A remission of the clinical signs and symptoms, and successful healing in the short-term were achieved in these cases. Key learning points? ? Periapical and periodontal lesions are closely related through pathways of communication. ? Disruption of the cortical plate and the presence of dentoalveolar sinus tracts can have a deleterious effect on the regeneration process after periradicular surgery. ? The adoption of supplementary periodontal surgical techniques may help to solve some of the difficulties in the healing process in periradicular surgery. ? Periosteal grafts have been shown to have the potential to stimulate bone formation when used as a graft material.

AB  - Abstract Organotypic explants of neonatal mouse cerebellum were cultured for periods up to 56 days in vitro. Living cultures were compared to those fixed and stained by the Holmes' reduced silver nitrate method. The explants consist of a heterologous neuronal population comparable to that found in situ. Since the differentiation of the cerebellum is actively in progress during the neonatal and postnatal periods, cultures derived from such tissue demonstrate the developmental phases that are present at the time of explantation. The in vitro. maintenance of neonatal mouse cerebellum allows the expression of those aspects of neuronal development which are intrinsic to the cell proper and primarily concerned with type-specific differentiation, e.g., neurofibrillary development; axonal growth; myelination; and the acquiring of basic dendritic patterns. The secondary aspects of differentiation, which determine the adult state and which are characterized primarily by the increasing complexity of dendritic formation and of synaptic interactions, occur to a much lesser extent in vitro. The importance of recognizing transitional forms as normal and not peculiar to the in vitro situation is emphasized.

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Abstract The ideological foundations of the Korean War lie in the pre-1945 era, in the evolution of diverse and divisive strands of Korean nationalism, efforts by Koreans to eliminate Japanese colonial rule from the Korean Peninsula, the impact of the Russian Revolution on Asia, and the influence of Christianity and ideas of constitutional governance on Koreans. The conjunction of forces that led to the Korean conflict, however, were rooted in the immediate post-World War II era, in Soviet and American objectives toward Korea, the global beginnings of the Cold War, and the creation and consolidation of two rival Korean regimes.

AB  - Abstract Aim and objective? To evaluate the validity of study outcomes of published papers that report the effects of clinical pathways (CP). Method? Systematic review based on two search strategies, including searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Psychinfo and Picarta from 1995 till 2005 and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. We included randomized controlled or quasi-experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of clinical pathway application. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies included randomization, power analysis, selection bias, validity of outcome indicators, appropriateness of statistical tests, direct (matching) and indirect (statistical) control for confounders. Outcomes included length of stay, costs, readmission rate and complications. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected papers and recorded the findings with an evaluation tool developed from a set of items for quality assessment derived from the Cochrane Library and other publications. Results? The study sample comprised of 115 publications. A total of 91.3% of the studies comprised of retrospective studies and 8.7% were randomized controlled studies. Using a quality-scoring assessment tool, 33% of the papers were classified as of good quality, whereas 67% were classified as of low quality. Of the studies, 10.4% controlled for confounding by matching and 59.1% adopted parametric statistical tests without testing variables on normal distribution. Differences in outcomes were not always statistically tested. Conclusion? Readers should be cautious when interpreting the results of clinical pathway evaluation studies because of the confounding factors and sources of contamination affecting the evidence-based validity of the outcomes.
