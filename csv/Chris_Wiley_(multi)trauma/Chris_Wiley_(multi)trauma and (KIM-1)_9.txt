AB  - Abstract Second generation hemoglobin-based O2 carriers (HBOCs) are being developed with high O2 affinity (low P50) in order to suppress vasoconstriction elicited by over-oxygenating tissues, a problem associated with low O2 affinity first generation HBOCs. Our group has previously investigated the polymerization of hemoglobin (Hb) with dialdehydes as a strategy for engineering high O2 affinity HBOCs. In this study, two novel reactive dialdehydes were synthesized by ring-opening 2-chloroethyl-?-D-fructopyranoside (2-CEFP) and 1-o-octyl-?-D-glucopyranoside (1-OGP) at the 1,2-diol position, respectively, to yield novel Hb polymerizing reagents. High-affinity polymerized HBOCs were synthesized by reacting R-state bovine hemoglobin (bHb) with ring-opened 2-CEFP and 1-OGP at cross-linker to bHb molar ratios ranging from 10:1 to 30:1. The resulting polymerized bovine HBOCs (bHBOCs) displayed P50s ranging from 7 to 18 mmHg, cooperativities ranging from 0.8 to 1.4, and methemoglobin (metHb) levels ranging from 3% to 10%. The cross-linking reaction also stabilized the third stepwise Adair coefficient for bHbs reacted with ring-opened 1-OGP at cross-linker to bHb molar ratios of 20:1 and 30:1 and for bHbs reacted with ring-opened 2-CEFP at molar ratios of 30:1. Additionally, the number-averaged molecular weight, Mn, of each polymerized bHBOC was larger compared to bHb. Molecular weight distributions leaning towards larger molecular weight bHBOCs were obtained by increasing the cross-linker to bHb molar ratio. Taken together, the results of this study have identified novel Hb polymerization reagents that are easy to synthesize, and that are capable of yielding bHBOCs with higher O2 affinities and weight-averaged molecular weights compared to bHb.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Asynchronous e-learning allows for targeted teaching, particularly advantageous when bedside and didactic education is insufficient. An asynchronous e-learning curriculum has not been studied across multiple centers in the context of a clinical rotation. We hypothesize that an asynchronous e-learning curriculum during the pediatric emergency medicine (EM) rotation improves medical knowledge among residents and students across multiple participating centers. Methods Trainees on pediatric EM rotations at four large pediatric centers from 2012 to 2013 were randomized in a Solomon four-group design. The experimental arms received an asynchronous e-learning curriculum consisting of nine Web-based, interactive, peer-reviewed Flash/HTML5 modules. Postrotation testing and in-training examination (ITE) scores quantified improvements in knowledge. A 2 ? 2 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tested interaction and main effects, and Pearson's correlation tested associations between module usage, scores, and ITE scores. Results A total of 256 of 458 participants completed all study elements; 104 had access to asynchronous e-learning modules, and 152 were controls who used the current education standards. No pretest sensitization was found (p = 0.75). Use of asynchronous e-learning modules was associated with an improvement in posttest scores (p < 0.001), from a mean score of 18.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.92 to 18.98) to 21.30 (95% CI = 20.69 to 21.91), a large effect (partial ?2 = 0.19). Posttest scores correlated with ITE scores (r2 = 0.14, p < 0.001) among pediatric residents. Conclusions Asynchronous e-learning is an effective educational tool to improve knowledge in a clinical rotation. Web-based asynchronous e-learning is a promising modality to standardize education among multiple institutions with common curricula, particularly in clinical rotations where scheduling difficulties, seasonality, and variable experiences limit in-hospital learning.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Abstract Deuterium and fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been employed for quantification of regional blood flow in concert with nonradiative, exogenous, freely diffusible tracers such as D2O and freon gas. Typically, the tracer residue washout was monitored by NMR over time following tracer administration by bolus injection or inhalation. The theory, including compartmental analysis, required to quantitatively derive volumetric tissue blood flow and perfusion is reviewed herein. Applications of NMR tissue blood flow measurement techniques to tumor, muscle, liver, and brain are presented with discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of NMR methods. ? 1990 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)
