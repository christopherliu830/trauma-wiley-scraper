AB  - Abstract: Inequalities in human social groups contribute in important ways to the initiation and perpetuation of violence. Because both social inequalities and interpersonal aggression emerge in early life, it is important to study their developmental origins in the collective and individual behavior of young children. As young as 2 years of age, children assemble stable, linearly transitive dominance hierarchies when brought together in novel social groups. Just as the consequences of socioeconomic status may be due in part to experiences of social ordering per se, subjective childhood experiences of occupying a lesser or greater position on a scale of social influence may similarly affect health, safety, and behavior in early development. Children's experiences with social ordering may represent a first, formative encounter with the hierarchical social relations that affect health and susceptibility to violence over the human lifespan. We have studied the health correlates of group stressors, dominance positions, and biobehavioral reactivity within cohorts of preschool children and semi free-ranging rhesus macaques. Social position is ascertained using naturalistic observations of critical dyadic events, and stress-reactivity is measured using assessments of behavioral and biological responses to standardized challenges. Outcome measures, including indicators of mental and physical health and interpersonal injuries, have been assessed?in the case of children?with parent- and teacher-report questionnaires, child self-report protocols, and frequent, objective physical examinations of the child and?in the case of rhesus monkeys?with daily observations of violence-related injuries. Results to date have suggested the following provisional conclusions: (1) Children and monkeys form stable, linearly transitive social hierarchies in which identifiable subgroups of individuals occupy dominant and subordinate social positions. (2) Individuals occupying subordinate positions within the social group show exaggerated adrenocortical and/or autonomic reactivity to challenge and disproportionate rates of chronic medical conditions or violent injuries. (3) Stress-reactivity, naturally occurring stressors, and social position are interactively predictive of rates of morbidity. Monkeys who displayed high biobehavioral reactivity sustained disproportionate numbers of violent injuries during a confinement stressor. Children who were high in the dominance hierarchy and low in reactivity showed significantly higher rates of externalizing mental health symptoms, while those who were in subordinate social positions and high in reactivity showed higher prevalences of internalizing symptoms. In conclusion, the prevention of youth violence?and other forms of early disorder?will require a deeper, developmental understanding of the ?headwaters? of aggression and victimization in early childhood and a stronger accounting of how early social inequalities set trajectories toward healthy or disordered behavior.

AB  - Abstract Aim and objective? To evaluate the validity of study outcomes of published papers that report the effects of clinical pathways (CP). Method? Systematic review based on two search strategies, including searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Psychinfo and Picarta from 1995 till 2005 and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. We included randomized controlled or quasi-experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of clinical pathway application. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies included randomization, power analysis, selection bias, validity of outcome indicators, appropriateness of statistical tests, direct (matching) and indirect (statistical) control for confounders. Outcomes included length of stay, costs, readmission rate and complications. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected papers and recorded the findings with an evaluation tool developed from a set of items for quality assessment derived from the Cochrane Library and other publications. Results? The study sample comprised of 115 publications. A total of 91.3% of the studies comprised of retrospective studies and 8.7% were randomized controlled studies. Using a quality-scoring assessment tool, 33% of the papers were classified as of good quality, whereas 67% were classified as of low quality. Of the studies, 10.4% controlled for confounding by matching and 59.1% adopted parametric statistical tests without testing variables on normal distribution. Differences in outcomes were not always statistically tested. Conclusion? Readers should be cautious when interpreting the results of clinical pathway evaluation studies because of the confounding factors and sources of contamination affecting the evidence-based validity of the outcomes.

AB  - Abstract In this paper, we address the issue of whether it is economically advantageous to concentrate emergency rooms (ERs) in large hospitals. Besides identifying economies of scale of ERs, we also focus on chain economies. The latter term refers to the effects on a hospital's costs of ER patients who also need follow-up inpatient or outpatient hospital care. We show that, for each service examined, product-specific economies of scale prevail indicating that it would be beneficial for hospitals to increase ER services. However, this seems to be inconsistent with the overall diseconomies of scale for the hospital as a whole. This intuitively contradictory result is indicated as the economies of scale paradox. This scale paradox also explains why, in general, hospitals are too large. There are internal (departmental) pressures to expand certain services, such as ER, in order to benefit from the product-specific economies of scale. However, the financial burden of this expansion is borne by the hospital as a whole. The policy implications of the results are that concentrating ERs seems to be advantageous from a product-specific perspective, but is far less advantageous from the hospital perspective. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Background:? This investigation addresses whether there are differences in the form and content of autobiographical memory recall as a function of maltreatment, and examines the roles of self-system functioning and psychopathology in autobiographical memory processes. Methods:? Autobiographical memory for positive and negative nontraumatic events was evaluated among abused, neglected, and nonmaltreated school-aged children. Results:? Abused children?s memories were more overgeneral and contained more negative self-representations than did those of the nonmaltreated children. Negative self-representations and depression were significantly related to overgeneral memory, but did not mediate the relation between abuse and overgeneral memory. Conclusions:? The meaning of these findings for models of memory and for the development of overgenerality is emphasized. Moreover, the clinical implications of the current research are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective This study investigated the effects of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) transplantation combined with low dose ultrashortwave (USW) radiation on functional recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n?=?64) were randomly divided into five groups: sham-operated, as well as control, USW, BMSCs, and BMSCs?+?USW that were subjected to spinal cord contusion. BMSCs were transplanted into rats in the BMSCs and BMSCs+USW groups, while those in the USW and BMSCs?+?USW were exposed to radiation; Basso?Beattie?Bresnahan (BBB) tests were performed before the operation and at 1-week intervals after SCI for 7 weeks. 7 weeks later, animals were assessed footprint pattern, motor evoked potential (MEP), histological features, and expression of the ED1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), markers of activated macrophages and astrocytes, respectively, in the lesion area. BBB scores were higher in the BMSCs?+?USW than in the BMSCs and control groups. The USW and BMSCs?+?USW groups had improved coordination compared to the BMSCs and control groups (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively, vs. control). BMSCs?+?USW rats had a lower ratio of lesion/cavity to spinal cord area than the other injured rats, and also had expression of GFAP in transplanted BMSCs. All treatment groups had lower ED1 expression and MEP latency than the controls (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively). The results indicate that BMSCs transplantation combined with USW radiation is more effective than either treatment alone in promoting functional recovery after SCI, possibly due to concomitant suppression of inflammation and spinal cord repair.

AB  - Objectives To review available information regarding in-office procedures for benign vocal fold lesions (BVFL). Methods PubMed term search on office/awake laryngeal procedures for any of the following specific lesions: Reinke's edema (RE), polyps, nodules, varices, vocal process granuloma, and vocal fold (VF) scar. Results In-office ablative and nonablative laser procedures have been described for BVFL, including RE, polyps, varices, and granuloma. Fiber-based lasers used include potassium titanyl phosphate, pulsed dye laser, and more recently CO2. In-office intralesional steroid injection (ISI) for BVFL targets the inflammatory process involved with the lesion and may induce regression of polyps, nodules, RE, and granuloma. Botulinum toxin-induced ?voice rest? has been described as adjunctive treatment for refractory VF nodules or vocal process granuloma. Most in-office techniques for treating BVFL rely on induction of lesion regression rather than complete lesion removal, as in conventional operative microsurgery. When treating VF scarring, in-office procedures aim to alter the wound-healing process; ISI targets the inflammatory phase and angiolytic lasers target the proliferative phase. Conclusion In-office procedures for BVFL apply new technology that can potentially lower risk and cost. Although numerous case series have shown the potential of these procedures, data that thoroughly compares outcomes with those of microlaryngoscopic techniques is needed.

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.
