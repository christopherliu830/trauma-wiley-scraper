AB  - Abstract Aim The study purpose is to explore adolescent and adult women's experiences, perceptions, beliefs, knowledge and behaviours related to bladder health across the life course using a socioecological perspective. Lower urinary tract symptoms affect between 20?40% of young adult to middle-aged women, with symptoms increasing in incidence and severity with aging. There is limited evidence to address bladder health promotion and prevention of dysfunction. This first study of the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium is designed to address gaps in existing qualitative research in this area. Design This focus group study will be implemented across seven geographically diverse United States research centres using a semi-structured focus group guide informed by a conceptual framework based on the socioecological model. Methods The study was approved in July 2017. A total of 44 focus groups composed of 6?8 participants representing six different age categories (ranging from 11 to over 65 years) will be completed. We aim to recruit participants with diverse demographic and personal characteristics including race, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, physical/health conditions, and urinary symptom experience. Six of the focus groups will be conducted in Spanish and translated into English. Focus group transcripts will undergo content analysis and data interpretation to identify and classify themes and articulate emerging themes. Discussion This foundational qualitative study seeks to develop an evidence base to inform future research on bladder health promotion in adolescent and adult women. Impact This study has the potential to provide new insights and understanding into adolescent and adult women's lived experience of bladder health, the experience of lower urinary symptoms and knowledge and beliefs across the life course.

AB  - Abstract The present study aimed to test whether monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphism was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on externalizing and internalizing problems and social competence among Chinese children. Participants were 290 children and their parents in China. MAOA genotypes were ascertained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Mothers reported their parenting stress and engagement in parent?child activities when the child was 6 months old. Children's behavioral problems and social competence were rated by mothers and fathers at 48 months old. The results showed that MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal parenting stress in predicting boys' internalizing problems. Also, MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal engagement in parent?child activities in predicting boys' social competence. The analyses of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk for (a) high internalizing problems under high maternal parenting stress and (b) low social competence if mothers displayed a low level of maternal engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results suggested that the MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model among Chinese boys. Highlights We evaluated whether MAOA gene was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on behavioral problems and social competence among 4-year-old Chinese children. The results of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk of high internalizing problems or low social competence with high maternal parenting stress or low engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results indicated that MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model rather than the differential susceptibility model.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diagnosis of tibial neuropathy has been traditionally based on clinical examination and electrodiagnostic studies; however, cross-sectional imaging modalities have been used to increase the diagnostic accuracy and provide anatomic mapping of the abnormalities. In this context, magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) offers high-resolution imaging of the tibial nerve (TN), its branches and the adjacent soft tissues, and provides an objective assessment of the neuromuscular anatomy, abnormality, and the surrounding pathology. This review describes the pathologies affecting the TN and illustrates their respective 3 Tesla (T) MRN appearances with relevant case examples.

AB  - Abstract Glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis plays an important role in neurodegenerative disorders. In the process of screening for naturally occurring substances with neuroprotective effects against glutamate exitotoxicity, we have discovered that the extract from Alpinia oxyphylla, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, exhibited significant neuroprotective activity against glutamate exitotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Alpinia oxyphylla extract against glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons. After exposure of the neurons to glutamate (30 ?M), apoptotic cell death was observed as evidenced by alteration of neuronal morphology, DNA fragmentation on agarose gel and flow cytometric analysis. Co-treatment of the neurons with Alpinia oxyphylla extract (80?240 ?g/ml) in the presence of glutamate significantly elevated the cell viability, reduced the number of apoptotic cells and decreased the intensity of glutamate-induced DNA fragmentation. The results suggest the neuroprotective potential of Alpinia oxyphylla against glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Abstract Bruxism is an abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterized by jaw clenching and tooth gnashing or grinding. It is classified into two overlapping types: awake bruxism (AB) and sleep bruxism (SB). Theories on factors causing bruxism are a matter of controversy, but a line of evidence suggests that it may to some extent be linked to basal ganglia dysfunction although so far, this topic has received little attention. The purpose of this article was to review cases of bruxism reported in various movement disorders. The biomedical literature was searched for publications reporting the association of bruxism with various types of movement disorders. As a whole, very few series were found, and most papers corresponded to clinical reports. In Parkinsonian syndromes, AB was rarely reported, but seems to be exacerbated by medical treatment, whereas SB is mainly observed during non-REM sleep, as in restless leg syndrome. AB is occasionally reported in Huntington's disease, primary dystonia, and secondary dystonia; however, its highest incidence and severity is reported in syndromes combining stereotypies and cognitive impairment, such as Rett's syndrome (97%), Down syndrome (42%), and autistic spectrum disorders (32%). Taken as a whole, AB seems to be more frequent in hyperkinetic movement disorders, notably those with stereotypies, and is influenced by anxiety, suggesting an involvement of the limbic part of the basal ganglia in its pathophysiology.

AB  - SUMMARY Electron microscopy reveals that the multicellular hairs, in the Anabaena-containing leaf cavities of Azolla, produce labyrinthine wall ingrowths, and have dense cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria and abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Development of transfer cell morphology, in this location, might be an adaptation facilitating interchange of metabolites between Azolla and its algal partner. Equally prominent wall ingrowths are also found in the absence of Anabaena. It is suggested that they may be either a constitutive feature of Azolla or may be induced as a response to the presence of combined nitrogen sources in the axenic culture medium. The occurrence of plasmalemmasomes, in the developing hair-cells of Azolla, is compared with their presence in lichens, mycorrhiza and at host-parasite interfaces.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to explore a novel, short-term treatment intervention for internalizing behaviours. This intervention is primarily based upon an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas. This article addresses the clinical population of children and youth, specifically through outlining the protocol, externalizing metaphors therapy. A selective review of significant works regarding the efficacy of short-term therapy was conducted, including the process of change within narrative therapy. It is proposed that two specific processes account for the mental health change experienced by clients who receive this new treatment intervention: (1) externalization of problems and (2) purposeful client-generated metaphor manipulation, impacting upon underlying schemas. From these theoretical constructs, the present article outlines a three-session treatment protocol that manualizes these key clinical processes. A case study is presented to illustrate this intervention for anxiety and depression. Further clinical research is underway to address the testable hypotheses resulting from the current theoretical model. Clinical trials in brief psychotherapy are suggested to empirically evaluate the efficacy of this new treatment intervention for dysphoria. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley  (2) children and adolescents on the autism spectrum; (3) adults in general; and, (4) adults with a dual-diagnosis.The treatment protocol described within is based upon the externalizing and deconstructive properties of Narrative Therapy, and the transformation of metaphoric imagery of Metaphor Therapy; both of which have little empirical support with narrative practices gaining international attention and widespread usage - through brief therapy, long-term therapy, and walk-in clinics in North America.For the first time, the theoretical constructs of the 3-session model are described and a case example illustrates the interlinking concepts.

AB  - Summary In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA?, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve?, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70?146) to 57 (45?64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06?7.28) to 7.39 (7.35?7.49), P < 0.0001. Four patients were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to progressive hypoxia or circulatory failure. Nineteen patients (95%) were successfully transplanted. Hospital and 1-year survival was 75 and 72%, respectively. Bridging to LTX with ECCO2-R delivered by arteriovenous pumpless or venovenous pump-driven ILA is feasible and associated with high transplantation and survival rates.
