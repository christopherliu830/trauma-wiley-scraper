AB  - Summary In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA?, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve?, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70?146) to 57 (45?64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06?7.28) to 7.39 (7.35?7.49), P < 0.0001. Four patients were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to progressive hypoxia or circulatory failure. Nineteen patients (95%) were successfully transplanted. Hospital and 1-year survival was 75 and 72%, respectively. Bridging to LTX with ECCO2-R delivered by arteriovenous pumpless or venovenous pump-driven ILA is feasible and associated with high transplantation and survival rates.

AB  - Summary Rationale, aims and objectives? Clinical pathways are globally used to improve quality and efficiency of care. Total joint arthroplasty patients are one of the primary target groups for clinical pathway development. Despite the worldwide use of clinical pathways, it is unclear which key interventions multidisciplinary teams select as pathway components, which outcomes they measures and what the effect of this complex intervention is. This literature study is aimed at three research questions: (1) What are the key interventions used in joint arthroplasty clinical pathways? (2) Which outcome measures are used? (3) What are the effects of a joint arthroplasty clinical pathway? Method? Systematic literature review using a multiple reviewer approach. Five electronic databases were searched comprehensively. Reference lists were screened. Experts were consulted. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria and critical appraisal, 34 of the 4055 publications were included. Results? Joint arthroplasty clinical pathways address pre-admission education, pre-admission exercises, pre-admission assessment and testing, admission and surgical procedure, postoperative rehabilitation, minimal manipulation, symptoms management, thrombosis prophylaxis, discharge management, primary caregiver involvement, home-based physiotherapy and continuous follow-up. An overview of target dimensions and corresponding indicators is provided. Clinical pathways for joint arthroplasty could improve process and financial outcomes. The effects on clinical outcome are mixed. Evidence on team and service outcome is lacking. Conclusions? A set of key interventions and outcome measures is available to support joint arthroplasty clinical pathways. Team and service outcomes should be further addressed in practice and research. Meta-analysis on the outcome indicators should be performed. Future studies should more rigorously comply with existing reporting standards.

AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - Abstract After injury to the CNS, the accumulation of extracellular glutamate induces neuronal excitotoxicity, leading to secondary tissue damage. Astrocytes can reduce excess extracellular glutamate primarily through the astrocytic glutamate transporter-1 and the Na+-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST). In this study, we used an in vitro model of cadmium-induced cellular stress and found that glutamate uptake activity of astrocytes was suppressed because of cadmium-induced inhibition of GLAST expression. The blockage of cadmium-triggered Ca2+ influx by Ca2+ chelators elevated GLAST transcription and glutamate uptake activity in astrocytes, suggesting that the suppression of GLAST expression in cadmium-treated astrocytes was Ca2+-dependent. This was supported by the findings showing the reduction of GLAST mRNA in astrocytes after treatment with Ca2+-ionophore A23187. Cadmium reduced human GLAST promoter activity; however, it increased the binding of Ca2+-sensitive activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to their specific elements derived from the human GLAST promoter. These results demonstrate that AP-1 and CREB may be coupled with Ca2+-dependent pathway triggered by cadmium to mediate the inhibition of GLAST transcription. Our results suggest that Ca2+ influx into astrocytes after CNS injury could cause the down-regulation of GLAST expression, thus reducing the astrocytic glutamate uptake function, which in turn may exacerbate secondary damage after CNS injury.

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem, resulting in both adverse tissue form and function and the goal of therapeutic interventions is to reduce and prevent excessive scarring. We have demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (rAd-p21), inhibited scar formation by blocking cell cycle progression and attenuated cell proliferation at the wound site (Perkins et?al 2002). Recently, we have shown rAd-p21 specific antiproliferative effects on granulation tissue in vivo(Gu, et?al, manuscript submitted). Safety parameters using rAd-p21 for anti-scarring may include effects on wound strength and dehiscence of the wound. We tested effects of rAd-p21 on wound strength in vivo using tensile strength as an endpoint and included comparisons with other clinically relevant antiproliferative agents. Specifically, rAd-p21 at doses from 1???107 to 3.8???1010 particle (PN) per incision was administered intradermally to linear rat incisions and assayed 14?28 days post treatment. rAd-p21 mildly reduced tensile strength at high doses (≥3???1010PN), whereas low to moderate doses (1???107 to 1???1010PN) had no effect. Interestingly, all rAd-p21 treated wounds regained tensile strength indistinguishable from vehicle control, 4 weeks after treatment, suggesting that rAd-p21 wounds recover with time. An adenovirus control vector, not containing a gene (rAd-Empty), showed subtle reduction of tensile strength that was only statistically significant at day 21. This suggests that delivery of rAd-Empty alone in the wound has little effect on wound strength. Triamcinolone at 5?mg/mL/wound, 5-FU at 10?mg/mL/wound, and low doses of MMC did not significantly reduce tensile strength, although high doses of MMC (0.2?mg/mL/wound) severely reduced tensile strength which failed to recover after 28 days. Morphological analysis of all groups revealed necrosis only in the MMC treatment. This data suggests that rAd-p21 may reduce the hyperproliferative status in excessive scar formation with minimal effects on wound strength.

AB  - ABSTRACT Schmorl's nodes are depressions on vertebrae due to herniation of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc into the vertebral body. This study provides an extension of our previous study which analyzed the shape of the lower thoracic spine and found that vertebral morphology was associated with the presence of Schmorl's nodes. Ninety adult individuals from the late Medieval site of Fishergate House, York, and the Post-Medieval site of Coach Lane, North Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, were analysed using 2D geometric morphometrics to identify possible relationships between vertebral morphology and Schmorl's nodes at the thoraco-lumbar junction and in the lumbar spine. A significant correlation was found between vertebral shape and the presence of Schmorl's nodes in the twelfth thoracic vertebrae and the first to third lumbar vertebrae. The findings corroborate previous studies and suggest that vertebral shape may be an important factor in spinal health. It is hypothesized that the pedicle shape of affected vertebrae may not provide adequate structural support for the vertebral bodies, resulting in vertical disc herniation.

AB  - Abstract Background This study was performed to assess early and late outcomes of pathologic N2 disease unexpectedly detected in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for clinical stage I. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of patients with unexpected N2 non-small cell lung cancer and their early and late outcomes in the VATS lobectomy group versus the open thoracotomy lobectomy group. Results The overall survival time for all 358 patients was 33.26 ± 0.90 months. The overall survival time for 117 cases in the VATS lobectomy group was 36.02 ± 1.44 months. The overall survival time for 241 cases in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group was 31.92 ± 1.14 months. The survival rates for patients in the VATS lobectomy group were 92.31%, 36.75%, 5.13% at one, three, and five years, respectively. The survival rates for patients in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group were 92.12%, 21.58%, 2.49% at one, three, and five years, respectively. A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding this factor (, P = 0.049). Conclusions VATS lobectomy is feasible and safe to perform on patients with minimal N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Even if lymph node metastasis is unexpectedly detected during surgery, with rigorous preoperative evaluation and systematic lymph node dissection, there is no need to convert to open thoracotomy lobectomy.
