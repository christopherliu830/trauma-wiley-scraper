AB  - Abstract Background This study was performed to assess early and late outcomes of pathologic N2 disease unexpectedly detected in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for clinical stage I. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of patients with unexpected N2 non-small cell lung cancer and their early and late outcomes in the VATS lobectomy group versus the open thoracotomy lobectomy group. Results The overall survival time for all 358 patients was 33.26 ± 0.90 months. The overall survival time for 117 cases in the VATS lobectomy group was 36.02 ± 1.44 months. The overall survival time for 241 cases in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group was 31.92 ± 1.14 months. The survival rates for patients in the VATS lobectomy group were 92.31%, 36.75%, 5.13% at one, three, and five years, respectively. The survival rates for patients in the open thoracotomy lobectomy group were 92.12%, 21.58%, 2.49% at one, three, and five years, respectively. A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding this factor (, P = 0.049). Conclusions VATS lobectomy is feasible and safe to perform on patients with minimal N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Even if lymph node metastasis is unexpectedly detected during surgery, with rigorous preoperative evaluation and systematic lymph node dissection, there is no need to convert to open thoracotomy lobectomy.

AB  - Research on abnormal scarring, such as excessive scars, has been hampered by the lack of relevant animal models. Recent studies suggest that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are stimulators of fibrosis or scarring. We developed a rabbit ear cutaneous excessive scarring model using the growth factor stimulators TGF-?1 (0.25, 0.5 or 1??g per wound), PDGF-BB (1, 2 or 3??g per wound) and FGF-2 (0.5, 1, 3 or 5??g per wound). Three 8-mm diameter wounds were created on each ear in NZW rabbits (n?=?6 wounds). The test growth factors were injected intradermally immediately after wounding. Controls consisted of PBS, BSA and wounding only without injections. Scar thickness of wounds was measured with a micrometer at days 14 and continued twice a week thereafter until sacrifice at day 28. Results showed that the greatest measurement of elevated scars was observed at day 14. Significant differences of scar thickness were observed in TGF-?1 at a dose of 0.25??g, PDGF-BB at a dose of 3??g, and FGF-2 at a dose of 3??g per wound groups when compared to PBS and wounding only groups (p?<?0.05). Interestingly, BSA, a protein stabilizer for TGF-?1 and FGF-2 proteins, also significantly elevated scar thickness at day 14 over PBS alone (p?<?0.05). Trichrome stained tissue sections on day 28 showed an increase in cellularity and thicker epithelium in all doses of TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 protein treated groups when compared to wounding only, PBS or BSA treatments. In general, FGF-2 treated wounds showed more vascularity than TGF-?1 and PDGF-BB treated wounds. By contrast, PDGF-BB treated wounds showed richer collagen deposition than TGF-?1 and FGF-2 treated wounds. Results from these studies demonstrated that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 contributed to the scar formation in the rabbit ear scar model. BSA may contribute in stimulating scar formation in the early stage of wound healing in this model. Enhancing elevated scar formation in the rabbit ear model will be useful in evaluating anti-scarring agents for excessive scars such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.

AB  - Abstract Stress response biologic systems are altered in alcohol-dependent individuals. Early life stress (ELS) is associated with a heightened risk of alcohol dependence, presumably because of stress-induced neuroplastic changes. This study was designed to assess the contribution of ELS to a stress-induced neural response in alcohol-dependent participants. Fifteen alcohol-dependent men abstinent for 3?5 weeks and 15 age- and race-matched healthy controls were studied. Anticipatory anxiety was induced by a conditioned stimulus paired with an uncertain physically painful unconditioned stressor. Neural response was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. ELS was assessed with the Childhood Adversity Interview. There was a significant interaction between ELS and group on blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) amplitude during anticipatory anxiety in the right amygdala and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior putamen and insula. Higher ELS scores were associated with decreased BOLD amplitude during anticipatory anxiety in alcohol-dependent, but not control, participants. These findings suggest that ELS interacts with alcohol dependence to induce a muted cortico-striatal response to high threat stimuli. Allostatic changes due to both ELS and excessive alcohol use may jointly induce persistent changes in the neural response to acute stressors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Multidisciplinary wound centres are currently facing an increase in both the incidence of wounds and the complexity of care. This has resulted in rising costs and increased interest in the effectiveness of treatments. Little evidence is available regarding optimal wound centre organisation and effectiveness; therefore, measuring the quality of wound centres has become more important. This study aims to assess the evidence concerning quality by describing the state of the art of wound centres and organisational effectiveness by developing indicators of quality and by assessing their suitability in a pilot study. A multi-method approach was used: a literature review performed resulted in the development of an indicator list that was consequently subjected to expert review, and a benchmark study was completed comparing eight wound centres in the Netherlands. We thus provide a description of the relevant state-of-the-art aspects of wound centre organisation, which were multidisciplinary collaborations and standardisation of the organisation of care. In literature, significant patient-related effects were observed in improved healing rates and decreased costs. A total of 48 indicators were selected. The indicator list was tested by a benchmark study pilot. In practice, the outcome indicators were especially difficult to generate. Six indicators regarding structure, three regarding process and five regarding outcome proved feasible to measure and improve quality of wound centres.

AB  - This article provides a concluding commentary for a thematic issue of the Journal of Social Issues (JSI) dealing with the intertwining of psychology, history, and social issues. First we show how the social issues addressed and the scholarly approach in this journal collection are consistent with the JSI tradition. Then we contend that the questions asked in more traditional areas of psychology and in examining the intersection of history and psychology bear a resemblance. Next we identify three themes that cut across the articles in the collection: the role of social injustice in shaping identities, the depiction of history varies by who describes it, and responses to social histories are shaped by multiple forces. Finally, we consider policy implications focusing on how identities and group boundaries are important in policy advocacy and the use of policy to seek redress of injustices.

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem. p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression and attenuates proliferation of various cell types. Our in vitro rAd-p21 dose response studies of primary human dermal fibroblasts showed a 3?80 fold reduction of cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation at doses of 1???108?3???109?PN/mL, respectively. Further, rAd-p21 at 3???109 PN/mL showed a 2-fold less procollagen I (PIP) production when compared to control virus. These in vitro data demonstrate that rAd-p21 significantly attenuates fibroproliferation and procollagen production in the target cells. In vivo, a rat PVA sponge model was used. rAd-p21, at doses of 1???109, 1???1010 and 5???1010 PN was delivered into sponges that had previously been treated with a granulation tissue stimulator, rAd-PDGF-B. Results showed that sponges receiving rAd-PDGF-B alone had the highest % granulation fill (40?60% fill area). Sponges that were treated with rAd-PDGF-B for the first injection followed by rAd-p21 on a second injection showed a dose-dependent decrease in % granulation fill as rAd-p21 doses increased (p?<?0.001). On day 5 post-injection, IHC staining identified p21 protein expression only in sponges receiving rAd-p21. In addition, the quantitative measurement of cells labeled by BrdU or Ki67 demonstrated that rAd-p21 significantly attenuated cell proliferation when compared to rAd-PDGF alone in this model (p?<?0.01). In another in vivo experiment, a rabbit excessive scar model was used. rAd-p21, at a dose of 2???109?PN/wound was intradermally injected into the rabbit ear wounds that had previously been treated with PDGF-BB protein. Preliminary data showed that scar thickness in rAd-p21 treated wounds was significantly decreased in comparison to wounds treated with the control virus (p?<?0.05). These data suggest that rAd-p21 is effective in attenuating scars in the rabbit ear excessive scar model. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the further exploration of rAd-p21 as a useful therapeutic candidate for hyperproliferative diseases in patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews important aspects of children's development that affect their ability to provide useful information when interviewed about events they have experienced. The ability to organize the remembered details into a coherent form is important for both communication and for long-term memory. Infantile amnesia curtails the ability of children and adults alike to recall their earliest experiences verbally, whether or not they were traumatic. The clarity and completeness of children's testimony is clearly affected by their developing communicative abilities. The accuracy of children's accounts is greatly influenced by the linguistic style and the complexity of the language addressed to them by questioners, especially in legal contexts. Children also learn how to participate in conversations. The fact that children may have difficulty recalling specific incidents of multiply-experienced events has led many court systems in the United States to relax the requirement that child witnesses identify the time of the individual incidents of multiply-experienced events.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Abstract In this chapter, we provide an overview of the historical issues accompanying the study of child maltreatment and address advances and challenges that have emerged over decades of research in this area. A developmental psychopathology perspective provides a framework for discussing etiological models, psychological and biological sequelae, and methodological considerations, as well as for highlighting implications for intervention and social policy. The utilization of a multilevel perspective that integrates socioemotional, cognitive, psychophysiological, neurobiological, and genetic levels of analysis infused throughout our discussion of research. We conclude by proffering recommendations for research initiatives that will continue to advance the field and ultimately improve the lives of children who have been victimized by abuse and neglect.

AB  - Bisphosphonates are considered the most effective drugs for controlling adult and pediatric osteolytic diseases. Although they have been used successfully for many years, several side effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, delayed dental eruption, atypical femoral fracture, and alterations to the bone growth system, have been described. After an overview of nitrogenous bisphosphonate, the purpose of this article is to describe their mechanisms of action and current applications, review the preclinical and clinical evidence of their side effects in the skeleton (?what we know?), and describe current recommendations for preventing and managing these effects (?what we can do?). Finally, promising future directions on how to limit the occurrence of these side effects will be presented.
