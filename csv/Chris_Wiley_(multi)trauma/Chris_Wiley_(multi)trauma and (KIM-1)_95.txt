AB  - Bisphosphonates are considered the most effective drugs for controlling adult and pediatric osteolytic diseases. Although they have been used successfully for many years, several side effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, delayed dental eruption, atypical femoral fracture, and alterations to the bone growth system, have been described. After an overview of nitrogenous bisphosphonate, the purpose of this article is to describe their mechanisms of action and current applications, review the preclinical and clinical evidence of their side effects in the skeleton (?what we know?), and describe current recommendations for preventing and managing these effects (?what we can do?). Finally, promising future directions on how to limit the occurrence of these side effects will be presented.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews origins and progress in resilience science, with an emphasis on progress over the past decade in theory, findings, and translational applications for strategic intervention. In alignment with prevailing concepts in developmental systems theory, human resilience is defined as the potential or manifested capacity of an individual to adapt successfully through multiple processes to experiences that threaten his or her function, survival, or development. Resilience pathways, developmental cascades, gene-environment interactions, and other models salient in current resilience theory are delineated, including new approaches to testing resilience-related processes in such models. Findings on promotive and protective effects are discussed, focusing on widely replicated adaptive processes that develop in children, their families, other relationships, and key contexts as children develop. Resilience processes involving families, schools, peers, culture, and other socioecological systems are highlighted. Genetic and neurobiological processes are reviewed as a growingedge of resilience science. Intervention research based on resilience theory is discussed, together with translational implications for practice and policy based on the expanding body of knowledge about resilience processes. The chapter concludes with a review of enduring controversies, a summary of progress, and directions for the future.

AB  - Abstract In this chapter, we provide an overview of the historical issues accompanying the study of child maltreatment and address advances, as well as challenges, that have emerged over decades of research in this area. A developmental psychopathology perspective provides a framework for discussing etiological models, psychological and biological sequelae, and methodological considerations, as well as for highlighting implications for intervention and social policy. The utilization of a multilevel perspective that integrates socioemotional, cognitive, psychophysiological, neurobiological, and genetic perspectives is infused throughout our discussion of research. We conclude by proffering recommendations for research initiatives that will continue to advance the field and ultimately improve the lives of children who have been victimized by abuse and neglect.

AB  - background. As hair transplantation evolved into a procedure in which large numbers of very small grafts are moved in a single session, new problems have emerged. These include greater staffing requirements, longer operating time, additional technical difficulties, and increasing problems with quality control. objective. To introduce a new surgical instrument, the Rapid Fire Hair Implanter Carousel (Carousel), which can automate the most labor-intensive parts of the hair transplantation process, site creation and implant placement, by combining them into a single step and delivering them in rapid sequence. This instrumentation should help to minimize some of the human factors contributing to graft injury and to simplify and increase the speed of the hair transplant procedure. methods. In a patient with a Norwood IIIA balding pattern, 400 follicular implants were placed into a specific section of the bald scalp. The remainder of the bald scalp was transplanted with 800 follicular implants placed in the traditional way. The two areas were monitored and compared for intraoperative bleeding, ease of placing, total placing time, postoperative healing, and hair growth. Photographic documentation was obtained after surgery and at each postoperative visit. results. The Carousel visually produced less bleeding when compared with the manual approach. The Carousel was easier to use than the manual technique, since it eliminated graft insertion as a separate step. This was evidenced by the significantly shorter time required to insert the implants (40 grafts/minute with the Carousel vs 6.6 grafts/minute manually) and the decreased need for secondary manipulation once the grafts were inserted. Postoperative healing of the two groups were the same with regard to the duration of crusting and erythema. The rate of hair growth and the total amount of hair observed at 4 months were the same when identical size areas in test and control sides were compared. conclusion. In this single patient pilot study, the Carousel greatly facilitated the placement of grafts by decreasing bleeding and obviating the extra step needed for the insertion of the implants. As a result, the total operative time decreased, shortening the time the grafts were outside the body, and decreasing the risk of desiccation and warming. By minimizing the human factor in this labor-intensive part of the procedure, the quality of the hair transplant should increase. It is anticipated that these benefits will result in increased hair yield. Further studies are needed, in a larger patient group, so that these benefits can be demonstrated.
