AB  - Summary In this case, the authors report Chaetomium globosum as a cause of invasive pulmonary infection in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis. Fungal hyphae (KOH and Calcofluor) were seen on direct microscopy of lung biopsy sample and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. C. globosum isolated on culture clinched the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary infection by Chaetomium spp. A positive galactomannan of serum and BAL was repeatedly seen and was utilised for follow-up and as prognostic marker in patient management. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by voriconazole. All the Chaetomium infections reported till date since 1980 are reviewed. Chaetomium spp. with its unique ecology has a hidden clinical potential to cause invasive mould infections.

AB  - Abstract The study of fear memory is important for understanding various anxiety disorders in which patients experience persistent recollections of traumatic events. These memories often involve associations of contextual cues with aversive events; consequently, Pavlovian classical conditioning is commonly used to study contextual fear learning. The use of predator odor as a fearful stimulus in contextual fear conditioning has become increasingly important as an animal model of anxiety disorders. Innate fear responses to predator odors are well characterized and reliable; however, attempts to use these odors as unconditioned stimuli in fear conditioning paradigms have proven inconsistent. Here we characterize a contextual fear conditioning paradigm using coyote urine as the unconditioned stimulus. We found that contextual conditioning induced by exposure to coyote urine produces long-term freezing, a stereotypic response to fear observed in mice. This paradigm is context-specific and parallels shock-induced contextual conditioning in that it is responsive to extinction training and manipulations of predator odor intensity. Region-specific lesions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus indicate that both areas are independently required for the long-term expression of learned fear. These results in conjunction with c-fos immunostaining data suggest that while both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus are required for forming a contextual representation, the ventral region also modulates defensive behaviors associated with predators. This study provides information about the individual contributions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus to ethologically relevant fear learning. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background The success of salvage procedures for failing digital replants (FR) is poorly documented. We sought to evaluate the success of salvage procedures for FR and factors contributing to successes and failures of replants. Methods Adult patients who presented to our center between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015, suffered ≥1 digital amputation(s), and underwent digital replantation were included. Preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative details were recorded. Digits were monitored postoperatively via nursing and physician assessments. The presumed reason for failure, details, and outcomes of salvage attempts were recorded for FR. Length of hospital stay and complications were also recorded. Results Fifty-two patients and 83 digits were included. Fifty-two digits (63%) were compromised (arterial ischemia in 15 digits; venous congestion in 37 digits) and 48 digits had salvage therapy. Twenty-one FR (44%) were salvaged via operative (1 of 2; 50%), nonoperative (19 of 43; 44%), and combined (1 of 3; 33%) therapies. FR patients were more likely than those with successful replants to receive a blood transfusion (52 vs. 23%; p?=?.009) with more transfused units (3.45?±?3.30 vs. 0.86?±?0.95; p?=?.001). Length of stay was prolonged for FR patients (9 [range: 2?22] vs. 7 [range: 3?19] days; p?=?.039). Ultimately, 59% (49 of 83) of replants were successful, where 25% (21 of 83) were successfully salvaged. Conclusion Nonoperative and operative salvage therapies improve the rate of replant survival. We suggest close postoperative monitoring of all replants and active salvage interventions for compromised replants in the postoperative period.

AB  - The analysis of infectious complications in patients after allotransplantation of a donor kidney. For the dynamic analysis of frequency of infection-purulent complications, all patients were divided into 2 groups. The first, control group included 33 patients who were operated from 2000 to 2002 (men-21, women-12, adults-28, children-5). The second, basic group included 35 patients (men-22 and women-13, adult-28, children-7), after allotransplantations, which have transferred operation?transplantations of kidney with 2003 on 2004. In the first group purulent?septic complications were marked at 9 patients (27.2%), from them two (6%) have died of a sepsis on a background of antibacterial therapy (cephalosporini 3 generations). Duration of treatment made from 7 up to 15 days. In the second group in the postoperative period purulent ? septic complications were marked at 5 of 35 patients (14,2%). All 35 patients in the second group after allotransplantation of a donor kidney carried out preventive antibacterial therapy maxipimi (cephalosporini IV generations) on dosage 1 gram 2 times per day in a combination with amykini intravenously during 7 days. Cases of development of sepsis in this group of patients were not observed. Thus, estimating the received results, it is possible to draw the conclusion, application of antibiotics of a wide spectrum (cephalosporini IV generations) the patient with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency after allotransplantation of a donor kidney were lowered with quantity of suppurations of postoperative wounds and occurrence of infectious complications on 13%.

AB  - When the acute dialysis program became an in-house operation, the development and implementation of a CQI program was a priority. Quality indicators were identified. Clotting in the dialyzer, treatment delays, and catheter-related infections were tracked. Based on our CQI data, it was clear from the beginning that there was a high incidence of dialyzer clotting, particularly on our patients on Extended Daily Dialysis (EDD) who were on heparin-free dialysis. Heparin-free dialysis is prescribed for high bleeding risk patients and for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. There was a need to explore an effective way to maintain patency and longevity of the extracorporeal circuit as clotting not only results to blood loss but to loss of treatment time, which affects the efficiency and adequacy of the dialysis therapy. Our policy on no-heparin dialysis was modified. Hourly saline flushes were changed to a more aggressive every-15-to-30 minute flushes. In addition, ?heparin rinse? or priming the extracorporeal circuits with 5000 units of heparin added to 1-liter bag, except for HIT positive patients, was immediately implemented. After 2 months, clotting in the dialyzer on Extended Daily Dialysis was significantly reduced from 24% to 2%. Conclusion:?CQI in the acute dialysis setting is critical for a continuous cycle of evaluating and improving patient outcomes. Through the process of CQI, we were able to identify dialyzer clotting with our EDD as a quality of care problem and implemented a solution that was effective.

AB  - The share of gross domestic product from the service industry reflects the competitiveness of a nation; the service industry in the USA accounts for around 80% of its gross domestic product, and it has been increasing gradually. Continual innovations and advances in enabling technologies for the service industry are crucial for developed countries to sustain their leading positions in the globalized economy. To clarify future research directions of operations research (OR) in the service industry, the state of art of OR has been examined systematically, the new requirements of OR are identified for its applications in service industries in comparison with those in manufacturing industries, and the limitations of existing methodologies and tools have been discussed. This paper was intended to provide an updated review on how OR has been applied in the service sector in recent years and what directions the study of OR will be carried forward in the near future. Under a proposed research framework, recent OR-related articles were collected from 17 leading OR journals and classified into the five most active sectors, that is, transportation and warehousing, information and communication, human health and social assistance, retails and wholesales, and financial and insurance services. The conclusions on the limitations of existing studies and the demanding ORs in the service have been drawn from our summaries and observations from a comprehensive review in this field.

AB  - Abstract This paper reviews the preclinical literature related to the effects of stress on neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems. Preclinical studies of stress provide a comprehensive model for understanding neurobiological alterations in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The pathophysiology of stress reflects long-standing changes in biological stress response systems and in systems involved in stress responsivity, learning, and memory. The neural circuitry involved includes systems mediating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, norepinephrine (locus coeruleus), and benzodiazepine, serotonergic, dopaminergic, neuropeptide, and central amino acid systems. These systems interact with brain structures involved in memory, including hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Stress responses are of vital importance in living organisms; however excessive and/or repeated stress can lead to long-lasting alterations in these circuits and systems involved in stress responsiveness. Intensity and duration of the stressor, and timing of the stressor in life, have strong impact in this respect. Depression and Anxiety 15:126?147, 2002. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
