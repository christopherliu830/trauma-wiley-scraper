AB  - Abstract Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes continuous neurological deficits and major sensory-motor impairments. There is no effective treatment to enhance sensory-motor function following SCI. Thus, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutics for this particular patient population. Astaxanthin (AST) is a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. In the present study, it was tested in a severe compression SCI model with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes, signalling pathway, along with other complications. Methods A severe SCI was induced by compression of the rat thoracic spinal cord with an aneurysm clip and treatment with AST or the vehicle was carried out, 30 min after injury. Behavioural tests including open field, von Frey, hot plate and BBB were performed weekly to 28 days post-injury. Rats were assigned to measure blood glucose, weight and auricle temperature. Western blot and histological analysis also were performed at the same time points. Results AST decreased mechanical and thermal pain and also improved motor function performance, reduced blood glucose and auricle temperature increases and attenuated weight loss in SCI rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased activation of ERK1/2 and increased activation of AKT following AST treatment. The histology results revealed that AST considerably preserved myelinated white matter and the number of motor neurons following SCI. Conclusion Taken together, the beneficial effects of AST to improve sensory-motor outcomes, attenuate pathological tissue damage and modulate ERK and AKT signalling pathways following SCI, suggest it as a strong therapeutic agent towards clinical applications. Significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory-motor function and causes complications, which astaxanthin (AST) has the potential to be used as a treatment for. The present study investigates the effects of AST in a compression model of SCI with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes alongside other complications, histopathological damage and also related signalling pathways.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Physicians, policy makers, and other interested parties require a synthesized, critical, and clear compilation of the following information to optimize spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for neuropathic pain: 1) indications and potential beneficial outcomes; 2) answers to key clinical questions; 3) cost/resource use implications; and 4) the quality and source of the evidence. This information must be nonjudgmental and noncoercive and have the sole objective of increasing the reader's expertise. Study Design.? Evidence-based literature review and consensus statement. Methods.? We consulted with experts to identify clinical-practice questions. Then, we conducted a critical literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, 1967 through March 2007) to grade treatment practices from ?options? to ?recommended.? We created a bibliographical database of all citations pertinent to each practice question. Several experts not otherwise involved reviewed the draft document. Results.? We answered 64 questions covering 1) indications; 2) potential beneficial outcomes; 3) prognostic factors; 4) patient selection for screening trial; 5) procedural risk management; 6) screening trial; 7) device options; 8) patient management; 9) factors affecting the delivery and quality of SCS treatment; and 10) cost-effectiveness. Most of our more than 300 references are cited multiple times (in each pertinent category). This is the first overview that seeks to categorize and place the entire SCS clinical literature at the disposal of the reader. It presents the first grading system that incorporates, among other evidence sources, an assessment of the likelihood of a favorable outcome based on the evidence provided by expert consensus combined with consideration of the risk and potential benefit of an action. Conclusions.? The Practice Parameters for Spinal Cord Stimulation in the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain answers important questions. It assesses supporting evidence and provides specific citations to enable the reader to conduct further study. The document will be updated regularly in a Web-based version.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV), an actual or threatened physical, sexual, or psychological abuse by a current or former partner or spouse, is a common global public health issue. Understanding both the prevalence of IPV during pregnancy and its potential impact on the health of pregnant women is important for the development and implementation of interventions to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between maternal experiences of IPV during pregnancy and pregnancy complications. A health-facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2015 to April 2016 among 400 randomly selected women who were admitted to the postnatal wards of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for delivery. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess relationships between variables of interest after controlling for potential confounders. Results indicated that 39.0% of women reported physical IPV and 26.3% of women reported sexual IPV during pregnancy. Additionally, 69.5% of women experienced medical complications (MCs); of this group, 44.3% experienced obstetric complications (OCs) and 79.3% experienced any pregnancy complication (AC) during their last pregnancy. The experience of physical IPV during pregnancy was significantly associated with the experience of MCs (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15?4.01), OCs (AOR: 4.23, 95% CI: 2.01?7.12) and AC (AOR: 5.26, 95% CI: 2.98?10.52). Women who experienced sexual IPV during pregnancy were also at increased risk of suffering from any MC, any OC, and AC. Maternal experience of IPV during pregnancy is positively associated with pregnancy complications. Preventing IPV directed at pregnant women might reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh.

AB  - Abstract Natural and synthetic materials have been developed to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix properties for tissue regeneration and reconstruction. On account of the excellent biological and mechanical properties, diverse decellularized tissue materials have been developed as natural scaffolds. Among them, decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has generated great interest in recent years due to the extensiveness of the source and the eximious potential to enhance the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. In this review, we compared the different physical, chemical, and biological treatment in recorded decellularization methods, and illustrated the similarities and differences in the characteristics of various aspects of DATs prepared by different methods, including macroscopic (macro) and microcosmic (micro) structure, cellular contents removal, DNA quantification, collagen, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or growth factors retention, and mechanical properties. We also summarized the DAT application in the studies of tissue regeneration, wound healing, drug screening, and other diseases. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Determine the effect of endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS) on long-term olfactory outcomes after surgery. Methods An English-language search was conducted using the Cochrane, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases from January 2000 to October 2017 for adult patients undergoing ESBS with subjective and objective olfaction outcomes. Two authors independently examined articles to identify those meeting inclusion criteria. Studies examining objective olfactory outcomes after ESBS were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis of patients undergoing sellar and parasellar ESBS was conducted to compare preoperative and postoperative olfactory outcomes using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CCSIT). Results Among 339 eligible articles, 29 articles met inclusion criteria. Twenty-five of these focused on sellar and parasellar tumors. Individual articles not meeting criteria for meta-analysis were qualitatively reported. Meta-analysis showed there was no difference in preoperative and postoperative olfactory function after sellar and parasellar ESBS based on the UPSIT (five studies, mean difference [MD] = ?1.03; 95% CI: ?3.98, 1.93; P = .50) and the CCIST (three studies, MD = ?0.77; 95% CI: ?3.03, 1.49; P = .50). A pooled overall meta-analysis revealed similar results (eight studies, effect size = ?0.30; 95% CI: ?0.79, 0.18; P = .22). However, heterogeneity for all meta-analyses was high (I2 > 95%, P < .01), suggesting significant variation in the included studies. Conclusions Based on published objective olfaction outcomes after sellar and parasellar ESBS, there was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative olfaction. Further prospective studies using validated objective measures of olfaction are required to improve our understanding on this subject. Level of Evidence 2a Laryngoscope, 129:1998?2007, 2019
