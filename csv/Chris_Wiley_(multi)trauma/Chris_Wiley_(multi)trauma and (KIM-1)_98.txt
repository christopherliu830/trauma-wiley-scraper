AB  - Chaperones (stress proteins) are essential proteins to help the formation and maintenance of the proper conformation of other proteins and to promote cell survival after a large variety of environmental stresses. Therefore, normal chaperone function is a key factor for endogenous stress adaptation of several tissues. However, altered chaperone function has been associated with the development of several diseases; therefore, modulators of chaperone activities became a new and emerging field of drug development. Inhibition of the 90?kDa heat shock protein (Hsp)90 recently emerged as a very promising tool to combat various forms of cancer. On the other hand, the induction of the 70?kDa Hsp70 has been proved to be an efficient help in the recovery from a large number of diseases, such as, for example, ischemic heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Development of membrane-interacting drugs to modify specific membrane domains, thereby modulating heat shock response, may be of considerable therapeutic benefit as well. In this review, we give an overview of the therapeutic approaches and list some of the key questions of drug development in this novel and promising therapeutic approach.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that has emerged as a prevalent source of nosocomial infections, most frequently causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. The emergence of pan-drug resistant strains magnifies the problem by reducing viable treatment options and effectively increasing the mortality rate associated with Acinetobacter infections. In light of this rising threat, research on A.?baumannii epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis is accelerating. The recent development of both in vitro and in vivo models has enabled studies probing the host?Acinetobacter interface. Bacterial genetic screens and comparative genomic studies have led to the identification of several A.?baumannii virulence factors. Additionally, investigations into host defence mechanisms using animal models or cell culture have provided insight into the innate immune response to infection. This review highlights some of the key attributes of A.?baumannii virulence with an emphasis on bacterial interactions with the innate immune system.

AB  - Although long known and the most prevalent movement disorder, pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) remains controversial. The most accepted hypothesis is that it is caused by a dysfunction of the olivocerebellar system. Vilela Filho et al. [2001; Stereotact Funct Neurosurg 77:149?150], however, reported a patient with unilateral hand ET that was completely relieved after a stroke restricted to the contralateral posterior putamen and suggested that ET could be the clinical manifestation of posterior putamen hyperactivity. The present study was designed to evaluate this hypothesis in the most often used model of ET, harmaline-induced tremor in rats. Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into three groups: experimental (EG), surgical control (SCG), and pharmacological control (PCG) groups. EG animals underwent stereotactic unilateral posterior striatotomy. SCG rats underwent sham lesion at the same target. PCG served exclusively as controls for harmaline effects. All animals received, postoperatively, intraperitoneal harmaline, and the induced tremor was video-recorded for later evaluation by a blind observer. Thirteen animals were excluded from the study. Limb tremor was reduced ipsilaterally to the operation in 20 of 21 rats of EG and in two of nine of SCG, being asymmetric in one of 10 of PCG rats. Comparisons between EG ? SCG and EG ? PCG were statistically significant, but not between SCG ? PCG. Limb tremor reduction was greater in anterior than in posterior paws. Lateral lesions yielded better results than medial lesions. These results suggest that the posterior striatum is involved with harmaline-induced tremor in rats and support the hypothesis presented. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Risk of recurrence is a major problem in breast cancer management. Currently available prognostic markers have several disadvantages including low sensitivity and specificity, highlighting the need for new prognostic techniques. One of the candidate techniques is serum-based Raman spectroscopy (RS). In this study, feasibility of using RS to distinguish ?pre? from ?post? breast tumor resection serum in rats was explored. Spectral analysis suggests change in proteins and amino acid profiles in ?post? compared to ?pre-surgical? group. Principal-Component-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis shows 87% and 91% classification efficiency for ?pre? and ?post-surgical? groups respectively. Thus, the study further supports efficacy of RS for theranostic applications.

AB  - Summary Flexible inorganic light emitting diodes represent an emerging class of unconventional optoelectronic devices. Recent advances in materials designs, mechanical layouts, fabrication techniques, and assembly schemes have enabled flexible inorganic light emitting diodes with high-performance operation even under extreme modes of mechanical deformation. These results provide the foundations for a broad range of system-level integrated optoelectronic platforms, ranging from deformable displays to conformable bioelectronics. This chapter summarizes recent progress in this field with focus on the underlying materials and device physics, as well as the use of flexible inorganic light emitting diodes in optical modulation and photometric measurements of neural activities at target sites.

AB  - Objective: Feasibility and safety evaluation of citrate anticoagulation for hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) procedure in a pediatric critical care unit. Patients and Methods:From 08?2002 to 12?2003, five patients were treated by CVVHD with regional citrate anticoagulation, age range 1.4?16?yrs, body weight 6.7?38?kg. Inclusion criteria: oligoanuria and hypervolemia and/or uremia, hemodynamic instability, and impossibility of peritoneal dialysis. The patient's primary diseases were: liver disease (4/5) and chronic renal disease (1/5). All patients were on mechanical ventilation and on vasopressor support and presented with thrombocytopenia. Hepatic dysfunction was observed in four patients. The CVVHD prescription was: blood flow rate: 2?5?ml/min, dialysate and replacement flow rate: 3000?ml/1.73?m2/h. Citrate regional anticoagulation (4% trisodium citrate) was used according to a previously described protocol (Bunchman et al., Pediatr Nephrol 2002: 17:150?154). The duration of each individual procedure was 9?72 hours, and the total time range of CVVHD was 2 to 19 days. A bicarbonate based solution (Na 140?mEq/L and bicarbonate 35?mEq/L) was prepared in our hospital pharmacy. Prisma system (GAMBRO) and polycrylonitrile M-60 Pre-set hemofilter was used in 4/5 patients and M-10 Pre-set hemofilter in one patient. Results:The use of M-10 filter was associated with a higher rates of ACD-A and calcium infusion (ml/h). Metabolic alkalosis was observed in one patient and hypernatremia in three patients. All patients died of causes other than renal failure (sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). No bleeding related to citrate occurred. Conclusion: Citrate anticoagulation proved to be feasible with minor side effects in pediatric ICU patients. The high mortality can be related to the severity of multiple organ failure.

AB  - Abstract Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been known to play an important role in pathological conditions, specifically in response to inflammation, infection and injury to cells. Recently, several research teams have been interested in investigating its association with cognition during the progression of pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that LCN2 is not correlated with cognitive function under normal physiological conditions, although LCN2 has been negatively associated with cognition and some neuropathologies. Increasing LCN2 production is associated with reduced cognitive performance in a rodent model. However, further studies are needed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms of LCN2 on cognitive dysfunction, as well as its clinical relevance. This review aims to summarise the evidence available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies concerning the possible role of LCN2 on cognitive function following the onset of pathological conditions. Any contradictory evidence is also assessed and presented.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated the socialization of children's emotion regulation in physically maltreating and non-maltreating mother?child dyads (N?=?80 dyads). Mother?child dyads participated in the parent?child emotion interaction task (Shipman & Zeman, 1999) in which they talked about emotionally-arousing situations. The PCEIT was coded for maternal validation and invalidation in response to children's emotion. Mothers were also interviewed about their approach to emotion socialization using the meta-emotion interview-parent version (Katz & Gottman, 1999). The meta-emotion interview-parent version was coded for maternal emotion coaching. Mothers also completed measures that assessed their child abuse potential and abuse-related behaviors as well as children's emotion regulation. Findings indicated that maltreated children demonstrated fewer adaptive emotion regulation skills and more emotion dysregulation than non-maltreated children. In addition, maltreating mothers engaged in less validation and emotion coaching and more invalidation in response to children's emotion than non-maltreating mothers. Finally, maternal emotion socialization behaviors mediated the relation between maltreatment status and children's adaptive emotion regulation skills.
