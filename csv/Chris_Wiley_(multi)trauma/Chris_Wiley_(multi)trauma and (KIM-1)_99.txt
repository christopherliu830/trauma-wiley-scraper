AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal reconstruction is an ongoing challenge for surgeons as it is required for one out of five patients undergoing surgery. In the past three decades, through the close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists, several regenerative strategies have been proposed. These have emerged from interdisciplinary approaches that bridge tissue engineering with material science, physiology, and cell biology. The paradigm behind tissue engineering is to achieve regeneration and functional recovery using stem cells, bioactive molecules, or supporting materials. Although plenty of preclinical solutions for bone and cartilage have been presented, only a few platforms have been able to move from the bench to the bedside. In this review, we highlight the limitations of musculoskeletal regeneration and summarize the most relevant acellular tissue engineering approaches. We focus on the strategies that could be most effectively translate in clinical practice and reflect on contemporary and cutting-edge regenerative strategies in surgery.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated the socialization of children's emotion regulation in physically maltreating and non-maltreating mother?child dyads (N?=?80 dyads). Mother?child dyads participated in the parent?child emotion interaction task (Shipman & Zeman, 1999) in which they talked about emotionally-arousing situations. The PCEIT was coded for maternal validation and invalidation in response to children's emotion. Mothers were also interviewed about their approach to emotion socialization using the meta-emotion interview-parent version (Katz & Gottman, 1999). The meta-emotion interview-parent version was coded for maternal emotion coaching. Mothers also completed measures that assessed their child abuse potential and abuse-related behaviors as well as children's emotion regulation. Findings indicated that maltreated children demonstrated fewer adaptive emotion regulation skills and more emotion dysregulation than non-maltreated children. In addition, maltreating mothers engaged in less validation and emotion coaching and more invalidation in response to children's emotion than non-maltreating mothers. Finally, maternal emotion socialization behaviors mediated the relation between maltreatment status and children's adaptive emotion regulation skills.

AB  - Objective Lumbar spinal stenosis is a medical condition characterized by the narrowing of the spinal canal as a consequence of bone and soft tissue degeneration, including disc herniation, facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation. The percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) technique is one of the emerging surgical alternatives for treating central lumbar stenosis. The present study aims to describe the present techniques of PTED and foraminoplasty for central lumbar stenosis, and discuss the feasibility and advantages of this technique. Methods A total of 55 patients with an average age of 50?years were recruited in this study. They were operated on between August 2017 and June 2018 by a single surgeon for symptomatic lumbar stenosis using the PTED and foraminoplasty technique, along with a detailed description of the present technique. The retrospective analysis of 55 patients operated between August 2017 and June 2018 by a single surgeon for symptomatic lumbar stenosis using the PTED and foraminoplasty techniques, and the detailed description of the present technique were the focus of the present study. For all patients, the PTED and foraminoplasty procedure was performed under local anesthesia in the lateral position on a radiolucent table using C-arm fluoroscopy. The retrospective analysis evaluated the outcomes of symptoms through follow-up interviews at six weeks, six months, and one year after surgery. The analyzed parameters included surgery time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, visual analog scale (VAS) score, Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The modified MacNab criteria were adopted. Results The average duration of symptoms was 15.6?weeks. The mean operative time was 161?minutes. The mean volume of intraoperative blood loss was 21 mL. The mean follow-up period was 14.6?months. The average preoperative VAS score for leg pain and low back pain was 6.8 and 5.5, respectively. The preoperative ODI and JOA score was 49.2 and 14.6, respectively. At the final follow-up, all 55 patients had an average VAS score of 1.1 for leg pain and 0.5 for low back pain. At the same time, the average ODI and JOA score was seven and 24.5, respectively. The statistical analysis showed that the VAS score, ODI value, and JOA score were significantly lower in all time-points at post-operation, when compared to those at pre-operation. For the modified MacNab criteria, the final outcome results were excellent in 39 patients (70.9%), good in nine patients (16.4%), fair in four patients (7.3%), and poor in two patients (3.6%), and the overall success rate was 89.1%. Two patients underwent a second operation during the follow-up period, and their symptoms were released after the reoperation. Conclusion PTED and foraminoplasty technique showed promising outcomes in the treatment of central lumbar stenosis in a 1-year follow-up period. It suggested that PTED and foraminoplasty might be applied as a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with lumbar stenosis.

AB  - Abstract This review describes practical criteria and a systematic process to aid the treatment planning decision of whether to preserve teeth by root canal treatment (RCT) or extract and provide an implant. Recommendations presented are based on best available evidence from the literature and the expert views of specialists in endodontics and restorative dentistry, including dental implantology. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the terms ?root canal therapy?, ?dental implants?, ?decision making?, ?treatment planning?, ?outcome? and ?human?, and supplemented by hand-searching. When evaluating the outcome of root canal treatment, an observation period of 4?5?years is required for complete healing of periapical lesions. Dental implants, however, present a de novo situation and a functional period of at least 5?years is often required before peri-implant diseases are established and detected. Good long-term success rates and greater flexibility in clinical management indicate that RCT or retreatment should be performed first in most instances unless the tooth is judged to be unrestorable. When deciding if a compromised tooth of questionable prognosis should be maintained or replaced by an implant, both local, site-specific and more general patient-related factors should be considered. Following systematic evaluation and consideration of the best treatment option in a particular case, a treatment recommendation may then be given in favour or against tooth retention. Whilst single risks are possibly accepted for single tooth restorations, teeth with questionable prognosis and multiple pre-treatment requirements are better not included as abutments in fixed dental prostheses to reduce the risk to survival of the entire restoration.

AB  - Abstract There is high variability in efficacy for interventions for youth with disruptive behavior problems (DBP). Despite evidence of the unique correlates and critical consequences of girls? DBP, there is a dearth of research examining treatment efficacy for girls. This meta-analysis of 167 unique effect sizes from 29 studies (28,483 youth, 50% female; median age: 14) suggests that existing treatments have a medium positive effect on DBP (gÂ =Â .33). For both boys and girls, the most effective interventions included (a) multimodal or group format, (b) cognitive skills or family systems interventions, and (c) length-intensive programs for (d) younger children. Boys demonstrated significantly greater treatment gains from group format interventions compared to girls, which is particularly important given that the group program format was the most prevalent format for boys and girls, with 14 studies involving 10,433 youth encompassing this category. This is the first meta-analysis to examine the effect of program characteristics in a sample of programs selected to be specifically inclusive of girls. Given that girls are underrepresented in intervention research on DBP, findings are discussed in terms of gender-responsive considerations and elucidating how key aspects of program structure can support more effective intervention outcomes for youth.

AB  - Following adequate tissue incision, reflection and retraction to expose the surgical site, the next stages of periradicular surgery consist of osseous access through the cortical bone, if still intact, and subsequent removal of any soft tissue lesion surrounding the apical and/or lateral aspects of the associated root to provide unimpeded access to these sites. The soft tissue lesion may on occasions encapsulate foreign material that may perpetuate the lesion if left in situ. Any excised lesion should be sent for histopathologic examination to confirm the clinical diagnosis and exclude other pathoses.

AB  - Recently, a significant epigenetic component in the pathology of suicide has been realized. Here we investigate candidate functional SNPs in epigenetic-regulatory genes, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, for association with suicide attempt (SA) among patients with co-existing psychiatric illness. In addition, global DNA methylation levels [5-methyl cytosine (5-mC%)] between SA and psychiatric controls were quantified using the Methylflash Methylated DNA Quantification Kit. DNA was obtained from blood of 79 suicide attempters and 80 non-attempters, assessed for DSM-IV Axis I disorders. Functional SNPs were selected for each gene (DNMT1; n?=?7, DNMT3B; n?=?10), and genotyped. A SNP (rs2424932) residing in the 3? UTR of the DNMT3B gene was associated with SA compared with a non-attempter control group (P?=?0.001; Chi-squared test, Bonferroni adjusted P value?=?0.02). Moreover, haplotype analysis identified a DNMT3B haplotype which differed between cases and controls, however this association did not hold after Bonferroni correction (P?=?0.01, Bonferroni adjusted P value?=?0.56). Global methylation analysis showed that psychiatric patients with a history of SA had significantly higher levels of global DNA methylation compared with controls (P?=?0.018, Student's t-test). In conclusion, this is the first report investigating polymorphisms in DNMT genes and global DNA methylation quantification in SA risk. Preliminary findings suggest that allelic variability in DNMT3B may be relevant to the underlying diathesis for suicidal acts and our findings support the hypothesis that aberrant DNA methylation profiles may contribute to the biology of suicidal acts. Thus, analysis of global DNA hypermethylation in blood may represent a biomarker for increased SA risk in psychiatric patients.

AB  - SUMMARY The best-known protein components of the plant cell wall have highly repetitive, proline-rich sequences. The use of recombinant DNA approaches has enabled complete sequences of these proteins to be determined and features of the expression of the corresponding genes to be examined. These results, coupled with the use of immunological techniques, have shown that proline-rich proteins are interesting probes to study developmental and defence processes in plants. In this review, the sequence and expression of different groups of proline-rich proteins in plants are presented. These groups include hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) or extensins, proline-rich proteins (PRP) and glycine-rich proteins (GRP). The specific features of each group and the possible functions of these proteins are discussed, as well as the data available on the mechanisms controlling the expression of their corresponding genes.

AB  - Summary Prospective cohort studies are costly and time consuming yet appear to be the best means for understanding how genes interact with environmental risk factors to cause disease. This information is a necessary prerequisite for evidenced-based disease prevention, yet not all researchers agree about the importance of studying the interplay between genes and environments. They argue that we already know enough about which environmental ?exposures? can prevent most common diseases, for example, wholesome diet, adequate housing/income and access to good healthcare. Implicit is the notion that current disease categories (i.e. phenotypes) are ?real? and represent homogenous entities, and that identifying environmentally mediated risk is relatively straightforward. Other concerns relate to scientific basis, utility and ethics. These arguments are critically examined for a range of disorders, from diabetes, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease to depression. We refute the contention that incorporating the measurement of genotype into longitudinal-epidemiological studies is wasteful or unlikely to yield significant benefits.
