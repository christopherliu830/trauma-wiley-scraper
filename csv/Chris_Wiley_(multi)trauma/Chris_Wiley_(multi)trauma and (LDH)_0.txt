AB  - Abstract? Chylothorax is rare following blunt thoracic trauma; its diagnosis is usually delayed until the puncture or drainage of posttraumatic pleural effusion and its cause is not clear. Mostly, it is attributed to injury or overstretching of major thoracic duct by fractures or other injury of neighboring thoracic spine. We describe of two cases, one unilateral and one bilateral, of chylothorax, both after blunt thoracic trauma. In the first case, there were associated fractures of lower thoracic vertebrae, whereas in the other there was no obvious cause, except striking osteophytic degeneration alongside the thoracic spine. Both cases were successfully treated after 16 and 23 days, respectively, with drainage, starvation, reexpansion of the lung(-s), and total parenteral nutrition. We believe that with the ?triad of RST? (?reexpansion, starvation diet, TPN?), conservative treatment will be successful in the majority of cases.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The clinical spectrum of electrical injury ranges from the absence of any external physical signs to severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain injury accompanying an electrical trauma. In this report, a case study and discussion are presented on the management and coordination of postacute care of an electrical trauma survivor. Expertise and a multi-disciplinary team are essential to cohesive patient care. Patient monitoring for progressive changes and prompt intervention are needed to address the potential difficulties experienced by trauma survivors as they rehabilitate to return to their work and their activities of daily living.

AB  - Abstract Many US veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq have multiple physical and psychiatric problems. A major focus of research has been on determining the effects of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), but mTBI is rarely diagnosed in the absence of co-occurring conditions such as blast exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, etc. These potentially interactive psychological and physical conditions produce complex patterns of cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms that impede civilian reintegration and complicate efficient and effective treatment planning. The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) has developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of deployment trauma and its consequences in veterans of these wars. The prospective TRACTS longitudinal cohort study conducts state-of-the-art assessments in the domains of biomedical function, lifetime head trauma, psychological function encompassing deployment experience and lifetime exposure to traumatic events, neuropsychological function, and structural and functional neuroimaging. The TRACTS longitudinal cohort study is the first of its kind to comprehensively evaluate lifetime incidence of TBI and PTSD in these veterans, in addition to those incurred during military deployment. The protocol has begun to reveal information that will help improve understanding of the complex pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress disorders.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Abstract We consider a new concept of biometric-based cybersecurity systems for active authentication by continuous tracking, which utilizes biochemical processing of metabolites present in skin secretions. Skin secretions contain a large number of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication at the level of an individual.

AB  - Summary: Thirty-three patients whc had had prosthetic valves inserted in the preceding four years were investigated to estimate the value of various laboratory tests in the assessment of traumatic red cell destruction. A combination of the findings of an elevation in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and a fall in serum haptoglobir levels, was found to be a reliable and accurate pointer to the presence of red cell damage. This study indicates that the commonly used parameters of an increased reticulocyte count, a rise it serum bilirubin levels, the presence ol methaemalbumin (positive Schumm's test) and fragmented red cells in the peripheral blood, although very valuable in more severe cases, are not sufficiently accurate to be used as indicators ol minor degrees of red cell damage. Milc and clinically insignificant red cell destruction is very common in patients with artificial valves and only one case of the thirty-three studied showed no laboratory evidence of traumatic haemolysis.

AB  - Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a versatile, bioabsorbable, and biodegradable polymer with excellent biocompatibility and ability to incorporate a great variety of active agents. Silver sulfadiazine (SDZ) is an antibiotic used to control bacterial infection in external wounds. Aiming to combine the properties of PLA and SDZ, hydrotalcite ([Mg?Al]-LDH) was used as a host matrix to obtain an antimicrobial system efficient in delivering SDZ from electrospun PLA scaffolds intended for wound skin healing. The structural reconstruction method was successfully applied to intercalate silver sulfadiazine in the [Mg?Al]-LDH, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses. Observations by scanning electron microscopy revealed a good distribution of SDZ-[Mg?Al]-LDH within the PLA scaffold. Kinetics studies revealed a slow release of SDZ from the PLA scaffold due to the intercalation in the [Mg?Al]-LDH. In vitro antimicrobial tests indicated a significant inhibitory effect of SDZ-[Mg?Al]-LDH against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This antibacterial activity was sustained in the 2.5-wt% SDZ-[Mg?Al]-LDH?loaded PLA nanofibers, which also displayed excellent biocompatibility towards human cells. The multifunctionality of the PLA/SDZ-[Mg?Al]-LDH scaffold reported here is of great significance for various transdermal applications.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract Haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R) may cause global ischaemia-reperfusion injury, which can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan failure (particularly liver failure) and high mortality. Hinokitiol, a bioactive tropolone-related compound, exhibits antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory activities. Targeting inflammatory responses is a potential strategy for ameliorating hepatic injury during HS/R. Whether hinokitiol prevents hepatic injury during HS/R remains unclear. In the present study, we determined the role of hinokitiol following HS/R. The in¬†vivo assays revealed that hinokitiol markedly attenuated HS/R-induced hepatic injury. Hinokitiol could inhibited NF-?B activation and IL-6 and TNF-Œ± upregulation in liver tissues. Moreover, hinokitiol reduced caspase-3 activation, upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. These findings suggest that hinokitiol can ameliorate liver injury following HS/R, partly through suppression of inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the in¬†vitro data revealed that hinokitiol significantly reversed hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death and apoptosis in the primary hepatocytes. Hinokitiol prevented H/R-induced caspase-3 activation, PPAR cleavage, Bax overexpression and Bcl-2 downregulation. Moreover, hinokitiol attenuated H/R-stimulated NF-?B activation and reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-Œ± mRNAs, suggesting that hinokitiol can protect hepatocytes from H/R injury. Collectively, our data suggest that hinokitiol attenuates liver injury following HS/R, partly through the inhibition of NF-?B activation.

AB  - Abstract Hemolysis is a potential limitation of percutaneously delivered left-sided mechanical circulatory support pumps, including trans valvular micro-axial flow pumps (TVP). Hemolytic biomarkers among durable left ventricular assist devices include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and plasma-free hemoglobin (pf-Hb) >20 mg/dL. We examined the predictive value of these markers among patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) receiving a TVP. We retrospectively studied records of 116 consecutive patients receiving an Impella TVP at our institution between 2012 and 2017 for CS. Twenty-three met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and had sufficient pf-Hb data for analysis. Area under receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for diagnosing hemolysis were calculated. Mean age was 62 ¬± 14 years and ejection fraction was 15 ¬± 5%. Mean duration of support was 5.4 ¬± 3.5 days. Pre-device LDH levels were >2.5x ULN in 71% (n = 5/7) of 5.0 and 29% of CP patients, while pre-device pf-Hb levels were >20 mg/dL in 14% (n = 1/7) of 5.0 and 25% (n = 4/16) of CP patients. Given elevated baseline LDH and pf-Hb levels, we defined hemolysis as a pf-Hb level >40 mg/dL within 72 h post-implant plus clinical evidence of device-related hemolysis. We identified that 30% (n = 7/23) had device-related hemolysis. Using ROC curve-derived cut-points, an increase in delta pf-Hb by >27mg/dL, not delta LDH, within 24 h after TVP implant (delta pf-Hb: C-statistic?=?0.79, sensitivity: 57%, specificity: 93%, p <0.05) was highly predictive of hemolysis. In conclusion, we identified a change in pf-Hb, not LDH, levels is highly sensitive and specific for hemolysis in patients treated with a TVP for CS.

AB  - Abstract In vitro models of traumatic injury are useful adjuncts to animal models for studying mechanisms of post-traumatic cell death. Here we describe a new in vitro model in which reproducible levels of injury are delivered by a punch device that produces 28 parallel cuts in individual wells of 96-well microplates. Cell loss is measured by LDH assay or quantitative fluorometric assay for ethidium homodimer staining. Glial cultures show cell death restricted to the initial injury site, whereas neuronal/glial cultures demonstrate substantial spread of cell loss over time. We used this model to examine the role of pH and NMDA receptors in delayed post-traumatic injury. NMDA receptor blockade by dizocilpine (MK-801) or treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against NMDAR1 was neuroprotective. Decreased cell death was observed under acidic conditions whereas increased extracellular pH was associated with increased, MK-801 sensitive cell loss. Advantages of our model include: reproducible trauma induction; rapid measurements of cell injury; and use of 96-well microplates which reduce time and cost. This model appears to be well-suited for the study of selected mechanisms of post-traumatic neuronal injury as well as for screening potential neuroprotective agents. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract Background Transforaminal endoscopic spine system (TESSYS) has the advantages of small trauma, rapid recovery, early out-of-bed activity and fewer postoperative complications in lumbar disc herniation (LDH) surgery. However, whether TESSYS would show a better curative effect than traditional open discectomy is not certain. Methods Related clinical trial reports were collected from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. After careful screening, the enrolled studies were evaluated by systematic review and meta-analysis using Revman v5.2 and STATA v11. Results Using visual analogue scale as assessment index, TESSYS has a better operation effect than open discectomy only at 1 and 12?months after operation, the pooled standard mean differences were??0.289 (95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.518 to 0.060, P =?0.013) and??0.18 (95% CI ?0.34 to 0.03, P =?0.022). When using the Japanese Orthopaedics Association assessment index, a better operation effect of TESSYS was shown only at 3 months after operation, standard mean difference ?0.394 (95% CI ?0.678 to 0.110, P =?0.007). There were no obvious differences between TESSYS and open discectomy in Oswestry disability index assessment. Conclusions TESSYS seems to display an equal operation effect with traditional open discectomy.

AB  - According to clinical studies, degenerative diseases of canine joints lead to higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in synovial fluid. The goal of the present study was to examine the intraarticular distribution of LDH in healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints in order to identify possible sources of LDH in synovial fluid. As synovial LDH concentrations neither correlate with the number of leukocytes nor with synovitis, our investigation focused on the articular cartilage. Samples from healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). In addition, fresh cartilage samples were investigated cytochemically by the tetrazolium-formazan reaction. Analyses of blood and synovial fluid samples were used to confirm the absence of inflammatory disease. Morphology of articular cartilage was assessed macroscopically and by means of TEM. IHC revealed highest levels of LDH in chondrones and a diffuse labelling of the matrix with a distinctive decrease in signal from superficial to deeper cartilage layers. Ultrastructural localization by ICC showed LDH to be present in the cytoplasm of all chondrocytes and confirmed the density gradient in the matrix. Labelling was absent from nuclei and from pericellular rims. Cytochemistry confirmed the distribution pattern and, thus, expanded our findings beyond immunological evidence by providing proof of enzymatic activity of LDH in articular cartilage. The present results indicate that LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to the cartilaginous matrix. We suggest, therefore, that LDH found in synovial fluid originates from the articular cartilage and that osteoarthrotic processes promote LDH release from the cartilaginous matrix.

AB  - Abstract Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of inflammasome is involved in the development of a wide spectrum of diseases. We aimed to investigate whether (?)schisandrin B [(?)Sch B], a phytochemical that can induce cellular antioxidant response, can suppress the inflammasome activation. Results showed that (?)Sch B can induce an nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-driven thioredoxin expression in primary peritoneal macrophages and cultured RAW264.7 macrophages. A 4-h priming of peritoneal macrophages with LPS followed by a 30-min incubation with ATP caused the activation of caspase 1 and the release of IL-1?, indicative of inflammasome activation. Although LPS/ATP did not activate inflammasome in RAW264.7 macrophages, it caused the ROS-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase1/2 (JNK1/2) activation and an associated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in RAW264.7 macrophages, an indication of cytotoxicity. (?)Sch B suppressed the LPS/ATP-induced activation of caspase 1 and release of IL-1? in peritoneal macrophages. (?)Sch B also attenuated the LPS/ATP-induced ROS production, JNK1/2 activation and LDH release in RAW264.7 macrophages. The ability of (?)Sch B to suppress LPS/ATP-mediated inflammation in vitro was further confirmed by an animal study, in which schisandrin B treatment (2 mmol/kg p.o.) ameliorated the Imject Alum-induced peritonitis, as indicated by suppressions of caspase1 activation and plasma IL-1? level. The ensemble of results suggests that (?)Sch B may offer a promising prospect for preventing the inflammasome-mediated disorders. ? 2015 BioFactors, 41(5):314?323, 2015

AB  - Abstract The stability of orthopedic implants is governed by the interaction between the material's surface and bone cells. Nanosized structures seem to be promising in supporting the osseointegration of total joint replacements. In order to analyze whether nanostructured titanium surfaces, as generated by a short-pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser irradiation process developed in the aeronautics and space industry as a ?cold ablation? process, can be useful for orthopedic applications, their impact on bone cells is evaluated in vitro. Cell spreading and morphology on nanostructured titanium niobium nitride or titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces are comparable to osteoblast behavior on corresponding untreated titanium or cells grown on cover glass. However, on the nanostructured surfaces cell numbers appear to be reduced. Nonetheless, cell viability is not affected by laser pretreatment. Interestingly, osteoblast proliferation on nanostructured titanium is inhibited to the benefit of an increased production of osteoblast-specific proteins such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or procollagen. Furthermore, an enhanced mineralization of cells grown on nanostructured surfaces is confirmed in terms of an elevated hydroxyapatite deposition. Laser irradiation leads to an additional nanostructure on microstructured titanium surfaces and might positively affect the biocompatibility and ingrowth of prostheses made from the corresponding biomaterials.

AB  - Abstract Multiple recent Sickle Cell Disease studies have been terminated due to poor enrollment. We developed methods to overcome past barriers and utilized these to study the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). We describe the methods of the Intravenous Magnesium in Sickle Vaso-occlusive Crisis (MAGiC) trial and discuss methods used to overcome past barriers. MAGiC was a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous magnesium versus normal saline for treatment of VOC. The study was a collaboration between Pediatric Hematologists and Emergency Physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Eligible patients were randomized within 12?hours of receiving intravenous opioids in the Emergency Department (ED) and administered study medication every 8?hours. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Associated plasma studies elucidated magnesium's mechanism of action and the pathophysiology of VOC. Health-related quality of life was measured. Site-, protocol-, and patient-related barriers from prior studies were identified and addressed. Limited study staff availability, lack of collaboration with the ED, and difficulty obtaining consent were previously identified barriers. Leveraging PECARN resources, forging close collaborations between Sickle Cell Centers and EDs of participating sites, and approaching eligible patients for prior consent helped overcome these barriers. Participation in the PECARN network and establishment of collaborative arrangements between Sickle Cell Centers and their affiliated EDs are major innovative features of the MAGiC study that allowed improved subject capture. These methods could serve as a model for future studies of VOCs. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:1049?1054. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
