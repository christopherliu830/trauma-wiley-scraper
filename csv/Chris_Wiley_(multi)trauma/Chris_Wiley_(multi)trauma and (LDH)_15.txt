AB  - Summary Abstract Heart transplant patients have significant psychiatric co-morbidity both pre- and post- transplant, and psychiatric assessment and treatment is often integral to their care. Patients with significant cardiac disease have a high incidence of depression and anxiety regardless of whether they are transplant candidates and there is evidence to suggest that addressing their psychiatric issues improves outcomes. In addition, for the transplant patient, the stress of life-threatening illness is coupled with the impact of living because someone else has died. This chapter will review the epidemiology of psychiatric illness in the heart failure and pre-transplant population, outline the work-up and psychosocial evaluation of transplant candidates, and discuss the psychiatric treatment of patients post transplant. We will also review the psychologic implications of long-term treatment with a left ventricular assist device, which has now become a viable alternative to heart transplant.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Abstract Fas ligation via the ligand FasL activates the caspase-8/caspase-3-dependent extrinsic death pathway. In so-called type II cells, an additional mechanism involving tBid-mediated caspase-9 activation is required to efficiently trigger cell death. Other pathways linking FasL?Fas interaction to activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway remain unknown. However, ATP release and subsequent activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) favors cell death in some cells. Here, we evaluated the possibility that ATP release downstream of caspase-8 via pannexin1 hemichannels (Panx1 HCs) and subsequent activation of P2X7Rs participate in FasL-stimulated cell death. Indeed, upon FasL stimulation, ATP was released from Jurkat cells in a time- and caspase-8-dependent manner. Fas and Panx1 HCs colocalized and inhibition of the latter, but not connexin hemichannels, reduced FasL-induced ATP release. Extracellular apyrase, which hydrolyzes ATP, reduced FasL-induced death. Also, oxidized-ATP or Brilliant Blue G, two P2X7R blockers, reduced FasL-induced caspase-9 activation and cell death. These results represent the first evidence indicating that the two death receptors, Fas and P2X7R connect functionally via caspase-8 and Panx1 HC-mediated ATP release to promote caspase-9/caspase-3-dependent cell death in lymphoid cells. Thus, a hitherto unsuspected route was uncovered connecting the extrinsic to the intrinsic pathway to amplify death signals emanating from the Fas receptor in type II cells. J. Cell.

AB  - In contrast to traditional static cold preservation of donor livers, normothermic machine perfusion may reduce preservation injury, improve graft viability and potentially allows ex vivo assessment of graft viability before transplantation. We have studied the feasibility of normothermic machine perfusion in four discarded human donor livers. Normothermic machine perfusion consisted of pressure and temperature controlled pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic artery and continuous portal perfusion for 6 h. Two hollow fiber membrane oxygenators provided oxygenation of the perfusion fluid. Biochemical markers in the perfusion fluid reflected minimal hepatic injury and improving function. Lactate levels decreased to normal values, reflecting active metabolism by the liver (mean lactate 10.0 ± 2.3 mmol/L at 30 min to 2.3 ± 1.2 mmol/L at 6 h). Bile production was observed throughout the 6 h perfusion period (mean rate 8.16 ± 0.65 g/h after the first hour). Histological examination before and after 6 h of perfusion showed well-preserved liver morphology without signs of additional hepatocellular ischemia, biliary injury or sinusoidal damage. In conclusion, this study shows that normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers is technically feasible. It allows assessment of graft viability before transplantation, which opens new avenues for organ selection, therapeutic interventions and preconditioning.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract In addition to its endocrine function, for which it was named, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has substantial neuroprotective actions as well as other physiological effects. We have developed a number of modified TRH analogues as well as cyclic dipeptides structurally related to a major metabolic product of TRH, which have enhanced neuroprotective activity but none of the other major physiological effects of TRH. The extensive structure?activity data developed with these compounds were used to develop a pharmacophore model. Subsequently, a web-based pharmacophore searching program was used to query several large three-dimensional databases. Of the 219?compounds identified whose structures met the pharmacophore model, 15 were chosen for study in a classical model of neuronal cell death in vitro; five of these, 2?6, showed neuroprotective activity. Thus, pharmacophore modeling developed from neuroprotective small peptides can be used to identify novel lead compounds as neuroprotective agents.

An analysis of the stereochemical requirements for high-affinity interaction with these receptors was performed. We identified two highly potent and selective competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, (5S,αR)-1 and (5S,αR)-4, which exhibit good in?vitro neuroprotective activity and in?vivo anticonvulsant activity by i.p. administration, suggesting that these molecules may have potential use as therapeutic agents.

AB  - 1 Antagonists acting at the polyamine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, including a number of heterocyclic aminoalcohols related to ifenprodil, were investigated to establish their functional interaction at the NMDA receptor and their neuroprotective profile. 2 In murine cultured neocortical neurones, NMDA (100?m)-stimulated production of guanosine 3?:5?-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was blocked by N-l([thienyl]-cyclohexyl)-piperidine (1 ?m) and by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 ?m). Ifenprodil and structurally related heterocyclic aminoalcohols inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the NMDAstimulated, NO-dependent production of cyclic GMP; rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 3 All of the polyamine NMDA antagonists blocked NMDA (300 ?m)-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium concentrations as measured by changes in the fluorescence of pre-loaded fluo-3-acetoxy methyl ester. Rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > 840S > tibalosine > threotibalosine. 4 In a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the polyamine NMDA antagonists as blockers of NMDA-induced cytotoxicity, all of the drugs were found to inhibit the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase after the exposure of the murine neocortical cultures to NMDA (100 ?m, 5 h). Rank potency order was: 2309 BT > ifenprodil > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 5 These results provide direct evidence that polyamine NMDA antagonists produce a functional blockade of the NMDA receptor complex. The heterocyclic aminoalcohols described herein, like ifenprodil, block NMDA-mediated elevation of intracellular NO and calcium, two key events in the excitotoxic cascade, and are cytoprotective.

AB  - Abstract Lanthanides, once termed rare-earth elements, are not as sparce in the environment as their traditional name suggests. Mean litospheric concentrations are in fact comparable to the physiologically fundamental elements such as iodine, cobalt, and selenium. Recent advances in medical technology have resulted in accumulation of lanthanides presenting potential exposure to both our central and peripheral nervous systems. Extensive and detailed studies on these peculiar active metals in the context of their influence on neural functions are therefore urgently required. Almost all neurochemical effects of trivalent lanthanide ions appear to result from the similarity of their radii to the key signaling ion calcium. Lanthanides, especially La3+ and Gd3+ block different types of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels in human and animal neurons, regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release, as well as synaptic activity. Lanthanides also act as modulators of several ionotropic receptors, e.g., GABA, NMDA, and kainate and can also affect numerous signaling mechanisms including NF-?B and apoptotic-related endoplasmic reticulum IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways. Several lanthanide ions may cause oxidative neuronal injuries and functional impairment by promoting reactive oxygen species production. However, cerium and yttrium oxides have some unique and promising neuroprotective properties, being able to decrease free radical cell injury and even alleviate motor impairment and cognitive function in animal models of multiple sclerosis and mild traumatic brain damage, respectively. In conclusion, lanthanides affect various neurophysiological processes, altering a large spectrum of brain functions. Thus, a deeper understanding of their potential mechanistic roles during disease and as therapeutic agents requires urgent elucidation.
