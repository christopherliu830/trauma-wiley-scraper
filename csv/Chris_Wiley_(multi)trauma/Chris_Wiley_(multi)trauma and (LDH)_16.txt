AB  - Abstract Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses have been identified as key elements of neuronal cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which inflammatory responses contribute to apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with fipronil (FPN). Based on the cytotoxic mechanism of FPN, we examined the neuroprotective effects of meloxicam against FPN-induced neuronal cell death. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with FPN induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-9 and -3, leading to nuclear condensation. In addition, FPN induced oxidative stress and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) via inflammatory stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with meloxicam enhanced the viability of FPN-exposed cells through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response. FPN activated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibitors of MAPK abolished FPN-induced COX-2 expression. Meloxicam also attenuated FPN-induced cell death by reducing MAPK-mediated pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, we observed both nuclear accumulation of p53 and enhanced levels of cytosolic p53 in a concentration-dependent manner after FPN treatment. Pretreatment of cells with meloxicam blocked the translocation of p53 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Together, these data suggest that meloxicam may exert anti-apoptotic effects against FPN-induced cytotoxicity by both attenuating oxidative stress and inhibiting the inflammatory cascade via inactivation of MAPK and p53 signaling.

AB  - Abstract To guide the natural bone regeneration process, bone tissue engineering strategies rely on the development of a scaffold architecture that mimics the extracellular matrix and incorporates important extracellular signaling molecules, which promote fracture healing and bone formation pathways. Incorporation of growth factors into particles embedded within the scaffold can offer both protection of protein bioactivity and a sustained release profile. In this work, a novel method to immobilize carrier nanoparticles within scaffold pores is proposed. A biodegradable, osteoconductive, porous chitosan scaffold was fabricated via the ?freeze-drying method,? leading to scaffolds with a storage modulus of 8.5 kPa and 300??m pores, in line with existing bone scaffold properties. Next, poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) nanoparticles were synthesized and immobilized to the scaffold via carbodiimide-crosslinker chemistry. A fluorescent imaging study confirmed that the conventional methods of protein and nanocarrier incorporation into scaffolds can lead to over 60% diffusion out of the scaffold within the first 5 min of implantation, and total disappearance within 4?weeks. The novel method of nanocarrier immobilization to the scaffold backbone via carbodiimide-crosslinker chemistry allows full retention of particles for up to 4?weeks within the scaffold bulk, with no negative effects on the viability and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Abstract Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is an emerging tick-borne disease. It is spread by the black-legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis that serves as the vector for six human pathogens. HGA is still rarely reported in solid organ transplant recipients. In solid organ transplant recipients, orchitis has been reported secondary to chickenpox, tuberculosis and infections due to Listeria monocytogenes and Nocardia asteroides. Orchitis as a presenting feature of HGA infection has only been reported in animals. We present a unique case of a renal transplant recipient with HGA that presented as orchitis. We also compare the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of our patient with other cases of HGA in transplant recipients. To the best of our knowledge, our patient is one of the first cases of A phagocytophilum mono-infection causing a classical presentation of orchitis in a transplant patient.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Eccentric exercise affects muscles differentially according to intensity, duration, and previous exposure to the specific exercise activity. We used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences to localize and quantify muscle damage following step exercise and to determine correlations between transverse relaxation time (T2) and other markers of muscle damage. Eight women performed two-step exercise bouts (30?min) separated by 8 weeks. Blood samples, MR scans, measurements of muscle strength, and muscle soreness were obtained immediately before, after, and up to 9 days after each bout. Resting muscle T2 (40.3±0.6?ms) increased exclusively in m. Adductor magnus (AM) in the thigh performing eccentric contractions and peaked 3 days after bout 1 (73.5±9.7?ms, P<0.05). Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity peaked on day 3 after bout 1 and correlated with T2 in AM (r=0.96, P<0.001). After bout 2 CK and T2 were almost unaffected. This indicates that T2-weighted MRI can be applied to identify muscles from which enzymes are being released into the circulation.

AB  - Abstract We observed that an aqueous extract of this medicinal plant exhibited significant neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in primary cultured rat cortical cells from methanol extracts of the seeds of P. tobira. To further clarify the underlying neuroprotective mechanism(s) of this observed effect, we isolated and identified various active fractions and components. By using such fractionation procedures, four known carotenoids compounds ? tobiraxanthins A1, A2, A3, and B ? were isolated from the n-hexane fraction of methanol extracts from the seeds of P. tobira. Among these four compounds, tobiraxanthins B exhibited significant neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, as indicated by a cell viability of approximately 50%, at concentrations ranging from 0.1??M to 10??M. These findings indicate that, the neuroprotective effects of P. tobira might be due to the inhibition of glutamate-induced toxicity by carotenoids present in the plant.

AB  - Abstract: The enhancing effect of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on oxidative stress with or without a sublethal dose of endotoxin was examined. The mortality of mice treated with recombinant human TNF-α (1X104 units/mouse, intravenously) and endotoxin (0.01-1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was dependent on the dose of endotoxin. The liver lipid peroxide level, superoxide anion generation and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, especially serum lactate dehydrogenase-5 isozyme leakage, in mice 2-4 hr after administration of recombinant human TNF to endotoxin-pretreated mice (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) were markedly higher than in those without endotoxin, whereas the administration of recombinant human TNF significantly decreased the non-protein sulfhydryl level, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxide activities in the liver of endotoxin-injected mice compared with those in mice treated with recombinant human TNF or endotoxin alone. Furthermore, findings clearly demonstrated that J774A.1 cells stimulated with recombinant human TNF (1X104 units/ml) can effectively produce nitric oxide in the presence of endotoxin, and the production was dependent on the dose of endotoxin (0.01-10 ?g/ml). The level of lipid peroxide in mice 4 hr after administration of recombinant human TNF and lead acetate (50 mg/kg, intravenously) was markedly higher than that in the mice treated with recombinant human TNF alone. By contrast, injection of polymyxin-B (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, an anti-endotoxin drug) markedly decreased the lipid peroxide level in the liver of the mice treated with recombinant human TNF and lead acetate. These findings suggest that the oxidative stress caused by TNF occurs as a enhancing effect of endotoxion or by bacterial translocation from the intestinal gut under reduction of reticuloendothelial system function in various disease states, and that the effect of TNF may cause a marked increase of toxicity of oxidative stress by endotoxin.
