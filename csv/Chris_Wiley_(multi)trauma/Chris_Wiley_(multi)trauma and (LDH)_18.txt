AB  - It has been hypothesized that increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required to support the metabolic demands of rapid malignant cell growth. Using orthotopic mouse models of human glioblastoma (GBM) and renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain, we estimated the activity of the PPP relative to glycolysis by infusing [1,2-13C2]glucose. The [3-13C]lactate/[2,3-13C2]lactate ratio was similar for both the GBM and brain metastasis and their respective surrounding brains (GBM, 0.197?±?0.011 and 0.195?±?0.033, respectively (p?=?1); metastasis: 0.126 and 0.119?±?0.033, respectively). This suggests that the rate of glycolysis is significantly greater than the PPP flux in these tumors, and that the PPP flux into the lactate pool is similar in both tumors. Remarkably, 13C?13C coupling was observed in molecules derived from Krebs cycle intermediates in both tumor types, denoting glucose oxidation. In the renal cell carcinoma, in contrast with GBM, 13C multiplets of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) differed from its precursor glutamate, suggesting that GABA did not derive from a common glutamate precursor pool. In addition, the orthotopic renal tumor, the patient's primary renal mass and brain metastasis were all strongly immunopositive for the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase, as were 84% of tumors on a renal cell carcinoma tissue microarray of the same histology, suggesting that GABA synthesis is cell autonomous in at least a subset of renal cell carcinomas. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 13C-labeled glucose can be used in orthotopic mouse models to study tumor metabolism in vivo and to ascertain new metabolic targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND Diagnosis of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) in patients with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms is challenging without using invasive urodynamic tests. Recently, we showed in vitro that urothelial strips from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) release more ATP than controls. Here, we tested whether urinary ATP can be used as a wall tension transducer non-invasive biomarker to detect BOO in patients with BPH. METHODS 79 male patients with BOO and 22 asymptomatic controls were recruited prospectively. Patients were asked to complete the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire and to void at normal desire into a urinary flowmeter; the postvoid residual volume was determined by suprapubic ultrasonography. Urine samples from all individuals were examined for ATP, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase. RESULTS BOO patients had significantly higher (P?<?0.001) urinary ATP normalized by the voided volume (456?±?36?nmol) than age-matched controls (209?±?35?nmol). Urinary ATP amounts increased with the voided volume, but the slope of this rise was higher in BOO patients than in controls. A negative correlation was detected between urinary ATP and flow rate parameters, namely maximal flow rate (r?=??0.310, P?=?0.005), Siroky flow-volume normalization (r?=??0.324, P?=?0.004), and volume-normalized flow rate index (r?=??0.320, P?=?0.012). We found no correlation with LUT symptoms IPSS score. Areas under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were 0.91 (95%CI 0.86?0.96, P?<?0.001) for ATP alone and 0.88 (95%CI 0.81?0.94, P?<?0,001) when adjusted to urinary creatinine. CONCLUSIONS Patients with BOO release higher amounts of ATP into the urine than the control group. The high area under the ROC curve suggests that urinary ATP can be a high-sensitive non-invasive biomarker of BOO, which may have a discriminative value of detrusor competence when comparing BPH patients with low urinary flow rates.

AB  - Abstract Neurological disorders occur in the central and peripheral nervous system and include Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Activation of the innate immune system inevitably occurs in all forms of neurological disorders. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimolecular complex that can sense danger signals associated with neurological disorders. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 maturation in microglia, where neuroinflammation contributes to neurological disease development and progression. Thus, this review attempts to elucidate the current knowledge regarding NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Recent scientific findings with respect to neuroprotective effects of dietary phytochemicals against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neurological disorders summarized in this review suggest that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by plant-derived phytochemicals could be a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the in vitro cytocompatibility of one-dimensional and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) carbon and inorganic nanomaterial reinforced polymeric nanocomposites fabricated using biodegradable polymer poly (propylene fumarate), crosslinking agent N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) and following nanomaterials: single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, single and multiwalled graphene oxide nanoribbons, graphene oxide nanoplatelets, molybdenum disulfide nanoplatelets, or tungsten disulfide nanotubes dispersed between 0.02 and 0.2 wt% concentrations in the polymer. The extraction media of unreacted components, crosslinked nanocomposites and their degradation products were examined for effects on viability and attachment using two cell lines: NIH3T3 fibroblasts and MC3T3 preosteoblasts. The extraction media of unreacted PPF/NVP elicited acute dose-dependent cytotoxicity attributed to leaching of unreacted components into cell culture media. However, extraction media of crosslinked nanocomposites showed no dose dependent adverse effects. Further, all crosslinked nanocomposites showed high viability (78?100%), high cellular attachment (40?55%), and spreading that was confirmed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Degradation products of nanocomposites showed a mild dose-dependent cytotoxicity possibly due to acidic degradation components of PPF. In general, compared to PPF control, none of the nanocomposites showed significant differences in cellular response to unreacted components, crosslinked nanocomposites and their degradation products. Initial minor cytotoxic response and lower cell attachment numbers were observed only for a few nanocomposite groups; these effects were absent at later time points for all PPF nanocomposites. The favorable cytocompatibility results for all the nanocomposites opens avenues for in vivo safety and efficacy studies for bone tissue engineering applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? A family with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type III was studied. Twenty patients and 10 of their healthy siblings were clinically examined and questioned about their medical history. Blood sampling and bone marrow aspirations were also performed. Forty-five percent of the patients reported symptoms of anaemia and 35% regularly felt weakness, fatigue, or headache. However, the majority of the patients regarded themselves as healthy. The bone marrow showed a uniform picture of erythroid hyperplasia with multinuclear erythroblasts and gigantoblasts with up to 12 nuclei. There was laboratory evidence of intravascular haemolysis and mild anaemia. We also observed a high prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (3 cases) and myeloma (1 case) among the patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare but important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity. Predicting the severity and outcome of AP in pediatric patients can be challenging because there are few validated severity scoring systems. Moreover, the etiology of pediatric AP in the Japanese population is different from that of Western populations. The performance of severity scores in pediatric AP with a high prevalence of severe cases is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of existing severity scoring systems when used for Japanese children at a tertiary care center. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of all children (≤18?years) treated for AP at between 2002 and 2012 at National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo. The modified Glasgow acute pancreatitis severity score (modified Glasgow), Ranson criteria (Ranson), Balthazar computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and pediatric acute pancreatitis severity (PAPS) score were assessed for their ability to distinguish severe pancreatitis from the milder forms. Results Thirty-three Japanese children with AP were identified. Among them, 37 episodes were analyzed for the performance of the scoring systems and 33 for the etiology. The most common etiology of AP was structural abnormality (n = 8). Sensitivity for the modified Glasgow, Ranson, PAPS, and CTSI was 42.9%, 52.4%, 81.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, while specificity was 81.3%, 81.3%, 37.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Conclusion We found PAPS to be the most reliable when used for discriminating the severe form of AP from the milder forms at a Japanese tertiary pediatric care center.
