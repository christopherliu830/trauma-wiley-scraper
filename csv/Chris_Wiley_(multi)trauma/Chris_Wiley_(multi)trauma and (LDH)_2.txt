AB  - Overview Melanoma comprises a wide variety of malignant cell types arising from the skin, the mucous membranes, and the pigmented cells of the eye. While these tumors are all classified as melanoma and share a common molecular biology of pigmentation and biological resemblance to cells of neural crest origin, important distinctions in other molecular characteristics and patterns of exposure to ultraviolet light as a carcinogen determine their clinical natural history, including the response to therapeutic interventions. While the majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and curable with minimal surgery, melanoma has the potential for early and widespread dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for primary, regional, and many cases of single- or oligo-metastatic disease, but systemic therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis for metastatic melanoma, particularly immunotherapies that enhance existing cellular immunity. The rapid discovery of new molecular targets, immunotherapy combinations (including the use of radiotherapy), and understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance are likely to lead to even greater improvements in the prognosis for patients with melanoma in the near future.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination.

AB  - Objective This study sought to assess the long-term clinical benefits and predictors of survival of trans-catheter aortic valve closure in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients. Background LVADs have been shown to increase survival and quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, severe aortic insufficiency (AI) can develop in up to 50% of patients at 12 months resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Trans-catheter treatment of LVAD associated AI has emerged as a potential alternative to surgical treatment. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure using an Amplatzer Multi-Fenestrated Septal Occluder ?Cribriform? device to assess potential clinical and procedural factors associated with survival. Student's t-tests were used to compare baseline patient demographics and procedural characteristics, as well as patient outcomes immediately post procedure and at 6 months. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 10 patients (70% male, median age 59 years) were included. Technical success was accomplished in 100% of patients with a 6 month survival rate of 30% (3/10). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had a higher rate of pre-procedural clinical co-morbidities, an increased likelihood of right ventricular failure, and received larger occluder devices. Conclusions Trans-catheter aortic valve closure successfully treats late severe AI in LVAD patients, however, the presence or development of right heart failure portends a worse prognosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the factors involved in the development of right ventricular failure, and potential treatment, in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Abstract The paper overviews various methods that are used for the analysis of output signals generated by enzyme-based logic systems. The considered methods include optical techniques (optical absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance), electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, potentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, conductivity measurements, use of field effect transistor devices, pH measurements), and various mechanoelectronic methods (using atomic force microscope, quartz crystal microbalance). Although each of the methods is well known for various bioanalytical applications, their use in combination with the biomolecular logic systems is rather new and sometimes not trivial. Many of the discussed methods have been combined with the use of signal-responsive materials to transduce and amplify biomolecular signals generated by the logic operations. Interfacing of biocomputing logic systems with electronics and ?smart? signal-responsive materials allows logic operations be extended to actuation functions; for example, stimulating molecular release and switchable features of bioelectronic devices, such as biofuel cells. The purpose of this review article is to emphasize the broad variability of the bioanalytical systems applied for signal transduction in biocomputing processes. All bioanalytical systems discussed in the article are exemplified with specific logic gates and multi-gate networks realized with enzyme-based biocatalytic cascades.

AB  - Abstract Electrodes can provide information on neural function and stimulate neural activity. These neural electrodes can provide remarkable benefit to people suffering physical trauma or neural disease. Traditional metal electrodes have shortcomings related to poor biostability, cytocompatibility, and a rigid structure that maps poorly to tissue. Organic conductors can be formed with various chemical and physical properties to create improved electrode-neural interfaces. The processability of organic conductors enables their use in advanced fabrication methods. This review details the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conducting polymers for neural interfacing. Construction of novel neural electrode architectures via advanced fabrication processes is also addressed.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 1052?1063. Abstract Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) improve functional outcome in a number of disease models through suppression of inflammation. However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Preclinical studies for neurodegenerative diseases have shown a multi-targeted approach to be successful in the treatment of these complex disorders with several pathoetiological pathways. Polycyclic compounds, such as NGP1-01 (7a), have demonstrated the ability to target multiple mechanisms of the complex etiology and are referred to as multifunctional compounds. These compounds have served as scaffolds with the ability to attenuate Ca2+ overload and excitotoxicity through several pathways. In this study, our focus was on mitigating Ca2+ overload through the L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of several novel polycyclic compounds. We determined the IC50 values for both the pentacycloundecylamines and the triquinylamines by means of a high-throughput fluorescence calcium flux assay utilizing Fura-2/AM. The potential of these compounds to offer protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death was also evaluated. Overall, 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane (NGP1-01, 7a) had the most favorable pharmacological profile with an IC50 value of 86?µM for LTCC inhibition and significant reduction of hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. In general, the triquinylamines were more active as LTCC blockers than the oxa-pentacycloundecylamines. The aza-pentacycloundecylamines were potent LTCC inhibitors, with 8-hydroxy-N-phenylethyl-8,11-azapentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane (8b) also able to offer significant protection in the cell viability assays.

AB  - SUMMARY When IAT is used, the patient's shed blood is collected continuously from the wound site during surgery. The salvaged red cells are stored in a dedicated reservoir and subsequently processed by cell separation (continuous centrifugation), washed with saline, concentrated and retransfused to the patient. In the context of perioperative blood saving strategies, IAT has gained standard-of-care status in many surgical procedures as it is especially cost-effective when the anticipated intraoperative blood loss is likely to exceed 1000 mL (major orthopedic, cardiac, vascular and emergency trauma surgery). IAT is not primarily recommended for cancer surgery or whenever the operative field is contaminated. Intraoperative plasmapheresis (IP) is used in cardiac surgery to minimize coagulation deficiencies caused by the traumatizing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on platelets. A substantial amount of the patient's circulating platelets is withdrawn prior to heparinization and initiation of CPB. The collected autologous platelet-rich plasma is then stored at room temperature, preserving platelet function and plasmatic coagulation factors, and retransfused to the patient after heparin reversal. There is controversy about the actual blood saving benefit of IP, but this method may be effective in complicated procedures precipitating high blood loss and long CPB times. In addition, IP may be used when other autologous whole blood harvesting techniques are not an option.
