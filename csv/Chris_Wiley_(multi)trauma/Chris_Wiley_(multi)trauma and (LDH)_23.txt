AB  - Summary. New methods are described for platelet isolation and buoyant density determination using low-speed centrifugation in continuous density gradients of Percoll. The conditions used do not induce loss of granule or cytoplasmic markers and enable reproducible platelet frequency distributions to be obtained in linear density gradients. Such frequency distributions are normal with a mode of 1·0645 ± 0·0015 g cm?3 (mean ± SD, n= 20). Platelets fixed in 0·1% glutaraldehyde show a modal density of 1·0712 ± 0·0005 g cm?3. Content of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-thromboglobulin and 3H-serotonin correlate closely with platelet numbers throughout the density distribution. The frequency distribution of platelet volume between 2·2 and 21 fl fits a log normal model and cell volume in density subfractions from the most dense to the least dense also approximate log normality. There is a positive correlation between mean platelet volume and buoyant density with a small increment between the least and the most dense extremes. Platelet subfractions separated by volume using a FACS II cell sorter differ substantially from each other in cell volume but the difference in mean density of four different volume fractions is negligible. In discontinuous density gradients of Stractan factors other than platelet density must influence the separation of platelets, as rebanding of platelets from interfaces shows a wide variation in buoyant density when analysed in continuous gradients. It is concluded that analysis of platelet buoyant density in continuous Percoll gradients supports the view that platelet density, like platelet volume, is determined primarily during thrombocytopoiesis and that volume and density are largely independent elements of platelet heterogeneity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Wound healing is compromised by critical colonization and infection with bacteria. Hence, antimicrobial agents are used clinically to decrease the bacterial load and promote wound healing. Polihexanide (PHMB) has been found to be effective against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms and is increasingly utilized in rinsing solutions or in combination with wound dressings because of its good biocompatibility. In the present study, a co-culture of human keratinocytes and Staphylococcus aureus was established to serve as an in vitro model for infected wounds. Incubation of keratinocytes with increasing concentrations of S. aureus led to a dose-dependent decline of cell viability and proliferation. Lactate dehydrogenase release and interleukin-8 liberation were found to be elevated under these conditions. Polihexanide dose-dependently was able to protect keratinocytes from bacterial damage and re-establish normal human cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, a dressing consisting of biocellulose derived from Acetobacter xylinum with the addition of polihexanide was adept to safeguard keratinocytes against S. aureus. In conclusion, the co-culture system presented embodies a valuable tool as a model system for infected cells in a non-healing wound. Furthermore, the results obtained support the favorable function of polihexanide in the treatment of infected chronic wounds.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Resilience and recovery are of increasing importance in the field of alcohol dependence (AD). This paper describes how imaging studies in man can be used to assess the neurobiological correlates of resilience and, if longitudinal, of disease trajectories, progression rates and markers for recovery to inform treatment and prevention options. Methods Original papers on recovery and resilience in alcohol addiction and its neurobiological correlates were identified from PubMed and have been analyzed and condensed within a systematic literature review. Results Findings deriving from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have identified links between increased resilience and less task-elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia, and benefits of heightened neural pre-frontal cortex (PFC) engagement regarding resilience in a broader sense; namely, resilience against relapse in early abstinence of AD. Furthermore, findings consistently propose at least partial recovery of brain glucose metabolism and executive and general cognitive functioning, as well as structural plasticity effects throughout the brain of alcohol-dependent patients during the course of short-, medium- and long-term abstinence, even when patients only lowered their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. Additionally, specific factors were found that appear to influence these observed brain recovery processes in AD, e.g. genotype-dependent neuronal (re)growth, gender-specific neural recovery effects, critical interfering effects of psychiatric comorbidities, additional smoking or marijuana influences or adolescent alcohol abuse. Conclusions Neuroimaging research has uncovered neurobiological markers that appear to be linked to resilience and improved recovery capacities that are furthermore influenced by various factors such as gender or genetics. Consequently, future system-oriented approaches may help to establish a broad neuroscience-based research framework for alcohol dependence.
