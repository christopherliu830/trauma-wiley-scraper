AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based gene therapy has been considered in the treatment of many degenerative diseases. Gene-modified stem cells should maintain its reproductive activity without losing stem cell properties, including genetic phenotype and differentiation potential. In the study, a novel poly (amidoamine) with pendant aminobutyl group (PAA-BA) designed by our group was used in the transfection of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and the cellular properties post-transfection were evaluated, including DNA content, colony forming capacity, genetic phenotype, and multi-directional differentiation. Two classical non-viral gene delivery vectors, polyethylenimine (PEI) and Lipofectamine 2000 (LP2000) were also used. Compared to non-transfected group, PAA-BA showed minor decreased DNA content but maintained BMSCs? phenotype, reproductive activity and multi-differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic differentiation). Both PAA-BA and PEI transfected BMSCs demonstrated improved osteogenic differentiation ability at late stage but suppressed adipogenic as well as mature neural differentiation in vitro. LP2000 and PEI transfected BMSCs displayed significantly lower DNA content and reproductive activity. These findings suggest that PAA-BA is one of safe gene delivery vectors in BMSCs transfection and plays a role in stem cell's osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation. This study proposes the potential application of PAA-BA in BMSCs based gene therapy, in particular bone and nerve relative diseases. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Objective:? Pleural involvement of salmonella infection is very rare and we are not aware of any case of salmonella empyema in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study is to report our experience of recurrent empyema due to Salmonella enteritidis with bacteremia in a patient on hemodialysis. Case report: A 53-year-old woman with end stage renal disease, having been on hemodialysis for 10 days, was brought to the emergency department due to fever and shortness of breath for 2 days. Her initial physical examination revealed diminished breathing sound over right lung field. The chest radiographs disclosed right pleural effusion and pleural fluid analysis included a white cell count of 13800(N/L:95/5), LDH 2534?U/L, protein 2.7?g/dL, and sugar 10?mg/dL. Right side empyema was noted. Sonography revealed splenomegaly. Salmonella enteritidis was identified from the cultures of blood and pleural fluid. After antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and pleural pigtail drainage, fever subsided and pleural drainage tube was removed. However, thoracoscopic debridement was done later because of recurrent empyema within one week after removing the drainage tube. Computed tomography revealed pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and splenomegaly, but there was no evidence of aortic aneurysm formation or infectious process of aorta. Overall the patient received 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone treatment and 3 months of oral ciprofloxacin. The follow-up CXR revealed minimal pleural effusion. Conclusion:? Nontyphoidal salmonella infection can present with empyema and bacteremia in patients on hemodialysis. Adequate drainage and antimicrobial therapy may be necessary to treat such patients effectively.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.
