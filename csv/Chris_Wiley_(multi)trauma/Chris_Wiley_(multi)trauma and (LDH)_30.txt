AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Summary Gender disparity is recognized in multiple gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases. Some conditions are nearly specific to women, and no state is more unique to women than pregnancy. Disorders can be specific to pregnancy, or induced or exacerbated by pregnancy-related physiologic changes. This chapter will address this special interplay.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of carbamazepine and placebo on measures of toxicity in frail nursing home patients. DESIGN: A nonrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. SETTING: Two nursing homes in Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five subjects (mean age 84.5 years) with dementia. INTERVENTION: Carbamazepine and placebo during two 5-week periods separated by a 2-week washout. The modal dose for each patient was 300 mg/day. MEASUREMENTS: Adverse experiences, comorbid events, and physical signs and symptoms were assessed continuously, and laboratory data were examined at the beginning and end of each treatment period. RESULTS: One subject died with a pneumonia (and elevated white blood cell count), and one subject developed probable carbamazepine-induced tics. There was a minimal drop in hematocrit and a slight elevation of liver enzymes, none of which was clinically significant. There was otherwise no excess of adversity or comorbid events on carbamazepine versus placebo, and there was no change in electrolytes or other laboratory measures. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that carbamazepine in this dose range was well tolerated for the 5-week treatment period in this frail sample. These data supplement the literature regarding carbamazepine toxicity, which is devoid of controlled studies in older subjects.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pleural infection is a condition commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the most recent data regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, and the management of pleural infection. Data source Medline was searched for articles related to pleural infection using the terms ?pleural infection,? ?empyema,? and ?parapneumonic.? The search was limited to the years 1997-2017. Only human studies and reports in English were included. Results A rise in the incidence of pleural infection is seen worldwide. Despite the improvement in healthcare practices, the mortality from pleural infection remains high. The role of oral microflora in the etiology of pleural infection is firmly established. A concise review of the recent insights on the pathogenesis of pleural infections is presented. A particular focus is made on the role of tPA, DNAse and similar substances and their interaction with inflammatory cells and how this affects the pathogenesis and treatment of pleural infection. Conclusion Pleural infection is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as a considerable economic burden. The role of medical management is expanding thanks to the widespread use of newer treatments.

AB  - Purpose To present the pathophysiology, differential diagnoses, assessment techniques, and treatment options for hepatic hydrothorax. Data Sources A case study is presented with supporting material from current medical literature. Conclusions Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion caused by the flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through an actual defect in the diaphragm. Successful outcomes depend on early detection and timely referral of often-subtle lung involvement. Implications for Practice Although incidence is reported to be as high as 12% in cirrhotic patients, standard medical references attach little importance to pul-monary risks in this population. Hepatic hydrothorax should always be considered in the cirrhotic patient with a pleural effusion.
