AB  - Summary The use of flow cytometry (FCM) in the study of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) is particularly important. It is able to reliably discriminate between true clonal proliferations and the reactive lymphocytosis seen as a response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Before any potentially clonal disorder can be categorized, it is important to have a basic understanding of T and B-cell lymphoid ontogeny. The pattern of surface cluster differentiation (CD) antigen expression indicates the degree of maturity, the possible relationship with the lymph node germinal centre and sometimes the function of the normal cell from which a malignant population is derived. Many lymphoproliferative disorders and exfoliating lymphoid lymphomas can be encountered in clinical practice. These disorders are extremely different in their biological basis, presentation, morphology and immunophenotype. An accurate diagnosis can only be made when all these characteristics are carefully considered together and not assessed in isolation.

AB  - Abstract Chronic alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) have been shown to interact with normal age-related volume loss to exacerbate brain atrophy with increasing age. However, chronic cigarette smoking, a highly co-morbid condition in AUD and its influence on age-related brain atrophy have not been evaluated. We performed 1.5?T quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in non-smoking controls [non-smoking light drinking controls (nsCONs); n?=?54], smoking light drinking controls (sCONs, n?=?34), and one-week abstinent, treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent (ALC) non-smokers (nsALCs, n?=?35) and smokers (sALCs, n?=?43), to evaluate the independent and interactive effects of alcohol dependence and chronic smoking on regional cortical and subcortical brain volumes, emphasizing the brain reward/executive oversight system (BREOS). The nsCONs and sALCs showed greater age-related volume losses than the nsALCs in the dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC), total cortical BREOS, superior parietal lobule and putamen. The nsALCs and sALCs demonstrated smaller volumes than the nsCONs in most cortical region of interests (ROIs). The sCONs had smaller volumes than the nsCONs in the DPFC, insula, inferior parietal lobule, temporal pole/parahippocampal region and all global cortical measures. The nsALCs and sALCs had smaller volumes than the sCONs in the DPFC, superior temporal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobules, precuneus and all global cortical measures. Volume differences between the nsALCs and sALCs were observed only in the putamen. Alcohol consumption measures were not related to volumes in any ROI for ALC; smoking severity measures were related to corpus callosum volume in the sCONs and sALCs. The findings indicate that consideration of smoking status is necessary for a better understanding of the factors contributing to regional brain atrophy in AUD.

AB  - Abstract Cigarette smoke is known to be associated with the incidence of a variety of pulmonary diseases, and alveolar macrophages are a key player in the defense mechanism against inhalable toxicants. Herein, we have found that a hydrophilic fraction in smoke extracts from 3R4F reference cigarettes (CSE) contains high concentrations of volatile substances compared to cigarette smoke condensate (amphoteric fraction). We also identified the toxic mechanism of CSE using MH-S, a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line. CSE decreased cell viability accompanying increased lactate dehydrogenase release. Additionally, mitochondrial volume and the potential increased along with enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins and decreased adenosine triphosphate production. Similarly, CSE clearly induced increase of catalase activity and intracellular calcium concentration and decrease of endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome volume at the highest dose. More interestingly, damaged organelles accumulated in the cytosol, and CSE-containing particles specifically penetrated to mitochondria. Meanwhile, any significant change in autophagy related protein expression was not found in CSE-treated cells. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of CSE on secretion of inflammatory related cytokines and chemokines, considering the relationship between organelle damage and the disturbed immune response. Very importantly, we found that expression of innate and adaptive immunity related mediators is disrupted following CSE exposure. Taken together, we suggest that CSE may cause the accumulation of damaged organelles in the cytoplasm by impairing selective autophagic function. In addition, this accumulation is responsible for the inadequate ability of immune cells to repair the damage of lung tissue following exposure to CSE.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating, and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the Committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Seventh Edition, like its predecessor, has consistently applied the category and grading system definitions in the fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was used since the fourth edition has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. The Seventh Edition discusses 87 fact sheets (14 new fact sheets since the Sixth Edition) for therapeutic apheresis diseases and medical conditions, with 179 indications, which are separately graded and categorized within the listed fact sheets. Several diseases that are Category IV which have been described in detail in previous editions and do not have significant new evidence since the last publication are summarized in a separate table. The Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue serves as a key resource that guides the utilization of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of human disease. J. Clin.
