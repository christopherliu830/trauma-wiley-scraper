AB  - Abstract In the current study, we describe the synthesis, material characteristics, and cytocompatibility of conducting poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL)-based nano-composite films. Electrically conducting carbon nano-fillers (carbon nano-fiber (CNF), nano-graphite (NG), and liquid exfoliated graphite (G)) were used to prepare porous film type scaffolds using modified solvent casting methods. The electrical conductivity of the nano-composite films was increased when carbon nano-fillers were incorporated in the PCL matrix. CNF-based nano-composite films showed the highest increase in electrical conductivity. The presence of an ionic solution significantly improved the conductivity of some of the polymers, however at least 24 h was required to absorb the simulated ion solutions. CNF-based nano-composite films were found to have good thermo-mechanical properties compared to other conducting polymer films due to better dispersion and alignment in the critical direction. Increased nano-filler content increased the crystallisation temperature. Analysis of cell viability revealed no increase in cell death on any of the polymers compared to tissue culture plastic controls, or compared to PCL polymer without nano-composites. The scaffolds showed some variation when tested for PC12 cell attachment and proliferation, however all the polymers supported PC12 attachment and differentiation in the absence of cell adhesion molecules. In general, CNF-based nano-composite films with highest electrical conductivity and moderate roughness showed highest cell attachment and proliferation. These polymers are promising candidates for use in neural applications in the area of bionics and tissue engineering due to their unique properties. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4 h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome on patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0?2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III?IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL. Low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor in DLBCL.

AB  - Abstract Neonatal (P7) brain hypoxia?ischemia (HI) induces intracellular Bax protein shifts to the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it triggers the activation of the respective cell death signaling cascades. When compared with HI-treated rat pups, 100% O2 resuscitation of HI-treated rat pups increases HI-induced ER Bax levels, ER-mediated cell death signaling, and resultant lesion volume and inflammation due to increased necrotic-like cell death. To better characterize the role of Bax intracellular shuttling ER cell death signaling and necrotic-like cell death, we used rotenone-treated P5 neuronal cortical cultures to increase ER Bax levels and subsequent cell death signaling. We treated P5 primary cortical neurons with 25 ?M and 100 ?M rotenone as an apoptotic or necrotic-like stimulus, respectively, and measured intracellular organelle Bax levels and the subsequent activation of ER/mitochondrial cell death signaling. The 25 ?M rotenone treatment promptly increased nuclear Bax levels followed by a later increase in mitochondrial Bax levels and caspase-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin. The 100 ?M rotenone treatment also resulted in an early increase in nuclear Bax levels followed by a subsequent increase in ER Bax levels and calpain-mediated cleavage of α-fodrin. After pretreatment with the immunosuppressive and neuroprotective FK506, there was a delay in Bax intracellular shifts and cell death signaling for both the 25 and 100 ?M rotenone treatments. These results suggest that the different outcomes of apoptotic-like vs. necrotic-like cell death resulting from the treatment of neuronal cultures with rotenone at 25 and 100?M rotenone reflect changes in the intracellular trafficking of Bax among different organelles. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Abstract Apoptosis is a controlled cell-death process mediated inter alia by proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Some proteins previously shown to promote the apoptotic process were found to have nonapoptotic functions as well. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, respond to brain derangements by becoming activated to contend with the brain damage. Activated microglia can also undergo activation-induced cell death. Previous studies have addressed the role of core apoptotic proteins in the death process, but whether these proteins also play a role or not in the activation process is not been reported. Here we explore the effect of the BH3-only protein Bid on the immunological features of microglia and macrophages. Our results showed that Bid regulates both the phagocytotic activities and the inflammatory profiles of these cells. Deficiency of Bid attenuated the phagocytotic activity of primary microglia and peritoneal macrophages. It also changed the expression profile of distinct inflammation-related genes in lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia and peritoneal macrophages in vitro and in an in vivo sepsis-like paradigm. Notably, similar changes followed downregulation of Bid in the N9 microglial cell line. Cell death could not be detected in any of the systems examined. Our findings demonstrate that Bid can regulate the immunological profiles of activated microglial and macrophages, via a novel nonapoptotic activity. In view of the critical role of these cells in various pathologies, including acute and chronic brain insults, our finings suggest that impairments in Bid expression may contribute to these pathologies also via a nonapoptotic activity. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Bioactive glasses (BAGs) are being investigated for the repair and reconstruction of bone defects, as they exhibit osteoconductive and osteostimulatory potential. However, successful bone regeneration requires also the neovascularization of the construct which is, among other factors, guided by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, BAG S53P4 (53% SiO2, 23% Na2O, 20% CaO, 4% P2O5) is investigated in relation to VEGF-release and response of fibroblast cells. Human CD-18CO fibroblasts were cultivated in contact with different granules of different sizes (0.5?0.8 mm, 1.0?2.0 mm, and 2.0?3.15 mm) and at different concentrations (0?1 wt/vol % of BAG) for 72 h. The analysis of morphology revealed no toxic effect for all granule sizes and concentrations. Compared with the reference, lactate dehydrogenase-activity of CCD-18CO cells increased in contact with BAG samples. The VEGF release from CCD-18CO fibroblasts cultured on different granule sizes and at different concentrations after 72 h of incubation was quantified. It was found that particles of 0.5?0.8 mm and 1.0?2.0 mm in size enhanced VEGF release, whereas BAG particle sizes of 2.0?3.15 mm led to inhibition of VEGF release. The results are relevant to understand the influence of the particle size and concentration of BAG S53P4 on VEGF expression and neovascularization. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We have investigated the role of Ca2+ accumulation and neuronal injury in cerebellar granule neurons after glutamate receptor overactivation. After the removal of the free cytosolic Ca2+ we identified an extensive second Ca2+ fraction (SCF) that is retained within the neurons after glutamate receptor overactivation. The SCF reaches a plateau within 10?min with the magnitude of this SCF accumulation reflecting the extent of the neuronal injury that occurs within the neurons. The existence of this SCF is sensitive to both NMDA receptor antagonists and mitochondrial inhibitors but is unaffected by agents that deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, indicating that this Ca2+ fraction may be located within the mitochondria. Through the isolation of mitochondria from cerebellar granule neurons treated with glutamate we have shown that the majority of the SCF is mitochondrial in location. On the removal of the glutamate stimulus the SCF recovers at a slower rate than the free Ca2+ concentration within the neuron. This is intriguing, as it implies a capacity to remember previous excitatory events. Most significantly we have shown that a short pre-application of subthreshold glutamate or kainate blocks both SCF Ca2+ accumulation and extensive neuronal injury in response to high concentrations of glutamate. These findings may be relevant to the observations of pre-conditioning in the brain and heart.

AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Factors associated with performing urgent coronary angiography (UCA) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were identified. Background Current guidelines for resuscitated OHCA patients recommend UCA if there is ST-elevation on post-arrest electrocardiogram or high suspicion of acute myocardial infarction. Some have advocated for UCA in all OHCA regardless of suspected etiology. The reasons for variations in performing UCA are not well understood. Methods A retrospective analysis of subjects presenting with resuscitated OHCA to a single academic medical center from 12/15/2007 to 8/31/2014 was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients undergoing UCA, defined as angiography within 6 hr of presentation, were compared with those not undergoing UCA. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of UCA. Results A total of 323 resuscitated OHCA patients (mean age, 64 years; women, 35%) were included in the analysis; 107 (33.1%) underwent coronary angiography during their hospitalization and 66 (20.4%) underwent UCA. Multivariable adjusted factors associated with UCA were ST-elevation [odds ratio (OR) 14.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.28?34.24, P?<?0.001], initial shockable rhythm (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.52?8.97, P?=?0.004), and history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.43?7.95, P?=?0.005). Higher age (OR 0.71 per decade, 95% CI 0.55?0.92, P?=?0.01) and obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02?0.38, P?=?0.001) were negatively associated with UCA. Conclusions In resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, ST-elevation, shockable rhythm, and history of CAD were associated with performing urgent coronary angiography; older patients and those with obvious non-cardiac causes of arrest were negatively associated.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Despite numerous hypotheses regarding the action of laser light, the use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury is still being verified. The present study investigates the effects of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on I/R injury of the musculus gracilis in rats. Materials and Methods I/R injury of the musculus gracilis flap was induced in male adult Sprague?Dawley rats (n?=?84). Rats were subdivided depending on treatment into four subgroups: (1) healthy group, (2) I/R injury without irradiation, (3) R group irradiated only during reperfusion after injury, and (4) IR group irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion injury. LLLT (AlGaInP; ??=?670?nm; 4?J/cm2; 40?mW/cm2) was applied to the injured muscle four times daily until euthanasia. Results Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels were significantly lower (P<0.05) in the irradiated groups during the first 12?120?hours, while the lower creatine kinase (CK) level reached statistical significance only at 24?hours in the irradiated group when compared to the control group. The number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the gracilis muscle was significantly lower in the treated group only on the second day (P<0.0001). The lowered percentage of necrosis in the muscle tissue was statistically significant after 6 and 10 days of treatment (P<0.0001), while lower atrophy and higher neovascularization were observed at 6?14 days of irradiation (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the group irradiated only during reperfusion and that irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion. Conclusion LLLT confers a protective effect against early inflammatory tissue response, further atrophy, and necrosis of the muscle and it stimulates neovascularization after I/R injury. Lasers Surg.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - ABSTRACT No disease-modifying osteoarthritis (OA) drugs are available to prevent posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Mitochondria (MT) mediate the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases, and recent evidence indicates that MT dysfunction is a peracute (within minutes to hours) response of cartilage to mechanical injury. The goal of this study was to investigate cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotection as a new strategy to prevent chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration after injury. Cartilage was harvested from bovine knee joints and subjected to a single, rapid impact injury (24.0?±1.4?MPa, 53.8?±?5.3?GPa/s). Explants were then treated with a mitoprotective peptide, SS-31 (1µM), immediately post-impact, or at 1, 6, or 12?h after injury, and then cultured for up to 7 days. Chondrocyte viability and apoptosis were quantified in situ using confocal microscopy. Cell membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase activity) and cartilage matrix degradation (glycosaminoglycan loss) were quantified in cartilage-conditioned media. SS-31 treatment at all time points after impact resulted in chondrocyte viability similar to that of un-injured controls. This effect was sustained for up to a week in culture. Further, SS-31 prevented impact-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, cell membrane damage, and cartilage matrix degeneration. Clinical Significance: This study is the first investigation of cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotective therapy in cartilage. These results suggest that even when treatment is delayed by up to 12?h after injury, mitoprotection may be a useful strategy in the prevention of PTOA. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of hypoxic liver injury, most commonly referred to as hypoxic hepatitis (HH), is up to 10% in critically ill patients. In the majority of cases, HH occurs as a consequence of haemodynamic impairment following cardiogenic or septic shock. A marked, dramatic increase in the aminotransferase levels in a setting of cardiocirculatory failure is the key characteristic of HH. HH may contribute to several complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and hypoglycaemia. The overall mortality after the onset of HH is approximately 50?60% within 1 month. We report a case of severe HH that was successfully bridged using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System. In addition to the possible effects of extracorporeal liver support devices, the recognition of HH and therapy of the underlying disease that led to the occurrence of HH is of central importance.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of BHT, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic stroke in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties. In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats. Methods? Sprague?Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion. mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15?min before and 15?min after, or orally once 30?min or 120?min after the onset of MCAO (50 or 200?mg/kg each). Key findings? Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion. mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury. Oral administration of mBHT 30?min after ischaemia also markedly reduced the infarct size after cerebral ischaemia. The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced hypothermia was abolished. In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3. However, mBHT did not inhibit N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Conclusions? Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke.
