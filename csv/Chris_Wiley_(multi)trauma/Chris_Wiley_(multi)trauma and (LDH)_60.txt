AB  - The remnant of ultimobranchial (UB) body in the thyroid gland of adult buffalo was studied. This remnant appeared in the form of irregular and elongated follicles of various size and shape with folded lumen. These structures occupied a peripheral location beneath the capsule, as well as being embedded mostly in the vascular connective tissue of the thyroid. Calcitonin cells were predominantly localized in the UB follicles. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that surface of most UB follicular cells was almost flat and polyhedral or hexagonal in shape. Other follicles possessed cells with dome shaped apical surface demarcated by a shallow intercellular depression. The luminal surface of the follicular cell lining was studded with microvilli that appeared with various density and length and were numerous at the cellular borders. Interestingly, most of UB follicular cells were provided with single cilium, projecting over the cell surface. Notably some UB follicles presented various stages of apocrine activities.

AB  - Borna disease virus (BDV) causes a non-purulent meningoencephalitis and retinitis in a variety of species. In Lewis rats infected intracerebrally with the highly neurotropic BDV the retina is one of the most severely affected central nervous system (CNS) structures. While BDV-induced damage in the brain has previously been shown to be caused by a T-cell-dependent process, the immunopathological mechanisms leading to BDV-induced retinitis, remain to be elucidated. RNA samples from retinae were subjected to RNase protection assays to detect transcripts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines known to be involved in the recruitment of T-cells and macrophages in the CNS. The observed expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as the immunohistochemical detection of α?TCR-positive and CD8-positive T-cells in the BDV-infected retinae, is reminiscent of the situation observed in the brains of Lewis rats during the acute phase of Borna disease. This suggests, that similar immunopathological mechanisms are operating in retinae and brains of infected rats. This research was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (J.S.-PA 615/1-1).

AB  - During gestation, the uterus of eutherian mammals is subject to extensive modifications, which are most prominent in species with a haemochorial placenta. Pregnancy-associated changes in haemochorial placental types includes a rearrangement of endometrial blood vessels together with a rapid invasion of the endometrium by trophoblast cells, inducing the alteration of the phenotype of stroma cells, which is called decidualization. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these modifications with special reference to the development of the placental vascularization during gestation of the rat. 15 Wistar rats were sacrificed on days 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 and 20 of gestation (2 per day) and during estrous cycle (1) and perfusion-fixed. Implantation chambers and/or placental tissues were excised and paraffin-embedded. Additionally vascular corrosion casts were produced on the same days of gestation from another series of rats, and examined scanning electron microscopically. Paraffin-embedded sections were used for immunohistochemistry with antibodies against cytokeratin, α-smooth muscle (sm) actin, and histochemistry with lectin (Lycopersicum esculentum). The histological findings were compared to the scanning electron microscopical results. Cytokeratin labelled epithelial cells, namely uterine luminal and glandular epithelium as well as most types of trophoblast cells. α-sm actin was observed in smooth muscle cells, maternal vascular endothelium and decidua cells. Lycopersicum esculentum lectin was detected in endothelial cells and in yolk sac epithelium. The uterine microvasculature in the course of gestation showed specific alterations, like the development of spiral arteries and a central artery running straight to the fetal placental surface where it branches into arterioles. These arterioles feed the placental labyrinth through blood channels, which are lined by syncytiotrophoblast instead of endothelial cells. In parallel, the vascular diameter increases distinctly, and comparison to histology confirms the presence of protruding endovascular trophoblast cells as indentations on vascular casts. The present findings allow to establishing a reference defining the principal stages of the constitution and development of the chorioallantoic placenta, particularly with regard to the modifications concerning the morphology of the placental and uterine vessel tree, and the development of the cellular composition in different parts of the placenta.

AB  - In elephants, the limb posture in general and the angle of the knee joint in particular differs to those of most mammals. Although previous studies on the osteology of elephants are available, knowledge of the structure of their joints is sparse. The aim of this study was to provide an anatomical description of the African elephant's knee joint. Hindlimbs of six juvenile individuals of Loxodonta africana were dissected at the Department of Anatomy and Physiology, University of Pretoria (Onderstepoort, South Africa). All animals had lived in the Kruger National Park and were shot due to the regular culling program during the 1990s. The tight joint capsule encloses both the articulatio femorotibialis and the articulatio femoropatellaris. The articular surfaces of the tibial and femoral condyli show a high grade of congruency. The meniscuslateralis and especially the meniscusmedialis are very narrow merely resembling folds of the joint capsule. A ligamentum meniscofemorale is present. The Ligamentum cruciatum craniale attaches to the caudomedial surface of the condyluslateralisfemoris, passes the proximally flattened surface of the eminentiaintercondylaris tibiae and inserts on a craniolateral impression of this eminentia. The ligamentumcruciatumcaudale courses far caudally from the lateral surface of the condylusmedialisfemoris to the area intercondylariscaudalis. The tendon of origin of the m. popliteus passes caudoproximally over the meniscus lateralis and a recess of the joint capsule lies between this muscle and the condylus lateralis tibiae or the caput fibulae respectively. The ligamentumcollateralemediale and the smaller laterale are embedded within the thick fascial layers surrounding the knee. Retinacula patellae are not discernible. The ligamentum patellae attaches to the tuberositas tibiae and the distal tendon of the m. rectus femoris lies cranial to this ligament. It is likely that the structural peculiarities of the elephant's knee stand in close relationship with limb posture and weight bearing.

AB  - Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) of the testis is known to be the pre-invasive stage of most human germ cell tumours (seminoma and non-seminoma), but the mechanisms leading to an increased pubertal proliferation of CIS cells after a long latency and to progression of CIS to an invasive malignancy are still not known. Additionally, CIS and seminoma have also been reported in equine testis (Veeramachaneni and Sawyer, 1998). The gap junctional protein and tumour suppressor gene connexin(cx)43 represents the predominant cx in human, canine and rodent testis so far and it is expected to play a key role for the regulation of both proliferation and differentiation of germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatocytes), and its gene- and protein-expression pattern is typical for the pubertal terminal differentiation of somatic Sertoli cells. Using cDNA-microarray analysis, in-situ hybridization (ISH), RT-PCR from tissue homogenate and semi-quantitative RT-PCR from well defined microdissected tubules with normal spermatogenesis, CIS, intratubular seminoma (ISe) and from seminoma cells from invasive seminoma we found a downregulation of cx43 starting in intratubular CIS, leading to a complete loss in most invasive seminoma cells. This indicates that regulation of cx43 expression takes place at transcriptional level confirming and expanding earlier studies of protein expression (Brehm et al., 2002). This reduction of cx43-expression suggests that an early intratubular derangement in cx43-gene expression and disruption of inter-cellular communication between Sertoli cells and/or Sertoli cells and pre-invasive tumour cells via cx43-gap junctions may play a role in the proliferation of CIS cells and seminoma cells and in the progression phase of testicular seminoma development.

AB  - The olecranon ligament (ligamentum olecrani) is described as an elastic ligament of the elbow joint in carnivores that tenses the caudomedial part of the joint capsule. The aim of the study was to compare the course and the microscopic structure of the ligament in dogs and cats. The elbow regions of 25 dogs and 15 cats were dissected to examine the topography of the ligament in extension and flexion. Furthermore, the olecranon ligaments of five dogs and five cats were studied using routine histological methods. Additional sections were stained with Resorcin?Fuchsin and Orcein to detect elastic fibres. In both species the olecranon ligament originates at the lateral surface of the epicondylus medialis humeri and inserts at the cranial crest of the olecranon extending distally to the roof of the processus anconeus. Tension of the ligament only occurs when the elbow joint is flexed maximally. This tension is increased by a slight supination of the forearm, which takes place automatically in this joint position. In dogs the ligament is long (30?40?mm in medium sized breeds) and relatively slim (approx. 2?4?mm). In cats the ligament is short (10?12?mm) and relatively strong (5?8?mm). The histological examination of the olecranon ligament shows all signs of a tight collagenous ligament with a negligible amount of elastic fibres. The olecranon ligament helps to limit the maximal flexion of the elbow joint. In addition, it controls a slight lateral movement of the processus anconeus during the automatic supination of the antebrachial bones in extreme flexion of the elbow joint.

AB  - Aims:? Mammals cannot swallow if their necks and, hence, their mm. sternohyoidei et sternothyroidei are stretched. In order to understand the functional morphology of mastication and swallowing in mammals, it is useful to understand its evolutionary origin. Material and Methods:? Five formalin-preserved specimens of the Spiny Dogfish (Squalus ancanthias) were used for dissection or to prepare sagittal or transverse serial sections. Results and Conclusions:? The feeding apparatus of the shark Squalus acanthias as a representative of the cartilaginous fishes serves as an excellent model of that of an ancestral vertebrate with a kinetic skull, in which the chondrocranium is movable relative to the jaw apparatus. To open the mouth, the cranium is raised by the epibranchial musculature, the palatoquadrate cartilage (i.e., upper jaw) is entrained, and the mandibular cartilage is held in place and prevented from following the upper jaw by the coracomandibular muscle. At the same time, the branchial basket and oropharyngeal cavity are expanded and held in place by the coracohyoid and coracoarcual muscles, which prevent the hyoid and branchial arches from being entrained cranially by the raised chondrocranium. The mandible is not retracted during the opening of the mouth in sharks because the branchial region would have to be compressed instead of expanded. In the course of the evolutionary modifications leading to mammals, the heart and respiratory apparatus became decoupled from the feeding apparatus through the formation of a neck. The skull became akinetic through the integration of the upper jaw into the base of the cranium. The mouth is not opened any longer by lifting the cranium, but by depressing the mandible through a special muscle, the m. depressor mandibulae. The coracomandibular muscle lost its function as a stabilizer of the mandible during mouth opening and became modified into the lingual and geniohyoid muscles.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe morphological differences between the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the canine elbow joint. Forty forelimbs of 22 dogs (adult German shepherd dogs and shepherd mongrels) were dissected. The length and width of defined segments of the ligaments (i. e. total length, areas of origin and insertion, ?free part?, ?humeral part?, ?antebrachial part?) were measured in extension (160°) and flexion (30°). Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the data analysis software SAS 8.0. In addition the collateral ligaments of ten forelimbs of five shepherd mongrels were studied histologically. The LCL differs from the MCL in the following morphological items: a) the areas of origin and insertion are larger and in consequence the ?free part? of the lateral ligament is shorter; b) the caudal crus of the LCL is fan-shaped with a broad insertion area at the ulna whereas the caudal crus of the MCL remains slim; c) in the LCL the ?humeral part? varies in length depending on extended or flexed position of the joint, which is due to the spiral shape of the capitulum humeri; d) the microscopical structure of the LCL is organized less tightly; the collagen fibre bundles cross in varying angles. Referring to these details the LCL seems to allow and to limit a slight rotation of the forearm when the elbow joint is extremely flexed.

AB  - We have applied a laser micro-dissection microscope followed by RT-PCR analysis of micro-dissected tissue to identify gene expression of various immune genes in the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. A major problem in teleost anatomy is the lack of specific cell markers to identify different leukocyte populations. For instance, the involvement of T-cells in inflammatory reactions is unknown. We used frozen sections from the gut of salmon fed to induce localized inflammatory reactions and micro-dissected regions showing proliferative changes. RNA was extracted from the micro-dissected specimens and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR using primers and TaqMan probes for T-cell receptor, MHC class II and elongation factor, which served as a house-keeping gene. The results showed expression of T-cell receptor, MHC class II and elongation factor. The expression of the elongation factor corresponded invariably to the area micro-dissected tissue. In conclusion, T-cells are present in teleost inflammatory reactions.

AB  - Several investigators have suggested that the blood-vessel system in the equine periodontal ligament does not only serve nutritional needs, but also specific functional needs, e.g. in terms of a shock absorbing system. In order to supplement the previous data, corrosion casts of the periodontal blood vessels were studied with special attention to the spatial arrangement and connections of the vessels. The heads of eight warm-blooded horses (age 2.5?23?years, seven female, one male), which had been killed for medical reasons, were dissected. The arteria alveolaris inferior and the a. infraorbitalis were perfused with 100?ml Heparin (20?000?IU) followed by 100?ml tap water. After storage at 4°C for 24?96?h, 10?200?ml methacrylate resin (BiodurTM E20) were injected by use of a cartridge pistol for approx. 1?h. After polymerization for 24?h at 60°C, the jaws were frozen and cut with a steel band saw in a horizontal, sagittal or transversal plane to obtain segments that exposed the periodontal space. The specimens were macerated in detergent at 60°C until the soft tissues had vanished. Care was taken to keep the periodontal vessels complete and in topographical integrity. The vascular casts were mesoscopically examined by use of a dissection microscope (magnification 5.8??40?). The blood vessels in the periodontal space connected with vessels in three other sites: 1 occlusal ? with the blood vessels of the gingiva; 2 apical ? with blood vessels next to the apical foramen; 3 at the sides ? with blood vessels that penetrated the lamina cribriformis. The blood-vessel system in the periodontal space consisted of main vessels in a parallel alignment with interconnecting branches with smaller diameter. There were indications in some of the specimens that these blood vessels were arranged in layers: one layer next to the cementum, the other next to the alveolar bone.

AB  - Thyrocalcitonin cells (C cells) were predominantly demonstrated in the ultimobranchial (UB) structures of the thyroid gland of one-humped camels. The UB population was observed as clear cells, either singly distributed or as groups of cells between the component cellular elements lining the UB structures. They displayed various shapes: oval, pear-like, rounded, cubical, columnar and or ellipsoid. Those populating the cell nests or solid cellular masses were almost polygonal or ovoid in shape. The cytoplasm contained well-developed golgi complexes, several mitochondria and characteristically presented rounded or oval membrane-bound electron dense granules of different sizes. The latter granules were irregularly distributed within the cytoplasm especially at the vascular pole. The nucleus of C cells was relatively large, indented, occupying a more or less central position in the cytoplasm. It presented various chromatin contents; the heterochromatin variety was predominantly demonstrated at the marginal zone. However, the euchromatin occupied a more central position within the nucleus.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the suitability of functional and morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model and further to validate that the ischemic injury was successfully induced. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T (Siemens Vision, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) in piglets (n?=?10; age 12?36?h) under general anaesthesia. Hypoxia was induced by ventilation of a gas mixture containing 8% O2 in N2 (AGA, Oslo, Norway). Ischemia was induced by bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (CCA). HI was maintained for 30?min, followed by re-oxygenation with ambient air (21% O2) for 2.5?h. Relative cerebral flow (rCF) was estimated using a single shot SE-EPI sequence (TE?=?85?ms, voxel size 1???1???5?mm3), measuring the first-pass response following bolus injection of an intravascular iron oxide nanoparticulate contrast agent (NC100150 Injection; Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway) at a dose of 4.5?mg Fe/kg. rBF maps were generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from the peak height of a gamma-variate function fitted to the first-pass contrast agent response. The presence of total carotid occlusion was assessed by MR angiography (MRA). MRA images (3D-GRE, TR/TE 4.4?ms/1.8?ms, voxel size 0.9???0.9???1.5?mm3) were acquired after contrast administration; utilizing the T1-effect of NC100150 injection. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously during the experiment via a catheter placed in the femoral artery. Blood gasses and rectal temperature were measured at regular intervals. At the end of the experiment, the piglets were given an overdose of 150?mg/kg Pentobarbital i.v., and a dissection was performed in order to identify structures identified on the MRI. MR angio (MRA) and volume rendering identified a prominent, highly vascularized, defined structure close to the eyeball, medioventrally. At dissection, when comparing with the MR images, the deep gland of the third eyelid, the Harderian gland, corresponded to this structure both by topography and size. It was thick, brownish and finely lobulated, and extended from the cartilage of the third eyelid towards the origin of the extrinsic eye muscles at the apex of the orbit. In contrast, the lacrimal gland presented as a small, soft and pale structure that was difficult to distinguish from the surrounding connective tissue. At histological examination, the Harderian gland consisted mostly of compact areas of alveolar glands with abundant eosinophilic granules. Wide thin-walled vessels were conspicuous in the interlobular connective tissue and the capsule. The present MRI demonstration of the Harderian gland was an accidental finding during an investigation to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model. In pig, this gland has received little attention in the literature. However, taking its size and blood supply into consideration, it must be of significant importance also in the pig. It is mostly studied in rodents and lower vertebrates and is found to possess various endocrine functions as well as exocrine.
