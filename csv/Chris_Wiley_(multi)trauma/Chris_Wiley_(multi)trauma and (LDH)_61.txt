AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the suitability of functional and morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model and further to validate that the ischemic injury was successfully induced. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T (Siemens Vision, Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) in piglets (n?=?10; age 12?36?h) under general anaesthesia. Hypoxia was induced by ventilation of a gas mixture containing 8% O2 in N2 (AGA, Oslo, Norway). Ischemia was induced by bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (CCA). HI was maintained for 30?min, followed by re-oxygenation with ambient air (21% O2) for 2.5?h. Relative cerebral flow (rCF) was estimated using a single shot SE-EPI sequence (TE?=?85?ms, voxel size 1???1???5?mm3), measuring the first-pass response following bolus injection of an intravascular iron oxide nanoparticulate contrast agent (NC100150 Injection; Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway) at a dose of 4.5?mg Fe/kg. rBF maps were generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from the peak height of a gamma-variate function fitted to the first-pass contrast agent response. The presence of total carotid occlusion was assessed by MR angiography (MRA). MRA images (3D-GRE, TR/TE 4.4?ms/1.8?ms, voxel size 0.9???0.9???1.5?mm3) were acquired after contrast administration; utilizing the T1-effect of NC100150 injection. Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously during the experiment via a catheter placed in the femoral artery. Blood gasses and rectal temperature were measured at regular intervals. At the end of the experiment, the piglets were given an overdose of 150?mg/kg Pentobarbital i.v., and a dissection was performed in order to identify structures identified on the MRI. MR angio (MRA) and volume rendering identified a prominent, highly vascularized, defined structure close to the eyeball, medioventrally. At dissection, when comparing with the MR images, the deep gland of the third eyelid, the Harderian gland, corresponded to this structure both by topography and size. It was thick, brownish and finely lobulated, and extended from the cartilage of the third eyelid towards the origin of the extrinsic eye muscles at the apex of the orbit. In contrast, the lacrimal gland presented as a small, soft and pale structure that was difficult to distinguish from the surrounding connective tissue. At histological examination, the Harderian gland consisted mostly of compact areas of alveolar glands with abundant eosinophilic granules. Wide thin-walled vessels were conspicuous in the interlobular connective tissue and the capsule. The present MRI demonstration of the Harderian gland was an accidental finding during an investigation to assess the extent of brain injury in a hypoxia-ischemia piglet model. In pig, this gland has received little attention in the literature. However, taking its size and blood supply into consideration, it must be of significant importance also in the pig. It is mostly studied in rodents and lower vertebrates and is found to possess various endocrine functions as well as exocrine.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the ultrastructure of three-dimensional keratinocyte colonies in relation to ex vivo bovine hoof epidermis. Keratinocytes were isolated from the claw and cultured in equal parts of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Taufkirchen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, Taufkirchen) and serum-free MCDB 153 complete medium (Biochrom, Berlin). Cells were allowed to grow until formation of colonies occurred. Then the colonies were isolated by removing the surrounding cells with a cell scraper every 3?days. The colonies were harvested when the reached diameters of 6?8?mm and were fixed in Karnovsky's solution. They were routinely processed for the embedding in Agar 100. Semithin and ultrathin sections were prepared and examined under the light and transmission electron microscope. These colonies revealed the morphological properties and tissue architecture, which are specific for claw epidermis in vivo. We detected up to 22 layers of keratinocytes and could discover between three stages of differentiation: a basal cell layer, followed by several cell layers corresponding morphologically to the cells of the stratum spinosum and a few cornified superficial cell layers. Throughout all layers cells were connected by desmosomes, which were linked to the cytoskeleton by dense bundles of filaments. In addition we observed the formation of desmosomes. The cells of the upper un-cornified layers generated an cornified envelope. In the following layers cell death and subsequent cornification accompanied by the characteristic alterations of the nuclei occurred. The cells at the superficial layers were filled by electron dense, solid horn masses. Additionally we detected intercellular cementing substance in the intercellular space between the upper layers. Our electron microscopical characterization of the colonies provides evidence that the bovine hoof keratinocytes invitro undergo basically a similar pattern of proliferation and differentiation like in the claw in vivo. These findings provided a basis for further studies like the long-term culture and differentiation of bovine hoof keratinocytes in perfusion chambers.

AB  - By definition, melanomacrophage centres (MMC) consist of aggregates of macrophage-like pigmented cells located in the kidney and spleen, and to a lesser extent in the liver. In 30 Salmo gairdneri Richardson trout, MMC have been identified in various organs. In the kidney, liver and spleen, respectively, macrophages (M?) are aggregated in clusters, which are next to vessels. MMC have been cytoenzymatically identified with periodic acid Schiff (PAS), α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), peroxidase (PEROX) reactions. Finally, in order to show pigments in the context of MMC, in particular, we used iron stain to detect iron pigments and Prussian blue reaction to detect melanin and lipofuscin. The presence of iron pigments indicates that MMC function as lymphoreticular centres where fish erythrocytes (FE) are destroyed together with other foreign material. In previous studies, we found that FE are able to bind and engulf Candida albicans (CA) without killing this fungus. FE containing engulfed CA form with M? functional rosettes and, in reason of that M? are solicited to phagocytose and kill CA. It is likely that rosettes and/or single FE containing engulfed foreign material migrate to distant organs, such as the kidney, the spleen and the liver. Therefore, the MMC may, in part, derive from these peripheral rosettes and pigments result from FE and foreign material digestion and destruction operated by M?. Reference?

AB  - Accurate interpretation of thoracic magnetic resonance images requires a thorough knowledge of anatomy of this region. The purpose of this communication is to describe the normal cross sectional anatomy of the thoracic cavity of the cat, using MR images, dissections and macroscopic sections. In this study, three cats were used. The animals were anesthetized and positioned in sternal recumbency in the MR scanner. MR imaging was performed at the Special Diagnostic Service of San Roque Clinic of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with a superconducting magnet operating at a field strength of 1.5?Tesla and a human body coil. Spin echo pulse sequences were used to obtain T1-weighted images in tranverse and sagittal planes. At the conclusion of imaging, the cats were euthanatized for medical reasons unrelated to disease of thorax. The cats were frozen and then sectioned using an electric band saw. The cuts were matched as closely as possible to the MR images for identifying the normal planimetric anatomy of the thoracic structures. MR T1-weighted spin echo images provided excellent anatomic appearance of the thorax structures. In MR images the grey scale is directly related to the signal intensity of the thoracic cavity structures. Thus, fat and nerves had higher signal intensity compared with the lower signal intensity of the respiratory system. Bone marrow and muscles had a intermediate signal intensity and appeared gray. The intensity signal of the articular fluid permits a good differentiation of the opposing cartilage surfaces on all MR images. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the thoracic cavity in the cat allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, being helpful tool for the identification of the MR images. The information presented should serve as an initial reference to evaluate MR images of the feline thorax and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Surface ultrastructural observation of the thyroid gland in donkey revealed the coexistence of certain unusual follicles or cysts, the ultimobranchial (UB) follicles, which exhibited large diameters and less regular outlines. In addition, several small follicles, cell nests or solid cellular masses were also demonstrated in association with these structures. Surface of most UB follicular cells was almost hexagonal in shape, studded with sparse or dense pleomorphic microvilli, which were much denser at the cellular borders. Each follicular cell bore single cilium that projecting over the cell surface. Interestingly, bleb-like apocrine protrusion of the apical cytoplasm of some follicular cells was frequently demonstrated. These apocrine blebs (or aposomes) were varied in shape, size and showed smooth or irregular surface. In addition to such aposomes, deep to shallow circumscribed or eroded areas of the apical cell surface was frequently demonstrated. These findings indicate that the UB follicular cells in donkeys, similar to those of camels, exhibit an apocrine activity alongside with the usual merocrine mode of secretion.

AB  - Introduction and Aims:? Primary and secondary cell cultures of canine dermal fibroblasts were used to test the suitability of several senescence-linked cellular markers to characterize the chronological age of dogs. In further studies these markers will be used to test the hypothesis that senescence-linked changes at the cellular level are representative for the observed inverse relationship of body mass and life expectancy in different dog breeds. Methods:? In this study standardized skin samples of Beagles were used to analyse the cell morphology and several senescence-linked parameters as Cumulative Population Doubling Level, Highest Population Doubling Level, Culture Doubling Time and Life Span Completed to determine the replicative potential of fibroblasts. The samples were divided by the age of the donors into three groups (?young?, ?middle? and ?old?). Results:? There are notable differences between the replicative potential of young and old Beagles at the cellular level. Preliminary results show that in fibroblast cultures obtained from the young group the highest population doubling level is higher and the culture doubling time is shorter then in cultures of the old group. Cultures from the young and middle-aged group cannot be distinguished by the measured parameters. For final results the complete statistical analysis of sampled data has to be carried out. Conclusions:? Our results demonstrate a relationship between the chronological age of the skin donor and the replicative potential of the dermal fibroblasts. Therefore cellular senescence-linked markers could serve as suitable tools to compare the age of individual dogs of different breeds.

AB  - Introduction:? Interactions between horn quality and flooring systems significantly impact on claw health. Poor horn quality is associated with reduced milk yield, painful lesions or slaughtering. Horn quality is determined by horn cells, intercellular cement and hoof horn architecture, i.e. the structure and arrangement of the horn tubules. Soft and elastic flooring systems have been reported to have a positive influence on the microstructure of hoof horn. Aims:? We wanted to correlate the microstructure of claw horn to the horn quality in a large number of samples and detect influences of the flooring system on hoof horn microstructure. Methods:? Samples were obtained from two different studies: 40 cows from Hohenheim/Germany kept on slatted floor and subsequently on rubber mats for 4 months; 1000 cows from 11 farms in Luxembourg, kept on concrete floor. From all samples 7??m-sections were cut and stained with the PAS-reaction. Morphometry was done with the LuciaG?-software (Nikon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS? (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parameters measured were area, minimal and maximal diameter of both medulla and cortex of horn tubules. Statistical analysis included: tubules per visual field, area per visual field, total medulla area, total cortex area and the limiting values of diameters. Results:? Luxembourg samples showed consistency of tubule-parameters between both dates; all farms showed an average number ranging from 13.36 to 14.79 tubules per visual field. Hohenheim horn from the hard flooring showed 19.9 and horn of the same animals kept on rubber floor showed 20.5 tubules per visual field. Maximum diameter of hard-floor horn is 55??m whereas 45??m in animals kept on rubber floor. Conclusions:? The results show that genetic/individual differences take smaller influence on horn quality than housing systems. These outcomes provide evidence for the economical and animal welfare benefit of soft and elastic flooring systems. Further research will focus on correlation of biodata, such as physiological state, lactation, age, and claw horn microstructure. This work was supported by Biopsytec/Rheinbach.

AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important phospholipid messenger involved in diverse physiological and pathological conditions. Actions of PAF are mediated by a specific PAF receptor (PAF-R) and the inhibition of biological activity by PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). To elucidate the potential role of PAF in stimulating angiogenesis and trophoblast giant cell migration during gestation, we examined the expression and localization of PAF-R mRNA and protein as well as PAF-AH mRNA in the bovine placenta. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were applied to placentomes from days 20, 80, 150, 200, 240, 270 of gestation, and immediately pre-partum (around day 280). PAF-R mRNA and protein were colocalized in immature trophoblast giant cells (TGC), uterine epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of fetal and maternal vessels. There was no apparent difference in placental PAF-R mRNA or protein levels until day 270. In contrast, in placentomes taken immediately pre-partum the localization of the immunohistochemical and hybridization signals switched from immature TGC and maternal epithelium to cells of the maternal stroma, particularly endothelial cells of maternal vessels. mRNAs for PAF-AH isoforms Ib (?- and ?-subunit), II, and plasma-isoform were detected by RT-PCR in placentomes throughout gestation. In tissue sections mRNA of the PAF specific PAF-AH-Ib ?-subunit was predominantly found in TGC, while the intensity of the signal was weaker in maternal epithelium and endothelium of fetal and maternal vessels. Corresponding to the PAF-R expression, mRNA of PAF-AH Ib was detected mainly in maternal endothelial cells prior to parturition. The constitutive expression and localization of PAF-R and PAF-AH in epithelial and endothelial cells during gestation, together with the parturition-related switch to the maternal stroma suggests a functional role of PAF for the interaction of TGC with the maternal epithelium, and thus may be associated with TGC migration, placental angiogenesis and pre-partum tissue programming. Acknowledgement:? This study was supported by the German Research Foundation.

AB  - We investigated the embryotoxicity of ozone (O3), after gas exposure in ovo, to chick embryos of the Lohmann-Weiss strain. The main aim of the study is to reduce the microbiological content, particularly of Salmonella enteritides on the egg surface by the use of ozone in different concentrations and response times. The aim of our morphological study is to analyse the influence of gas exposure to the embryonal development of chick. Ozone has proved its worth as a disinfectant without the harmful adverse effects of formaldehyde. The chick embryo provides a useful and well-defined model for analysis of toxicity of chemicals, particularly with regard to an alternative disinfectant: ozone. Embryotoxicity of ozone in developing chick embryos was studied by examining different parameters: deformities and pathohistology of heart, liver, kidney and spleen, weight, length and survival of embryo. After oviposition the eggs were transferred to a chamber filled with ozon-oxygen-mixture in a defined concentration (1% - 5.22%). After achievement of the ozone concentration the eggs were incubated over various response times have 20, 30, 60?min or 17?h. After the incubator times of 18, 19 or 20?days we studied the development of the gas exposed embryos and unexposed controls. The organs were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1?hour provided low graded survival rates of 3.3?13.3%. There was significantly increase of the survival rate after decline of ozone concentration and response time of 90?100%. We found also a remarkable decrease of weight and length in fewer surviving gas exposed embryos with high ozone concentration and response time (Fig.?1.), compared with the normal development of gas-exposed embryos with study of high survival rate (Fig.?2.). We calculated a 60% increase in the survival rate of embryos exposed to high ozone concentration without response time. In low ozone concentration (1.8%) with high response time of 17?hours the survival rate decreased to 10%. We found no signs of deformities and pathohistology of organs in our embryological examination. In conclusion, ozone has a dose-dependent effect. The response time constitutes an important factor in the survival and growth of chick embryos after exposure to ozone in ovo. 1 [ High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1 hour result in a low survival rate of 3,3% and the surviving embryo shows a decrease in body weight and length (right) in comparison to the biggest (left) and lowest (middle) unexposed embryo. ] 2 [ Height comparison between the unexposed controls (both embryos on the left side) with gas exposed embryos (both embryos on the right side) in a study with low ozone concentration of 1% and low response time of 20 minutes.

AB  - The arterial system of the gills of carp and its histological structure were studied light and electron microscopically by making Mercox or Neoplane Latex corrosion cast preparations. Four pairs of afferent and efferent branchial arteries, and a pair of afferent and efferent pseudobranchial arteries were identified in the branchial arterial system. The 1st and 2nd afferent branchial arteries are given off directly from the ventral aorta, and the 3rd and 4th afferent arteries originate from their common trunk, which is branched off from the ventral aorta caudal to the origin of the former branchial arteries. Numerous afferent filamental arteries are connected to the lamellar blood capillary networks in the gill lamellae via afferent lamellar arterioles, and efferent filamental arteries followed the efferent lamellar arterioles are converged into four efferent branchial arteries that are connected to the dorsal aorta. To the pseudobranchia, afferent pseudobranchial arteries are connected with the ventral branches of the 1st efferent branchial arteries to provide arterial blood to the organ through the afferent mandibular arteries. Afferent pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles originating from the afferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the blood capillary networks in the pseudobranchial lamellae, and blood in the capillary networks is drained into the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries via 2-4 pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles. Branches of the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the arteries to the eyeballs and provide blood to choroid of the vascular tunic of them. Pseudobranchial cells surrounding lamellar capillaries in the pseudobranchia are furnished with abundant mitochondria and tubular structures, and the histological findings suggest the cells may share an ability to exchange physiological materials between the cells and the blood in the capillary networks of pseudobranchia.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Vasculogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels from embryonic precursor cells. The formation of additional vessels is called angiogenesis, the sprouting from pre-existing vessels by migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells. Until recently vasculogenesis was considered to be restricted to embryogenesis, however, evidence suggests that progenitor cells exist in the adult, able to participate in neovascularization. In order to study cellular and molecular control mechanisms without animal testing we have established in featuring the three-dimensional formation of capillary-like structures from microvascular endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to identify the specific subpopulation of cells that triggers the primary process of vasculogenesis in vitro. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells were isolated from the bovine corpus luteum and examined by phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy. Immunolabelling was done for the most important pro-angiogenic factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors (VEGF-R1, -R2) as well as for endothelial cell surface markers (CD 31, CD51/61, CD29) and presumptive stem cell marker CD 34. Additionally VEGF and VEGF-R1, -R2 expression was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results:? The beginning of vessel formation in vitro was initiated by confluence of endothelial cells. A linear and circular side-by-side arrangement of cells and the formation of capillary-like structures with an internal lumen could be observed. Specific clusters of cells were identified. These cells were arranged in a star-like formation, i.e., one particular round cell in the centre surrounded by several cells with extensions. Immunolocalization of VEGF, VEGF-R1, -R2, CD 31, CD51/61, CD29 and CD34 was positive. VEGF-R2 and CD 34 were found to be co-localized in specific cells exclusively. Conclusions:? Results for the first time reveal the specific subpopulation of endothelial cells that trigger the start of vasculogenesis in vitro. These progenitor cells are characterized by a specific morphology, by the presence of endothelial cell markers and by the expression of stem cell marker in vitro models

AB  - Introduction:? The formation of the liver structure at mammal embryogenesis is interconnected by drawing up of venous mains. In parallel to the transformation of the main veins, there is a reduction of the blood formation function and the liver transformation from the primary organ of embryogenesis into the secondary one, but the exception is immaturity and underdeveloped maturity mammals (Smirnova, 1967; Mechtiev, 1968; Bresler, 1993). The purpose of research is to establish morphofunctional criteria of the incompleteness in the blood vessels and in tissue components of the liver in neonatal animals. Material and Methods:? The afferent and efferent liver veins of calves, piglets and puppies at one day of age were investigated. The complex of morphological, roentgenological, ultrasound and statistic methods was used. Results:? It was established that the liver veins in newborn animals portoumbilical (afferent) and caval (efferent) collectors. In 1-day-old calves, the afferent collector is connected with caval way of the large vein flow of the main type. Relative weight of the liver in the calves is 2.31?2.85%, hepatocytes form balks and they are not always oriented radially to the central venuels. There are no seats of haemopoesis. Sonography of the liver and its veins proves inconstancy of the sizes depending on acts of breath. In 1-day-old piglets, many treelike anastomoses follow with the left hepatic vein. Relative weight of the liver in the piglets is 2.27?4.64%. The parenchyma of the organ is spongy with the seats of haemopoesis (0.04 3.61%). In 1-day-old puppies afferent and efferent collectors combine through the venous duct. Additionally, in the abdominal cavity of puppies, there are the vitelline artery (starts from a. mesenterica) and vein (runs to v. porta near the afferent collector), following to the umbilical ring. Relative weight of the liver in the puppies is about 5.18?6.04%. Hepatocytes form the chaotic congestion with haemopoetic points (2.04?7.14%). Conclusion:? Thus, incompleteness of morphology of the liver is shown in preservation of provisional vein structures and tissue components of the embryonic type, which is one of the factors complicating diseases of digestive organs in neonatal animals.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the CT anatomy of the normal loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) head using three loggerhead sea turtle heads. CT imaging was performed using the following parameters: K.v.: 120?mAs: 220, and a soft-tissue window (WW 1880, WL 465): Transverse and sagittal CT images were obtained. Detailed anatomy of the head was acquired with the sagittal and transverse series. The heads were frozen and then sectioned using an electric saw, to compare them with the CT images. In CT, the grey scale is directly related to the radiation attenuation of the head structures. The skull and hyoid bones, and the lower jaw were easily identifiable due to the high CT density image compared to adjacent or surrounding structures such as the respiratory system, oral cavity, oesophagus and cranial cavity that appeared as a low opacity. The nervous structures, salt gland, eyeball, ramphoteca structure and different muscles of the head had an intermediate CT density and appeared grey. CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head provided excellent detail of clinically relevant anatomy and correlated well with corresponding gross specimens. CT of the head has considerable advantages over other techniques: CT provides excellent spatial resolution and good discrimination between bone and soft tissue, and the structures are viewed without superimposition. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the head allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, which is a useful tool for the identification of the CT images. With developing technology, CT imaging may soon become more readily available for exotic animals imaging. In the same way, we consider it quite useful to be able to establish some references on head, in order to scan only selected parts during a clinical or experimental approach. The information presented in this communication should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberuclosis. To investigate the efficacy of assays for early diagnosis, experimental infections were performed in goat kids. Oral doses of M. a. paratuberculosis were administered to goat kids over extended periods and the resulting infection was followed for 12?24?months. Complementary experiments were performed on goat kids vaccinated against M. a. paratuberculosis. Immunological, pathological and morphological examinations were undertaken in both these experimental systems. The analysis of results from these experiment series provided novel insights into the influence of the biology of gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the progress of disease, into the character of the tissue granuloma and its dominance of the local tissue response and into the relationship between the local and systemic immune responses.
