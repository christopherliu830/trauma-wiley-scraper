AB  - The third eyelid protects the eye, contribute to the aqueous portion of the pre-ocular film and its distribution over the corneal surface, as well as removal of foreign material from the anterior surface of the eye. It is rather vulnerable during fights and clinicians often have to perform surgery for third eyelid neoplasia. In dogs, this lid has a triangular shape, being widest at its free margin. It is vascularized by branches of the malar artery. Being of such importance as an adnexa of the eye, the authors concentrated their attention on its vascularization, which is not well defined. Methods:? Scanning Electronic Microscopy of vascular corrosion casts and intact tissue. Observations:? It was quite interesting to notice the presence of two patterns of vascularization inside the third eyelid. One can say that there are two segmental levels of vessels. In one of these there is a predominance of arteries and veins, while in the other a meshwork of third order arteries, capillaries and post-capillary venules are present. In fact, the branch of the malar artery that reaches the base of the third eyelid divides into smaller branches that cross almost the complete length of the lid giving only a few collateral vessels, in a monopodical way, and only near the free margin of the lid is possible to observe dicothomical ramifications that became rather anastomotic (being anastomoses of type I and II are present) and contribute to the microvascular meshwork. This microvascular net is drained by post-capillary venules and veins that empty as a brush into bigger veins that occupy the same segmental level as the third eyelid artery. Remarks:? This uncommon angioarchitecture is probably an adaptation to the fact that in the medial canthus of the eye this lid has a smaller space and the way of obtaining an efficient vascularization is by going straight to the top of the lid.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Canine malignant haemangioendothelioma is an aggressive neoplasia that affects mostly older dogs of large breeds with a strong predilection for the spleen, liver, heart and skin. The tumour originates in the vascular endothelium and consists of transformed cells forming large and leaky vessel-like structures. Prognosis is poor because surgery and chemotherapy have limited success in prolonging survival times and increasing quality of patients. A new strategy to treat this malignancy could be anti-angiogenic therapy based on the inhibition of proliferation, migration and three-dimensional organization of transformed cells. In order to reduce animal experiments, in vitro-models are required to test the safety and efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs. So far only few models of angiogenesis are available using mostly human, rodent and bovine cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to establish an in vitro model of canine haemangioendothelioma. Materials and Methods:? Tumours were collected from dogs during surgery or immediately after euthanasia. Isolation of cells was done from different areas of the tumours and by enzymatic digestion of the tissue. Cells were incubated in culture media with and without endothelial growth factors. Cells were characterized by lectin histochemistry using Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin and Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Moreover, RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was employed to investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors VEGF-R1 and -R2. Results and Conclusions:? Different populations of cells were isolated and cultured successfully from canine malignant haemangioendothelioma. Cells show characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells of an angiogenic phenotype, i.e. the formation of spheroids and tube-like structures as well as strong labelling for Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Thus, morphological and glycohistochemical results confirm the vascular character of the cells isolated. RT-PCR showed expression of VEGF. However, endothelium-specific VEGF receptors were not expressed. Loss of typical receptors is common in cancer and may correlate with increased tumour dedifferentiation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the pressure distribution under the paws of chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger) using static pedobarography. We included in our study three healthy chinchilla aged 1?3?year, both sexes, weighted 480?570?g. We performed static pedobarography (PEL 38 podometer) in each chinchilla and we took into account standing on four legs or two hind legs. We found that on standing on four legs, two types of contact area with base in chinchilla exist: first type ? the ring shape of contact area with base of forefeet with maximal pressure in forefeet at their central part and elliptic shape of foot contact area with base of hind legs (paws) with longer diameter about twice longer than the shorter one and with maximal pressure in hind legs at their posterior part (greater than pressure under forefoot paws), that a value was 98?g/cm2 In the second type of foot contact area with base a pattern of hind legs was similar to that of forefeet. During standing on two hind legs we distinguished the another type (third) of foot contact area with base that was similar to the first type with the difference made by the fact that animal was standing only on hind paws. In each animal we found also the contact area with base of a tail ? the contact area was similar to that of forefeet but the value of pressure was twice decreased. Concluding, the most frequent manner of contact area with base in chinchilla is 4 points contact with hind paws contact area twice greater than contact area of forefeet. Moreover, the fifth point of support can exist ? a tail, which is mainly important during standing on the hind paws.

AB  - Introduction:? On one hand, the distal phalanx in cattle is suspended by the wall segment of the dermis, on the other hand it is supported in the palmar/plantar region by the bulb with its specialized subcutaneous tissue. Recent results of various studies suggest that changes in tissue composition of the bulb and slackening of the suspension can lead to an unphysiological position of the distal phalanx within the horn capsule. This leads to an altered distribution of pressure and mechanically influences the dermal blood supply. In the worst case these changes may lead to sole ulcer. Aims:? The aim of this study was to develop a method to allow measuring the minimal distance between the surface of the distal phalanx and the inner surface of the horn capsule under various loading. Material and Methods:? The right front and the left hindclaws have been taken from seven healthy beef bulls (German Simmentals, average body weight 580?±?25?kg) from the local abattoir. After functional claw trimming the feet have been scanned in a computed tomograph (veterinary surgical clinics) in unloaded and the loaded state [distribution of body weight: 55% (front legs): 45 % (hind legs)]. Each distal phalanx and claw capsule have been reconstructed in both datasets via threshholding (?marching-cube-algorithm?). The minimal distance between both objects has been measured by the ?nearest-neighbour-algorithm?. Results:? No significant differences could be observed between front and hind claws and lateral and medial claws respectively. In the unloaded state there was a distance of 4?6?mm in the dorsal, abaxial and axial aspect of the distal phalanx, which almost remained constant in the loaded state. On the solear surface values increased from 3?mm at the tip of the coffin bone to 7?8?mm at the flexor tubercle where significant distance changes (approx. 3?mm) could be observed. Discussion:? A tilting movement of the distal phalanx becomes obvious with loading. Thus, especially the region of transition between the soft and the hard bulb experiences heavy compressive stress. This coincides topographically with the incidence of sole ulcers.

AB  - Introduction:? Elbow dysplasia is one of the most important orthopaedic diseases of the canine elbow joint. The medial coronoid process (MCP) and the anconeal process (AP) are involved with a high incidence. Aims:? The aim of this study was to clarify whether these processes are especially loaded resulting in osteoarthrosis. Material and Methods:? Elbow joints were examined from dogs of various breeds, with a body weight over 20?kg and an age ranging from 1 to 12?years. Only joints without damage to the articular cartilage have been included in this investigation. Articular surfaces have been evaluated macroscopically, subchondral bone density (long-term loading) and split-lines (long-term tensile loading) have been determined. Results:? In the humeral fossa olecrani, there was a distinct impression on the inner side of the lateral compared to the medial epicondyle. In the ulna, the MCP was much greater than the lateral coronoid indicating that the medial process has to support the humeral condyle to a higher extent. Subchondral split lines with a transverse orientation in the fossa olecrani gave evidence of long-term transverse tensile loading in this area. Split lines on the MCP were oriented radially as if the lateral edge was bent downwards. Subchondral bone density in the fossa olecrani was higher towards the lateral epicondyle in comparison to the medial. Furthermore, there was a bone density maximum on the medial part of the humeral condyle opposite of the MCP with its very high density. Discussion:? Gait analyses showed that there is a transverse, medially oriented force of up to 4% bodyweight acting on the paw during midstance. As the carpus is stable when slightly hyperextended during midstance loading there is a long lever arm from the ground up to an assumed rotation centre in the depth of the trochlear notch. The medially directed ground reaction force slightly rotates the forearm inwards causing a bending moment about the elbow joint, which leads to an increased pressure of the AP and the MCP. This bending in addition to sagittal loading is the reason for the high susceptibility of the MCP and AP.

AB  - This work was carried out on the parabronchi of ducks during the pre- and post-hatching periods. For this purposes, the samples were taken from the embryo of incubated eggs from the 10th to 28th?day of incubation, at regular interval, and from adult ducks under anaesthesia. The parabronchi first appeared at 14th?day of incubation as out-pouches, from the secondary bronchi, with solid free end invading the surrounding mesenchym. These pouches was lined by high cuboidal cells rested on PAS positive basal lamina, the cells showed free luminal quarter, which indicated an apocrine secretion. At 17th to 22nd?day of incubation, irregularities invading the underlying tissue were observed. This invading part was club-shape forming the future atrium and air capillaries. At 24th to 28th?day of incubation the parabronchi were observed at the center of a polygonal shape lobule (lung lobule), it was lined with squamous cells at the head of the clubs, while atrium was lined with cuboidal cells at both side of the stalk (interatrial septum), and the air capillaries was lined with attenuated squamous cells. Because of the breathing of the duck started before hatching the structure of the parabronchi was similar in post-hatching period to that of late stage of pre-hatching period. The wall of parabronchi was pierced by a number of openings leading to the atrium. The lining epithelium was followed by a layer of smooth muscles, which formed a sphincter around the opening of the atrium regulating the amount of air passed to the atrium and air capillaries to avoid hyperventilation. The E.M. picture revealed that, the epithelium of parabronchi was squamous and displayed a scarce number of microvilli, while that of the atrium was cuboidal with a large number of microvilli, the cells of both contained osmiophilic multilamiller bodies that extruded to the surface. Under the epithelium of parabronchi, there were: smooth muscle cells, macrophages, mast cells, collagen fibers, and fibroblasts, while in the interatrial septum between the epithelium on both side there were collagen fibers and fibroblasts only.

AB  - Most mammals have two different structures in which we found glomerular layers at the same time: the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Both bulbs have the same pattern of organization, but there are some differences: although the size is considerably bigger in MOB than in AOB, probably the most important difference is that the principal cells are not differentiated into mitral and tufted cells in the AOB, and are usually described as mitral/tufted cells. We have previously observed that in some mammals, like pigs and sheep, the AOB reaches maturity before birth, but this is not a rule for other species. Surprisingly, mice need several days of life to achieve full stratification of its cellular components. We have studied the chronology of this process, focusing our attention on the glomerular layer, the last to appear. We concluded that there are two critical periods, between E11.5 and E16.5 (migration phase) and between E17.5 and P3.5?7 (true morphological constitution).

AB  - The cecum is a great cul-de sac intercalated between the small intestine and the colon. It has a remarkable size in the equine and digestion of more than 30% of total cellulose and production of volatile fatty acids by anaerobic metabolism of cellulose by its micro flora were made on it. It has also a substantial number of lymphatic nodules, which in horses are located near the apex. Topographically, cecum is situated chiefly to the right of the median plane and occupies around the whole volume of there in the abdominal cavity. The histological structure of the lymphatic follicles and their distributions pattern throughout the cecum in five healthy mature miniature horses (an special species of horses lives only in north of Iran) were studied (Fig. 1a). Each cecum was divided into three parts, namely, the base, body and apex, and samples were taken from each part immediately after slaughter and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Routine histological laboratory techniques were made and 6??m ?sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin staining and studied under light microscope. Lymphatic nodules were mostly found in the submucosa, but they disrupted the muscularis mucosa and merged into the lamina propria (Fig. 1c). The thickness of the mucosa and submucosa at these sites was smaller, and the epithelium that covered the mucosa was here modified into simple squamous or low cuboidal epithelia with dark and flattened nuclei (Figs 1b,d). The large and small lymphatic nodules were extensively accumulated in the apex, forming a nearly continuous layer in lamina propria and submucosa. However, they were less prominent at the base and least in the body of the cecum. 1 A [ Abdominal viscera of miniature horse: right view.

AB  - Surface ultrastructural observation of the thyroid gland in donkey revealed the coexistence of certain unusual follicles or cysts, the ultimobranchial (UB) follicles, which exhibited large diameters and less regular outlines. In addition, several small follicles, cell nests or solid cellular masses were also demonstrated in association with these structures. Surface of most UB follicular cells was almost hexagonal in shape, studded with sparse or dense pleomorphic microvilli, which were much denser at the cellular borders. Each follicular cell bore single cilium that projecting over the cell surface. Interestingly, bleb-like apocrine protrusion of the apical cytoplasm of some follicular cells was frequently demonstrated. These apocrine blebs (or aposomes) were varied in shape, size and showed smooth or irregular surface. In addition to such aposomes, deep to shallow circumscribed or eroded areas of the apical cell surface was frequently demonstrated. These findings indicate that the UB follicular cells in donkeys, similar to those of camels, exhibit an apocrine activity alongside with the usual merocrine mode of secretion.

AB  - Introduction and Aims:? Primary and secondary cell cultures of canine dermal fibroblasts were used to test the suitability of several senescence-linked cellular markers to characterize the chronological age of dogs. In further studies these markers will be used to test the hypothesis that senescence-linked changes at the cellular level are representative for the observed inverse relationship of body mass and life expectancy in different dog breeds. Methods:? In this study standardized skin samples of Beagles were used to analyse the cell morphology and several senescence-linked parameters as Cumulative Population Doubling Level, Highest Population Doubling Level, Culture Doubling Time and Life Span Completed to determine the replicative potential of fibroblasts. The samples were divided by the age of the donors into three groups (?young?, ?middle? and ?old?). Results:? There are notable differences between the replicative potential of young and old Beagles at the cellular level. Preliminary results show that in fibroblast cultures obtained from the young group the highest population doubling level is higher and the culture doubling time is shorter then in cultures of the old group. Cultures from the young and middle-aged group cannot be distinguished by the measured parameters. For final results the complete statistical analysis of sampled data has to be carried out. Conclusions:? Our results demonstrate a relationship between the chronological age of the skin donor and the replicative potential of the dermal fibroblasts. Therefore cellular senescence-linked markers could serve as suitable tools to compare the age of individual dogs of different breeds.

AB  - Introduction:? Interactions between horn quality and flooring systems significantly impact on claw health. Poor horn quality is associated with reduced milk yield, painful lesions or slaughtering. Horn quality is determined by horn cells, intercellular cement and hoof horn architecture, i.e. the structure and arrangement of the horn tubules. Soft and elastic flooring systems have been reported to have a positive influence on the microstructure of hoof horn. Aims:? We wanted to correlate the microstructure of claw horn to the horn quality in a large number of samples and detect influences of the flooring system on hoof horn microstructure. Methods:? Samples were obtained from two different studies: 40 cows from Hohenheim/Germany kept on slatted floor and subsequently on rubber mats for 4 months; 1000 cows from 11 farms in Luxembourg, kept on concrete floor. From all samples 7??m-sections were cut and stained with the PAS-reaction. Morphometry was done with the LuciaG?-software (Nikon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS? (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parameters measured were area, minimal and maximal diameter of both medulla and cortex of horn tubules. Statistical analysis included: tubules per visual field, area per visual field, total medulla area, total cortex area and the limiting values of diameters. Results:? Luxembourg samples showed consistency of tubule-parameters between both dates; all farms showed an average number ranging from 13.36 to 14.79 tubules per visual field. Hohenheim horn from the hard flooring showed 19.9 and horn of the same animals kept on rubber floor showed 20.5 tubules per visual field. Maximum diameter of hard-floor horn is 55??m whereas 45??m in animals kept on rubber floor. Conclusions:? The results show that genetic/individual differences take smaller influence on horn quality than housing systems. These outcomes provide evidence for the economical and animal welfare benefit of soft and elastic flooring systems. Further research will focus on correlation of biodata, such as physiological state, lactation, age, and claw horn microstructure. This work was supported by Biopsytec/Rheinbach.

AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important phospholipid messenger involved in diverse physiological and pathological conditions. Actions of PAF are mediated by a specific PAF receptor (PAF-R) and the inhibition of biological activity by PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). To elucidate the potential role of PAF in stimulating angiogenesis and trophoblast giant cell migration during gestation, we examined the expression and localization of PAF-R mRNA and protein as well as PAF-AH mRNA in the bovine placenta. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were applied to placentomes from days 20, 80, 150, 200, 240, 270 of gestation, and immediately pre-partum (around day 280). PAF-R mRNA and protein were colocalized in immature trophoblast giant cells (TGC), uterine epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of fetal and maternal vessels. There was no apparent difference in placental PAF-R mRNA or protein levels until day 270. In contrast, in placentomes taken immediately pre-partum the localization of the immunohistochemical and hybridization signals switched from immature TGC and maternal epithelium to cells of the maternal stroma, particularly endothelial cells of maternal vessels. mRNAs for PAF-AH isoforms Ib (?- and ?-subunit), II, and plasma-isoform were detected by RT-PCR in placentomes throughout gestation. In tissue sections mRNA of the PAF specific PAF-AH-Ib ?-subunit was predominantly found in TGC, while the intensity of the signal was weaker in maternal epithelium and endothelium of fetal and maternal vessels. Corresponding to the PAF-R expression, mRNA of PAF-AH Ib was detected mainly in maternal endothelial cells prior to parturition. The constitutive expression and localization of PAF-R and PAF-AH in epithelial and endothelial cells during gestation, together with the parturition-related switch to the maternal stroma suggests a functional role of PAF for the interaction of TGC with the maternal epithelium, and thus may be associated with TGC migration, placental angiogenesis and pre-partum tissue programming. Acknowledgement:? This study was supported by the German Research Foundation.

AB  - We investigated the embryotoxicity of ozone (O3), after gas exposure in ovo, to chick embryos of the Lohmann-Weiss strain. The main aim of the study is to reduce the microbiological content, particularly of Salmonella enteritides on the egg surface by the use of ozone in different concentrations and response times. The aim of our morphological study is to analyse the influence of gas exposure to the embryonal development of chick. Ozone has proved its worth as a disinfectant without the harmful adverse effects of formaldehyde. The chick embryo provides a useful and well-defined model for analysis of toxicity of chemicals, particularly with regard to an alternative disinfectant: ozone. Embryotoxicity of ozone in developing chick embryos was studied by examining different parameters: deformities and pathohistology of heart, liver, kidney and spleen, weight, length and survival of embryo. After oviposition the eggs were transferred to a chamber filled with ozon-oxygen-mixture in a defined concentration (1% - 5.22%). After achievement of the ozone concentration the eggs were incubated over various response times have 20, 30, 60?min or 17?h. After the incubator times of 18, 19 or 20?days we studied the development of the gas exposed embryos and unexposed controls. The organs were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1?hour provided low graded survival rates of 3.3?13.3%. There was significantly increase of the survival rate after decline of ozone concentration and response time of 90?100%. We found also a remarkable decrease of weight and length in fewer surviving gas exposed embryos with high ozone concentration and response time (Fig.?1.), compared with the normal development of gas-exposed embryos with study of high survival rate (Fig.?2.). We calculated a 60% increase in the survival rate of embryos exposed to high ozone concentration without response time. In low ozone concentration (1.8%) with high response time of 17?hours the survival rate decreased to 10%. We found no signs of deformities and pathohistology of organs in our embryological examination. In conclusion, ozone has a dose-dependent effect. The response time constitutes an important factor in the survival and growth of chick embryos after exposure to ozone in ovo. 1 [ High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1 hour result in a low survival rate of 3,3% and the surviving embryo shows a decrease in body weight and length (right) in comparison to the biggest (left) and lowest (middle) unexposed embryo. ] 2 [ Height comparison between the unexposed controls (both embryos on the left side) with gas exposed embryos (both embryos on the right side) in a study with low ozone concentration of 1% and low response time of 20 minutes. There are no differences in body weight and length between the unexposed and exposed embryos. ]

AB  - The arterial system of the gills of carp and its histological structure were studied light and electron microscopically by making Mercox or Neoplane Latex corrosion cast preparations. Four pairs of afferent and efferent branchial arteries, and a pair of afferent and efferent pseudobranchial arteries were identified in the branchial arterial system. The 1st and 2nd afferent branchial arteries are given off directly from the ventral aorta, and the 3rd and 4th afferent arteries originate from their common trunk, which is branched off from the ventral aorta caudal to the origin of the former branchial arteries. Numerous afferent filamental arteries are connected to the lamellar blood capillary networks in the gill lamellae via afferent lamellar arterioles, and efferent filamental arteries followed the efferent lamellar arterioles are converged into four efferent branchial arteries that are connected to the dorsal aorta. To the pseudobranchia, afferent pseudobranchial arteries are connected with the ventral branches of the 1st efferent branchial arteries to provide arterial blood to the organ through the afferent mandibular arteries. Afferent pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles originating from the afferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the blood capillary networks in the pseudobranchial lamellae, and blood in the capillary networks is drained into the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries via 2-4 pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles. Branches of the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the arteries to the eyeballs and provide blood to choroid of the vascular tunic of them. Pseudobranchial cells surrounding lamellar capillaries in the pseudobranchia are furnished with abundant mitochondria and tubular structures, and the histological findings suggest the cells may share an ability to exchange physiological materials between the cells and the blood in the capillary networks of pseudobranchia.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Vasculogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels from embryonic precursor cells. The formation of additional vessels is called angiogenesis, the sprouting from pre-existing vessels by migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells. Until recently vasculogenesis was considered to be restricted to embryogenesis, however, evidence suggests that progenitor cells exist in the adult, able to participate in neovascularization. In order to study cellular and molecular control mechanisms without animal testing we have established in featuring the three-dimensional formation of capillary-like structures from microvascular endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to identify the specific subpopulation of cells that triggers the primary process of vasculogenesis in vitro. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells were isolated from the bovine corpus luteum and examined by phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy. Immunolabelling was done for the most important pro-angiogenic factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors (VEGF-R1, -R2) as well as for endothelial cell surface markers (CD 31, CD51/61, CD29) and presumptive stem cell marker CD 34. Additionally VEGF and VEGF-R1, -R2 expression was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results:? The beginning of vessel formation in vitro was initiated by confluence of endothelial cells. A linear and circular side-by-side arrangement of cells and the formation of capillary-like structures with an internal lumen could be observed. Specific clusters of cells were identified. These cells were arranged in a star-like formation, i.e., one particular round cell in the centre surrounded by several cells with extensions. Immunolocalization of VEGF, VEGF-R1, -R2, CD 31, CD51/61, CD29 and CD34 was positive. VEGF-R2 and CD 34 were found to be co-localized in specific cells exclusively. Conclusions:? Results for the first time reveal the specific subpopulation of endothelial cells that trigger the start of vasculogenesis in vitro. These progenitor cells are characterized by a specific morphology, by the presence of endothelial cell markers and by the expression of stem cell marker in vitro models

AB  - Introduction:? The formation of the liver structure at mammal embryogenesis is interconnected by drawing up of venous mains. In parallel to the transformation of the main veins, there is a reduction of the blood formation function and the liver transformation from the primary organ of embryogenesis into the secondary one, but the exception is immaturity and underdeveloped maturity mammals (Smirnova, 1967; Mechtiev, 1968; Bresler, 1993). The purpose of research is to establish morphofunctional criteria of the incompleteness in the blood vessels and in tissue components of the liver in neonatal animals. Material and Methods:? The afferent and efferent liver veins of calves, piglets and puppies at one day of age were investigated. The complex of morphological, roentgenological, ultrasound and statistic methods was used. Results:? It was established that the liver veins in newborn animals portoumbilical (afferent) and caval (efferent) collectors. In 1-day-old calves, the afferent collector is connected with caval way of the large vein flow of the main type. Relative weight of the liver in the calves is 2.31?2.85%, hepatocytes form balks and they are not always oriented radially to the central venuels. There are no seats of haemopoesis. Sonography of the liver and its veins proves inconstancy of the sizes depending on acts of breath. In 1-day-old piglets, many treelike anastomoses follow with the left hepatic vein. Relative weight of the liver in the piglets is 2.27?4.64%. The parenchyma of the organ is spongy with the seats of haemopoesis (0.04 3.61%). In 1-day-old puppies afferent and efferent collectors combine through the venous duct. Additionally, in the abdominal cavity of puppies, there are the vitelline artery (starts from a. mesenterica) and vein (runs to v. porta near the afferent collector), following to the umbilical ring. Relative weight of the liver in the puppies is about 5.18?6.04%. Hepatocytes form the chaotic congestion with haemopoetic points (2.04?7.14%). Conclusion:? Thus, incompleteness of morphology of the liver is shown in preservation of provisional vein structures and tissue components of the embryonic type, which is one of the factors complicating diseases of digestive organs in neonatal animals.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the CT anatomy of the normal loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) head using three loggerhead sea turtle heads. CT imaging was performed using the following parameters: K.v.: 120?mAs: 220, and a soft-tissue window (WW 1880, WL 465): Transverse and sagittal CT images were obtained. Detailed anatomy of the head was acquired with the sagittal and transverse series. The heads were frozen and then sectioned using an electric saw, to compare them with the CT images. In CT, the grey scale is directly related to the radiation attenuation of the head structures. The skull and hyoid bones, and the lower jaw were easily identifiable due to the high CT density image compared to adjacent or surrounding structures such as the respiratory system, oral cavity, oesophagus and cranial cavity that appeared as a low opacity. The nervous structures, salt gland, eyeball, ramphoteca structure and different muscles of the head had an intermediate CT density and appeared grey. CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head provided excellent detail of clinically relevant anatomy and correlated well with corresponding gross specimens. CT of the head has considerable advantages over other techniques: CT provides excellent spatial resolution and good discrimination between bone and soft tissue, and the structures are viewed without superimposition. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the head allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, which is a useful tool for the identification of the CT images. With developing technology, CT imaging may soon become more readily available for exotic animals imaging. In the same way, we consider it quite useful to be able to establish some references on head, in order to scan only selected parts during a clinical or experimental approach. The information presented in this communication should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberuclosis. To investigate the efficacy of assays for early diagnosis, experimental infections were performed in goat kids. Oral doses of M. a. paratuberculosis were administered to goat kids over extended periods and the resulting infection was followed for 12?24?months. Complementary experiments were performed on goat kids vaccinated against M. a. paratuberculosis. Immunological, pathological and morphological examinations were undertaken in both these experimental systems. The analysis of results from these experiment series provided novel insights into the influence of the biology of gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the progress of disease, into the character of the tissue granuloma and its dominance of the local tissue response and into the relationship between the local and systemic immune responses.

AB  - Purpose:? Studies out of the United States and United Kingdom show great variability in practices relating to prostatic biopsy. This survey was performed to evaluate current practices in Australia and New Zealand. Methods:? Questionnaires were sent to Australian and New Zealand Urologists and Trainees on the database of the Urological Society of Australasia. Results:? Significant variability exists with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation; analgesic use; number of cores taken; and repeat biopsy practices. Most urologists (91%) perform their own biopsies. 9% refer to another urologist or radiologist. Transrectal biopsy is the favoured approach in 97%. Most urologists (96%) use antibiotic prophylaxis with the quinolone antibiotics being the most commonly used. Only 42% use bowel preparation for their biopsies. Analgesia is used in 79% with equal numbers using sedation and periprostatic nerve block. 77% take 10 cores or more for first biopsy. 28% do not inform their patients of a false negative rate with TRUS biopsy of the prostate. There were 36% and 60% who would not re-biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP respectively. Conclusions:? Prostate biopsy is a commonly performed procedure to diagnose carcinoma of the prostate. Despite significant variability, most Urologists and Trainees in Australia and New Zealand have safe biopsy protocols, given the evidence that is currently available. Evidence supports the use of analgesia and repeating biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP.
