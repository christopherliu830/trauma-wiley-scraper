AB  - Introduction:? Most of the morphological studies on the skin of birds refer to chickens. Little can be found about the specific fine structure of the foot-pad epidermis of turkeys and almost nothing is known about the developing reticulate scales in turkey foetuses. This study deals with the question as to whether the development and morphology of the reticulate scales of turkeys are similar to those of chickens. Since the first signs of food-pad dermatitis can be observed in turkey poults at the age of four days, it was additionally examined if these alterations can be found in turkey foetuses already. Methods:? Foot pad samples of heavy strain BUT Big 6 turkeys were collected at different developmental stages (day 20, 23, and 28 of incubation). The specimens were compared by light- and electron-microscopic methods. Results:? On the 20th day of incubation, the reticulate scales cover the food pads as small knob-like structures. Between the embryonic epidermal cells wide inter-cellular spaces are visible, and in the intermediate cells multigranular bodies (MGBs) are detectable. Peridermal cells cover the reticulate scales. They are characterized by peridermal granules and protuberances of the outer cell membrane. On the 23rd day of incubation, many lipid droplets are scattered within the intermediate cells. Because a thin stratum corneum has formed, the periderm is almost completely sloughing off. On the 28th day of incubation, the turkey poults hatch. The epidermis has almost reached maturity and a broad stratum corneum is detectable. Conclusions:? The development and morphology of the reticulate scale epidermis of turkey is comparable to that of chicken, although little differences were found. Besides former investigations, which described the peridermal protuberances as microvilli, scanning-electron microscopy proved that they also show a fingerprint-like surface structure that has not been observed for birds previously. Up to the hatching day, no signs of food pad alterations are seen in developing turkeys.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) is a modern technique of image diagnosis particularly recommended in human medicine to evaluate the existence of pulmonary pathological changes such as neoplasms, metastasis, interstitial infiltrates, etc. In veterinary medicine, however, few anatomical and clinical CT studies in the dog have used apparatus of the latest generation, including injection of intravenous contrast and application of regional specific CT windows with different window width (WW) and window level (WL) to evaluate the lungs, the pulmonary vessels and the bronchial structures. This methodology allows the obtaining of clear CT images with high capacity of tissue discrimination and different shades of attenuation. In this work we have planned a tomographic study of the lungs of the dog by using a six-generation spiral CT scanner (Toshiba Ex Vision), belonging to the private Medical Institute of Radiology ?Irion? of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Four mixed-breed mature dogs (4?6?years, 15?20?kg) were used, two males and two females. The dogs were anaesthetized and kept in a maximum inspiration when obtaining the images. Dogs were placed in a stretcher in a ventral or sternal recumbency. Previously, the contrast urografin? was injected in the cephalic vein. Different CT windows were applied in order to increase the quality of the images: pulmonary window (WW 928; WL -680), high-resolution pulmonary window (WW 1085; WL -750), and soft tissue window (WW 652; WL -34). The use of intravenous contrast, different CT windows and a modern CT apparatus produced excellent images of the pulmonary parenchyma, the pleural cavity, the pulmonary veins, the lobular rami of the pulmonary artery and the lobular bronchi.

AB  - Introduction:? Endothelial dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis are connected to ageing. However, the mechanisms involved in age-related alterations are not fully elucidated, whereby reduced VEGF-expression and decreased mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells are suggested as possible causes. When cultured in vitro, endothelial cells often enter a growth arrest phase called ?cellular senescence? that is consistent with many changes in age-related vascular disease. Based on the decreasing lifespan observed in high yielding dairy cows, a hypothesis has been formulated that these cows, due to their enormous metabolic performance, show an accelerated process of ageing, resulting in typical production-related diseases, particularly lameness. As a basis for further research into the role of endothelial cell biology in high producing cattle, the aim of this study was to set up a model of endothelial ageing. As a first step, the role of angiogenesis in the functional adaptation of the microvasculature of the bovine pododerma was examined. Material and methods:? Scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts of healthy juvenile and adult claws as well as pathologically altered claws, and routine light microscopy of pododermal serial sections was compared to an in vitro model of angiogenesis based on cultured bovine microvascular endothelial cells. For detection of angiogenic molecular control mechanisms effective in both, the pododermal system and our cell culture model, lectin- and immunohistochemistry as well as RT-PCR were carried out. Results and discussion:? In the adolescent and adult claw, sprouting and intussusceptive angioadaptation was demonstrated. Evidence of angiogenic processes was also detected in the pathologically altered claws. Immunolocalization of angiogenic factors within the dermo-epidermal system of the claw was established. The detected angioadaptation may be visible expression of the increased metabolic demands of the claw caused by the growing body-weight-load. Increase of the pododermal vascular density via angiogenesis was also the connectional reparative principle in pathologically altered claws.

AB  - So far, it was generally accepted that newly formed blood vessels are exclusively comprised of endothelial cells, and complemented by pericyte and myocyte recruitment during vessel maturation. Accordingly, participation of non-endothelial cells in the formation of blood vessels has rarely been suggested. Recently, evidence supporting the existence of tumour vessels lined by non-endothelial cells has emerged. Consequently, the concept of the inherent capacity of non-endothelial cells to behave like endothelial cells has been discussed for tumours, and this pathomechanism has been termed vascular mimicry. The corpus luteum is one of the most intensely vascularized tissues, and angiogenesis in the corpus luteum is more effective than in highly malignant tumours. Our results indicate active involvement of granulosa cells in luteal angiogenesis, and the aim of this study was to shed more light on this exciting prospect. The study was based on cultured granulosa cells isolated from the bovine ovary in different stages of follicle maturation. Morphology of angiogenic granulosa cells was studied by phase contrast, transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy. Expression of angiogenesis-regulating factors and their receptors was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cultured granulosa cells underwent changes reminiscent of endothelial angiogenesis, i.e., migration, proliferation, differentiation and three-dimensional organization, and expressed angiogenesis-regulating factors and their receptors. Our results suggest a tight regulatory and structural association of endothelial and granulosa cells in luteal angiogenesis, suggesting physiological vascular mimicry in the ovary.

AB  - According to our previous findings (Passantino et al. 2002a,b; 2004) we discovered that fish erythrocytes (FE) act as immune cells in that they bind and engulf Candida albicans (CA). Then, these activated FE interact with macrophages (M?) so that a so-called rosette results from such an interplay. A rosette consists of one or more M? containing ingested CA, centrally located and surrounded by CA activated FE. Quite interestingly, we found that supernatants of CA-activated FE contain cytokine-like factors able to modulate M? function. In particular, active supernatants are able to inhibit M? migration under agarose and this activity was identified as macrophage inhibiting factor (MIF) ? like function, by analogy to human MIF. On the other hand, same supernatants could enhance M? phagocytosis of CA, thus contributing to fungus killing. Taken together, these results suggest that FE act as immune cells by secreting cytokine-like factors, which contribute to the rosette formation through modulation of M?. References?

AB  - The present study investigated the arrangement and chemical coding of intramural nerve structures supplying the porcine stomach. Tissue samples comprising all layers of the wall of the ventricular fundus were collected from juvenile female pigs (n?=?4), which were first deeply anaesthetized and then transcardially perfused with buffered paraformaldehyde. The cryostat sections were processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence to study the distribution of the intramural nerve structures (visualized with antibodies against protein gene-product 9.5) and their neurochemical characteristics using antibodies against vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), galanin (GAL), vasoactive intestinal-polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SOM) and substance P (SP). The study confirmed the presence of three distinct nerve plexuses within the wall of the porcine stomach including one myenteric plexus and two, outer and inner, submucous plexuses. The outer and inner submucous plexuses (OSP and ISP, respectively) were similar in respect to the chemical coding of neurons they contained. Most of the neurons expressed immunoreactivity to SP (ISP 58%; OSP 60%) or to VAChT (ISP 56%; OSP 56%), some of them stained for GAL (ISP 18%; OSP 15%) and solitary nerve cells were SOM-positive (in ISP only). No neurons in the submucous plexuses displayed immunoreactivity to VIP or NOS. In the myenteric plexus, some neurons stained for NOS (20%), VAChT (15%), GAL (10%), VIP (8%) or SP (8%) while no neurons immunoreactive for SOM were encountered. In both submucous and myenteric plexuses, many varicose nerve fibres expressed immunoreactivity to VAChT, GAL or SP, while VIP-, SOM- or NOS-positive nerve terminals were less numerous. The comparison of the present results with those obtained by other authors has revealed distinct inter-species differences regarding the arrangement and chemical coding of nerve structures supplying the mammalian stomach.

AB  - Light microscopic observations revealed that in camel foetuses of 25?mm crown-to-rump length (CRL) the primordial tubular system of the prospective lung was formed of several tubules lined by undifferentiated columnar epithelium. Intra-epithelial neuroendocrine cells were the first elements to be differentiated in the lining epithelium of the primordial tubular system of the prospective lung as early as 25?mm CRL. On reaching 50?67?mm CRL, the primordial tubular system started to differentiate into two systems of primordial tubules, the prospective bronchial or light tubules and the future respiratory or dark tubules. The lining epithelium of the prospective bronchial tubules revealed a clear evidence of ciliogenesis as early as 80?mm CRL. From 800?mm CRL onwards, the bronchial epithelium demonstrated ciliated and non-ciliated secretory cells. The non-ciliated secretory cells of the bronchial epithelium of fetal camel lung showed moderate reaction to AB/PAS technique, for the first time, in fetuses reaching 600 mm CRL.

AB  - The third eyelid protects the eye, contribute to the aqueous portion of the pre-ocular film and its distribution over the corneal surface, as well as removal of foreign material from the anterior surface of the eye. It is rather vulnerable during fights and clinicians often have to perform surgery for third eyelid neoplasia. In dogs, this lid has a triangular shape, being widest at its free margin. It is vascularized by branches of the malar artery. Being of such importance as an adnexa of the eye, the authors concentrated their attention on its vascularization, which is not well defined. Methods:? Scanning Electronic Microscopy of vascular corrosion casts and intact tissue. Observations:? It was quite interesting to notice the presence of two patterns of vascularization inside the third eyelid. One can say that there are two segmental levels of vessels. In one of these there is a predominance of arteries and veins, while in the other a meshwork of third order arteries, capillaries and post-capillary venules are present. In fact, the branch of the malar artery that reaches the base of the third eyelid divides into smaller branches that cross almost the complete length of the lid giving only a few collateral vessels, in a monopodical way, and only near the free margin of the lid is possible to observe dicothomical ramifications that became rather anastomotic (being anastomoses of type I and II are present) and contribute to the microvascular meshwork. This microvascular net is drained by post-capillary venules and veins that empty as a brush into bigger veins that occupy the same segmental level as the third eyelid artery. Remarks:? This uncommon angioarchitecture is probably an adaptation to the fact that in the medial canthus of the eye this lid has a smaller space and the way of obtaining an efficient vascularization is by going straight to the top of the lid.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Canine malignant haemangioendothelioma is an aggressive neoplasia that affects mostly older dogs of large breeds with a strong predilection for the spleen, liver, heart and skin. The tumour originates in the vascular endothelium and consists of transformed cells forming large and leaky vessel-like structures. Prognosis is poor because surgery and chemotherapy have limited success in prolonging survival times and increasing quality of patients. A new strategy to treat this malignancy could be anti-angiogenic therapy based on the inhibition of proliferation, migration and three-dimensional organization of transformed cells. In order to reduce animal experiments, in vitro-models are required to test the safety and efficacy of anti-angiogenic drugs. So far only few models of angiogenesis are available using mostly human, rodent and bovine cells. Therefore, the aim of our study was to establish an in vitro model of canine haemangioendothelioma. Materials and Methods:? Tumours were collected from dogs during surgery or immediately after euthanasia. Isolation of cells was done from different areas of the tumours and by enzymatic digestion of the tissue. Cells were incubated in culture media with and without endothelial growth factors. Cells were characterized by lectin histochemistry using Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin and Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Moreover, RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was employed to investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors VEGF-R1 and -R2. Results and Conclusions:? Different populations of cells were isolated and cultured successfully from canine malignant haemangioendothelioma. Cells show characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells of an angiogenic phenotype, i.e. the formation of spheroids and tube-like structures as well as strong labelling for Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Thus, morphological and glycohistochemical results confirm the vascular character of the cells isolated. RT-PCR showed expression of VEGF. However, endothelium-specific VEGF receptors were not expressed. Loss of typical receptors is common in cancer and may correlate with increased tumour dedifferentiation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the pressure distribution under the paws of chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger) using static pedobarography. We included in our study three healthy chinchilla aged 1?3?year, both sexes, weighted 480?570?g. We performed static pedobarography (PEL 38 podometer) in each chinchilla and we took into account standing on four legs or two hind legs. We found that on standing on four legs, two types of contact area with base in chinchilla exist: first type ? the ring shape of contact area with base of forefeet with maximal pressure in forefeet at their central part and elliptic shape of foot contact area with base of hind legs (paws) with longer diameter about twice longer than the shorter one and with maximal pressure in hind legs at their posterior part (greater than pressure under forefoot paws), that a value was 98?g/cm2 In the second type of foot contact area with base a pattern of hind legs was similar to that of forefeet. During standing on two hind legs we distinguished the another type (third) of foot contact area with base that was similar to the first type with the difference made by the fact that animal was standing only on hind paws. In each animal we found also the contact area with base of a tail ? the contact area was similar to that of forefeet but the value of pressure was twice decreased. Concluding, the most frequent manner of contact area with base in chinchilla is 4 points contact with hind paws contact area twice greater than contact area of forefeet. Moreover, the fifth point of support can exist ? a tail, which is mainly important during standing on the hind paws.

AB  - Introduction:? On one hand, the distal phalanx in cattle is suspended by the wall segment of the dermis, on the other hand it is supported in the palmar/plantar region by the bulb with its specialized subcutaneous tissue. Recent results of various studies suggest that changes in tissue composition of the bulb and slackening of the suspension can lead to an unphysiological position of the distal phalanx within the horn capsule. This leads to an altered distribution of pressure and mechanically influences the dermal blood supply. In the worst case these changes may lead to sole ulcer. Aims:? The aim of this study was to develop a method to allow measuring the minimal distance between the surface of the distal phalanx and the inner surface of the horn capsule under various loading. Material and Methods:? The right front and the left hindclaws have been taken from seven healthy beef bulls (German Simmentals, average body weight 580?±?25?kg) from the local abattoir. After functional claw trimming the feet have been scanned in a computed tomograph (veterinary surgical clinics) in unloaded and the loaded state [distribution of body weight: 55% (front legs): 45 % (hind legs)]. Each distal phalanx and claw capsule have been reconstructed in both datasets via threshholding (?marching-cube-algorithm?). The minimal distance between both objects has been measured by the ?nearest-neighbour-algorithm?. Results:? No significant differences could be observed between front and hind claws and lateral and medial claws respectively. In the unloaded state there was a distance of 4?6?mm in the dorsal, abaxial and axial aspect of the distal phalanx, which almost remained constant in the loaded state. On the solear surface values increased from 3?mm at the tip of the coffin bone to 7?8?mm at the flexor tubercle where significant distance changes (approx. 3?mm) could be observed. Discussion:? A tilting movement of the distal phalanx becomes obvious with loading. Thus, especially the region of transition between the soft and the hard bulb experiences heavy compressive stress. This coincides topographically with the incidence of sole ulcers.

AB  - Introduction:? Elbow dysplasia is one of the most important orthopaedic diseases of the canine elbow joint. The medial coronoid process (MCP) and the anconeal process (AP) are involved with a high incidence. Aims:? The aim of this study was to clarify whether these processes are especially loaded resulting in osteoarthrosis. Material and Methods:? Elbow joints were examined from dogs of various breeds, with a body weight over 20?kg and an age ranging from 1 to 12?years. Only joints without damage to the articular cartilage have been included in this investigation. Articular surfaces have been evaluated macroscopically, subchondral bone density (long-term loading) and split-lines (long-term tensile loading) have been determined. Results:? In the humeral fossa olecrani, there was a distinct impression on the inner side of the lateral compared to the medial epicondyle. In the ulna, the MCP was much greater than the lateral coronoid indicating that the medial process has to support the humeral condyle to a higher extent. Subchondral split lines with a transverse orientation in the fossa olecrani gave evidence of long-term transverse tensile loading in this area. Split lines on the MCP were oriented radially as if the lateral edge was bent downwards. Subchondral bone density in the fossa olecrani was higher towards the lateral epicondyle in comparison to the medial. Furthermore, there was a bone density maximum on the medial part of the humeral condyle opposite of the MCP with its very high density. Discussion:? Gait analyses showed that there is a transverse, medially oriented force of up to 4% bodyweight acting on the paw during midstance. As the carpus is stable when slightly hyperextended during midstance loading there is a long lever arm from the ground up to an assumed rotation centre in the depth of the trochlear notch. The medially directed ground reaction force slightly rotates the forearm inwards causing a bending moment about the elbow joint, which leads to an increased pressure of the AP and the MCP. This bending in addition to sagittal loading is the reason for the high susceptibility of the MCP and AP.

AB  - This work was carried out on the parabronchi of ducks during the pre- and post-hatching periods. For this purposes, the samples were taken from the embryo of incubated eggs from the 10th to 28th?day of incubation, at regular interval, and from adult ducks under anaesthesia. The parabronchi first appeared at 14th?day of incubation as out-pouches, from the secondary bronchi, with solid free end invading the surrounding mesenchym. These pouches was lined by high cuboidal cells rested on PAS positive basal lamina, the cells showed free luminal quarter, which indicated an apocrine secretion. At 17th to 22nd?day of incubation, irregularities invading the underlying tissue were observed. This invading part was club-shape forming the future atrium and air capillaries. At 24th to 28th?day of incubation the parabronchi were observed at the center of a polygonal shape lobule (lung lobule), it was lined with squamous cells at the head of the clubs, while atrium was lined with cuboidal cells at both side of the stalk (interatrial septum), and the air capillaries was lined with attenuated squamous cells. Because of the breathing of the duck started before hatching the structure of the parabronchi was similar in post-hatching period to that of late stage of pre-hatching period. The wall of parabronchi was pierced by a number of openings leading to the atrium. The lining epithelium was followed by a layer of smooth muscles, which formed a sphincter around the opening of the atrium regulating the amount of air passed to the atrium and air capillaries to avoid hyperventilation. The E.M. picture revealed that, the epithelium of parabronchi was squamous and displayed a scarce number of microvilli, while that of the atrium was cuboidal with a large number of microvilli, the cells of both contained osmiophilic multilamiller bodies that extruded to the surface. Under the epithelium of parabronchi, there were: smooth muscle cells, macrophages, mast cells, collagen fibers, and fibroblasts, while in the interatrial septum between the epithelium on both side there were collagen fibers and fibroblasts only.

AB  - Most mammals have two different structures in which we found glomerular layers at the same time: the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Both bulbs have the same pattern of organization, but there are some differences: although the size is considerably bigger in MOB than in AOB, probably the most important difference is that the principal cells are not differentiated into mitral and tufted cells in the AOB, and are usually described as mitral/tufted cells. We have previously observed that in some mammals, like pigs and sheep, the AOB reaches maturity before birth, but this is not a rule for other species. Surprisingly, mice need several days of life to achieve full stratification of its cellular components. We have studied the chronology of this process, focusing our attention on the glomerular layer, the last to appear. We concluded that there are two critical periods, between E11.5 and E16.5 (migration phase) and between E17.5 and P3.5?7 (true morphological constitution).

AB  - The cecum is a great cul-de sac intercalated between the small intestine and the colon. It has a remarkable size in the equine and digestion of more than 30% of total cellulose and production of volatile fatty acids by anaerobic metabolism of cellulose by its micro flora were made on it. It has also a substantial number of lymphatic nodules, which in horses are located near the apex. Topographically, cecum is situated chiefly to the right of the median plane and occupies around the whole volume of there in the abdominal cavity. The histological structure of the lymphatic follicles and their distributions pattern throughout the cecum in five healthy mature miniature horses (an special species of horses lives only in north of Iran) were studied (Fig. 1a). Each cecum was divided into three parts, namely, the base, body and apex, and samples were taken from each part immediately after slaughter and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. Routine histological laboratory techniques were made and 6??m ?sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin staining and studied under light microscope. Lymphatic nodules were mostly found in the submucosa, but they disrupted the muscularis mucosa and merged into the lamina propria (Fig. 1c). The thickness of the mucosa and submucosa at these sites was smaller, and the epithelium that covered the mucosa was here modified into simple squamous or low cuboidal epithelia with dark and flattened nuclei (Figs 1b,d). The large and small lymphatic nodules were extensively accumulated in the apex, forming a nearly continuous layer in lamina propria and submucosa. However, they were less prominent at the base and least in the body of the cecum. 1 A [ Abdominal viscera of miniature horse: right view.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was induced by transient (10 min) applications of KCl in agar upon the cortical surface of α-chloralose anaesthetised cats. Its features were compared with CSD resulting from sustained applications of crystalline KCl through a mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DWI) over a poststimulus period of 60?100 min. Individual CSD events were computationally detected with the aid of Savitzky-Golay smoothing applied to critically sampled data derived from regions of interest (ROIs) made up of 2 ? 2 pixel matrices. The latter were consistently placed at three selected sites on the suprasylvian gyrus (SG) and six sites on the marginal gyrus (MG). The CSD events thus detected were then quantitatively characterised for each ROI using the original time series. Both stimuli consistently elicited similar spreading patterns of initial, primary CSD events that propagated over the SG and marginal MG and were restricted to the hemispheres on which the stimuli were applied. There followed secondary events over smaller extents of cortical surface. Sustained stimuli elicited primary and secondary CSD events with similar amplitudes of ADC deflection that were distributed around a single mean. The ADC deflections were also conserved in peak amplitude throughout the course of their propagation. The initial primary event showed a poststimulus latency of 1.1 ± 0.1 min. Successive secondary events followed at longer, but uniform, time intervals of around 10 min. Primary and secondary CSDs showed significantly different velocities of conduction (3.32 ± 0.43 mm min?1vs. 2.11 ± 0.21 mm min?1, respectively; n= 5) across the cerebral hemisphere. In contrast, transient stimuli produced significantly fewer numbers of CSD events (3.8 ± 0.5 events per animal, n= 5) than did sustained stimuli (7.4 ± 0.5 events per animal, mean ±s.e.m., n= 5, P= 0.002). The peak ADC deflection of their primary CSD events declined by ≈30 % as they propagated from their initiation site to the interhemispheric boundary. The primary CSD event following a transient stimulus showed a latency of 1.4 ± 0.1 min. It was followed by successive and smaller secondary ADC deflections that were separated by progressively longer time intervals. Conduction velocities of secondary events were similar to those of primary events. Conduction velocities of both primary and secondary events were slower than their counterparts following a sustained stimulus. ADC changes associated with CSD thus persist at times well after stimulus withdrawal and vary markedly with the nature of the initiating stimulus even in brain regions remote from the stimulus site.
