AB  - At the University of Missouri-Columbia, USA, teaching the anatomy of genital organs in large (and in small) animals is clinically oriented. In the male horse, ox, and pig, the descriptive anatomy of the structures is taught in that order as they are listed in Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria. Clinical correlates are immediately mentioned in relation to each of the following structures. The testicle, epididymis, ductus deferens, spermatic cord, and tunics of spermatic cord and testis are correlated to the castration, criptorchidism, ectopic testicles, and inguinal herniae, as well as to the landmarks and approaches to different clinical techniques. The penis and male urethra are correlated to the prolapse of the prepuce, ulcerative posthitis, balanitis, penile deviation, penischisis, persistent penile frenulum, short retractor penis muscle, catheterization of the urethra, the contagious equine metritis (CEM), etc. In the female horse, ox and pig, following the similar order as in the male species, the ovary and the salpinx are correlated to the diagnosis of pregnancy by rectal exploration, ovarian hypoplasia, ectopic pregnancy, and ovariectomy. The uterus is correlated to the different aspects of metritis and endometritis, to the retained placenta, pyometra, uterine torsion, uterine prolapse and eversion, Caesarian section, diagnosis of pregnancy and different stages of oestrus by rectal exploration, double external ostium of the cervix, distocia, and the assessment of possible difficulties in the birth process. The vagina and vestibulum vaginae are correlated to the gaertneritis, vaginal and cervical prolapse, vaginitis, catheterization of the urinary bladder, and pelvimetry. The vulva and clitoris are correlated to vulvitis, balanitis, distocia, episiotomy, and transmissible genital diseases. Different kinds of udder diseases (mastitis) are based on the thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the udder including the blood and nerve supply and the lymphatic system. The two techniques of epidural anesthesia (Magda and Farquharson in ruminants) and subsacral anaesthesia (Popescu) for diagnosis and treatment purposes are explained in detail.

AB  - The oestrogen receptor beta (ERß) is largely distributed in the ovary of many species but data for the bovine ovary are scare. Therefore, the expression of ERß mRNA in the different follicles of the bovine ovary was studied using in situ hybridization. Ovarian tissue sections of three cows with different plasma progesterone concentrations were used (cow 1: 3.50?ng/ml; cow 2: 1.00?ng/ml, cow 3: 0.35?ng/ml). A 602?bp fragment of ERß mRNA was cloned, sequenced and digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled. Subsequently, in situ hybridization was performed by incubating the sections with the DIG-labelled RNA anti-sense probe. For the semi-quantitative evaluation of ERß mRNA expression the ERß mRNA score (SER) was determined for the different follicular cell types using the formula: SER = 0.n0 + 1.n1+ 2.n2 + 3.n3 with n0, n1, n2, n3 indicating the percentage of cells exhibiting a staining intensity 0 (absent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong), respectively. High ER mRNA levels were noticed in primordial and primary follicle cells, and suggest a role of ER mRNA in early folliculogenesis. A lower SER was observed in the granulosa cells of secondary and tertiary follicles. This significant difference in the SER of follicle cells during follicular growth may be associated with cell proliferation. In obliterative and cystic atretic follicles high SER were observed, although ERß mRNA levels in obliterative follicles showed much inter-individual variation. This is suggestive for ERß mediated oestrogen action in atretic follicles. In the corpora lutea moderate ERß mRNA levels were noticed. Our findings are in accordance with studies in the ewe in which corpora lutea cells synthesize estrogen. These preliminary findings will be further elaborated in a higher number of cows to examine the role of ERß in the ovary throughout the oestrus cycle.

AB  - The morphology and function of the circumanal glands in dogs is under current discussion. They are clinically important because they rank fourth in frequency as the site of canine skin tumours. The tissue is known to be governed by steroid hormones, as the gland exhibit sexual dimorphism, castration reduces the size of the gland and lead to tumour regression. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the hormone receptors in healthy circumanal glands as well as adenomas and adenocarcinomas in intact and castrated female and male dogs of different age groups. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against androgen receptor (AR, Affinity Bioreagents, rabbit pc, 1:150) and oestrogen receptor (ER, Zymed Lab., rabbit pc, 1:200) after antigen retrieval with microwave cooking. Positive and negative nuclei were counted using Eclipse software and subsequently statistically evaluated. ER and AR-positive nuclei could be detected in healthy as well as in diseased tissue sections of the circumanal gland. The number of positive nuclei was higher in the flattened peripheral cells compared to the large polygonal cells in the centre of the lobule. There was no significant difference between male and female tissue and between healthy glands and tumours although in tumours there was a tendency to a higher number of positive cells. In tumours, the distribution of hormone receptor positive cells was more irregular and varied between single lobules. Castrated animals of both sexes showed a slightly higher number of positive nuclei than intact animals, but the difference was not significant. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of steroid hormone receptors in the canine circumanal gland. We suggest that an evaluation of steroid hormone receptors is justified before general hormonal or anti-hormonal treatment of patients.

AB  - Aim:? The aims of this study were immunhistochemical (IHC) and ultrastruktural characterization of cells involved in vaccine granuloma formation in Atlantic salmon. Methods:? Fish suffering from severe reaction 6 to 9 months after vaccination were selected. We investigated granuloma from peritoneum, at the injection site. Morphological staining techniques, IHC to visualise MHC+ cells and ultrastructural analysis were performed. Results:? Microbial investigations revealed no infective agents. Histological and ultrastructural studies revealed Russel bodies, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, melanomacrophages (MMP), mast cells (MC) and Splendore?Hoepply material in the lesions. Conclusion:? Signet ring cells identified after vaccination have been hitherto described as svollen mast cells. This study shows that these cells fit the Russel body characteristic, consistent with humoral stimulation following vaccination and foreign material precipitate, Splendore-Hoepply material. MHC+ cells were located circumferal to granuloma centers. MMP were present containing melanosomes in different developmental stages.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? The corpus luteum is one of the most intensely vascularized tissues. Luteal angiogenesis is strictly controlled and blood vessels regress completely within a short period of time. The aim of this study was to investigate vascular dynamics in relation to cellular and molecular mechanisms of luteal angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells of blood vessels in paraffin sections of bovine corpora lutea from different stages were examined by labelling with the lectin Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. Angiogenesis was studied by morphometry of the capillaries, and immunolocalization of the angiogenic factor VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2. Presence of apoptotic luteal and endothelial cells was investigated using the TUNEL test and transmission electron microscopy. Results:? During development of the corpus luteum (day 3?8 of the oestrous cycle) a dense capillary network (8?12% area ratio) is established and maintained until day 17. Early regression (day 18?24) is characterized by a remarkable decrease of capillaries (1% area ratio). In the regressing corpus luteum the number of apoptotic luteal cells is closely correlated (r?=?0.9) to the number of apoptotic endothelial cells. VEGF is immunolocalized in luteal cells (day 3?17), smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of arterioles of the regressing corpus luteum. During late luteal regression, a moderate increase of capillaries (2.5% area ratio) is obvious. Conclusions:? The dynamic changes of the capillarity during development and regression of the cyclic corpus luteum correlate with VEGF and VEGF-R2 activities. In contrary to expectations the late stage of luteal regression is accompanied by angiogenesis. One reason for this phenomenon may be an increase in metabolic activity resulting in re-organization of blood vessels already regressed.

AB  - The increased use of embryo technologies, in particular in cattle, has emphasized the need for assessing embryo quality by morphological techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry for confocal laser scanning microscopy, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. By a combination of these techniques, we have demonstrated that (1) the rRNA gene activation in the 8-cell bovine embryo as monitored by nucleolar development is comparable in embryos developed in vivo and produced in vitro, whereas embryos reconstructed by cloning by nuclear transfer display deviations in nucleolar development, (2) generating bovine embryos by in vitro production and reconstruction by nuclear transfer is associated with increased occurrence of apoptosis, in particular in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, (3) the same two embryo production techniques are associated with increased occurrence of mixoplody, i.e. embryos presenting a major population of normal diploid cells and a minor population of abnormal haploid or polyploid cells, and (4) upon hatching from the zona pellucida, the inner cell mass of the bovine blastocyst differentiate into hypoblasts and epiblasts, the latter of which forms a laminin enclosed pluripotent cell niche staining positive for the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4; a morphology that resembles that maintained by bovine ES-like cells cultured through several passages in vitro.

AB  - Leishmaniases are a globally widespread group of parasitic diseases from the group of anthropozoonoses. They are caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and dogs worldwide. In fact, the dog is considered one of the most important reservoir. The spleen is one of the several haematopoietic and immunocompetent organs involved. As this organ is a blood filter, the authors looked for the expression of this infection over the microvascular environment and modifications of the spleen cell population related to immunological responses to this parasitic condition. Tools:? Scanning electronic microscopy over intact tissue and corrosion casts, transmission electronic microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry (MAC 387 and CD3). Results:? Our results show three important modifications concerning the microvascular architecture of the spleen when compared to the normal pattern. A striking scarcity of the sinusoidal system sheath that surrounds the central arteries of the white pulp, a huge development of pulp venules and veins, differentiation of typical features of high endothelial venular cells. Remarks:? According to our results it seems that independent of the virulence of the parasite involved and the kind of immunity prevalent in a particular host, the spleen develops blood dynamic conditions that allows a sluggish blood flow so that cells involved in immunological processes can proliferate and differentiate and it also contributes to the trapping of lymphocytes to the area through the differentiation of typical characteristics of HEV endothelial cells.

AB  - Knowledge of the functional morphology of equine cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) shortly before ovulation is scarce. Therefore the aim of our studies was to characterize COCs matured in vivo by light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunohistochemistry (ICC). Pre-ovulatory COCs were obtained by ultrasound-guided transvaginal aspiration of pre-ovulatory follicles of 26 pony mares. The morphology of pre-ovulatory COCs was compared to that of immature COCs obtained by slicing of ovaries from the slaughterhouse. As shown by light microscopy and SEM, immature COCs possess numerous round, densely packed cumulus cells, which contact each other and possess merely single short processes. Contrary, in pre-ovulatory oocytes the cumulus cells are widely separated but send long cytoplasmic processes to the zona pellucida (ZP). All the cumulus cells are embedded in a huge amount of homogenous extracellular matrix. As shown by alcian blue staining and Periodic Acid Schiff Reaction (PAS) with and without amylase digestion, this matrix contains glycoproteins and acidic and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. In pre-ovulatory COCs both the oocyte and the cumulus cells produce glycosaminoglycans, whereas immature COCs are negative for alcian blue. Similarly, glycoproteins are synthesized in pre-ovulatory, but not in immature COCs. As shown by ICC, hyaluronic acid is one of the most abundant mucopolysaccharide in the pre-ovulatory COC. The high synthetic activity of the cumulus cells in the pre-ovulatory COC is confirmed by TEM showing densely packed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accumulation of glycogen in the cumulus cells. Our results imply that in the equine in vitro maturation of the oocyte is characterized by the cumulus cells synthesizing an extracellular matrix of glycoproteins and acidic and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. The extensive production of extracellular, water-binding matrix in the pre-ovulatory COC ensures mechanical protection and nutrition of the oocyte.

AB  - This study was conducted on nine heads of normal adult one-humped camels. The specimens were collected from Cairo slaughterhouse. The nasal cavity in the freshly collected samples were dissected and photographed. The specimens for microscopic studies were fixed in different fixatives and prepared to examine by light and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The nasal cavity of the camel was studied grossly and by using of light and scanning electron microscope. Specimens from different regions of this cavity were subjected to different histological stains and also demonstrated by the acid and alkaline phosphatases. Gross morphological examination of this cavity showed its three parts: rostral part (the nasal vestibule) covered with skin of usual structure then it lined with smooth mucosa. The middle part (respiratory) had dorsal, middle and ventral nasal conchae, but the caudal part (olfactory) contained the ethmoidal concha. The lining mucosa of the camel nasal cavity was similar to that of other mammals, but there were some differences: the respiratory epithelium showed a small number of goblet cells and there were a mixture of acidic and neutral mucins inside the epithelial and glandular mucous cells. Strong acid and alkaline phosphatase reaction was observed in the lining epithelium of the nasal cavity. By SEM, it showed the surface epithelial layer of the nasal cavity mucosa in three regions (vestibule, respiratory and olfactory) and resulted that it was stratified cuboidal to columnar epithelium, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with few goblet cells or olfactory mucosa containing neurosensory olfactory cells. This study aimed to investigate the anatomical features, the histological and histochemical structures of the nasal cavity in one humped camel. The findings of this study were discussed with the previous works in this field with the other domestic animals.

AB  - The anatomical and clinical studies of computed tomography (CT) in Camelidae are scarce. The use of CT in large animal medicine is currently limited by the logistic problems of acquiring computed tomographic images. Several CT studies exist on adult llamas, but not in camels. Accurate interpretation of the planimetric CT normal anatomy is necessary for the study and evaluation of pathological tissues. The purpose of our work was to evaluate the thorax of the newborn camel and related structures by means of CT images and macroscopic sections. One newborn camel of one week was used. It was euthanized for medical reasons unrelated to disease of the thorax. CT images were obtained and detailed anatomy of the thorax was acquired. Different CT windows, soft-tissue and pulmonary windows, were applied in order to obtain detailed attenuation shades of the thoracic structures. The camel was frozen and sectioned using an electric saw, and we obtained high quality images of the thorax compared with CT images. Clinically relevant anatomic structures of the thorax cavity were identified and labelled in the corresponding CT and gross-section photographs. The information presented in this paper should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the newborn camel thorax.

AB  - The influence of some environmental factors and some protecting substances were tested in a laboratory trial with healthy coronary horn and compared with specimens of damaged horn from the bearing border, which had been submitted to a faeces-urine medium. Hoof horn of the best quality from the middle zone of coronary horn (3?4?cm distal of the coronary band) was submitted to different organic media or to some hoof horn varnishes or to heat. The horn specimens of defined size were treated for 36?days with urine, faeces and urine, urea, faeces or faeces and biotine and their strength was compared with untreated controls. The mentioned excrements were collected from horses. The second group comprised some hoof varnishes or hoof-conditioners (Horsepan, Isohoof Protect, Krealit, Pedalo) and were kept for 24?h in these media. The influence of heat was tested after the horn specimens were heated in an oven for 5?min to 125°C. The results of histologically unchanged horn were compared to horn specimens of the bearing border, where frequently histological changes such as microcracks occur. Two groups of 20 specimens from the bearing border were treated with a mixture of faeces and urine for 5?weeks, and their tensile strength was compared to the same number of untreated controls. The tensile strength of unchanged coronary horn remained nearly unchanged or was only slightly diminished when it was treated with the different media. The treatment with heat did not reduce the tensile strength or showed even a slight increase compared to untreated specimens. The tensile strength of bearing border specimens showed a highly significant decrease of tensile strength of about 55% after 5?weeks treatment with faeces-urine in both trials compared to the untreated controls. The results indicate that unchanged horn is much more resistant to environmental factors than bearing border horn with first damages. For prevention of severe changes at the bearing border horses should not stand for a long time in beddings with a high content of faeces and urine.

AB  - In the enteric nervous system, nitric oxide (NO) is regarded as an important messenger for the non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic neurotransmission. Synthesized mainly by the constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms NOS I and NOS III, this molecule executes pre-junctional inhibitory effects in the submucosal plexus as well as relaxation of the enteric smooth muscles. In order to elucidate the role for NO during enteric development, we looked for the expression of all three NOS-isoforms in the enteric nervous system during mouse development from E8 to E20 using immunohistochemistry. Starting around midgestation, a transient expression of the NOS-II isoform during the very early development of enteric neurones was detected in parallel to that of HNK-1 exclusively in the myenteric plexus. Similar to findings for other neuronal systems, NOS-I and NOS III isoforms could be traced starting significantly later to increase towards the end of embryonic development when NOS II immunoreactivity faded and a strong expression of the vasointestinal peptide (VIP) could be detected. In contrast to the NOSII expression, the constitutive isoforms can also be detected in the submucosal plexus. Altogether, these findings suggest NOS-II to be exclusively involved during early steps of enteric nervous system development. Absence of downstream signalling elements, such as sGC and cGMP both in neurons and in enteric muscle until the end of the second third of gestation, may indicate different effects executed by NO during development, expressed by Ca2+ dependent and independent NOS isoforms.

AB  - Purpose:? Studies out of the United States and United Kingdom show great variability in practices relating to prostatic biopsy. This survey was performed to evaluate current practices in Australia and New Zealand. Methods:? Questionnaires were sent to Australian and New Zealand Urologists and Trainees on the database of the Urological Society of Australasia. Results:? Significant variability exists with regard to antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation; analgesic use; number of cores taken; and repeat biopsy practices. Most urologists (91%) perform their own biopsies. 9% refer to another urologist or radiologist. Transrectal biopsy is the favoured approach in 97%. Most urologists (96%) use antibiotic prophylaxis with the quinolone antibiotics being the most commonly used. Only 42% use bowel preparation for their biopsies. Analgesia is used in 79% with equal numbers using sedation and periprostatic nerve block. 77% take 10 cores or more for first biopsy. 28% do not inform their patients of a false negative rate with TRUS biopsy of the prostate. There were 36% and 60% who would not re-biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP respectively. Conclusions:? Prostate biopsy is a commonly performed procedure to diagnose carcinoma of the prostate. Despite significant variability, most Urologists and Trainees in Australia and New Zealand have safe biopsy protocols, given the evidence that is currently available. Evidence supports the use of analgesia and repeating biopsy for HGPIN and ASAP.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was induced by transient (10 min) applications of KCl in agar upon the cortical surface of α-chloralose anaesthetised cats. Its features were compared with CSD resulting from sustained applications of crystalline KCl through a mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DWI) over a poststimulus period of 60?100 min. Individual CSD events were computationally detected with the aid of Savitzky-Golay smoothing applied to critically sampled data derived from regions of interest (ROIs) made up of 2 ? 2 pixel matrices. The latter were consistently placed at three selected sites on the suprasylvian gyrus (SG) and six sites on the marginal gyrus (MG). The CSD events thus detected were then quantitatively characterised for each ROI using the original time series. Both stimuli consistently elicited similar spreading patterns of initial, primary CSD events that propagated over the SG and marginal MG and were restricted to the hemispheres on which the stimuli were applied. There followed secondary events over smaller extents of cortical surface. Sustained stimuli elicited primary and secondary CSD events with similar amplitudes of ADC deflection that were distributed around a single mean. The ADC deflections were also conserved in peak amplitude throughout the course of their propagation. The initial primary event showed a poststimulus latency of 1.1 ± 0.1 min. Successive secondary events followed at longer, but uniform, time intervals of around 10 min. Primary and secondary CSDs showed significantly different velocities of conduction (3.32 ± 0.43 mm min?1vs. 2.11 ± 0.21 mm min?1, respectively; n= 5) across the cerebral hemisphere. In contrast, transient stimuli produced significantly fewer numbers of CSD events (3.8 ± 0.5 events per animal, n= 5) than did sustained stimuli (7.4 ± 0.5 events per animal, mean ±s.e.m., n= 5, P= 0.002). The peak ADC deflection of their primary CSD events declined by ≈30 % as they propagated from their initiation site to the interhemispheric boundary. The primary CSD event following a transient stimulus showed a latency of 1.4 ± 0.1 min. It was followed by successive and smaller secondary ADC deflections that were separated by progressively longer time intervals. Conduction velocities of secondary events were similar to those of primary events. Conduction velocities of both primary and secondary events were slower than their counterparts following a sustained stimulus. ADC changes associated with CSD thus persist at times well after stimulus withdrawal and vary markedly with the nature of the initiating stimulus even in brain regions remote from the stimulus site.
