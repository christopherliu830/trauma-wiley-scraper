AB  - Abstract The objective of this translational study was to evaluate the FDA-approved PediMag, CentriMag, and RotaFlow centrifugal blood pumps in terms of hemodynamic performance using simulated neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits with different sizes of arterial and venous cannulae. Cost of disposable pump heads was another important variable for this particular study. The experimental circuit was composed of one of the centrifugal pump heads, a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator, neonatal and pediatric arterial/venous cannulae, and 1/4-inch ID tubing. Circuits were primed with lactated Ringer?s solution and packed human red blood cells (hematocrit 35%). Trials were conducted at 36°C using the three pump heads and different cannulae (arterial/venous cannulae: 8 Fr/18 Fr, 10 Fr/20 Fr, and 12 Fr/22 Fr) at various flow rates (200?2400 mL/min, 200 mL/min increments) and rotational speeds. Pseudo patient pressure was 60 mm Hg. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded for analysis. The RotaFlow pump had a higher pressure head and flow range compared with the PediMag and CentriMag pumps at the same rotational speed and identical experimental settings (P < 0.001). The PediMag pump had lower flow output than others (P < 0.001). Small-caliber arterial cannulae and higher flow rates predictably created higher circuit pressures and pressure drops. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic energy delivered to the pseudo patient with each of the three pumps. The arterial cannula had the highest pressure drop and hemodynamic energy loss in the circuit when compared to the oxygenator and arterial tubing. The RotaFlow centrifugal pump had a significantly better hemodynamic performance when compared to the PediMag and CentriMag blood pumps at identical experimental conditions in simulated neonatal and pediatric ECMO settings. In addition, the cost of the RotaFlow pump head ($400) is 20 to 30-fold less than the other centrifugal pumps [CentriMag ($12 000) or PediMag ($8000)] that were evaluated in this translational study.

AB  - In my presentation, I review the sexual differentiation from the genetic sex until the appearance of the external genitalia and the developmental anomalies to use an animated cartoon. The first critical stage of sexual differentiation occurs at the moment of fertilization, when the genetic sex of the zygote is determined by the nature of the sex chromosome contributed by the sperm. Although an XY zygote is destined to become a male, no distinctive differences between the early development of male and female embryos have been noted. This is accomplished after migration of the primordial germ cell into the early gonad. Because of the early commonality of genital structures, anomalies are the result of abnormal retention or loss of appropriate genital structures. Therefore, most genital anomalies are some form of intersex. During the early differentiation of the gonads, while the mesonephros is still the dominant excretory organ, the gonads arise as ridge like thickenings (gonadal ridge) on its ventromedial face. Differentiation of the indifferent gonads into ovaries or testes occurs after the arrival of the primordial germ cells. The primordial germ cells arise from the endodermal cells of the yolk. The principal function of the Y chromosome is to direct the differentiation of the presented indifferent gonad into a testis from the sixth week, while two X chromosome are presented the ovaries start to develop, from the 12th?week. The next and most obvious phase in sexual differentiation of the embryo is the differentiation of the somatic sex. The early embryo develops a dual set of potential genital ducts, one is the original mesonephric (Wolff ) ducts, which persists after degeneration of the mesonephros as an excretory organ, and the another is newly formed pair of ducts called the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts. Under the influence of testosterone secreted by the testes, the mesonephric ducts develop into the duct system through which the spermatozoa are conveyed from the testes to the urethra. The potentially female paramesonephric ducts regress under the influence of another product of the embryonic testes, the Müllerian inhibitory factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the Sertoli cells. In genetically female embryos, neither testosterone nor Müllerian inhibitory factor are secreted by the gonads. In the absence of testosterone the mesonephric ducts regress and lack of Müllerian inhibitory factor permits the paramesonephric ducts to develop into oviducts, the uterus and part of the vagina. The next stage is the development of the external genitalia. In very young embryos, a vaguely outlined elevation known as the genital eminence can be seen in the midline, just cephalic to the proctodeal depression. This is soon differentiated into a central prominence (genital tubercle) closely flanked by a pair of folds (genital folds) extending toward the proctodeum. Somewhat farther to either side are rounded elevation known as the genital swellings. From this common starting point the external genitalia of both sex differentiate. If the individual is to develop into a male the genital tubercle, under the influence of dihydrotestosterone, becomes greatly elongated to form the penis and the genital swellings become enlarged to form the scrotal pouches. During the growth of the penis a groove develops along the entire length of its caudal face and is continuous with the slit-like opening of the urogenital sinus. This groove later becomes closed over by a ventral fusion of the genital folds, establishing the penile portion of the urethra. The portion of the urogenital sinus between the neck of the bladder and the original opening of the urogenital sinus becomes the prostetic urethra. In the female, the genital tubercle becomes the clitoris, the genital folds become the labia minora, and the genital swellings become the labia majora. The urethra in the female is derived from the urogenital sinus, being homologous with the prostatic portion of the male urethra.

AB  - By computed tomography the liver has an intermediate degree of attenuation, with a CT value (HU) between 70 and 75. However, this number may vary according to the generation of the apparatus, the use of contrasts medium, the efficiency of the detector, etc. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the liver of the dog and related structures by means of a six-generation spiral CT scanner (Toshiba Ex Vision [[Au: please provide manufacturers details for ?Toshiba Ex Vision?: city, state code (if USA) and Country]]), and the previous injection of intravenous contrast medium via cephalic vein. Four half-breed mature dogs (4?6?years, 15?20?kg) were used, two males and two females. The dogs were anaesthetized and kept over a stretcher in sternal recumbency. To evaluate the liver two different CT windows with different window width and window level were applied: soft tissue window (WW 652; WL -34) and mediastinal-vascular window (WW 352; WL 220). The CT images obtained allowed an excellent resolution at the level of the hepatic lobules, the gall bladder, the porta vein, the hepatic artery, the caudal cava vein, etc. The attenuation shades of these structures were very similar in the two used windows, however a better contrast was obtained with the soft tissue window.

AB  - The present study in 58 dogs aimed to verify the changes of the canine endometrial surface epithelium during the estrous cycle using electron microscopy and to investigate the roles of apoptosis, cell proliferation and matrix metalloproteinases in canine endometrial remodelling using immunohistochemistry. Possible correlations between these phenomena and serum levels of estradiol-17? and progesterone were assessed. Prominent scanning electron microscopic changes of the canine endometrium were observed during early metestrus and included a variable height and number of microvilli of the surface epithelium. Using transmission electron microscopy, pronounced features of the surface epithelial cells were noticed in late metestrus and anestrus, during which a highly vacuolized cytoplasm and deformed nuclei due to fat accumulation were present. In these stages no prominent signs of cell death were noticed and also very low apoptotic numbers were observed using immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation in the endometrial surface epithelium seemed to be in balance with apoptosis. Most prominent features of apoptosis and proliferation were found in the basal glands and to a lesser extent also in the crypts. In contrast, only low amounts of apoptosis and proliferation were observed in the stroma, in which high collagenase-1 scores coincided with a decreased amount of collagen in the deep part of the endometrium and a massive increase of glandular cells during early metestrus. No cyclic differences were noticed for the expression of TIMP-1, the collagenase-1 inhibitor. Finally, no or only low correlations were found between apoptosis, cell proliferation and MMP-1 expression in the canine endometrium, and the serum levels of estradiol-17? and progesterone. In conclusion, these findings indicate that there is no desquamation of the canine endometrial surface epithelium at the end of the estrous cycle, but a regular turnover of cells throughout the estrous cycle. Furthermore, our data also suggest a role for MMP-1 in cellular proliferation. This study was supported by the BOF (#011B4101) of Ghent University.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of pig is a good and available (slaughterhouse material) model to study the enteric nervous system in relation to nutrition, inflammation, development and disease in general. In order to investigate the responses of the enteric nervous network to a variety of stimuli, e.g. growth factors, hormones, extracellular matrix components, but also noxious compounds in a controlled manner, an in vitro experimental set-up is most appropriate. Methods to obtain in vitro cultures of enteric neurons of rodents, chicken and human are well described. This study attempted to use these methods on pig material. The muscle layer containing the myenteric plexus was dissected from pieces of fetal, neonatal and adult pig jejunum. They were rinsed in Hanks basal salt solution (BSS) in which antibiotics were added. Pieces of ±25?mm2 were transferred to BSS with 1?mg/ml collagenase and 1?mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and incubated for 60?min (5% CO2, 90% RH). Subsequently, they were vortexed for 20?s and ganglia were selected. The procedure was repeated ±4 times. Myenteric ganglia could then be plated or further dissociated in 1?mg/ml trypsin in BSS for 30?min in the incubator. Afterwards, the dissociated ganglia were centrifuged (5?min 1500?rpm) and the trypsin-solution was replaced with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM). The explants or dissociated myenteric ganglia were transferred on non-coated or coated (poly-L-lysine, laminin, fibronectin, collagen or extracellular matrix gel) cover slips. After incubating for 45?min they were topped with 1?ml of DMEM with antibiotics and with or without fetal calf serum (5%). Medium was replaced twice a week. Using immunohistochemistry, both neurons (PGP9.5) and glial cells (S100) could be identified in both culture types. When cultivated under harsh conditions, the dissociated cultures gave rise to neurosphere-like bodies, containing neurons and glial cells. Thus, the digestion and dissociation technique is applicable to pig material.

AB  - While the macroscopic anatomy of the urinary bladder and the kidneys is well known, the ultrasound anatomy of these organs still remains difficult for physicians. The objective was to develop a multimedia computer-based program that helps to reduce the time necessary for learning ultrasonography in dogs and cats. Therefore, the program contains many ultrasound films and images, which are clearly marked. Additionally, colourful diagrams explain the ultrasound examination. Although the urinary bladder is comparatively easy to scan the surrounding structures are often confusing. Many of these structures such as the neighbouring fat are not especially mentioned in macroscopic anatomy. The program clearly demonstrates the advantages of the ultrasound method. For example, the physiological urinary jet into the urinary bladder is compared to urinary jet after application of a diuretic agent (furosemide). The ultrasound anatomy of the kidneys and the related structures are described in detail and illustrated by anatomic preparations and sketches. The comprehensive visual and audio representation of the Doppler ultrasonography of renal vessels is intended as an advanced training for already experienced physicians. The structure of the program is designed with regard to didactic and ergonomic aspects. The user can go through the program step by step or move freely using a navigation bar, visual links (viewer) or one of the various links. Nevertheless, all pages are clearly marked to keep track. The structure of the program is similar in all sections, starting with the anatomical topography and the patient preparation. After a detailed description of the scanning procedure the resulting ultrasound images are demonstrated. The last part includes different techniques of Doppler ultrasonography. The self-explaining multimedia structure of the computer-based program enables an autodidactic training of the ultrasound b-mode and the Doppler ultrasonography of the urinary tract and the kidneys for physicians with little experience as well as for advanced investigators.

AB  - Low back pain is a common ailment in dogs, particularly in specific breeds as for instance the German shepherd dog. A number of structures such as facet joint capsules, ligaments, dorsal root ganglia, periosteum, vertebral endplate, and meninges have been associated with this condition. However, in a substantial proportion of all cases, the origin of pain remains obscure. A further structure often being involved in vertebral column disorders is the intervertebral disc. However, the presence of nerves is a precondition for pain sensation and, consequently, structures lacking sensory innervation can be left out of consideration as a cause for low back pain. Nerve fibres have been demonstrated at the periphery of intervertebral discs in man, rabbit and rat. With regard to the dog, however, extent of intervertebral disc innervation still is disputed. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to assess previous findings based on silver impregnation. Protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 was used as a marker for immunohistochemical examination of serial transversal and sagittal paraffin sections of lumbar discs from adult dogs. This technique revealed nerve fibres to be confined to the periphery of the intervertebral discs. Thus, even limited pathological processes affecting the outer layers of the intervertebral disc are prone to cause low back pain.

AB  - Retrograde neuronal tracing and double labelling immunohistochemistry methods were used to study the co-existence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) with vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), neuronal nitric oxyde synthase (nNOS), calcitonine gene related peptide (CGRP), leucine-enkephaline (LENK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the peripheral paravertebral neurons projecting to the smooth vasal musculature of the swine cremaster muscle (CM). The fluorescent tracer Fast Blue (FB) was injected into the left CM of 4 50?Kg non-emasculated pigs. After 7-day survival time, the ipsilateral paravertebral L4 (PaGL4) ganglion, the most positive among the autonomic ganglia, was collected. 12??m-thick cryostat sections were observed under a fluorescent microscope. In the PaGL4, there were 575.5?±?152.93 FB+ neurons. On 206?±?51.07 FB+ cells tested for TH/ VAChT, 24.52%?±?5.6% were TH+/VAChT+, 33.65%?±?7.33% TH+/VAChT-, 7.46%?±?2.77% TH-/VAChT+, 34.38?±?2.66% TH-/VAChT-. 211.5?±?47 FB+ neurons were tested for TH/nNOS: 24.72%?±?5.43% were TH+/nNOS+; 29.35%?±?7.71% were TH+/nNOS-; 7.23%?±?3.22% were TH-/nNOS+; 38.7%?±?2.88% were TH-/nNOS-. On 213.25?±?71.82 positive neurons tested for TH/CGRP, 29.4%?±?4.36% were TH+/CGRP+, 29.09%?±?7.61% TH+/CGRP-, 11.45%?±?4.43% TH-/CGRP+, 30.06%?±?3.7% TH-/CGRP-. On 248.5?±?73.82 FB+ neurons tested for TH/LENK, 37%?±?4.25% were TH+/LENK+, 40.52%?±?5.96% TH+/LENK-, 3.54%± 1.37% TH-/LENK+, 18.94%?±?2.09% TH-/LENK-. 210?±?53.22 FB+ cells were tested for TH/NPY: 50.72?±?2.8% were TH+/NPY+; 15.38%?±?2.55% TH+/NPY-; 11.12%±4.32 TH-/NPY+; 22.79?±?2.78% TH-/NPY-. 218.75?±?65.02 of positive cells were tested for TH/SP: 26.76?±?4.73 were TH+/SP+; 36.82%?±?7.58 TH+/SP-; 3.78%?±?2.43% TH-/SP+; 32.64?±?3.75% TH-/SP-. On 202.5?±?47.65 FB+ neurons tested for TH/VIP, 30.95%?±?8.2% were TH+/VIP+, 29.51%?±?3.87 TH+/VIP-, 8.38%± 2.33% TH-/VIP+, 31.16%± 6.04% TH-/VIP-. The obtained results allow us to document that the neurochemical content of the paravertebral neurons projecting to the CM differ considerably. The contemporaneous presence of adrenergic, peptidergic, nitrergic, and cholinergic neurons shows the complex role that these autonomic ganglia have in the control of smooth vasal musculature.

AB  - This work was carried out on the scleral shelf of the eyeball of the donkey, cow, buffalo, camel, sheep, goat, pig and dog. The results of this work shows that the length of the shelf varies in different regions in all studied animals. The dorsal shelf is the longest followed by ventral one, the lateral shelf is the smallest followed by the medial one. The camel has the longest dorsal and ventral shelf followed by donkey, while the buffalo and cow have the smallest ones among the large animals. Among the studied small animals, the dog has the smallest dorsal and ventral shelf followed by pig. However, the small ruminants have the longest ones. On the other hand, the medial and lateral shelves are longest in donkey and smallest in camel. The dog and the small ruminants have the longest medial and lateral shelf of the studied small animals. The camel has the highest value of dorsal and ventral shelf and lowest value in the medial and lateral ones. Therefore the outline of the outer surface of the cornea is highly oval, the reverse results were observed in donkey; in which the cornea has highest degree of circularity followed by cow and buffalo.

AB  - Developmental anatomy is integrated with gross anatomy. It consists of 12 lectures and is divided into body systems. The development of each system is correlated to its adult structures and species differences. The urinary and genital systems are developmentally and anatomically associated and originate together from the intermediate mesoderm. The urethra forms from the distal part of the urogenital sinus. Starting with the gonadogenesis, and continuing with the duct systems and external genitalia, the lectures are focused on the male and then on the female structures. At the end, the anomalies of the genital organs are exposed in detail, with suggestions for students, specialists and breeders to prevent and treat teratological conditions. The gonadogenesis is first presented in the indifferent stage. The differential stage is explained for the testis and then for the ovary. The genital duct system is exposed in the indifferent stage. The differential stage for the male includes the formation of the efferent ductules, the epididymal duct and the ductus deferens, while in the female, the focus is on the formation of the uterine tubes, uterus (including the horns, the body and the cervix), and the vagina. The indifferent stage of external genitalia is a complex stage, which originates from the mesodermal swellings adjacent to the cloacal membrane. In the male, the differential stage includes the formation of penis and penile urethra. In the female the genital tubercle forms the clitoris, the urethral folds form the labia, while the genital swellings degenerate. The hermaphroditism, gonadal dysplasia, the cryptorchidism, the persistent vestigial structures, and the penischisis (hypospadias and epispadias) as anomalies of the genital system conclude the lecture.

AB  - The ringed seal (Phoca hispida), as well as other seals, exhibit some unique anatomical properties when compared to their terrestrial counterparts. In the ringed seal, the most conspicuous adaptation is the aortic bulb, a large dilatation of the ascending aorta, which is comparable to that found in other seal species and marine mammals. Coronary arteries are similar to those of terrestrial mammals. The branches of the ascending aorta (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery) are similar to those of higher primates and man. The pulmonary trunk originates from the right ventricle near the ventral midline of the thorax. The peculiarities of the venous system are three pulmonary veins, a pericardial venous plexus, a caval sphincter, a hepatic sinus with paired caudal vena cavae and a large extradural venous system. Generally, three pulmonary veins (right, left, middle) empty into the left atrium. The right and left pulmonary veins drain the cranial and middle lung lobes of their respective lung, while the middle pulmonary vein drains both caudal lung lobes and the accessory lobe. The pericardial venous plexus lies on the pericardial pleura on the auricular (ventral) surface the heart. The azygous vein is formed from the union of right and left azygous veins near the 5th thoracic vertebra. The caval sphincter surrounds the caudal vena cava as it passes through the diaphragm. Caudal to the diaphragm, the vena cava is dilated excessively (the hepatic sinus) and near the kidneys it is biphid. Cardiovascular physiological studies have shown some of these anatomical variations, especially of the venous system and the ascending aorta, to be modifications for diving.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a co-culture of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts in different types of perfusion chambers under defined conditions. The perfusion chamber PCS3c (Oligene, Berlin) was used to culture dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes separated by a Millicell? Insert (Millipore, Schwalbach). In addition novel perfusion chambers developed by Dirk Hoffmann were used in combination with S & S membrane filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel). First, fibroblasts were seeded onto one side of the insert/membrane and allowed to grow for 4 days. Subsequently keratinocytes were seeded onto the other side and allowed to adhere for one day. Then the chambers were connected to the tubing system with an attached 8-channel pump and a gas permeable media bag. We worked with different media and flow rates ranging from 0.035?ml/min to 0.35?ml/min. The system was run for up to 20?days. After a few days in culture the cells had grown to confluence. Then keratinocytes began to differentiate and built up stratified colonies. Within these colonies the cells showed the characteristic morphology of a stratified squamous epithelium. The use of perfusion chambers allows three-dimensional cultures to grow and survive for weeks, because of an unlimited medium supply and gas exchange. Additional, perfusion chamber systems enable the co-cultivation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes separated by membranes, which permit the exchange of molecules like growth factors. Furthermore, it is possible to perfuse the two different parts of the perfusion chamber with various and even different types of media. This provides the opportunity to add a growth factor to the medium for only one cell type and to study the effect of this factor to the other cell type.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a crucial process in physiological and pathological growth. Pathological angiogenesis is responsible for growth and metastasis of solid tumours, and, when blocked, improves prognosis. As a result of the angiogenic cascade in solid tumours an irregular, leaky capillary network develops. The aim of the present study was to define malignant tumours? vascular characteristics and reveal functional anatomy by quantification of the microvasculature and interstitial pressure (IP) in relation to tumour fluid dynamics as visualized by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods:? Dynamic MRI and measurement of the IP was performed in 21 rats implanted with colon carcinomas subcutaneously. Angiogenesis was studied by morphometry of the capillaries, and immunolocalization of the angiogenic factor VEGF and VEGF-Receptor 2. Results and Conclusions:? Histology, immunohistochemistry and MRI confirmed concentric arrangement of 4 tumour zones. The tumour margin included loose connective tissue with abundant mononuclear cells. Many large microvessels were seen in this most intensely vascularized zone. IP measurement in this zone was adjusted to the zero level. Diameter of the peripheral zone of vital cells measured 1.3?mm. Capillaries were smaller and sparse. Dynamic MRI revealed peripheral washout of the contrast agent in this zone. After an initial increase of the signal intensity a hypo-intense rim was formed within a few minutes. The intermediate region was characterized by islands of vital tumour cells containing 3% capillaries (hot spots). The innermost area, the necrotic zone, took 35% of the total tumour area with less than 0.5% vessels. The IP increased from the periphery to the centre. VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2 was found in the vessels of the tumour margin and vital tumour cells of the peripheral zone. From this can be concluded that the peripheral washout phenomenon seems to be correlated with elevated interstitial pressure and increased capillary density and therefore may be a reliable sign of malignancy.

AB  - In Korea, there are 10 veterinary schools and about 500 new veterinarians are produced annually. Veterinary education is 6-year-system composed of pre-veterinary (2?yrs) and veterinary course (4?yrs). Total of 28 to 33 subjects are taught in professional curriculum, including 21 of 23 subjects recommended by the World Veterinary Association (WVA) as minimum requirements for veterinary education. Only economics and botany are excluded. Currently, 6648 veterinarians are active in the profession in Korea; about 31% of these in clinical practice and 69% in non-clinical areas. Korea has 3.5?million pets, 10.4?million livestocks, 105?million chickens, and 0.5?million other animals. In general, 630?livestock units (LU) are covered by each veterinarian. With improvement of economic status and life style change, the number and variety of species of companion animals are expanding, accordingly. Also the importance of molecular biology is recognized and included in the professional curriculum. In these changing times, it is believed that gross anatomy, histology and embryology are essential integral component of found in veterinary education. But the teaching hours of histology, embryology and gross anatomy have reduced 15% during last 5?years due to new subjects. Total teaching hours in professional curriculum is about 4100?hours (pre-clinical 29%, paraclinical 32%, clinical course 38%). Average 200?hours are allocated for gross anatomy, histology and embryology lecture and average 250?hours for laboratory practice. The number of students per class ranges 40?80 depending on schools. The ratio of male and female students is 6?4, and the teaching faculty and students 1?22. The Korean Association of Veterinary Anatomists (KAVA) recommend one cow, five dogs, two pigs, five goats and 20 chickens per 20 students to be used for the dissection. The students are evaluated using various types of exam such as assignments, written and oral tests. Recently some schools are beginning to adopt block lectures and/or PBL.

AB  - Introduction:? Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a neuropeptide involved in the control of body weight. Morphological and pharmacological studies have shown that AGRP is implicated in the central control of feeding behaviour acting as an endogenous antagonist of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a potent satiety-inducing factor, at the melanocortin 3 (MC3)- and four (MC4)-receptors. Aim:? The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of AGRP and its mRNA in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck and, in particular, to establish which type of adrenal tissue is involved in the AGRP synthesis. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, reverse transcriptase (RT)-polimerase chain reaction (PCR). Results and Discussion:? AGRP-immunoreactivity was observed in neurons and nerve fibres in a restricted area of the hypothalamus. AGRP-ir neurons were located in the nucleus infundibularis and distributed ventromedially to the third ventricle in the hypothalamic tuberal region. These neurons were round or, with a lesser extent, elongated in shape. AGRP-ir fibres were seen to project to the median eminence (ME) and anterior periventricular hypothalamus. The AGRP ir-fibres in the ME were distributed in the external layer in close vicinity to the capillaries of the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal system. In the avian adrenal gland, AGRP immunoreactivity was observed in the medullary tissue. A partial sequence of AGRP cDNA was identified using RT-PCR cloning and sequencing. This sequence was highly homologous to the corresponding fragment of the chicken AGRP gene. The western blotting analysis of adrenal gland and hypothalamus tissue extracts showed a well-defined single band with an electrophoretic mobility consistent with the molecular weight of the avian AGRP protein. These results demonstrate that AGRP is expressed in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands of the duck and suggest an involvement of this peptide in the regulation of the melanocortin system in birds.

AB  - Reticular or net-like perineuronal coatings enriched with proteoglycans (PGs) and/or glycoproteins (GPs) were demonstrated to ensheathe cell surfaces of certain neuronal circuits in the central nervous system of mammals, reptiles and fishes. In this investigation the coated or ensheathed neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of adult albino rats were quantified using a computerised analysing system. They were distributed throughout the II?IV cortical layers and comprised about 24.25% of total neurons. The perineuronal coatings were expressed with a cationic iron colloid (CIC), CIC/Bodian staining and with certain plant lectins from Vicia villosa agglutinin ?VVA?, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin ?WFA? and Glycine max agglutinin ?SBA?. The mean number of coated neurons per unit area (UA, 60.15??m2), as labelled by CIC or CIC/Bodian, VVA, WFA and SBA staining was 4.01?±?0.42, 4.43?±?0.37, 6.45?±?0.87, 5.70?±?0.73 and 3.91?±?0.53, respectively. In addition, labelling indicated by the aforementioned stains were 10.55%, 11.55%, 16.97%, 15.00% and 10.23%. Notably, the labelled retrosplenial neurons underwent a non-significant increase with progression of animal age at the first post-natal year. However, they declined thereafter toward senility. Qualitatively, there were three types of coated neuronal circuits at the RSC of rats: PGs-, GPs- and PGs/GPs- coated cells, which comprised 9%, 64% and 27%, respectively. This data indicated that the GPs- and GPs/PGs- coated neurons in the RSC of albino rats were more prevalent than the PGs- coated ones.

AB  - Introduction:? Epidermal?dermal interactions play an important role in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and also in disease and regeneration of skin. A double paracrine regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation has been postulated and described in vitro recently. Interleukin-1 (Il-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF/FGF-7) and their receptors are major mediators in this epidermal-dermal signalling. Aim:? We wanted to generate evidence for a reciprocal regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation in the bovine claw involving Il-1 and KGF. Methods:? Tissue samples from claws of slaughtered cows, co-cultures and three-dimensional cultures of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used. Immunohistochemistry for Il-1 and Il-1 receptor, KGF and KGF receptor were carried out on frozen and paraffin sections from tissue and cell culture. RT-PCR was used to study regulation at the mRNA level in dermis and epidermis (after micro separation) and in fibroblasts and keratinocytes from the cultures respectively. Results:? In claw epidermis Il-1 was accumulated and KGF receptor was detectable. Interleukin-1 receptor and KGF were present in dermal cells. Il-1 stimulated fibroblasts responded with KGF expression in vitro. Neutralization of Il-1 reduced or stopped this effect. Keratinocytes co-cultured with fibroblasts showed a significant better growth. Presence of keratinocytes increased KGF expression in the co-cultured fibroblasts. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that Il-1 is leading to stimulation of KGF expression. KGF seems to be an important stimulator of keratinocyte proliferation in our co-culture system. So far our results provide initial evidence for a reciprocal regulatory mechanism present in the bovine claw involving Il- 1 produced in the epidermis and KGF originating from fibroblasts. Future in vitro studies including mRNA analysis will provide deeper insight into the epidermal-dermal cross-talk and the involved transcriptional/translational regulation in the bovine claw.

AB  - Introduction:? Today, the claims on the anatomical education have changed with the considerable increase of modern medical imaging. For the analysis of computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance (MR) images or ultrasound, the knowledge of cross sectional anatomy is an important prerequisite for proper diagnosis. Admittedly, it is difficult for students and also for practitioners to imagine three-dimensional objects in space. The possibilities and convenience of 3D-reconstructions were demonstrated by generating virtual casts of frontal sinuses. Methods:? Using a HiSpeed (DX/i Plus, General Electric) scanner transversal CT images of Persian and European Shorthair cats were acquired. The slice thickness and distance were set to 1?mm. With the software system VG Studio MAX 1.1, the obtained volumetric data was used to create volume graphics displaying object surfaces and interiors based on voxel data. Because of density value acquisition, it was possible to identify and label the objects of interest. The extension of the paranasal sinuses was analyzed and demonstrated in relation to the skull. For verification, conventional corrosion casting employing Technovit or Tensolcement, respectively, were carried out on the same specimens. Results:? The frontal sinuses of both feline breeds showed great variations in size, shape and symmetry. With models from the skull based on 3D-datasets including the virtual casts of the paranasal sinuses, it was easy to imagine spatial relations and localizations inside the head. The advantages of the virtually derived casting method are: creating the virtual casts in vivo; the method does not imply any health risks and is repeatedly applicable. Conclusion:? 3D-reconstructions based on CT-datasets are excellently suited for generating spatial sense. Additionally, a single scan series can be applied for different anatomical problems. The resulting digital 3D-objects are readily available and can be employed for educational purposes for better comprehension of the difficult spatial relations of the head.

AB  - Aims:? The even-hoofed, unguligrade tylopods display a well-developed eponymous footpad that absorbs most of the body weight in locomotion and is particularly adapted to the sandy ground surface of the natural environment of dromedaries. Considering the drastic changes in temperature occurring in the desert sand, specialised thermoregulatory vascular and nervous structures are to be expected in the modified pododerma of this footpad. Therefore, the aim of the study was to demonstrate the angioarchitecture of the camelid footpad and to detect specialised vascular structures related to these specific functions. Material and Methods:? Corrosion casting of fore and hind feet of dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius); scanning electron microscopy of micro-corrosion casts Results and Discussion:? The dense angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad, like that of unmodified skin, can be subdivided into separate plexus arranged at different levels: a subcutaneous plexus, a profound dermal plexus, a superficial dermal plexus and a subepidermal plexus. The subepidermal blood vessels run very close to the dermo-epidermal borderline and thus the subepidermal angioarchitecture consists of densely vascularised conical papillae comprised of centrally situated papillary arteriole and venule ensheathed in a dense subepidermal capillary network. At the tip of the papillae, the central papillary arteriole and venule form a peripheral capillary loop, acting as a thoroughfare channel. This dermal angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad is comparable to the papillary system described in the bulbs of the highly specialised digital end organs of many other odd- and even-hoofed mammals, particularly the equine hoof and the bovine claw. Within the subcutaneous and the deep dermal plexus of the dromedary foot pad, unique glomus-like vascular structures were detectable, presumably associated with cutaneous thermoregulation as described for the unmodified hairy skin.

AB  - The oral cavity in vertebrates plays a very important role in food intake mechanics and also contains chemical sensors for food and environmental water. Comparative studies revealed morphological and functional inter-specific differences that can be correlated to evolutionary events and might represent the adaptation to environmental conditions present in different habitats (Iwasaki, 2002). Particularly these events are strictly dependent on the food intake mechanisms determining the success of the adaptation of vertebrates to their environment and therefore their survival (Roth and Wake, 1989). Since data about the morphology of the zebrafish oral cavity are scarce the aim of the present research was to study it by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for some growth factor receptors, i.e. trkA and trkB. The zebrafish was chosen because as a vertebrate it has valuable features as a model for study of vertebrate development (Withfield, 2002). Adult zebrafishes were anesthesized with MS222 and the samples were taken and routinely processed for light and electron microscopy and for indirect peroxidase immunohistochemistry. The topographical and ultrastructural study demonstrated the presence of three different zones. The outer zone is characterized orally by the presence of a papilla and by an epithelium with numerous taste buds that are chemosensory endorgans consisting of modified epithelial cells. Their function is to sample potential food and selecting it according to its edibility (Hansen et al., 2002). Both in upper and lower intermediate zones, the presence of internal valves with a semi-lunar shape was evident, probably able to regulate the mouth closure. The most internal lower zone corresponds to the tongue that in zebrafish is only a thickening of the pavement mucosa with a stratified epithelium. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated both in upper and lower zones the presence of numerous taste buds that were immunoreactive to TrkA and TrkB-like neurotrophin receptors, confirming the role of these receptors in taste buds sensory cells (Germanà et al., 2004). The present results give a contribution to the morphological knowledge of the zebrafish oral cavity, an animal model commonly used for developmental studies of vertebrates.
