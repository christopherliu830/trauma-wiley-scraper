AB  - The anatomical and clinical studies of computed tomography (CT) in the dog are still scarce. Particularly, there are few CT studies combining the use of rapid apparatus of the latest generation, the supply of contrast medium (digestive or intravenous) and the application of regional specific CT windows with different window width (WW) and window level (WL). The use of this CT methodology is particularly recommended in the evaluation of mediastinal masses, heart pathologies, etc. In this work the mediastinum of the dog was studied by using a sixth generation spiral CT scanner (Toshiba Ex Vision), belonging to the private Medical Institute of Radiology ?Irion? of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Four mixed-breed mature dogs (4?6?years, 15?20?kg) were used, two males and two females. The dogs were anaesthetized and kept at a maximum inspiration when getting the images. Previously, the urografin? contrast had been injected by peroral and intravenous (cephalic vein) via. Dogs were placed in a stretcher in sternal recumbency. Different CT windows were applied in order to increase the quality of the images and to obtain detailed attenuation shades of the mediastinum organs: soft tissue window (WW 652; WL -34), pulmonary window (WW 928; WL -680) and mediastinal-vascular window (WW 352; WL 220). The mediastinal space was studied craniocaudally from the level of the cranial cava vein, brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery, to the caudal end of the lumbodiaphragmatic recess. The obtained images allowed a very good tomographic evidence of the great vessels, the heart, the thoracic portion of the trachea, the principal bronchi, the thoracic portion of the oesophagus, etc.

AB  - The location, size and histological structure of the ovine paraepiglottic tonsils were determined in 20 sheep. Macroscopic examination of the pharyngeal tonsils was performed in 10 sheep of 9 months of age, of which the heads were fixed in acetic acid 2% for 24?h, and in non-fixed heads of five sheep aged between 6 and 9?months. The paraepiglottic tonsil is located lateral to the epiglottis in the ventromedial segment of the pharyngeal sidewall, i. e. at the floor of the piriform recess. The tonsil appears as a cluster of small nodular elevations, which are white after fixation in acetic acid and are called hereafter tonsillar nodules. The number of these nodules per tonsil ranged from 1 through 8. The length of the tonsil varied from 5 till 14?mm, and the width ranged from 2 till 5?mm. The tonsils of 5 sheep aged between 6 and 9?months and of five sheep aged between 9 and 12?months were excised and fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde. The blocks were processed routinely for histology and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (8??m thick) were stained with eosin and haematoxylin. Histology revealed that each tonsillar nodule consisted of several lymphoid follicles (noduli lymphatici) surrounded by parafollicular tissue. Most lymphoid follicles were secondary follicles consisting of a germinal centre, a dark zone and a mantle zone. Primary follicles devoid of germinal centres were most obvious at the periphery of the tonsillar nodules. The stratified squamous pharyngeal epithelium covering the lymphoid tissue was frequently infiltrated by numerous lymphocytes, forming a follicle-associated epithelium. Crypts were absent, but in some cases the pharyngeal epithelium was slightly infolded into the lymphoid tissue. The tonsillar nodules were almost completely encapsulated by dense connective tissue from which septa extended into the larger nodules. Acknowledgement:?

AB  - In contrast to human medicine, the significance of appropriate post-operative care in companion animals is often neglected or even unknown. Physiotherapeutic exercises, also called physical therapies, are the golden standard of rehabilitation in human orthopaedics. In dogs and cats, such supportive therapies following surgery are rarely performed. Presently, physical therapeutic exercises, which are well established in man, are transferred to companion animals. However, there is no generally accepted scheme of procedures adequate to cats and dogs. Furthermore there is no study dealing with the exact effects of the various exercises performed with these species. Due to this paucity of information, the effect of several physical exercises concerning the lumbar spinal nerve roots transferred from man to the dog were assessed macroscopically. In ten euthanized healthy beagles up to eight years of age, the lumbar spine was surgically separated from adhering dorsal muscles. The lumbar nerve roots were visualized by removing the connective tissues surrounding the foramen intervertebrale. Nerve roots, i.e. spinal ganglia, were marked immediately outside the vertebral column applying a dot of yellow paint while the cadaver was in lateral recumbency. In man, for maximal sciatic nerve root movement the straight leg raising (SLR) (Maitland, 1986) exercise is applied on the patient lying on the back. For nervus femoralis movement the passive knee bending exercise is performed. In the dog, however, performing only the transferred SLR has a poor effect on L7. It can greatly be enhanced by a supplemental inward rotation of the hip joint by fixing the stifle joint and moving the lower leg medially. Concerning L4-L6 nerve roots, the hip joint is maximally extended and the effect can be improved by an outward rotation of the leg. The results of the present study indicate that the simple transfer of physical exercises from man to companion animals does not result in identical results in the latter species. Modifications considering different anatomical conditions should be kept in mind if clinical results are poor. Reference?

AB  - Some male seasonal breeders are known to undergo testicular growth and regression throughout the year. The periodic and fast physiological development and regression processes, with simultaneous fast changes in blood flow, appears to be stimulated by angiogenic substances and inhibited by anti-angiogenic factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of season on microvascularization and production of angiogenic factors by testicular tissue, using the male cat as a model. Monthly, testes were collected post mortem from domestic stray cats, for histology and for tissue culture. Testis explants were cultured for 18h and conditioned media were tested for their ability to stimulate mitogenesis of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used as a positive control. Proliferative response of BAEC to samples was evaluated by determining the number of cells in each well using a Neubauer chamber. Vascular density was assessed by a computerized image analysis (?Scion Image, NIH, USA?) based on the total histological area occupied by the vascular lumen. Percentage data subjected to arcsine transformation were analysed by one-way ANOVA and post-comparison tests. There was a significant increase in microvascular areas in November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the remaining months (LSD test). All cat testicular tissue showed the capability to increase BAEC proliferation, when compared to negative controls, throughout the study. However, there was an increase in BAEC mitogenesis in February (P?<?0.05) and November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the other months. Our data show that cat testicular tissue from different periods of the year stimulates angiogenic factor(s). Furthermore, changes in angiogenesis may play a role on vascular growth and regression of the testes during the breeding and non-breeding season in the male cat.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNs) of condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to characterize the microenvironment of individual neurons and the chemoarchitecture of some brain regions. In the present study, PNs in the hippocampus were visualized with a cationic iron colloid method for sulphated proteoglycan content and a plant lectin from Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) for N-acetylgalactosamine containing glycoconjugates. The ECM molecules were organized in reticular coats (PNs) around non-pyramidal cells in the Ammons horn (Corneu Ammons, CA) and subicular region, in addition to pyramidal neurons located in CA2 and CA3 regions. CA2 stratum pyramidale exhibited the most intense staining of its PNs and a diffuse intervening neutrophil labelling, while CA3 region showed a graded fashion of staining intensity. The subiculum displayed intensely stained perineuronal coats. Notably, the hippocampal perineuronal nets revealed overlapped staining characteristics with both staining methods. However, cell coats of the subicular neurons showed various degrees of labelling characteristics with both markers. It is suggested that the PNs in the hippocampus are correlated with the fast spiking inhibitory GABAergic neurons and their target pyramidal cells, and this is important to keep the excitatory elements under control and therefore control the information processes within the hippocampus.

AB  - In this study the vascularization of the wing and the two main breast muscles of pigeons was investigated using classical anatomical techniques. Three groups of 9-month-old pigeons cadavers were dissected. Each group contained six animals. The cadavers of the group no. 1 were first fixed using 4% formaldehyde solution and the arteries filled with coloured latex. After coagulation we dissected the pectoral (pectoral and supracoracoid) muscles and the supplying branches of the pectoral trunk. We followed also the subclavian, the axillary, the brachial, the radial and ulnar arteries as they vascularized the wing. The cadavers of group no. 2 were used as fresh cadavers and perfused via the brachial artery in retrograde direction with methyl?methacrylate. After the polymerization, the bodies were placed in concentrated hydrochloric acid so the microvascularization of the great breast muscles and the arteries of the wings could be investigated. The arteries of the group no. 3 were filled with BaSO4 solution after fixed with formalin and radiographed. Using this method we could represent the relation of the arteries to the bones. The breast muscles that move the wing are mainly vascularized by the pectoral trunk, which is the strongest branch of the subclavian artery and divides into the cranial, middle and the caudal pectoral arteries. Also the sternoclavicular artery is giving strong rami to the supracoracoid muscle by the lateral border of the coracoid. The subcutaneous thoracoabdominal vessels that supply the brood patches are branches of the pectoral trunk too. The brachial artery lies between the biceps and triceps brachii muscles on the medial side of the humerus and ramifies at the level proximal of the elbow joint to the stronger ulnar and weaker radial arteries. The radial lies cranially, covered by the pronator muscles and gives two branches, the deep and superficial radial arteries. The ulnar artery also gives off two: the superficial and deep ulnar arteries, which supply the flexor muscles and vascularize the distal part of the wing.

AB  - Members of the fibroblast growth factor family have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and cell differentiation during embryogenesis and invasive haemochorial placentation. The non-invasive epitheliochorial horse placenta is characterized by the occurrence of specialized areolae between the microcotyledons, where secretions of endometrial glands are imbibed by the pseudostratified trophoblast cells throughout gestation. Therefore, we hypothesize that trophoblast cells may be programmed differently depending on their location and function. The influence of FGF family members during placentation in the mare was evaluated in tissues from five mares at days 110, 121, 179, 199, and 309 of gestation. Placental samples were perfusion-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against FGF1 and FGF2 (which have been shown to influence cells of mesenchymal origin), FGF7 which acts on epithelial cells, and an antibody against FGFR which recognizes various receptor isoforms. FGF1 immunostaining occurred in most cells of the placenta throughout gestation, with the strongest expression in vascular structures. FGF2 protein expression differed in relation to location and stage of gestation. Trophoblast and endometrial epithelial cells in the microcotyledons showed strong nuclear expression, whereas areolar trophoblast, fetal and maternal endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of large allantochorionic blood vessels all showed cytoplasmic localization of FGF2. Near term, on day 309, FGF2 expression ceased in all types of cells. FGF7 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the nuclei of endometrial gland cells and the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells, and to a lesser extent in the endometrial epithelium. FGFR immunoreaction occurred almost exclusively in vascular cells, such as the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels, and staining declined towards term. The nuclear localization of FGF2 and FGF7 suggests the presence of high molecular weight isoforms, which have been shown to be involved in specific autocrine transcription processes, like activation of endometrial glands and differentiation of trophoblast cells. In contrast, the cytoplasmic localization of FGFs indicates the presence of low molecular weight isoforms. These would represent the classic FGFR binding isoforms that may be involved in angiogenesis mediated by auto- and paracrine mechanisms.

AB  - The avian lung shows fundamental differences to its mammalian counterpart and is characterized by a larger surface area and a thinner gas-blood barrier. These features provide the morphological basis for the enhanced respiratory efficiency of the avian lung. However, they also predispose this organ to an increased risk of injury by pathogenic microorganisms. In order to investigate the host?pathogen interaction during pulmonary infection and vaccine delivery by aerosol immunization a detailed knowledge of the structure and ontogenesis of the bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is required. For this reason the BALT of chickens aged from 1?day to 6?months was studied by immunohistochemistry (ICC), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as by FACS analysis. During the first 2?weeks after hatching no organized lymphatic structures were found. At this time, the defence system was based on the presence of cells of the unspecific innate immune system. In the third week after hatching lymphoid follicles begin to develop at the branching of primary and secondary bronchi. These develop into a highly organized bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) characterized by high endothelial venules and a follicle associated epithelium (FAE) with ?M-cell-like? cells. However, pathogens that have successfully crossed this initial barrier are additionally confronted with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages distributed around the parabronchi. Our results imply that the BALT is the first and most important structure encountering antigen and microbial pathogens, thus playing a central role in the initiation of a specific immune response.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a comprehensive summary of the basic criteria that are critical to the histologic diagnosis of melanoma. It focuses on the clinical features of the prototypic subgroups of melanoma such as lentiginous melanoma. After a consideration of the clinical features, the histology of the radial growth phase as it relates to specific subtypes of melanoma is addressed followed by a discussion on the recognition of the vertical growth phase. Five-year survival rates according to measured Breslow thickness are given in the chapter for patients with stage I lesions, where the tumor is confined to the primary site of the melanoma without regional lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease. Unusual forms of melanoma are discussed at the end of the chapter.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains syndromes produced by the transfusion of incompatible blood. It considers haemolytic reactions due to causes other than incompatibility. By convention, red cell destruction is classified as either intravascular, characterized by rupture of red cells within the bloodstream and liberation of haemoglobin (Hb) into the plasma, or as extravascular, characterized by phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages of the mono-nuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with subsequent liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Intravascular destruction may be produced by antibodies such as anti - A and anti - B that are readily lytic in vitro , although not all of the red cells are lysed in the plasma; some are sensitized and removed from the circulation by erythrophagocytosis, mainly in the liver. To ensure that haemolysis has not occurred ex vivo , the supernatant plasma of the unit or units of transfused blood should be inspected for free haemoglobin (Hb).
