AB  - Introduction The aims of this study were to quantify the morphological differences between uneven feet, and to evaluate the biomechanical locomotor consequences compared to horses with even feet, considered as normal. Methods Eight anatomical parameters that quantified conformational differences in the distal forelimbs of horses with a varied range of hoof asymmetries (n?=?36, of which 2 were lame) were compared using discriminant analysis. Forefeet were subjectively scored for unevenness by one clinician. Kinetics and distal limb kinematics of clinically sound horses (n?=?34; the 2 lame horses were excluded) were collected at trot and compared between even (n?=?13) versus uneven (n?=?21) forefeet and between all feet when classified as flat, medium and upright using MANOVA/ANOVA. The relative influence of contralateral differences in hoof angle and of absolute hoof angle on functional parameters was analyzed by multiple regression (P<0.05). Results Unevenness was best determined by the differences in dorsal hoof angle between the forefeet. In uneven footed horses, the flatter foot showed a significantly larger maximal horizontal braking and vertical ground reaction force, a larger vertical fetlock displacement and a suppler limb spring. A steeper hoof angle was linearly correlated with an earlier braking-propulsion transition. No significant differences were found between individual flat, medium or upright feet. Conclusions The conformational differences between the forefeet were more important for loading characteristics than the individual foot conformation. The contralateral differences in vertical force could in fact imply an early, subclinical sign of lameness developing in the steeper forefoot, as these differences were smaller than those reported for subtle, clinically evident lamenesses.

AB  - Introduction We have observed major back-shape changes over time in some horses, the speed of which may be influenced by work-type, skeletal maturity, nutrition and saddle-fit. Currently, there are no longitudinal data quantifying changes in back-shape and no objective data assessing the importance of each variable. The objectives were to: quantify back-shape changes over time; describe the effects of age, breed, weight, work-discipline, saddle-management and pain elicited on palpation. Methods Preliminary data from 98 sport horses in regular work in an on-going one-year longitudinal study. Weight and management changes were recorded. The thoracolumbar shape was measured at T18, T13 and T8 using a Flexible Curve Ruler [1] every two months. Ratios were calculated for each site for the widths 3?cm and 15?cm ventral to the dorsal midline. Differences in back-shape were determined using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Chi-square test was used to assess associations between categorical variables, Spearman rank correlation for continuous variables, Mann-Whitney-U for continuous variables with binary outcomes and Kruskal-Wallis to assess ≥3 groups. Results T8 and T18-ratios were significantly different after two months (P<0.001) and T13 after four months (P?=?0.004). Decreased ratio at T8 was related to ill-fitting saddles (P?=?0.005), saddles tipping back (P?=?0.020), pain on palpation (P?=?0.032) and greater age (P?=?0.004). Increased T18-ratio was associated with weight gain (P<0.001), more prevalent in stallions and geldings than mares (P?=?0.035) and in dressage horses than other disciplines (P?=?0.043). Conclusions Back-shape can change within two months, the speed and direction of which are influenced by saddle-fit, age and bodyweight. Pain elicited on palpation of the back may indicate that changes have occurred. Thus saddle-fit should be reassessed.

AB  - Introduction There are few data on training horses used for show jumping (SJ) in practice. This study presents such data and relates it to changes of VLa4 during an outdoors season (VLa4?=?speed at which a blood lactate concentration of 4?mmol/l is achieved). Methods The training of 19 SJ (11 managed by professional trainer, PSJ, and 8 by amateur riders, ASJ) was documented and related to changes of VLa4. All horses were submitted to 3 standardized exercise tests (SET) to calculate VLa4: April/May, June/July, September: SET1, SET2, SET3. Noted daily were: Minutes of turn-out on pasture, of walking in horse-walker, of lungeing and of specific exercise (gymnastics, jumping and others). Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA (Fisher's test as applicable) or linear regression. Results The duration of the specific exercises ranged between 30?60 minutes. PSJ were exercised less often and duration of each specific exercise was lower than for ASJ (P?=?0.01). Considering all horses, the VLa4 increased between SET1 and SET2 when the duration of exercise and gymnastics was longer and the number of days on pasture higher (P<0.05 both). These relationships became not significant when groups were analysed separately. The VLa4 of ASJ increased between SET2 and SET3 when horses were kept on pasture for more time (P<0.05, r2?=?0.64). The VLa4 of PSJ tended to increase with a higher percentage of jumping days between SET1 and SET2 (P?=?0.08, r2?=?0.30), and with longer duration of jumping exercise sessions between SET2 and SET3 (P?=?0.06; r2?=?0.33). Conclusions The information may help to improve the training of show jumpers. Ethical Animal Research Horse owners gave consent for these procedures within a veterinary monitoring system.

AB  - Introduction There is relatively little information concerning physiological factors affecting show-jumping performance. This study examined the relationship between show-jumping exercise, muscle soreness, serum muscle enzyme activity and blood lactate concentration. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15 fence course (1.35?1.45?m) once on day one and twice on day two; on day three the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Veterinary and physiotherapy assessments of muscle soreness were performed daily before and after exercise. An international coach graded jumping technique. Blood was obtained before and on two occasions after jumping (1 minute, two hours) for measurement of serum CK and AST, and blood lactate concentration. Data were analysed using regression procedures or Spearman correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05). Results Blood lactate significantly increased one minute after jumping on all three days (P?=?0.003 for all). When two rounds were jumped, lactate was significantly lower after the second round compared to the first (P?=?0.006, P?=?0.014). There was a positive correlation between blood lactate one minute after jumping and number of faults scored daily and overall (R2?=?0.61; P<0.01), decreased jumping technique grade (R2?=?0.69; P<0.01) and increased gluteal muscle soreness on day two (r?=?0.75; P?=?0.012). Plasma CK activity one minute, and 2 hours after jumping was significantly higher than before jumping on all days (P<0.01). Conclusions Horses with higher blood lactate concentrations after jumping demonstrated decreased jumping performance and were more likely to display muscle soreness.

AB  - Introduction Racehorses suffering from subclinical diseases are frequently kept in training until they fail expectations during competition. The diagnosis of medical causes of poor performance remains challenging in the field. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of subclinical causes of poor performance in working Thoroughbreds (TB) and to determine which clinical field tests could most appropriately identify them. Methods During the course of a training session, a complete clinical screening was performed in 11 healthy controls (C) and 38 poor performing (PP) TB without obvious clinical signs. Exercising ECG and GPS monitoring, blood sample analysis including oxidative stress markers, Doppler echocardiography, respiratory function testing (RFT), post-exercise endoscopy, tracheal wash (TW) and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. Statistics included ANOVA and Spearman's test (P<0.05). Results Subclinical causes of PP included muscular, respiratory and cardiac disorders. Variables derived from velocity and HR showed significant differences between groups. Lower airway diseases (LAD) were the most frequently diagnosed (33/38), causing significant differences in RFT. Endoscopic observations correlated with TW cytology, but unlike BAL analysis, were insufficient to diagnose all LAD cases. Supra- or ventricular premature beats were present only in the PP group but were not associated with echocardiographic abnormalities. Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in PP. Conclusions Velocity, ECG and HR monitoring during a training session can be used as non-specific predictive indicators of performance, help assess functional consequences of diseases and guide ancillary diagnostic investigations. As LAD is highly prevalent, BAL sampling would be indicated in any case of poor performance. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the University of Liege.

AB  - Introduction Elimination of CO2 from skeletal muscle (mCO2) during exercise is important for the regulation of intramuscular [H+] ([mH+]). Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyses the hydration/dehydration reaction of CO2 to facilitate its elimination. We hypothesised that extracellular CA inhibition and subsequent increase in PCO2 will result in increased m[H+] and decreased exercise performance. Methods Six horses were exercised on a treadmill until fatigue without (Con) and with acetazolamide (CA inhibitor) treatment (Acz; 30?mg/kg, 30?min before exercise). Arterial and mixed-venous blood was sampled, and biopsies collected from gluteal muscles at fatigue. Whole blood (wb) arteriovenous difference across the muscle (a-v) of [Na+], [K+], [Cl?], [Lac?], [SID], and PCO2, mCO2 and m[H+] were determined. Paired t-test was used to assess statistical significance (P<0.05). Results Duration of exercise to fatigue was not affected by Acz. Compared to Con, Acz increased mCO2 (Con 16.5(mean) ±?3.6(SE), Acz 20.5?±?2?mmol/L) and mixed-venous and arterial PCO2 but had no effect on VCO2. No difference was observed in m[H+] between Con (118?±?18?nmol/L) and Acz (99?±?16?nmol/L). Acetazolamide did not affect plasma [H+]. Based on the a-v differences Acz increased [Na+]wb and [K+]wb release, increased [Cl-]wb uptake and did not affect [Lac-]wb release by the muscle. Acz decreased a-v[SID]wb (Con 6.2?±?2.8?mmol/L, Acz ?0.3?±?2?mmol/L). Conclusions Although PCO2 and mCO2 were elevated no difference in [mH+] was observed. An increase in m[H+] due to elevated mCO2 was attenuated by strong ion fluxes between intramuscular and vascular spaces. Strong ion exchanges are important in attenuating m[H+] and maintaining exercise performance.

AB  - Introduction Many jurisdictions measure plasma tCO2 to determine if racehorses may have been administered exogenous alkalinizers illegally (?milkshakes?). Our hypothesis was that plasma tCO2 test results vary within a racing jurisdiction due to inter-day instrument variability. Methods Individual or daily mean plasma tCO2 test results from New York (n?=?584) and Maine (n?=?443) Standardbreds and California Thoroughbreds (n?=?23,686) were obtained through legal discovery in adjudicated cases where trainers were accused of tampering with horses resulting in tCO2 concentrations ≥37.0?mmol/L. Daily results were grouped by days on which no horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (LOW) or days on which at least one horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (HIGH). HIGH days were further subsampled by eliminating ?positive? test results ≥37.0?mmol/L (MODIFIED HIGH). With P<0.05 considered significant, differences between groups were compared by Student's t test for means and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test for medians. Results HIGH tCO2 means (32.9?±?2.6, 35.2?±?3.4, 32.6?±?2.7) and medians (32.9, 35.4, 32.6) for all 3 jurisdictions were higher than LOW means (31.7?±?2.3, 31.9?±?4.3, 31.5?±?0.7) and medians (31.8, 32.9, 31.5) (P<0.001). Even when ?positive? tests ≥37.0 were eliminated, MODIFIED HIGH means (32.5?±?2.2, 33.6?±?2.6, 32.4?±?2.5) and medians (32.7, 34.2, 32.5) were still higher than LOW (P<0.001). Conclusions Unless the population tCO2 mean varies significantly daily, it must be concluded that instrument variability resulted in day-to-day differences in plasma tCO2 test results. Without appropriate quality control including correction of individual suspect results to a contemporaneous standard curve, horse trainers may be accused unfairly of tampering when day-to-day instrument variability contributes to positive plasma tCO2 test results.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to determine whether serum anti-oxidant defenses are impaired by endurance exercise and to investigate possible correlation with performance in the race. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 23 Arabian or half-Arabian horses (6 years old) the day before (T0) and 30 minutes after (T1) a 90-km race. Performance records available included speed, heart rate 10 and 30 minutes after arrival and the rating by veterinarians based on recovery and gait (5 categories from ?eliminated? to ?excellent?). Absorbance at 413?nm (A413), at 650?nm (A650) and absorbance of Rose Bengal (RB) were measured in sera at T0 and T1 (a higher absorbance means a lower antioxidant capacity). Relationships between blood variables and between T0 values and race results were evaluated using correlation analysis and means comparisons. Results All horses finished the race with an average speed of 16.3?km/h. Three horses were eliminated for lameness, one was excellent and the others were distributed between the other three categories. After the race, a significant increase of RB, A413, A413-A650, PT and CK (P<0.001) was observed. At T0, RB and CK were significantly correlated (r?=?0.52, P<0.01). At T1, absorbance values were significantly correlated with muscle enzymes and haptoglobin (r?=?0.50?0.67, P<0.05). The speed of the horse was negatively correlated with RB at T0 (r?=??0.42, P<0.05). No significant difference in absorbance values could be detected between the recovery categories. Conclusions A higher resistance to oxidative stress was observed before the race in the best performing horses.

AB  - Introduction Electrolyte supplementation prior to exercise is known to benefit both performance and recovery; however its effects on acid-base status remain not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to use the physicochemical approach to provide a comprehensive time-course of the acid-base alterations that occur following pre-exercise electrolyte supplementation in horses. It was hypothesized that electrolyte supplementation will attenuate the alkalosis occurring with prolonged moderate intensity exercise. Methods In a randomized crossover experiment four conditioned mares were given, via nasogastric tube, 3?L of a commercial electrolyte solution (ES; designed to fully replace sweat electrolyte and fluid losses), or water alone (Control), 1 hour before they exercised on a treadmill at 30% VO2max until voluntary fatigue (inability to keep pace with belt speed). Blood was sampled from jugular venous catheters at frequent intervals before, during, and until 20?h of exercise recovery, and analyzed for all dependent and independent plasma acid-base variables. Differences (P<0.05) over time and between groups were assessed by 1- or 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results Horses exercised for 57.5?±?10.3 and 72.5?±?17.0?min and lost 2.73?±?0.82 and 4.63?±?1.35?L in Control and ES trials, respectively. ES horses had lower pCO2 and total carbon dioxide (TCO2) concentrations during exercise and early recovery. Control horses exhibited decreased [H+]. pCO2 was the primary contributor to changes in [H+] and [TCO2], while there were no differences in strong ion difference ([SID]) or total weak acid concentration ([Atot]). Conclusions Electrolyte supplementation prior to prolonged exercise leads to sustained effects on equine acid-base variables, even in the absence of significant changes in plasma electrolytes or hydration.

AB  - Introduction Exercise causes several physiological changes resulting from autonomic and hemodynamic adaptations, but there are few reports about the behaviour of blood pressure (BP) during physical activity in horses, as well as the effect of training on BP. Methods 9 untrained Arabian horses underwent two treadmill evaluations (before and after 90 days of aerobic training at 60% HRmax) at 6% incline with incremental speed increases every 3 minutes (commencing at 2.5?m/s and reaching 12.5?m/s). The facial artery was cannulated with a 20?G catheter and systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded with a multiparameter monitor (GE Dash 3000 model). Data were evaluated by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Bonferroni multiple comparison (P<0.05). Results During initial evaluation SBP increased in a gradual and uniform manner as speed increased, reaching a maximum of 208?mmHg at a speed of 10?m/s. After training, SBP behaved similarly during treadmill evaluation, however values were lower until 10?m/s (P<0.001), and the maximum value of SBP obtained was 218?mmHg at 12.5?m/s. DPB was not significantly different (P?=?0.124). MAP emulated the behaviour of SBP (P?=?0.012). Conclusions A decrease in SBP and MAP during identical treadmill evaluations before and after 90 days of aerobic exercise (60% HR max) indicated that training decreased cardiac effort required for the maintenance of physical activity.

AB  - Introduction Cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) has been previously validated in horses. Newer high sensitivity troponin assays have recently become available that are now the standard in human cardiology. The objective was to validate the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hscTn-T) assay for use in horses and to determine the biological variation within and between horse breeds. Methods Samples were analysed using the hscTn-T assay reagent (Roche,Cobas c501). Method validation included linearity, lower limit of quantitation (LLQ), freeze-thaw stability, within-and between-run precision, and comparison with cTn-I (Abbott iSTAT, Deming regression). Normal range and biological variation included healthy horses (n?=?120; age?=?7.2?±?0.5 years (SE)) representing 5 breeds. Results Assay was linear from 3?391?ng/L. The LLQ was validated at 3?ng/L. Stability of samples was unaffected by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Within-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?6.50 (±0.97), L2?=?10.1 (±0.88), L3?= 15.3 (±0.82)?ng/L and between-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?12.2 (±1.03), L2?=?57.0 (±4.82), L3?=?256 (±23.1)?ng/L. Comparison with cTn-I assay showed excellent correlation (range: 8?3535?ng/L, r?=?0.9998). Bias was evident in the regression results [hscTnT?=?(0.6153?±?0.002809)*(cTnI*1000)???(11.53?±?5.462)]. The 95th and 99th percentile of the normal distribution in healthy horses was 4 and 6?ng/L. Between breed, diurnal effect and between day variation was not detectable due to low concentrations of hscTnT. Conclusions This study established reference intervals for hscTn-T assay in healthy horses and the performance characteristics of hsTn-T assay in horse samples. Normal population distribution was mostly below the detection limit of the assay. The hscTn-T assay will likely establish the standard in early detection of cardiac pathologies in horses.

AB  - Introduction Increasing cardiac dimension with endurance training is well known in adult athletes. However, adaptation of the heart to training in growing Arabian type horses is less well documented. Methods During the national finals for young endurance horses, standardized echocardiographic examinations were performed before the races by two experienced examiners. In 2011 left ventricle (LV) was assessed in 74 horses aged 4-years (18), 5-years (33) and 6-years (23). In 2012 left atrial (LA) dimensions and the great heart vessels were measured in 122 horses aged 4-years (32), 5-years (40) and 6-years (50). Data were normally distributed; age groups and gender were compared by one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons, significance P<0.05); relationships between echocardiographic dimensions and body weight (BWT) were assessed by linear regressions. Results BWT was highest in 5-year old horses. LV dimensions increased with age, but for most measurements the difference was significant only for the group of 6-year old horses. The stroke volume (SV) increased (P?=?0.0016) and the heart rate decreased (P?=?0.06) with increasing age, leading to a constant cardiac output in all age groups. There was a weak relationship between BWT and SV. Two dimensional LA measurements increased between 4 and 5 years but remained constant between 5 and 6 years. LA area measurements and LA functional indices showed no evolution between the groups. Aortic dimension increased with age but pulmonary artery dimension showed no such increase. No influence of gender on echocardiographic dimensions and function could be found. Conclusions Great heart vessels, LA and LV dimensions showed different growth patterns between 4 and 6 years of age.

AB  - Introduction Field exercise tests (FET) can assist design of individualized training programs. Although FETs have been used in other breeds, there are limited reports for Quarter horses (QH) and cross-bred QH which are widely used in traditional Venezuelan equestrian activities. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of an FET in cross-bred Quarter horses in Venezuela. Methods Six horses (3 stallions and 3 mares) performed a FET consisting of a four-step incremental increase in speed (91?±?10; 136?±?3; 271?±?20; 439?±?43?m/min). Each cycle lasted 3 to 5?min with 3 minutes of rest between each. Environmental temperature was 32°C. Heart rate and speed were recorded (Polar Equine RS800CX?) and the speed to reach a heart rate of 200 and 170 beats/min was calculated by linear regression. The rate of heart rate decline was determined 5 minutes after the last step. Linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics and an unpaired t- test (Graph Pad Prism 5.0) were utilized to identify gender differences (P<0.05). Results Gender did not influence the results. V200 and V170 were slightly higher in stallions (617?±?98 and 465?±?66?m/min, respectively) than in mares (511?±?60 and 387?±?60?m/min, respectively). The rate of heart rate decline was slightly more rapid in mares (25?±?7 beats/min) compared to stallions (13?±?5 beats/min). Conclusions Although a low number of horses were evaluated, these preliminary data suggest that gender has limited influence on fitness of cross-bred Quarter horses used in local Venezuelan equestrian activities under tropical environmental conditions. The mean V200 and V170 values obtained were lower than those reported for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, but similar to those reported in young racing Quarter horses.

AB  - Introduction During racing, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of energy for muscle contraction. Assessment of muscle OXPHOS capacity by high-resolution respirometry (HRR) might identify animals with altered energy metabolism and consequently increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). Methods Prospective cohort study. Ten healthy French Standardbreds in active training, aged 4?7 years, recruited at the start of a competitive racing season, underwent a standardised field exercise test with determination of speed at onset of lactate accumulation (VLa4) and measurement of serum creatine kinase activity (CK) two hours post-exercise. Triceps brachii muscle microbiopsies were obtained for determination of OXPHOS and electron transfer system (ETS) capacities with HRR. Associations between HRR variables and occurrence of ER over the following four months of racing were analysed using univariate logistic regression. Results Two horses developed ER during the study period: one within one month of recruitment, another presented multiple minor episodes over the season. For these ER horses OXPHOS/ETS ratio was lower, and Complex I/Complex I?+?II ratio and Complex I /Complex II ratio were higher than non-affected horses in the study (perfect prediction of occurrence of ER with ratio of ≤0.74, ≥0.60 and ≥0.715 respectively). VLa4 for ER horses was within the range of non-affected horses. Post-exercise CK was within normal limits for all horses in the study. Conclusions OXPHOS and ETS capacities and their derived ratios indicate dysfunctional muscle energy metabolism whereas VLa4 and CK were unremarkable in horses subsequently affected by ER.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a missense, gain-of-function mutation in the equine skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1). Affected horses have excessive glycogen storage, amylopectate-like inclusions in their muscle and higher muscle glycogen synthase activities (GS) than controls. GS is normally allosterically-regulated by glucose-6-phosphate and enzyme activity is reduced by phosphorylation. We hypothesised that the higher GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses might be due either to 1) increased expression or reduced degradation of the mutant enzyme or 2) due to reduced phosphorylation. Methods Semimembranosus muscle samples were biopsied from 4 homozygotes (HH), 13 heterozygotes (RH) and 12 control (RR) Belgian Draught horses. Samples were analysed for glycogen content and GS activity. Western immunoblotting was used to examine expression of total and phosphorylated forms of GS, GSK3? and GLUT4. Data was analysed using non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests with post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results PSSM1 affected heterozygotes and homozygotes had significantly higher muscle glycogen contents than controls (RR vs. RH P?=?0.005, RR vs. HH P?= 0.041) and GS activity was significantly higher in PSSM1-affected homozygotes than in heterozygotes and control horses (P?=?0.03). Although there was no difference in total GS expression between groups, there was significantly more expression of GS phosphorylated at site 2?+?2a in PSSM1-affected horses in comparison with controls (P?=?0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses is not associated with increased expression or degradation of the mutant enzyme and occurs despite increased phosphorylation of GS at site 2?+?2a. Alternative mechanisms, including aberrant ligand binding might account for the increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected muscle.

AB  - Introduction Muscle glycogen is a potentially limiting substrate for horses during intense exercise. Low-starch, high-fat concentrates have become popular for performance horses, but their effect on muscle glycogen usage and repletion is unclear. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses were studied in a 3?x?3 Latin Square design to measure the effect of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), fat and fiber intake on glycogen repletion following intense exercise. Horses were fed isocaloric, isonitrogenous rations that supplied high (HS), medium (MS) or low (LS) NSC intake. The horses were fed 1.25% BW/d grass-hay and 1.0% BW/d concentrate. These rations provided 45%, 36% and 18% of total digestible energy (DE) from NSC, 11%, 15% and 23% of total DE from fat, and 30%, 33% and 45% of total DE from fiber. During each 1-month period horses were trained for three weeks on a high-speed treadmill followed by a three-day glycogen-depletion period comprising multiple bouts of intense exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken before and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-depletion. A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed on day 1 of the depletion period. Results During the SET, lactate was lower in LS compared to MS or HS (P<0.05). Heart rate, plasma glucose, VO2, VCO2 were unaffected by treatment. Muscle glycogen depletion averaged 33%, 30%, and 36% in the HS, MS and LS treatments. Muscle glycogen repletion was significantly lower in the LS group 72 hours post exercise (P<0.05). Conclusions Low NSC concentrates may not provide enough substrate for glycogen repletion following multiple bouts of intense exercise.

AB  - Introduction The 227-bp SINE insertion in the promoter region of the MSTN gene, the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MSTN, g.66493737C>T, and the SNPs BIEC2-417274 and BIEC2-417495 located upstream and downstream of MSTN seem appropriate QTL markers for racing performance of elite Thoroughbreds. This pilot study aimed to find if these markers of racing ability can be used to optimize the management of the racing careers of Turkish Thoroughbreds. Methods Hair roots were used for DNA extraction. The promoter insertion was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product. The SNPs were typed by the amplification refractory mutation system-real-time PCR. Best racing distance was defined as the distance of the races in which the horse obtained the best results. Results were semi quantified by a point score based on wining and places. Results BIEC2-417274, BIEC2-417495 SNP variants and the 227-bp SINE were strongly associated with g.66493737C>T. For the latter, the genotype frequencies were: C/C 0.23, C/T 0.52 and T/T 0.25. In total 39% of the Turkish races are distances >1600?m. Analysis of the racing career showed that both the sprinters (C/C) and the medium distance horse (C/T) were not entered optimally in races that fit with their genetic ability. Conclusions Turkish race programing should create more opportunities for the g.66493737 C/T genotypes to show their ability. This implies that more 1700 to 2800?m races should be scheduled in the racing calendar. Ethical Animal Research Owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Jockey Club of Turkey.

AB  - Introduction Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is considered height-linked in Thoroughbreds. A SNP (BIEC2-808543) proximal to the LCORL/NCAPG gene significantly influences height variation in horses. It has been suggested that the C-allele of this SNP is associated with RLN risk. Our objective was to investigate the association between the BIEC2-808543 C-allele, RLN and height in a cohort of Thoroughbreds. Methods Resting and exercising upper respiratory tract endoscopic videos, laryngeal ultrasonograms, wither height, age and sex were recorded in 79 Thoroughbreds (age 34?±?11 months). The Havemeyer grading scale was used to characterise RLN cases (Grade B or C at exercise) and controls (Grade 1.1 or 2.1 at rest, Grade A at exercise, normal laryngeal ultrasound). All horses were genotyped for the BIEC2-808543 SNP using a custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Logistic regression was performed measuring additive effects of allele dosage with sex, age and height as covariates (P≤0.05). Horses were subcategorised into tall (T,≥162?cm) and short (S,<162?cm) groups for C-allele frequency determination, with data presented as mean?±?SD. Results There were 16 RLN cases (height 164.5?±?4?cm) and 32 controls (height 156.2?±?4?cm). With sex and age as covariates, a significant association between the C-allele and RLN cases was observed (P?=?0.01). With height included as a covariate, a strong trend of association between the C-allele and RLN remained (P?=?0.06). C-allele frequency was 41.7% for the T-RLN group (n?=?12, height 166.2?±?3?cm), 12.5% for the S-RLN group (n?=?4, height 159.5?±?2?cm), 13% for the T-Control group (n?=?16, height 165.1?±?2?cm) and 14% for the S-Control group (n?=?16, height 156.2?±?4?cm). Conclusions The association between the BIEC-808543 C-allele and RLN appears to be independent of height. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction The horse has evolved to survive on a low-energy, high-fibre diet. The addition of starch, in the form of cereals, to the diet of racehorses to satisfy the high energy demands of extreme exercise has been identified as a risk factor for intestinal dysfunction. In this study we use 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to characterize the gut microbiome of 8 Thoroughbred (Tb) racehorses and study the response to dietary supplementation. Methods Faecal samples were collected from 8 Tb racehorses in training. A second sample was collected from all horses six weeks after commencement of twice daily dietary supplementation with an amylase-rich malt extract, designed to enhance pre-caecal digestion. Amplicons for the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA gene were multiplexed and sequenced on the 454 resulting in ?25,000 reads per sample. Differences in bacterial community structure were detected by linear discriminant analysis. Results Communities were composed of an equal balance between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with a ?5% contribution from other bacterial phyla. The number of observed operational taxonomic units sharing ≥97% nucleotide sequence in our racehorse population was 6000?8000. Horses showed no significant change in the number of OTUs observed after diet supplementation, but significant changes in the relative abundance of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes families were observed. Conclusions We demonstrated a highly diverse and complex faecal microbial community in Tb racehorses in the UK. Inter-horse variability is low amongst horses in the same training yard. We identified significant shifts in community profile following dietary supplementation and speculate that these may enhance intestinal health.

AB  - Introduction Repeated monitoring of faecal pH may be useful in detecting the effects of exercise and conditioning on the fermentative activity within the large intestine. This study investigated the effect of a maximal incremental exercise test (MIET) and aerobic conditioning on the faecal pH of untrained horses. Methods Fourteen equines were randomly divided into two experimental groups. The control group consisted of 7 horses that remained untrained. The second group underwent physical training (n?=?7). The trained equines underwent two MIETs, once before and once after exercise conditioning. The conditioning period lasted 6 weeks and consisted of 3 weekly sessions of exercising on a treadmill at 70% of lactate threshold. All horses were fed the same diet. To evaluate the effect of exercise on faecal pH, stool samples were collected before and 48?h after the MIETs (before and after training) for determination of fecal pH. To determine chronic effects, weekly stool sampling was performed at 0 (immediately before), 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days of training. One-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test, the paired t-test (MIET) and the unpaired t-test were performed for comparisons between the groups at the different times. Results Faecal pH decreased from day 28 in the trained horse group compared to controls. pH values were 7.57?±?0.10 and 7.27?±?0.24 (before) and 7.97?±?0.14 and 6.75?±?0.15 (after) for the control and trained groups respectively. There was no change in faecal pH after the MIET. Conclusions It appears that physical conditioning reduced faecal pH of horses.
