AB  - This review covers selected 2015 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due largely to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g.some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB  - summary. Data of the German Haemovigilance System were collected from 1997 to 2007 and assessed on the basis of pre-defined safety standards. Suspected cases of serious adverse reactions following transfusions reported to the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut were evaluated on the basis of national criteria, and the definitions of International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) in compliance with defined causality criteria. The suspected cases were rated as confirmed and unconfirmed transfusion reactions. Assessment of causality took into consideration the clinical course of the adverse reaction and, if necessary, information about donation and manufacturing. Of the 5128 suspected serious adverse reactions, 1603 could be confirmed. Referring to the absolute figures, acute transfusion reactions (e.g. allergic reactions, hypotension and dyspnoea) were recorded most frequently, followed by transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), haemolytic reactions, transfusion-related bacterial infections and virus infections. The majority of the 52 transfusion-related fatalities (14 each) were due to TRALI and acute transfusion reactions (mostly severe allergic reactions). Referred to the blood products administered, immune TRALI cases and TRALI-related fatal courses were most frequently reported after administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (15/106 and 3.5/106 units, respectively), transfusion-related bacterial infections after administration of platelet concentrates (7/106 units), acute haemolytic transfusion reactions after administration of red blood cell concentrates (2.3/106units) and acute transfusion reactions after administration of red blood cell or platelet concentrates (7.8/106 and 13/106 units, respectively). Despite the high safety standard required for blood products in Germany, there is still room for reducing the frequency of isolated cases of transfusion reactions by targeted action.

AB  - Abstract Background The biology of hepatic epithelial haemangioendothelioma (HEHE) is variable, lying intermediate to haemangioma and angiosarcoma. Treatments vary owing to the rarity of the disease and frequent misdiagnosis. Methods Between 1989 and 2013, patients retrospectively identified with HEHE from a single academic cancer centre were analysed to evaluate clinicopathological factors and initial treatment regimens associated with survival. Results Fifty patients with confirmed HEHE had a median follow-up of 51 months (range 1?322). There was no difference in 5-year survival between patients presenting with unilateral compared with bilateral hepatic disease (51.4% versus 80.7%, respectively; P = 0.1), localized compared with metastatic disease (69% versus 78.3%, respectively; P = 0.7) or an initial treatment regimen of Surgery, Chemotherapy/Embolization or Observation alone (83.3% versus 71.3% versus 72.4%, respectively; P = 0.9). However, 5-year survival for patients treated with chemotherapy at any point during their disease course was decreased compared with those who did not receive any chemotherapy (43.6% versus 82.9%, respectively; P = 0.02) and was predictive of a decreased overall survival on univariate analysis [HR 3.1 (CI 0.9?10.7), P = 0.02]. Conclusions HEHE frequently follows an indolent course, suggesting that immediate treatment may not be the optimal strategy. Initial observation to assess disease behaviour may better stratify treatment options, reserving surgery for those who remain resectable/transplantable. Prospective cooperative trials or registries may confirm this strategy.
