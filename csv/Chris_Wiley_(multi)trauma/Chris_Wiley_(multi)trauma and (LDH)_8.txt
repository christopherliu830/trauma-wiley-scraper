AB  - Introduction Racehorses suffering from subclinical diseases are frequently kept in training until they fail expectations during competition. The diagnosis of medical causes of poor performance remains challenging in the field. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of subclinical causes of poor performance in working Thoroughbreds (TB) and to determine which clinical field tests could most appropriately identify them. Methods During the course of a training session, a complete clinical screening was performed in 11 healthy controls (C) and 38 poor performing (PP) TB without obvious clinical signs. Exercising ECG and GPS monitoring, blood sample analysis including oxidative stress markers, Doppler echocardiography, respiratory function testing (RFT), post-exercise endoscopy, tracheal wash (TW) and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. Statistics included ANOVA and Spearman's test (P<0.05). Results Subclinical causes of PP included muscular, respiratory and cardiac disorders. Variables derived from velocity and HR showed significant differences between groups. Lower airway diseases (LAD) were the most frequently diagnosed (33/38), causing significant differences in RFT. Endoscopic observations correlated with TW cytology, but unlike BAL analysis, were insufficient to diagnose all LAD cases. Supra- or ventricular premature beats were present only in the PP group but were not associated with echocardiographic abnormalities. Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in PP. Conclusions Velocity, ECG and HR monitoring during a training session can be used as non-specific predictive indicators of performance, help assess functional consequences of diseases and guide ancillary diagnostic investigations. As LAD is highly prevalent, BAL sampling would be indicated in any case of poor performance. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the University of Liege.

AB  - Introduction Elimination of CO2 from skeletal muscle (mCO2) during exercise is important for the regulation of intramuscular [H+] ([mH+]). Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyses the hydration/dehydration reaction of CO2 to facilitate its elimination. We hypothesised that extracellular CA inhibition and subsequent increase in PCO2 will result in increased m[H+] and decreased exercise performance. Methods Six horses were exercised on a treadmill until fatigue without (Con) and with acetazolamide (CA inhibitor) treatment (Acz; 30?mg/kg, 30?min before exercise). Arterial and mixed-venous blood was sampled, and biopsies collected from gluteal muscles at fatigue. Whole blood (wb) arteriovenous difference across the muscle (a-v) of [Na+], [K+], [Cl?], [Lac?], [SID], and PCO2, mCO2 and m[H+] were determined. Paired t-test was used to assess statistical significance (P<0.05). Results Duration of exercise to fatigue was not affected by Acz. Compared to Con, Acz increased mCO2 (Con 16.5(mean) ±?3.6(SE), Acz 20.5?±?2?mmol/L) and mixed-venous and arterial PCO2 but had no effect on VCO2. No difference was observed in m[H+] between Con (118?±?18?nmol/L) and Acz (99?±?16?nmol/L). Acetazolamide did not affect plasma [H+]. Based on the a-v differences Acz increased [Na+]wb and [K+]wb release, increased [Cl-]wb uptake and did not affect [Lac-]wb release by the muscle. Acz decreased a-v[SID]wb (Con 6.2?±?2.8?mmol/L, Acz ?0.3?±?2?mmol/L). Conclusions Although PCO2 and mCO2 were elevated no difference in [mH+] was observed. An increase in m[H+] due to elevated mCO2 was attenuated by strong ion fluxes between intramuscular and vascular spaces. Strong ion exchanges are important in attenuating m[H+] and maintaining exercise performance.

AB  - Introduction Many jurisdictions measure plasma tCO2 to determine if racehorses may have been administered exogenous alkalinizers illegally (?milkshakes?). Our hypothesis was that plasma tCO2 test results vary within a racing jurisdiction due to inter-day instrument variability. Methods Individual or daily mean plasma tCO2 test results from New York (n?=?584) and Maine (n?=?443) Standardbreds and California Thoroughbreds (n?=?23,686) were obtained through legal discovery in adjudicated cases where trainers were accused of tampering with horses resulting in tCO2 concentrations ≥37.0?mmol/L. Daily results were grouped by days on which no horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (LOW) or days on which at least one horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (HIGH). HIGH days were further subsampled by eliminating ?positive? test results ≥37.0?mmol/L (MODIFIED HIGH). With P<0.05 considered significant, differences between groups were compared by Student's t test for means and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test for medians. Results HIGH tCO2 means (32.9?±?2.6, 35.2?±?3.4, 32.6?±?2.7) and medians (32.9, 35.4, 32.6) for all 3 jurisdictions were higher than LOW means (31.7?±?2.3, 31.9?±?4.3, 31.5?±?0.7) and medians (31.8, 32.9, 31.5) (P<0.001). Even when ?positive? tests ≥37.0 were eliminated, MODIFIED HIGH means (32.5?±?2.2, 33.6?±?2.6, 32.4?±?2.5) and medians (32.7, 34.2, 32.5) were still higher than LOW (P<0.001). Conclusions Unless the population tCO2 mean varies significantly daily, it must be concluded that instrument variability resulted in day-to-day differences in plasma tCO2 test results. Without appropriate quality control including correction of individual suspect results to a contemporaneous standard curve, horse trainers may be accused unfairly of tampering when day-to-day instrument variability contributes to positive plasma tCO2 test results.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to determine whether serum anti-oxidant defenses are impaired by endurance exercise and to investigate possible correlation with performance in the race. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 23 Arabian or half-Arabian horses (6 years old) the day before (T0) and 30 minutes after (T1) a 90-km race. Performance records available included speed, heart rate 10 and 30 minutes after arrival and the rating by veterinarians based on recovery and gait (5 categories from ?eliminated? to ?excellent?). Absorbance at 413?nm (A413), at 650?nm (A650) and absorbance of Rose Bengal (RB) were measured in sera at T0 and T1 (a higher absorbance means a lower antioxidant capacity). Relationships between blood variables and between T0 values and race results were evaluated using correlation analysis and means comparisons. Results All horses finished the race with an average speed of 16.3?km/h. Three horses were eliminated for lameness, one was excellent and the others were distributed between the other three categories. After the race, a significant increase of RB, A413, A413-A650, PT and CK (P<0.001) was observed. At T0, RB and CK were significantly correlated (r?=?0.52, P<0.01). At T1, absorbance values were significantly correlated with muscle enzymes and haptoglobin (r?=?0.50?0.67, P<0.05). The speed of the horse was negatively correlated with RB at T0 (r?=??0.42, P<0.05). No significant difference in absorbance values could be detected between the recovery categories. Conclusions A higher resistance to oxidative stress was observed before the race in the best performing horses.

AB  - Introduction Electrolyte supplementation prior to exercise is known to benefit both performance and recovery; however its effects on acid-base status remain not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to use the physicochemical approach to provide a comprehensive time-course of the acid-base alterations that occur following pre-exercise electrolyte supplementation in horses. It was hypothesized that electrolyte supplementation will attenuate the alkalosis occurring with prolonged moderate intensity exercise. Methods In a randomized crossover experiment four conditioned mares were given, via nasogastric tube, 3?L of a commercial electrolyte solution (ES; designed to fully replace sweat electrolyte and fluid losses), or water alone (Control), 1 hour before they exercised on a treadmill at 30% VO2max until voluntary fatigue (inability to keep pace with belt speed). Blood was sampled from jugular venous catheters at frequent intervals before, during, and until 20?h of exercise recovery, and analyzed for all dependent and independent plasma acid-base variables. Differences (P<0.05) over time and between groups were assessed by 1- or 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results Horses exercised for 57.5?±?10.3 and 72.5?±?17.0?min and lost 2.73?±?0.82 and 4.63?±?1.35?L in Control and ES trials, respectively. ES horses had lower pCO2 and total carbon dioxide (TCO2) concentrations during exercise and early recovery. Control horses exhibited decreased [H+]. pCO2 was the primary contributor to changes in [H+] and [TCO2], while there were no differences in strong ion difference ([SID]) or total weak acid concentration ([Atot]). Conclusions Electrolyte supplementation prior to prolonged exercise leads to sustained effects on equine acid-base variables, even in the absence of significant changes in plasma electrolytes or hydration.

AB  - Introduction Exercise causes several physiological changes resulting from autonomic and hemodynamic adaptations, but there are few reports about the behaviour of blood pressure (BP) during physical activity in horses, as well as the effect of training on BP. Methods 9 untrained Arabian horses underwent two treadmill evaluations (before and after 90 days of aerobic training at 60% HRmax) at 6% incline with incremental speed increases every 3 minutes (commencing at 2.5?m/s and reaching 12.5?m/s). The facial artery was cannulated with a 20?G catheter and systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded with a multiparameter monitor (GE Dash 3000 model). Data were evaluated by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Bonferroni multiple comparison (P<0.05). Results During initial evaluation SBP increased in a gradual and uniform manner as speed increased, reaching a maximum of 208?mmHg at a speed of 10?m/s. After training, SBP behaved similarly during treadmill evaluation, however values were lower until 10?m/s (P<0.001), and the maximum value of SBP obtained was 218?mmHg at 12.5?m/s. DPB was not significantly different (P?=?0.124). MAP emulated the behaviour of SBP (P?=?0.012). Conclusions A decrease in SBP and MAP during identical treadmill evaluations before and after 90 days of aerobic exercise (60% HR max) indicated that training decreased cardiac effort required for the maintenance of physical activity.

AB  - Introduction Cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) has been previously validated in horses. Newer high sensitivity troponin assays have recently become available that are now the standard in human cardiology. The objective was to validate the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hscTn-T) assay for use in horses and to determine the biological variation within and between horse breeds. Methods Samples were analysed using the hscTn-T assay reagent (Roche,Cobas c501). Method validation included linearity, lower limit of quantitation (LLQ), freeze-thaw stability, within-and between-run precision, and comparison with cTn-I (Abbott iSTAT, Deming regression). Normal range and biological variation included healthy horses (n?=?120; age?=?7.2?±?0.5 years (SE)) representing 5 breeds. Results Assay was linear from 3?391?ng/L. The LLQ was validated at 3?ng/L. Stability of samples was unaffected by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Within-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?6.50 (±0.97), L2?=?10.1 (±0.88), L3?= 15.3 (±0.82)?ng/L and between-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?12.2 (±1.03), L2?=?57.0 (±4.82), L3?=?256 (±23.1)?ng/L. Comparison with cTn-I assay showed excellent correlation (range: 8?3535?ng/L, r?=?0.9998). Bias was evident in the regression results [hscTnT?=?(0.6153?±?0.002809)*(cTnI*1000)???(11.53?±?5.462)]. The 95th and 99th percentile of the normal distribution in healthy horses was 4 and 6?ng/L. Between breed, diurnal effect and between day variation was not detectable due to low concentrations of hscTnT. Conclusions This study established reference intervals for hscTn-T assay in healthy horses and the performance characteristics of hsTn-T assay in horse samples. Normal population distribution was mostly below the detection limit of the assay. The hscTn-T assay will likely establish the standard in early detection of cardiac pathologies in horses.

AB  - Introduction Increasing cardiac dimension with endurance training is well known in adult athletes. However, adaptation of the heart to training in growing Arabian type horses is less well documented. Methods During the national finals for young endurance horses, standardized echocardiographic examinations were performed before the races by two experienced examiners. In 2011 left ventricle (LV) was assessed in 74 horses aged 4-years (18), 5-years (33) and 6-years (23). In 2012 left atrial (LA) dimensions and the great heart vessels were measured in 122 horses aged 4-years (32), 5-years (40) and 6-years (50). Data were normally distributed; age groups and gender were compared by one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons, significance P<0.05); relationships between echocardiographic dimensions and body weight (BWT) were assessed by linear regressions. Results BWT was highest in 5-year old horses. LV dimensions increased with age, but for most measurements the difference was significant only for the group of 6-year old horses. The stroke volume (SV) increased (P?=?0.0016) and the heart rate decreased (P?=?0.06) with increasing age, leading to a constant cardiac output in all age groups. There was a weak relationship between BWT and SV. Two dimensional LA measurements increased between 4 and 5 years but remained constant between 5 and 6 years. LA area measurements and LA functional indices showed no evolution between the groups. Aortic dimension increased with age but pulmonary artery dimension showed no such increase. No influence of gender on echocardiographic dimensions and function could be found. Conclusions Great heart vessels, LA and LV dimensions showed different growth patterns between 4 and 6 years of age.

AB  - Introduction Field exercise tests (FET) can assist design of individualized training programs. Although FETs have been used in other breeds, there are limited reports for Quarter horses (QH) and cross-bred QH which are widely used in traditional Venezuelan equestrian activities. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of an FET in cross-bred Quarter horses in Venezuela. Methods Six horses (3 stallions and 3 mares) performed a FET consisting of a four-step incremental increase in speed (91?±?10; 136?±?3; 271?±?20; 439?±?43?m/min). Each cycle lasted 3 to 5?min with 3 minutes of rest between each. Environmental temperature was 32°C. Heart rate and speed were recorded (Polar Equine RS800CX?) and the speed to reach a heart rate of 200 and 170 beats/min was calculated by linear regression. The rate of heart rate decline was determined 5 minutes after the last step. Linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics and an unpaired t- test (Graph Pad Prism 5.0) were utilized to identify gender differences (P<0.05). Results Gender did not influence the results. V200 and V170 were slightly higher in stallions (617?±?98 and 465?±?66?m/min, respectively) than in mares (511?±?60 and 387?±?60?m/min, respectively). The rate of heart rate decline was slightly more rapid in mares (25?±?7 beats/min) compared to stallions (13?±?5 beats/min). Conclusions Although a low number of horses were evaluated, these preliminary data suggest that gender has limited influence on fitness of cross-bred Quarter horses used in local Venezuelan equestrian activities under tropical environmental conditions. The mean V200 and V170 values obtained were lower than those reported for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, but similar to those reported in young racing Quarter horses.

AB  - Introduction During racing, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of energy for muscle contraction. Assessment of muscle OXPHOS capacity by high-resolution respirometry (HRR) might identify animals with altered energy metabolism and consequently increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). Methods Prospective cohort study. Ten healthy French Standardbreds in active training, aged 4?7 years, recruited at the start of a competitive racing season, underwent a standardised field exercise test with determination of speed at onset of lactate accumulation (VLa4) and measurement of serum creatine kinase activity (CK) two hours post-exercise. Triceps brachii muscle microbiopsies were obtained for determination of OXPHOS and electron transfer system (ETS) capacities with HRR. Associations between HRR variables and occurrence of ER over the following four months of racing were analysed using univariate logistic regression. Results Two horses developed ER during the study period: one within one month of recruitment, another presented multiple minor episodes over the season. For these ER horses OXPHOS/ETS ratio was lower, and Complex I/Complex I?+?II ratio and Complex I /Complex II ratio were higher than non-affected horses in the study (perfect prediction of occurrence of ER with ratio of ≤0.74, ≥0.60 and ≥0.715 respectively). VLa4 for ER horses was within the range of non-affected horses. Post-exercise CK was within normal limits for all horses in the study. Conclusions OXPHOS and ETS capacities and their derived ratios indicate dysfunctional muscle energy metabolism whereas VLa4 and CK were unremarkable in horses subsequently affected by ER. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by Liège University's Animal Ethics Committee (agreement N° 07-629); owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Part of the study protocol was funded by Les Haras Nationaux (France).

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a missense, gain-of-function mutation in the equine skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1). Affected horses have excessive glycogen storage, amylopectate-like inclusions in their muscle and higher muscle glycogen synthase activities (GS) than controls. GS is normally allosterically-regulated by glucose-6-phosphate and enzyme activity is reduced by phosphorylation. We hypothesised that the higher GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses might be due either to 1) increased expression or reduced degradation of the mutant enzyme or 2) due to reduced phosphorylation. Methods Semimembranosus muscle samples were biopsied from 4 homozygotes (HH), 13 heterozygotes (RH) and 12 control (RR) Belgian Draught horses. Samples were analysed for glycogen content and GS activity. Western immunoblotting was used to examine expression of total and phosphorylated forms of GS, GSK3? and GLUT4. Data was analysed using non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests with post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results PSSM1 affected heterozygotes and homozygotes had significantly higher muscle glycogen contents than controls (RR vs. RH P?=?0.005, RR vs. HH P?= 0.041) and GS activity was significantly higher in PSSM1-affected homozygotes than in heterozygotes and control horses (P?=?0.03). Although there was no difference in total GS expression between groups, there was significantly more expression of GS phosphorylated at site 2?+?2a in PSSM1-affected horses in comparison with controls (P?=?0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses is not associated with increased expression or degradation of the mutant enzyme and occurs despite increased phosphorylation of GS at site 2?+?2a. Alternative mechanisms, including aberrant ligand binding might account for the increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected muscle.

AB  - Introduction Muscle glycogen is a potentially limiting substrate for horses during intense exercise. Low-starch, high-fat concentrates have become popular for performance horses, but their effect on muscle glycogen usage and repletion is unclear. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses were studied in a 3?x?3 Latin Square design to measure the effect of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), fat and fiber intake on glycogen repletion following intense exercise. Horses were fed isocaloric, isonitrogenous rations that supplied high (HS), medium (MS) or low (LS) NSC intake. The horses were fed 1.25% BW/d grass-hay and 1.0% BW/d concentrate. These rations provided 45%, 36% and 18% of total digestible energy (DE) from NSC, 11%, 15% and 23% of total DE from fat, and 30%, 33% and 45% of total DE from fiber. During each 1-month period horses were trained for three weeks on a high-speed treadmill followed by a three-day glycogen-depletion period comprising multiple bouts of intense exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken before and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-depletion. A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed on day 1 of the depletion period. Results During the SET, lactate was lower in LS compared to MS or HS (P<0.05). Heart rate, plasma glucose, VO2, VCO2 were unaffected by treatment. Muscle glycogen depletion averaged 33%, 30%, and 36% in the HS, MS and LS treatments. Muscle glycogen repletion was significantly lower in the LS group 72 hours post exercise (P<0.05). Conclusions Low NSC concentrates may not provide enough substrate for glycogen repletion following multiple bouts of intense exercise.

AB  - Introduction In Thoroughbreds, genetic variation in myostatin (MSTN g.66493737C/T) is highly predictive of optimum race distance and influences mRNA expression, precocity, skeletal muscle development, two-year-old earnings, speed variables and skeletal muscle fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate MSTN variation associations with VO2peak in untrained yearling Thoroughbreds. Methods Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbred yearlings (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) from one flat racing yard (November-December). Data was collected as horses freely travelled up an all-weather gallop (2% incline) with no rider. VO2 was measured using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask and associated customized software validated for field testing. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded. MSTN genotypes were determined using a customised Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Tests of association between genotype and phenotype were performed using PLINK software. Results Average exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, and HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm. MSTN genotypes and VO2peak based on 6 breaths were n?=?16 CC, VO2peak?=?119.49?±?21.8; n?=?22 CT, VO2peak?=?116.40?±?-27.2; n?=?3 TT, 115.08?±?20.2.There was no association (P>0.05) between genotype and VO2peak. Conclusions In yearling Thoroughbreds no association between MSTN genotype and untrained peak oxygen consumption was observed. This may be a function of the small number of TT genotype individuals evaluated or a reflection of a requirement for MSTN-associated skeletal muscle entrainment in VO2peak changes resulting from a period of exercise training. Such changes may be associated with MSTN genotype and this requires further investigation. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction PGC-1α and irisin, encoded by the PPARGC1A and FNDC5 genes, play key roles in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise. PPARGC1A gene expression is induced by exercise and has been shown to upregulate FNDC5 expression. Higher levels of FNDC5 have been observed in young male human athletes compared to sedentary controls. FNDC5 gene expression has also been shown in some species to be modulated by myostatin (MSTN), a growth factor that limits muscle hypertrophy. In horses MSTN variation (g.66493737C>T) affects gene expression and racing performance. Thoroughbreds homozygous for the C-allele have significantly higher levels of MSTN?mRNA than homozygous T?:?T horses. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of PPARGC1A and FNDC5 in skeletal muscle to exercise and investigate the relationship with MSTN genotype. Methods Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) biopsies were taken from untrained yearling Thoroughbreds (n?=?27) at rest and after a ten month period of training at two-years-old. Skeletal muscle gene expression was measured using real-time qRT-PCR assays and data was analysed using qBase software. Results A significant increase in both PPARGC1A (P?=?0.0001, FC?=?1.82) and FNDC5 (P?=?0.039, FC?=?1.72) was observed post-training. A significant positive correlation was found between FNDC5 and PPARGC1A expression levels post training (P?=?0.01, R2?=?0.22). There was no relationship between PPARGC1A or FNDC5 gene expression and MSTN genotype. Conclusions These data indicate a coordinated role for PGC-1α and irisin in the skeletal muscle response to exercise in Thoroughbred horses. Their known roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and brown fat metabolism suggest important roles in the adaptive response to exercise, which is independent of MSTN-determined muscle type.

AB  - Introduction NaHCO3 has been administered prior to racing in an attempt to enhance performance but it remains unclear whether potential ergogenic effects may be due to increased buffering capacity or expanded extracellular fluid volume. Methods Solutions of 1?g/kg of NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3 in 8?L of water were administered via a nasogastric tube 60?min prior to a high intensity treadmill exercise test (12?m/s to fatigue) to 4 horses in a randomized fashion. Changes in mixed venous plasma electrolyte concentrations (NOVA Biomedical analyser) and run time to fatigue were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Administration of Na and K salts increased Na and K concentrations before and during maximal exercise, respectively. Administration of bicarbonate salts attenuated acidosis and the decrease in bicarbonate concentration during exercise, as compared to Cl salts. Of interest, run time to fatigue was longer (P<0.001, power?=?0.98) after administration of KCl (5.1?±?0.6?min) as compared to both bicarbonate salts (3.7?±?0.6 and 3.6?±?0.8?min for NaHCO3 and KHCO3, respectively), but was not different than run time after NaCl administration (4.3?±?0.8?min). Conclusions Preloading with large amounts of Na and K salts produced expected changes in mixed venous Na and K concentrations but preloading with bicarbonate did not improve performance. Observation of longer run times to fatigue after administration of NaCl or KCl was unexpected and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Introduction The objective was to compare, using a dynamometric horseshoe (DHS), the longitudinal and vertical components of the reaction force and corresponding impulses in the leading and trailing forelimbs of horses landing after a jump on a competition surface. Methods Both forefeet of 3 horses were equipped with a DHS. 1000?Hz films of the right forefoot at landing were synchronized with the DHSs recordings. Within a corridor delimited on a sand arena, each horse jumped a 1.20?m (horse 1) or 1.10?m (horses 2 and 3) high fence while cantering alternatively at both leads. Data were pooled and 37 strides analyzed both for the leading (LF) and trailing (TF) forelimbs. In addition to peak forces and impulses (integral of force over time) in the hoof reference frame, the forces on the right forelimb were projected in the track reference frame to determine true retardatory (TR) and propulsory (TP) phases. Differences between LF and TF were estimated with linear regression models, using generalized estimating equations to adjust for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (for all results, P<0.0005). Results Maximal vertical force and loading rate were respectively 1.2 and 1.4 times higher on TF. TR-longitudinal impulse was 21 times, and TR-vertical impulse 8 times higher in LF, whereas TP-longitudinal impulse was 4 times, and TP-vertical impulse 2 times higher in TF. Conclusions Despite a lower maximal vertical loading, LF plays a major part in the retardatory (load-absorption) phase, while TF is mainly involved in propulsion. Loading of anatomical structures is therefore different in both limbs, which provides insights for interpreting horses' preferred lead at landing depending on which structure is affected.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is an important part of lameness examination since the circular path is thought to accentuate low-grade lameness. Circle dependent, compensatory movement, and pain related asymmetries make lameness evaluation complex. Subjective evaluation, by watching the horse in motion, is standard practice but studies have shown that inter-observer variation is high when assessing lameness (straight line movement). The aim was to estimate inter- and intra-rater agreement between equine practitioners evaluating lameness from videos of sound and lame horses during lungeing. Methods Equine practitioners (n?=?86), including 43 deemed as experienced, participated in a web-based survey. Horses (n?=?23, including two horses with solar-pressure induced lameness) [defined as forelimb-, hind limb-lame or sound from objective kinematic straight line measurements] trotted on a circle in both directions on soft/hard ground surfaces (one condition/video). Of 104 recordings, 60 were selected of which 10 were repeated (numbers chosen to make compliance possible). The practitioners were asked to report which limb was most lame on each video. Kappa statistics were used to analyze the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement. The ? agreement was set to poor <0.3, acceptable 0.31?0.5, good 0.51?0.8, excellent >0.8. Results Inter-rater agreement kappa (n?=?86) was 0.31 (0.38/0.25 for experienced/less experienced). Evaluating forelimb compared to hind limb lameness agreement increased 11%. Intra-rater agreement kappa (percentiles) was (P10-50-90, 0.21, 0.57, 0.84). Conclusions Since identification of the lame limb/limbs is a prerequisite for successful diagnosis, treatment and recovery, the high inter-observer variation when evaluating lameness during lungeing may decrease the accuracy of lameness examinations.

AB  - Introduction When horses are trotted in-hand, this is predominantly performed with the handler on the horse's left side. In the context of objective gait analysis, this study investigated whether the side a horse is led from affects movement symmetry measures used to quantify lameness. We hypothesised that the side which horses were handled from would have no effect on head and pelvic movement symmetry. Methods Vertical movement of head and pelvis was quantified in 23 horses during trot in-hand with a validated inertial sensor gait analysis system. Established movement symmetry measures commonly used to quantify lameness were calculated for a minimum of 27 strides per condition. Each horse was assessed three times, twice handled from one side, once from the other side, with the initial handling side randomly assigned. Differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments led from the same side were compared to differences when led from the opposite side using a paired t-test (P<0.05) Results Which side a horse was led from had no significant effect on either head (all P>0.754) or pelvic (all P>0.514) movement symmetry. Mean differences for head (and pelvic) movement asymmetry were below 2% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for repeat assessments from the same side and below 4% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for opposite side leads. Conclusions The side from which a horse is led does not significantly affect differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments. Data analysis should be restricted to trials with consistent head carriage and a minimum of 27 strides (previously reported to give a representative estimate of stride-to-stride variability).

AB  - Introduction Rider movement may influence horse-rider interaction, yet little is known about what physical attributes affect postural stability. This study aimed to compare pelvic control and postural stability of riders on the floor and whilst riding. Methods 33 riders were assessed by a physiotherapist and subjectively graded according to ability to tilt the pelvis in isolation: 1?=?poor, 2?=?better plus compensations, which were either A?=?lumbar spine inclusion B?=?full body lean, 3?=?good. Riders wore markers on (1) greater trochanter of the femur, (2) iliac crest, (3) greater tubercle of the humerus. A marker was placed over the horse's tuber sacrale (4). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) recorded four strides of collected sitting trot in a straight line from the left side. Distance between markers was measured at midstance, maximum hindlimb protraction and retraction. Synchronisation was determined by the difference in time (secs) between the tuber sacrale of the horse and pelvis of the rider at these stride points. One-way ANOVA was used to compare synchronisation between groups. Student's independent t-test was used to compare marker distance. Results For pelvic tilt, no grade 3 riders were seen. Grade 2 riders were more synchronised with the horse during left hind diagonal suspension phase (P?=?0.011) and had smaller horizontal distances between markers 1?2, 2?3 and 1?3 respectively at all points of the stride (midstance: P<0.042; hindlimb protraction: P<0.049; hindlimb retraction: P<0.013). Comparing compensation types, grade A riders were better synchronised with the horse at midstance phase (P?=?0.014). Conclusions Results suggest that control of pelvic movement may have an impact on horse-rider synchronisation.

AB  - Introduction Lameness is the most common health problem of racehorses and may affect both welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate if locomotion asymmetry in a group of young horses was related to delayed qualification for races. Methods Locomotion asymmetry was measured every 1?3 months with a wireless inertial sensor based lameness evaluation system in 16 horses fourteen times between September of the year they were 1-year olds and May of the year they were 3-year olds. As 3-year-olds they passed their qualification race and after this, two subgroups were created for the study based on whether they passed their qualification race before June 21st (early group, n?=?6) or after September 19th (late group, n?=?6). The groups were compared with respect to the differences in vertical head (forelimbs) and pelvis (hindlimbs) movement (as measured by the Lameness Locator, Equinosis) during each stride cycle at trot. The vector sums (VS) of maximum and minimum difference from each sensor were calculated and used for statistical analyses. ANOVA (Proc mixed model including individual {random}, date and group) was used to analyse differences between groups. Results The late group had higher VS for forelimbs (16.0?±?1.0) than the early group (12.6?±?1.0) (P?=?0.04) in total over the whole period. The VS for hind limbs did not differ between groups. Conclusions Front limb locomotion asymmetry in young horses in training is associated with delayed qualification for races. However, further studies are warranted to investigate causality.
