AB  - Abstract Background Existing methods of non-viral airway gene transfer suffer from low levels of efficiency. Electroporation has been used to enhance gene transfer in a range of tissues. Here we assess the usefulness of electroporation for enhancing gene transfer in the lungs of mice and sheep. Methods Naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) expressing either luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was delivered to mouse lungs by instillation. Following surgical visualisation, the lungs were directly electroporated and the level and duration of luciferase activity was assessed and cell types that were positive for GFP were identified in lung cryosections. Naked pDNA was nebulised to the sheep lung and electrodes attached to the tip of a bronchoscope were used to electroporate airway segment bifurcations, Luciferase activity was assessed in electroporated and control non-electroporated regions, after 24 h. Results Following delivery of naked pDNA to the mouse lung, electroporation resulted in up to 400-fold higher luciferase activity than naked pDNA alone when luciferase was under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Following delivery of a plasmid containing the human polyubiquitin C (UbC) promoter, electroporation resulted in elevated luciferase activity for at least 28 days. Visualisation of GFP indicated that electroporation resulted in increased GFP detection compared with non-electroporated controls. In the sheep lung electroporation of defined sites in the airways resulted in luciferase activity 100-fold greater than naked pDNA alone. Conclusions These results indicate that electroporation can be used to enhance gene transfer in the lungs of mice and sheep without compromising the duration of expression.

AB  - Summary Bladder cancer is the most common urothelial malignancy. More than 90% arise from the transitional cell lining of the urinary tract. The remainder of the histological variants include squamous cell cancer, adeno carcinoma, and other rare tumours. Urothelial cancer is associated with smoking and exposure to industrial carcinogens. This cancer generally affects people who are older and who have many comorbidities, which makes their management more challenging. More than two-thirds of the urothelial cancers are non-muscle?invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa or submucosal layers of the bladder wall and remainder are muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC have tendency to recur, and the risk of recurrence varies between 15 and 80% and the majority of the recurrences occur within 6?12?months. Hence, intensive surveillance with cystoscopy and imaging of the urinary tract is required, which in turn incurs a high cost to the healthcare systems. The NMIBC cancers are classified based on their risk of recurrence and progression into low, intermediate, and high risk to tailor subsequent management and surveillance. In addition to the initial transurethral resection, intravesical therapies in the form of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination are used to reduce recurrence or progression of the disease. For MIBC or high-risk NMIBC, radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the mainstay of treatment. Radical cystectomy is a life-changing operation and is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, experts in the field are striving to minimise the morbidity of the procedure by using minimal invasive techniques of laparoscopy or robotic surgery in combination with enhanced recovery pathways to expedite recovery. There remains a risk of recurrence even after radical cystectomy due to micrometastasis. Various chemotherapy regimens have been used to decrease this in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has so far provided 5?8% absolute survival benefit at the expense of significant morbidity. In patients unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy, bladder preservation is an alternative which includes external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy after transurethral resection. There is not enough evidence to prove the equivalence of this to radical surgery. In those with advanced or metastatic disease, patients are put on palliative care pathway because the natural history of the disease is poor with four to six?months expected survival. However, some newer immuno-therapies that inhibit the interaction between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), present on the surface of tumour or antigen-presenting cells, and programmed death 1 (PD-1), present on the surface of activated lymphocytes, are offering new hope to the patients with advanced disease. In some cases of locally advanced cancer, palliative cystectomy can be performed for control of recurrent bleeding.
