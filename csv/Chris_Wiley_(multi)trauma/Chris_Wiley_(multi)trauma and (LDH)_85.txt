AB  - Hepatic metastases are a common event in the metastatic spread of primary tumours and indicate advanced disease. However, the presence of hepatic metastases does not necessarily imply incurability; in selected patients resection of hepatic metastases may result in 5-year survival rates of 25?35%, usually in patients with colorectal liver metastases in whom solitary metastases are more frequent than with other primary tumours. However, hepatic metastases from Wilm's tumours, adrenal tumours, renal cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumours may also be resected with similar success rates. A poor prognosis after resection of hepatic metastases is likely when there are more than three metastatic deposits, involved resection margins (often as a result of ?wedge? resections), when there is extrahepatic disease, or nodal involvement at the primary tumour site. Cyto-reductive procedures may provide excellent palliation and possibly long-term survival in selected patients with hepatic metastases unsuitable for resection. However, further study is required to establish the appropriate role for these treatments.

AB  - Summary Bladder cancer is the most common urothelial malignancy. More than 90% arise from the transitional cell lining of the urinary tract. The remainder of the histological variants include squamous cell cancer, adeno carcinoma, and other rare tumours. Urothelial cancer is associated with smoking and exposure to industrial carcinogens. This cancer generally affects people who are older and who have many comorbidities, which makes their management more challenging. More than two-thirds of the urothelial cancers are non-muscle?invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa or submucosal layers of the bladder wall and remainder are muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC have tendency to recur, and the risk of recurrence varies between 15 and 80% and the majority of the recurrences occur within 6?12?months. Hence, intensive surveillance with cystoscopy and imaging of the urinary tract is required, which in turn incurs a high cost to the healthcare systems. The NMIBC cancers are classified based on their risk of recurrence and progression into low, intermediate, and high risk to tailor subsequent management and surveillance. In addition to the initial transurethral resection, intravesical therapies in the form of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination are used to reduce recurrence or progression of the disease. For MIBC or high-risk NMIBC, radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the mainstay of treatment. Radical cystectomy is a life-changing operation and is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, experts in the field are striving to minimise the morbidity of the procedure by using minimal invasive techniques of laparoscopy or robotic surgery in combination with enhanced recovery pathways to expedite recovery. There remains a risk of recurrence even after radical cystectomy due to micrometastasis. Various chemotherapy regimens have been used to decrease this in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has so far provided 5?8% absolute survival benefit at the expense of significant morbidity. In patients unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy, bladder preservation is an alternative which includes external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy after transurethral resection. There is not enough evidence to prove the equivalence of this to radical surgery. In those with advanced or metastatic disease, patients are put on palliative care pathway because the natural history of the disease is poor with four to six?months expected survival. However, some newer immuno-therapies that inhibit the interaction between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), present on the surface of tumour or antigen-presenting cells, and programmed death 1 (PD-1), present on the surface of activated lymphocytes, are offering new hope to the patients with advanced disease. In some cases of locally advanced cancer, palliative cystectomy can be performed for control of recurrent bleeding.
