AB  - This review covers selected 2013 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, anjmals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on joumal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine dismpters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due in part to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and the 2010 Japanese tswwmi. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g.some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB  - The number of patients treated for end-stage renal disease increases in Sweden like the rest of the world. During the last six years more than 1000 persons a year started renal replacement therapy. Today hemodialysis patients have the opportunity to choose different treatment modalities?home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, or conventional dialysis. Purpose:?The aim of the study was to investigate differences in patient on home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, and conventional dialysis regarding quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence. Methods:?Questionnaires were used: Short Form (SF-36), Appraisal of Self-Care Agency (ASA-scale), and Sense of Coherence scale (SOC). 19 patients were included in the study (five patients on home hemodialysis, six self-care patients, and eight patients on conventional dialysis). Results:?The results showed a tendency of higher scores in quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence for the home hemodialysis patients. Conclusion:?Since the number of participants in this study was low, it is necessary to include more patients in a future study in order to verify the results.

AB  - Purpose:? To report our initial experience of using cutting balloons angioplasty in the treatment of resistant venous stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Materials and Methods:?Forty-eight patients with Brescia-Cimino fistulas underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 62 venous stenoses. Of these 48 patients, we encountered 8 venous stenoses (8/62, 12.9%) in 7 patients that were not successfully dilated with 6?8?mm high-pressure balloons inflated up to 24 atm. In each of 8 stenoses, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm were employed to dilate resistant stenoses. Results:?The locations of stenoses were 3 at the surgical vein mobilization site (?swing point?), 4 at the cephalic vein downstream from the anastomosis, and 1 at the cephalic arch. The grade of stenosis after high-pressure balloon angioplasty ranged from 57% to 87%(mean, 76%). Cutting balloons expanded completely in all stenoses and the residual stenosis after cutting balloon PTA ranged from 0% to 24%(mean, 7%). Residual stenosis was virtually nonexisistent at the 3 stenoses of ?swing point.? A focal rupture with a large hematoma occurred at the cephalic arch stenosis, which was treated by a stent placement. One minimal rupture that did not require any treatment occurred at the stenosis of downstream cephalic vein. No repeat angioplasty has been needed during follow-up period (range, 74?249 days). Conclusion:?Our early experience demonstrated that when high-pressure balloons fail to dilate stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm can be effectively used to overcome the resistance of stenoses.

AB  - Background/Aim:? Clinical presentation and complications of end-stage renal disesase (ESRD) patients are under influence of many enviromental and genetic factors. In this study we aimed to define frequencies of BsmI and TagI Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and possible influences on clinical presentations in Turkish ESRD population. Methodology and Patients:?186 patients (111 male, 75 female) who are being maintained on hemodialysis were included. Genotyping was performed for the insertion/deletion BsmI (B?b, restriction site, exon VIII?IX), TagI (T?t, 352 exon IX) VDR gene polymorphisms. Last 12 months? laboratory values (C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, Ca x P product) and clinical findings (vitamin D requirement, body weight) were recorded and analysed retrospectively. Results:?Mean age and follow-up period lengths were 42.1?±?12.6 years and 76.3?±?43.9 months, respectively. Polymorphism percentages were as follows: BsmI; BB/Bb/bb: 28.9/65.3/5.8%, TagI; TT/Tt/tt: 36.7/60.5/2.8%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that TT variant of TagI was related with hyperparathyroidism (p?<?0.05). Analysis of data after regrouping patients according to iPTH levels (0?249, 250?499, 500?+?pg/mL) and hemodialysis duration (<60 vs ≥60 months) revealed that influence of TT variation on hyperparathyroidism became more frequent in case of increased hemodialysis duration and iPTH levels (p?<?0.005). Conclusion:?TT variation of TagI VDR gene influences the development of hyperparathyroidism in HD patients. This influence becomes more evident in patients with longer HD duration.

AB  - Objective: Feasibility and safety evaluation of citrate anticoagulation for hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) procedure in a pediatric critical care unit. Patients and Methods:From 08?2002 to 12?2003, five patients were treated by CVVHD with regional citrate anticoagulation, age range 1.4?16?yrs, body weight 6.7?38?kg. Inclusion criteria: oligoanuria and hypervolemia and/or uremia, hemodynamic instability, and impossibility of peritoneal dialysis. The patient's primary diseases were: liver disease (4/5) and chronic renal disease (1/5). All patients were on mechanical ventilation and on vasopressor support and presented with thrombocytopenia. Hepatic dysfunction was observed in four patients. The CVVHD prescription was: blood flow rate: 2?5?ml/min, dialysate and replacement flow rate: 3000?ml/1.73?m2/h. Citrate regional anticoagulation (4% trisodium citrate) was used according to a previously described protocol (Bunchman et al., Pediatr Nephrol 2002: 17:150?154). The duration of each individual procedure was 9?72 hours, and the total time range of CVVHD was 2 to 19 days. A bicarbonate based solution (Na 140?mEq/L and bicarbonate 35?mEq/L) was prepared in our hospital pharmacy. Prisma system (GAMBRO) and polycrylonitrile M-60 Pre-set hemofilter was used in 4/5 patients and M-10 Pre-set hemofilter in one patient. Results:The use of M-10 filter was associated with a higher rates of ACD-A and calcium infusion (ml/h). Metabolic alkalosis was observed in one patient and hypernatremia in three patients. All patients died of causes other than renal failure (sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). No bleeding related to citrate occurred. Conclusion: Citrate anticoagulation proved to be feasible with minor side effects in pediatric ICU patients. The high mortality can be related to the severity of multiple organ failure.

AB  - Purpose:? This study evaluated improvements in dialyzer reuse parameters and clinical outcomes associated with a CQI project in a hospital-based dialysis center in which high flux polysulfone dialyzers were replaced with high flux Polyflux? dialyzers (GAMBRO? Renal Products). Methods:?Dialyzers were reprocessed using a Renatron? II Dialyzer Reprocessing System in conjunction with Renalin? sterilant (Minntech Corp.). Renalog? RM software was used to track dialyzer reprocessing rates and failures. Reasons for dialyzer failure included inadequate dialyzer volume; excess pressure; appearance; clotting during use; and maximum number of uses reached. The average number of dialyzer reuses with polysulfone dialyzers between January and June 2002 were compared to that achieved with Polyflux? dialyzers for the same periods in 2003 and 2004. Analysis periods were separated to avoid the impact of dialyzer transition on clinical parameters. Achievement of URR goals during these same periods was likewise compared. Results:?Transition from polysulfone to Polyflux? dialyzers was associated with a >40% increase in average number of reuses between 2002 and 2003 and a >63% increase comparing the 2002 and 2004 periods. During the 2002 analysis period with polysulfone dialyzers the target URR of 65% was achieved in approximately 75% of hemodialysis patients; this increased to nearly 95% with Polyflux? dialyzers in both the 2003 and 2004 periods, despite more reprocessing of these dialyzers. Conclusions:?These results demonstrate an improvement in both reuse efficiency and clinical outcomes associated with Polyflux dialyzers. Identifying clinical products through CQI studies that provide an economic and clinical advantage plays an important role in the success of hospital-based hemodialysis.
