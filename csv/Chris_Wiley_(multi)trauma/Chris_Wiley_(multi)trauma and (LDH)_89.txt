AB  - Objective:? This observational study was undertaken to evaluate the frequency of acute complications occurring during dialysis sessions and their association with other clinical and biochemical parameters. Method:?Forty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were selected and evaluated. Mean of the weekly evaluations of different parameters over a three-month period is presented here. Result:?Age of study subjects was 39?±?13 years and body mass index (BMI) 21?±?4?kg/m2. Duration of hemodialysis was 41?±?29 months. Most of the patients were hypertensive (98%), taking multiple anti-hypertensive drugs. Mean of the blood pressures before and at the end of dialysis sessions over the three month period were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 159?±?18 vs. 163?±?22 (p?<?0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 92?±?13 vs. 87?±?7?mmHg (p?<?0.003). Frequency of acute complicating symptoms during dialysis sessions were: headache (75%), rise in blood pressure (73%), leg cramps (67%), vomiting (60%), palpitation (58%), sweating (52%), and hypotension (35%). Raised blood pressure showed a positive correlation with headache (r?=?0.50, p?<?0.01) and sweating (r?=?0.53, p?<?0.05). Vomiting and palpitation were more frequent at low post-dialysis blood pressure (vomiting vs. post-SBP-r?=??0.41, p?<?0.05 and palpitation vs. post-DBP-r?=??0.48, p?<?0.05), and these patients were likely to get inadequate dialysis (hypotension vs. Kt/V-r?=??0.63, p?<?0.01). Pre and post dialysis weight variation was 53?±?11 vs. 51?±?11?kg (p?<?0.001), average ultrafiltration during dialysis (UF)?2.39 (0.5?4) liter and single session Kt/V was 0.95?±?0.38. The rising tendency of post-dialysis blood pressure correlated positively with increasing UF (SBP vs. UF-r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and DBP vs. UF-r?=?0.25, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:?From this study it may be concluded that acute complications during dialysis sessions have a significant correlation with deranged blood pressure regulation, and optimum control of blood pressure could provide better dialysis.

AB  - Hemodialysis is a common treatment of chronic renal failure, also in childhood. Due to the high standard of technique there are only few contraindications for this treatment at present. Limitations are given by the vessel access. But in the last years, hemodialysis has been made practicable by the permanent central venous catheter, however, with more problems. As an example for potential complications in the treatment with the permanent catheter we present an unusual case report about a twenty-one- year-old girl suffering from chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy, Prader-Willi- syndrome, myelonatrophia of undetermined origin with spastic diplegia of the legs, and increasing sphincter ani dysfunction. We started the renal replacement therapy when the girl was 15 years old. It was not possible to create an AV fistula due to very small vessels. Two Gore-Tex ? implants were clotted in absence of thrombophilia. Afterwards, the hemodialysis was performed by a permanent central venous catheter. The catheter had to be changed 15 times. The reasons for changing the catheter were problems of flow during hemodialysis due to clotting, dislocations, spontaneous removing of the catheter by herself, and infections. Altogether a sepsis occurred four times. The first transplantation failed due to a rupture of the transplanted kidney. A second transplantation was not possible because of the high BMI. Intermittently, the girl was treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the hospital, because the PD couldn?t be done at home due to different reasons. Only on weekends could the girl go home. The PD had to be finished after 6 months due to a severe psychotic syndrome. The girl died at age 21, caused by a sepsis following the 15th change of the catheter. A huge problem of frequent catheter changing is the limited availability of vessel accesses ? the limits of treatment by hemodialysis.

AB  - Copper (CU) deficiency, as reflected by a low serum CU and ceruloplasmin (CER) level, is a rare complication of chronic HD. When present, common clinical manifestations include anemia and neutropenia. Anecdotally, CU deficiency has been linked to the use of sevelamer hydrochloride (SH), a recently introduced phosphate binding agent. The finding of severe CU deficiency and rHuEPO-resistant anemia in 3 of our patients (pts) prompted a review of our entire pediatric HD population for the frequency of CU deficiency and its possible relationship to SH. An assessment of serum CU was conducted in 17 pts (male-11; mean age 169.4?+?49.6?mo) who had received HD for 21.5?+?33.9 months. All pts received three 4-hour HD sessions weekly with mean single-pool and equilibrated Kt/V values of 2.29?+?2.5 and 1.56?+?0.37, respectively. 14 of 17 (82%) pts had low serum CU levels with a mean value of 69.1?+?38.3?mcG/DL (normal?= 85?150?mcG/DL). 9 of 17 (53%) pts had values <60?mcG/DL and 3?pts had values <25?mcG/DL with CER values of 1.2?mg/dL, 0.6?mg/dL, and 1.8?mg/dL, respectively (normal?=?24?40?mg/dL). In the latter 3?pts, hemoglobin values fell to 5.4?gm/dL, 5.2?gm/dL, and 9.2?gm/dL despite regular rHuEPO dosing and adequate iron stores and all pts responded to supplemental CU therapy. The mean hemoglobin of the remaining 14?pts was 11.7?+?1.3?gm/dL. Whereas 13 of 14 (93%) CU deficient pts were receiving SH (142.1?+?112.3?mg/kg/d) for 331.0?+?293.6 days at the time of the CU assessment, there was no significant relationship demonstrated between the dose of SH or the duration of SH therapy and the serum CU level. In conclusion, CU deficiency appears to commonly occur in pediatric HD pts with extremely low values associated with profound anemia responsive to CU therapy. While the chronology of CU deficiency and the introduction of SH suggests an association, additional research is necessary to address this issue in a more definitive manner.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information exists on the use of any intravenous iron preparation in pediatric HD patients. This study was designed to describe the PK parameters of FG, now approved for use in children on HD. Methods:Iron-deficient pediatric HD pts (≤15?yr) were randomized to 2 doses of FG. Blood samples taken during a 1?hr infusion and at intervals over 48?hrs were analyzed for total iron, transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and FG-bound iron (FGI). Results:49% of pts were male, 88% white, 57% age 6?12?yr, wt 16.3?63.2?Kg, ht 100?177.5?cm. Mean serum iron concentrations (total iron and FGI) rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner, approximately proportional to the FG dose administered. A rapid rise in total serum iron was followed by a slower, less prominent rise in TBI. Single-dose PK of FGI was adequately described using non-compartmental analytical methods. A standard 2-compartment NONMEM model successfully fit the data and accurately described the time-course of FGI concentrations. Pharmacokinetic Parameter 1.5?mg/kg FG (n?=?22) 3.0?mg/kg FG (n?=?26) Cmax(mean?±?SD,?mcg/dL) 1287?±?285 ???2283?±?637 AUC0?48(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9327?±?4038 16,830?±?6526 AUC0?∞(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9499?±?4089 17,087?±?6776 Tmax(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???1.1?±?0.23 ???1.1?±?0.19 t1/2(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???2.0?±?0.7 ???2.5?±?1.8 Kel(mean?±?SD,?hr?1) ??0.43?±?0.30 ??0.39?±?0.27 Cl (mean?±?SD,?L/hr) ??0.69?±?0.50 ??0.66?±?0.52 Vd(mean?±?SD,?L) ???1.6?±?0.6 ???1.9?±?1.1 Conclusions: Cmax values in pediatric HD population were similar to Cmax values previously reported with similar FG doses in healthy iron-deficient adults (Ferrlecit? prescribing information). In contrast, mean AUC0?∞ values were approximately 2 times greater, and mean Cl rates were 5.4 times slower in pediatric pts.

AB  - In this paper we?ll discuss how change management affects hemodialysis improvement. As hemodialysis is a technology dependent method of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) treatment, it is obvious that the need of continuous revisions in health care practices and researches on staff training are significant factors for success. ?Change? defined as an attempt to replace existing knowledge with new. Change achievement is not always a simple procedure. In this study we examine nurses and patients reactions on changes and how can we accomplish successful changes every time they are needed. We also examine how changes in role of health care team can lead the team to our final destination, which is to provide the best hemodialysis treatment we can. Leadership, communication, informing, planning, and adjusting are the main contents for successful change management. We believe that we can improve haemodialysis practices and health care by giving learning opportunities to our nurses. Nursing training development can help them to follow changes. On the other hand we can get our patients to come on board with us on any change by encouragement and consistent try. As Hereticus said, ?Nothing that is, has to be just because it is.? Therefore, we should keep thinking about managing changes all the time!

AB  - Background:? Central venous stenosis in chronic hemodialysis patients occurs in about 17% of all venous stenosis and it is associated with central vein catheterization. We evaluated the effect of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?We retrospectively investigated the medical records of a total of 31 dialysis patients who had central venous stenosis. We reviewed the causes of central venous stenosis, clinical manifestations, venographic findings, and patency rate of radiological intervention. Results:?Of the total 31 patients, 28 patients had past history of central vein catheterization ipsilateral to vascular access. Mean duration of the catheterization was 32?±?14 days. Venography showed complete obstruction of central vein (n?=?14) and stenosis (n?=?17). The site of venous lesion was right subclavian vein (n?=?11), innominate vein (n?=?9), left subclavian vein (n?=?7), and superior vena cava (n?=?14). A total of 30 procedures of angioplasty with or without stenting were performed in 26 of 31 patients. Initial success rate was 96.1% and there was no severe complication such as rupture or bleeding. The primary patency rate at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after the procedure was 87.3%, 75.6%, 67.9%, and 65.4%, respectively. The cumulative patency rate at the same time point was 96.0%, 90.6%, 74.0%, and 72.8%, respectively. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that angioplasty with or without stenting is safe and effective in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Thrombolytic therapy is an important treatment modality for thrombosis-related catheter occlusion. Central venous access devices (CAVDs) are essential tools for the administration of many therapeutic modalities, especially for patients requiring lifetime therapy like hemodialysis. There are several reasons to salvage the occluded catheter. Catheter replacement results in an interruption of therapy delivery. This interruption may result in complications such as life-threatening metabolic and physiologic states. In addition, the patient's future access sites for CAVDs may be affected. The data released in the 2001 Annual Report ? ESRD Clinical Performance Measures Project (Department of Health and Human Services, December 2001) shows 17% of prevalent patients were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer. In the pediatric population the data shows that 31% were dialyzed with a chronic catheter. The most common reasons for catheter placement included: no fistula or graft created (42%) and fistula and graft were maturing, not ready to cannulate (17%). Five percent of patients were not candidates for fistula or graft placement as all sites had been exhausted. Methods:?A short study was done in our medical center to evaluate the results of t-PA vs. changing the tunnel catheter. On an average a catheter costs about $400.00. If you add the cost of specialty personnel such as an interventional radiologist, radiology technician, radiology nurse, and the ancillaries such as the room, sutures, gauze, and tape, the total could reach $2000.00 easily. Cathflo? Activase? costs around $60.00 for a single dose. T-PA was reconstituted by pharmacy personnel in single vials containing 2?mg/2?ml. Now with Cathflo, vials are stored in the renal clinic's refrigerator and when the need arises, the RN reconstitutes the medication. The RN, using established protocols, will instill Cathflo in the catheter following the volume requirements of the various tunnel catheters. After the t-PA is placed, the patient is sent home with instructions to return to their dialysis center the next day (arrangements are made by the RN as needed). In seventeen patients (17) with tunnel catheter malfunctions due to inadequate flow, not related to placement, t-PA was used. Of those 17 patients 2 were unable to use their catheter on their next dialysis treatment date, yielding an 88% success rate. This compares with clinical trials in which there is an 83% success rate with a dwell time of 4 hours, or an 89% rate on patients having a 2 hour dwell time (t-PA was repeated a second time if flow was not successfully restored. Results:?15/17 patients in our retrospective study showed that Cathflo worked successfully in restoring blood flow. Two catheters needed to be exchanged. The cost savings were significant when we compared the average cost of an exchange ($2000) versus using t-PA ($170 including nursing time). Conclusion:?Cathflo is not just safe and practical to use but also cost effective.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%

Examined 19 cases of patients with bleeding tendency, whether it is possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis by using PAES membrane, EVAL membrane, PS membrane, Cellulose triacetate membrane and Vitamin-E modified-dialysis membrane. Result:?With PAES membrane, the result showed a non- blockade rate of 91% after four hours and 100% after two hours. Therefore, blockade was prevented with a fairly high rate. In cases of blockade, most of them were possibly avoidable with a little contrivance as the reason were lack of establish blood flow rate, faulty position of a needle, etc. Conclusions:?By using PAES membrane, it was possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis. In order to completely have no blockade of blood lines in the future, we must strive further on.

AB  - The dialysis industry has become increasingly concerned about microbial contamination of reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Conventional membranes cannot be thoroughly sanitized due to the use of a peripheral seal which creates a stagnant area between the pressure vessel inner diameter and the membrane outer area. Cleaning procedures cannot adequately sanitize this annular area and control microbiological contamination. Sanitary full fit membranes ensure that a percentage of the feed water is free to bypass or flow around the outside of the membrane element to assure the annular area is continuously flushed and that there are no stagnant areas not exposed to CIP cleaning and sanitizing procedures. For this reason, the dairy industry has for many years used sanitary membranes, which are required by and approved by the USDA. Of the several full fit sanitary membranes available, the cage wrap, net wrap, and tail wrap, only the hard shell TurboCleanTM eliminates the inconsistent bypass flows inherent in the other designs, controlling the distribution of cleaning and sanitizing agents and providing better cleaning and lower microbial levels.

AB  - The number of patients treated for end-stage renal disease increases in Sweden like the rest of the world. During the last six years more than 1000 persons a year started renal replacement therapy. Today hemodialysis patients have the opportunity to choose different treatment modalities?home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, or conventional dialysis. Purpose:?The aim of the study was to investigate differences in patient on home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, and conventional dialysis regarding quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence. Methods:?Questionnaires were used: Short Form (SF-36), Appraisal of Self-Care Agency (ASA-scale), and Sense of Coherence scale (SOC). 19 patients were included in the study (five patients on home hemodialysis, six self-care patients, and eight patients on conventional dialysis). Results:?The results showed a tendency of higher scores in quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence for the home hemodialysis patients. Conclusion:?Since the number of participants in this study was low, it is necessary to include more patients in a future study in order to verify the results.

AB  - Purpose:? To report our initial experience of using cutting balloons angioplasty in the treatment of resistant venous stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Materials and Methods:?Forty-eight patients with Brescia-Cimino fistulas underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 62 venous stenoses. Of these 48 patients, we encountered 8 venous stenoses (8/62, 12.9%) in 7 patients that were not successfully dilated with 6?8?mm high-pressure balloons inflated up to 24 atm. In each of 8 stenoses, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm were employed to dilate resistant stenoses. Results:?The locations of stenoses were 3 at the surgical vein mobilization site (?swing point?), 4 at the cephalic vein downstream from the anastomosis, and 1 at the cephalic arch. The grade of stenosis after high-pressure balloon angioplasty ranged from 57% to 87%(mean, 76%). Cutting balloons expanded completely in all stenoses and the residual stenosis after cutting balloon PTA ranged from 0% to 24%(mean, 7%). Residual stenosis was virtually nonexisistent at the 3 stenoses of ?swing point.? A focal rupture with a large hematoma occurred at the cephalic arch stenosis, which was treated by a stent placement. One minimal rupture that did not require any treatment occurred at the stenosis of downstream cephalic vein. No repeat angioplasty has been needed during follow-up period (range, 74?249 days). Conclusion:?Our early experience demonstrated that when high-pressure balloons fail to dilate stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm can be effectively used to overcome the resistance of stenoses.

AB  - Background/Aim:? Clinical presentation and complications of end-stage renal disesase (ESRD) patients are under influence of many enviromental and genetic factors. In this study we aimed to define frequencies of BsmI and TagI Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and possible influences on clinical presentations in Turkish ESRD population. Methodology and Patients:?186 patients (111 male, 75 female) who are being maintained on hemodialysis were included. Genotyping was performed for the insertion/deletion BsmI (B?b, restriction site, exon VIII?IX), TagI (T?t, 352 exon IX) VDR gene polymorphisms. Last 12 months? laboratory values (C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, Ca x P product) and clinical findings (vitamin D requirement, body weight) were recorded and analysed retrospectively. Results:?Mean age and follow-up period lengths were 42.1?±?12.6 years and 76.3?±?43.9 months, respectively. Polymorphism percentages were as follows: BsmI; BB/Bb/bb: 28.9/65.3/5.8%, TagI; TT/Tt/tt: 36.7/60.5/2.8%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that TT variant of TagI was related with hyperparathyroidism (p?<?0.05). Analysis of data after regrouping patients according to iPTH levels (0?249, 250?499, 500?+?pg/mL) and hemodialysis duration (<60 vs ≥60 months) revealed that influence of TT variation on hyperparathyroidism became more frequent in case of increased hemodialysis duration and iPTH levels (p?<?0.005). Conclusion:?TT variation of TagI VDR gene influences the development of hyperparathyroidism in HD patients. This influence becomes more evident in patients with longer HD duration.

AB  - Objective: Feasibility and safety evaluation of citrate anticoagulation for hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) procedure in a pediatric critical care unit. Patients and Methods:From 08?2002 to 12?2003, five patients were treated by CVVHD with regional citrate anticoagulation, age range 1.4?16?yrs, body weight 6.7?38?kg. Inclusion criteria: oligoanuria and hypervolemia and/or uremia, hemodynamic instability, and impossibility of peritoneal dialysis. The patient's primary diseases were: liver disease (4/5) and chronic renal disease (1/5). All patients were on mechanical ventilation and on vasopressor support and presented with thrombocytopenia. Hepatic dysfunction was observed in four patients. The CVVHD prescription was: blood flow rate: 2?5?ml/min, dialysate and replacement flow rate: 3000?ml/1.73?m2/h. Citrate regional anticoagulation (4% trisodium citrate) was used according to a previously described protocol (Bunchman et al., Pediatr Nephrol 2002: 17:150?154). The duration of each individual procedure was 9?72 hours, and the total time range of CVVHD was 2 to 19 days. A bicarbonate based solution (Na 140?mEq/L and bicarbonate 35?mEq/L) was prepared in our hospital pharmacy. Prisma system (GAMBRO) and polycrylonitrile M-60 Pre-set hemofilter was used in 4/5 patients and M-10 Pre-set hemofilter in one patient. Results:The use of M-10 filter was associated with a higher rates of ACD-A and calcium infusion (ml/h). Metabolic alkalosis was observed in one patient and hypernatremia in three patients. All patients died of causes other than renal failure (sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). No bleeding related to citrate occurred. Conclusion: Citrate anticoagulation proved to be feasible with minor side effects in pediatric ICU patients. The high mortality can be related to the severity of multiple organ failure.

AB  - Purpose:? This study evaluated improvements in dialyzer reuse parameters and clinical outcomes associated with a CQI project in a hospital-based dialysis center in which high flux polysulfone dialyzers were replaced with high flux Polyflux? dialyzers (GAMBRO? Renal Products). Methods:?Dialyzers were reprocessed using a Renatron? II Dialyzer Reprocessing System in conjunction with Renalin? sterilant (Minntech Corp.). Renalog? RM software was used to track dialyzer reprocessing rates and failures. Reasons for dialyzer failure included inadequate dialyzer volume; excess pressure; appearance; clotting during use; and maximum number of uses reached. The average number of dialyzer reuses with polysulfone dialyzers between January and June 2002 were compared to that achieved with Polyflux? dialyzers for the same periods in 2003 and 2004. Analysis periods were separated to avoid the impact of dialyzer transition on clinical parameters. Achievement of URR goals during these same periods was likewise compared. Results:?Transition from polysulfone to Polyflux? dialyzers was associated with a >40% increase in average number of reuses between 2002 and 2003 and a >63% increase comparing the 2002 and 2004 periods. During the 2002 analysis period with polysulfone dialyzers the target URR of 65% was achieved in approximately 75% of hemodialysis patients; this increased to nearly 95% with Polyflux? dialyzers in both the 2003 and 2004 periods, despite more reprocessing of these dialyzers. Conclusions:?These results demonstrate an improvement in both reuse efficiency and clinical outcomes associated with Polyflux dialyzers. Identifying clinical products through CQI studies that provide an economic and clinical advantage plays an important role in the success of hospital-based hemodialysis.

AB  - In end-stage renal failure, impaired renal catabolism leads to retention of beta 2 microglobulin (ß2M), identified as the major constituent of hemodialysis (HD) related amyloidosis. It has been previously shown that, while using a high flux (HF) HD membrane, nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) with its increased time and frequency provides a much higher clearance of ß2M compared to conventional HD. We compared serum ß2M levels between low flux (LF) and HF in a group of 9 NHD patients who dialyse 8 hours 6 nights/week. Fresenius polysulfone LF membrane size F6-F8 HPS dialyser were used for the first 15 months (mth) of NHD (SA 1.3?1.8?m2). Subsequently, polysulfone HF FX80 dialyzer were used (SA 1.8?m2). Blood flow and dialysate flow rates were unchanged throughout the study. ß2M levels were measured at 6, 12, 15?mth on LF and at 6, 12?mth on HF. Albumin, homocysteine (Hcy), and phosphate (Phos) levels were also recorded at these times. ß2M levels trended upwards during the 15?mth on LF (36.6?±?10.57 at 6?mth vs 47.1?±?11.7 at 15?mth). On introduction of HF, there was a significant fall in ß2M at 6?mth to 12.4?±?3.5 (p?<?0.003), while ß2M levels were unchanged at 12?mth of HF. A downward trend in Hcy levels with the use of HF was noted (12.9?±?2.9 at 0?mth Vs 11.1?±?3.7 at 12?mth). Plasma albumin and Phos levels remained unchanged as did the use of Phos supplementation. Levels of ß2M continued to rise on NHD with LF, indicating inadequate clearance. With the introduction of HF there was a significant fall in ß2M levels consistent with improved clearance. The implications of this are that ß2M clearance may be time and frequency dependent only if dialyser membrane flux is adequate.

AB  - Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used in critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF). The survival of patients who require CRRT and the factors predicting their outcomes are not well defined. We sought to identify clinical features to predict survival in patients treated with CRRT. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received CRRT at the Toronto General Hospital during the year 2002. Our cohort (n?=?85) represented 97% of patients treated with this modality in 3 critical care units. We identified demographic variables, underlying diagnoses, transplantation status, location (medical-surgical, coronary or cardiovascular surgery intensive care units), CRRT duration, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl), and presence of oliguria (<400?ml/d) on the day of CRRT initiation. The principal outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Among those alive at discharge, we assessed whether there was an ongoing need for renal replacement therapy. Greater than one-third (38%, 32/85) of patients survived to hospital discharge. Three (9%) of the survivors remained dialysis-dependent at the time of discharge. Survivors were younger than non-survivors (mean age 56 vs 60?y.), were on CRRT for a shorter duration (7 vs 13?d.), and had a higher baseline CrCl (79 vs 68?ml/min). Patient survival varied among different critical care units (medical surgical 33%, coronary 38%, and cardiovascular surgery 45%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of CRRT, non-oliguria, and baseline CrCl?>?60?ml/min were independently associated with survival to hospital discharge (p?<?0.05). Critically ill patients with ARF who require CRRT continue to have high in-hospital mortality. A shorter period of CRRT dependence, non-oliguria, and higher baseline renal function may predict a more favorable prognosis. The majority of CRRT patients who survive their critical illness are independent from dialysis at the time of hospital discharge.

AB  - Purpose:? To analyze all patients who died while on hemodialysis from a single institution 1995?2004 and determine factors that influence duration on HD (months). Material and Methods: Review of the EMR from the dialysis unit for demographics, treatment parameters, cause of death, laboratory data. Two main groups those who stop dialysis (SHD) vs non stop dialysis (NSHD) data as mean and SD. Observations done at the start/mid/end of the period on dialysis by Kaplan Meier analysis. Results:?348 deaths, reported SMR for 2000?93(0.36,0.48,0.72,0.79), average comorbidity index 7.1?16.4; 49.1% male; age 67.6(12.3); 58.2% DM, 117(33.6%) stop dialysis. Detail analysis from 2000?2004; 187 deaths; 33.6% catheter, 41.1% AV graft at the time of death; 26% on no BP meds at the end, 64% 1?2 BP meds at the end.

AB  - Objective:? Blood-membrane interaction during hemodialysis may contribute to inflammatory process, which accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHD). Vitamin E has been widely used against oxidative stress in MHD. One of the strategies for the utilization of vitamin E in MHD patients is the usage of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer. We investigated the effects of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer on serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, the biomarker of inflammation, compared to polysulfone membrane dialyzer. Methods:?Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) and synthetic polysulfone dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) were manipulated in a crossover clinical study for 24 weeks in 10 non-diabetic MHD patients. Run-in and wash-out periods (Cellulose tri-acetate) were performed for 4 weeks before the treatment. Pre- and post-dialysis blood samples were taken at the begining and the end of each dialyzer period (12 weeks). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old. CRP and IL-6 levels were similarly increased after dialysis in both groups (4.8?±?0.7 and 37.2?±?9.4, respectively). The CRP and IL-6 level in vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer treatment were lower than in polysulfone treatment (5.0?±?1.2, p?<?0.008 and 67.2?±?12.4, p?<?0.04, respectively). Serum albumin, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count were not affected by types of dialyzer membrane. Conclusions:?In our study, hemodialysis stimulated the inflammation as the previous study. Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer may diminish the inflammatory process in MHD patients and may also prevent further atherosclerosis.
