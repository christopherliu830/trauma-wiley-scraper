AB  - Objective:? Hemodialysis (HD), hemofiltration (HF), hemodiafiltration (HDF), and acetate free biofiltration (AFB) are renal replacement therapy (RRT) methods in which impurities are removed from the blood extracorporeally. It has been suggested that HF, HDF, and AFB may have fewer cardiovascular side-effects than HD and may reduce incidence of dialysis-related amyloid- associated complications due to more effective removal of ?2-microglobulin. Methods:?We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these RRT modalities. Out of 1672 abstracts identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, 18 trials (588 patients) were included. Our comparisons were convective modalities (HF/HDF/AFB) vs HD (16 trials); HDF/AFB vs HF (no trials); and HDF vs AFB (2 trials). Data were extracted by two reviewers independently on mortality, hypotension episodes, dialysis sessions associated with ?adverse symptoms?(headache, nausea, and vomiting), hospital admissions, adequacy of dialysis, number of patients with amyloid related complications, ?2-microglobulin removal, and quality of life (QOL). Results:?No significant difference was found with regards to mortality, hospitalization, dialysis-related hypotension, dialysis-related symptoms, Kt/V, predialysis ?2-microglobulin values between convective modalities (HF/HDF/AFB) and HD, and HDF and AFB. Quality of life was assessed only in two studies comparing HF/HDF/AFB and HD. One study that used an unvalidated scoring tool showed that patients on convective modalities scored significantly better than those on HD; whereas, another study using a validated scoring system, the Kidney Diseases Questionnaire, failed to show significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions:?While this review summarized the best available evidence, it is based on very few trials. The trials included in this review are small and are therefore inadequately powered to detect differences between effects of the relevant treatments. Overall, HF, HDF, and AFB have not been shown to have significant advantage over HD with regard to clinically important outcomes of mortality, dialysis-related hypotension and manifestations of dialysis-related amyloidosis, and therefore, it is not possible to recommend the use of one modality in preference to the other.

AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Background:? Long slow hemodialysis (LS-HD) improves many biochemical parameters compared with conventional HD. However, its influences on quality of life are less well known. Aims:?The objective of this study was to examine the quality of life of patients on LS-HD performed overnight compared to the patients on standard hemodialysis. This extends the previous study, conducted in 2001, which examined the LS-HD patients, quality of life. Patients and methods:?We sent questionnaires to 12 LS-HD (overnight, treatment time 8?h???3/wk) patients and 15 day HD (4.5?h???3/wk) patients, all being treated using the limited care method. Data was collected using two different structured questionnaires. One was constructed for a previous study (2001) and the other one was a standardized set of questionnaires (RAND-36). Research material was collected from patient documents, such as the essential biochemical parameters, blood pressure, weight gain, and weekly EPO doses were recorded. Ten of the LS-HD patients (83%) and 13/15 (87%) of day HD patients returned the questionnaires. Three day hemodialysis patients returned empty questionnaires, which were disqualified. Results:?Based on the medical facts, the results showed that the patients of LS-HD felt better than the patients in another group. Patients on the LS-HD had higher Kt/V (2.623 vs. 1.577) and Hb (118 vs. 111) and lower Pi (1.36 vs. 1.63) and EPO dose (epoietin-beta 2667?ky/week vs. 5833?ky/week; darbepoetin 16?ky/week vs. 37?ky/week). However, their predialysis BP as well as the weight gain between treatments and salt and fluid balances caused problems furthermore. The experiences of the therapy of the LS-HD patients were more positive than of the control group: they felt their medical condition was better than of the patients on day HD. However we didn?t observe significant differences in the replies showing physical or psychosocial conditions between the two groups. Conclusions:?The study suggests that when patients can themselves make the choice between treatment modalities, it improves the quality of life of the patients. Control of anemia is improved in LS-HD overnight patients with lower doses of EPO. The LS-HD gives the patients more freedom of diet. However, more attention must be paid to salt and fluid restriction. The LS-HD makes it possible for many patients to work normally.

AB  - Purpose:? Identify practices to reduce HD catheter access related bacteremias (ARB). Methods:?Data was collected per the CDC Dialysis Surveillance Network protocol. ARB was defined as a patient with a positive blood culture with no apparent source other than the vascular access catheter. ARB's were calculated in events per 100 patient months with 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 was observed for 12 months, Cohort 2 for the subsequent 10 months, and Cohort 3 for the final 10 months. Cohort 1 had weekly transparent dressing changes, cleansing of the skin and 5 minute soaking of the connection lines with 10% povidone-iodine (PI) solution, and HCW use of clean gloves and face shield without a mask. Cohort 2 changes consisted of thrice weekly gauze dressing changes, skin cleansing with ChloraPrep, a 2% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol applicator, masks on the patients, adding a face mask to the shield, and application of 10% PI ointment to the exit site. Cohort 3 changes included weekly application of BioPatch (BioP), an antimicrobial dressing with CHG, sterile glove use, and replacing the PI line soaks with 4% CHG. Results:?The catheter-associated ARB rate per 100 patient months was 7.9 (17ARB/216 patient months) in Cohort 1, 8.6 (13/151) in Cohort 2, and 4.7 (5/107) in Cohort 3(p?=?0.31 compared with Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). During the last 2 months, in Cohort 3, 9 catheter lumen cracks occurred, with one of the patients having a bacteremia. Conclusions:?Addition of CHG line soaks and BioP reduced tunneled catheter infections, although this is not statistically significant. The increased number of catheter lumen cracks raises concern with the use of CHG line soaks. Further investigation with use of CHG line soaks and the BioP for decreasing ARB is needed.

AB  - While dialyzer manufacturers only provide information about their products as a black box, this study aimed at optimizing dialyzer geometry by looking in detail at transport processes and fluid properties inside the dialyzer using numerical modeling. A three-dimensional computer model of a single hollow fiber with its surrounding membrane and dialysate compartment was developed. Different equations govern blood and dialysate flow (Navier-Stokes), radial filtration flow (Darcy), and solute transport (convection-diffusion). Blood was modeled as a non- Newtonian fluid with a viscosity varying in radial and axial direction because of the influence of local hematocrit, diameter of the capillaries, and local shear rate. Dialysate flow was assumed as an incompressible, laminar Newtonian flow with a constant viscosity. The permeability characteristics of the asymmetrical polysulphone membrane were calculated from laboratory tests for forward and backfiltration. The influence of the oncotic pressure induced by the plasma proteins was implemented as well as the reduction of the overall permeability caused by the adhesion of a protein layer on the membrane. Urea (MW60) was used as a marker to simulate small molecule removal, while middle molecule transport was modeled using vitamin B12 (MW1355) and inulin (MW5200). The corresponding diffusion coefficients were determined by counting for the fluid and membrane characteristics. Fiber diameter and length were changed in a wide range for evaluation of solute removal efficiency. The presented model allowed us to investigate the impact of flow, hematocrit, and capillary dimensions on the presence and localization of backfiltration. Furthermore, mass transfer was found enhanced for increased fiber lengths and/or smaller diameters, most pronounced for the middle molecules compared to urea.

AB  - Scanty data suggests that large solutes show a kinetic behavior that is different from urea. The question investigated in this study is whether other small water-soluble solutes such as some guanidino compounds show a kinetic behavior comparable or dissimilar to that of urea. This study included 7 stable conventional hemodialysis patients without residual diuresis undergoing low flux polysulphone dialysis (F8 and F10HPS). Blood samples were collected from the inlet and outlet blood lines before the dialysis session, after 5, 15, 30, 120 minutes, and immediately after discontinuation of the session. Plasma concentrations of urea, creatinine (CTN), creatine (CT), guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), guanidine (G), and methylguanidine (MG) were used to calculate corresponding dialyzer clearances. A two-pool kinetic model was fitted to the measured plasma concentration profiles, resulting in the calculation of the perfused volume (V1), the total distribution volume (Vtot), and the inter-compartmental clearance (K12); solute generation and ultrafiltration were determined independently. No significant differences were observed between V1 and K12 for urea (6.4?±?3.3?L and 822?±?345?mL/min) and for the guanidino compounds. However, with respect to Vtot, GSA was distributed in a smaller volume (30.6?±?4.2?L) compared to urea (42.7?±?6.0?L???P?<?0.001), while CTN, CT, GAA, G, and MG showed significantly larger volumes (54.0?±?5.9?L, 98.0?±?52.3?L, 123.8?±?66.9?L, 89.7?±?21.4?L, and 102.6?±?33.9?L, respectively). These differences resulted in markedly divergent effective solute removal: 67%(urea), 58%(CTN), 42%(CT), 76%(GSA), 37%(GAA), 43%(G), and 42%(MG). In conclusion, the kinetics of the guanidino compounds under study are different from that of urea; hence, urea kinetics are not representative for the removal of other uremic solutes, even if they are small and water-soluble like urea.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemoperfusion, with or without hemodialysis, has been used to treat patients suffering from severe valproic acid poisoning. We report a patient suffering from severe valproic acid intoxication who was treated effectively with high-flux hemodialysis alone. Case:?A 20-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted after having ingested unknown amounts of valproic acid (Depakote?), prednisone, and erythromycin. He was agitated and obtunded but hemodynamically stable initially. Serum valproic acid level was 1,028??g/mL. Urine toxicology screen as well as serum levels of ethanol, acetaminophen, and acetylsalicylic acid levels were negative. A gastric lavage was followed by activated charcoal instillation. Subsequent myoclonic twitchings that progressed to continuous seizure activity were managed with intravenous lorazepam therapy and endotracheal intubation. Serum valproic acid value measured two hours after admission remained elevated at 1,046??g/mL. Hemodialysis was performed continuously for 10.5 hours using a high-flux, polysulfone dialyzer (Polyflux 21S, Fresenius Medical Care, Lexington, MA), a dialyzer blood flow of 200?300?mL/min, and a dialysate flow of 500?mL/min. The therapy brought about a fall in serum valproic acid level to 110??g/mL and a complete recovery of the patient. Discussion:?Valproic acid (144 Dalton) is 90?95% protein-bound at therapeutic serum values. However, in the face of an overdose, the unbound fraction rises because of saturation of protein-binding sites. This unbound fraction is readily dialyzable. We suggest that high-flux hemodialysis is effective in the treatment of severe valproic acid poisoning.

AB  - One of the basic symptoms of a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. From everything, used methods of correction of an anemia, it is considered the most effective application of preparations recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Since 1994 in the Scientific Centre of Surgery begins application r-Hu EPO. Application r-Hu EPO in patients with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of cases had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patients have intolerance to erythropoietin, that has induced to search of new effective methods of correction of anemia. During research were determined quantity erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte in peripheral blood and acid-alkaline condition of blood. All hematology parameters were defined at the beginning of treatment, over 5 day and for 15 day of stimulation of a bone marrow. For 15 days after stimulation of a bone marrow by the laser there was an authentic increase of quantity erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit. The initial contents erythrocytes made 2.22?±?0.1 10???12, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/l and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During treatment by the laser parameters erythrocytes have increased up to 2.9?±?0.8 10???12, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/l and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3%(P?<?0,005). Hematology parameters in blood of control group authentically have not changed.

AB  - Background:? Insulin resistance has been associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, central obesity, and dyslipidemia, all of which are important risk factors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A greater degree of insulin resistance may predispose to renal injury by worsening renal hemodynamics through the elevation of glomerular filtration fraction. However, there are sparse data on the relationship between insulin resistance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and total body fat or phase angle in CKD without diabetes. Methods:?We examined 84 non-diabetes CKD patients according to the K/DOQI definitions; only 79 patients were enrolled into the study (GFR between 15 and 90?ml/min/1.73?m2). The value of insulin resistance was obtained by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed to determine the percentage of total body fat or phase angle. GFR was calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances. Results:?The correlation analysis showed that HOMA-insulin resistance was positively correlated with phase angle (r?=?0.35, P?<?0.01), percentage of total body fat (r?=?0.27, P?<?0.01), body mass index (r?=?0.48, P?<?0.01) and serum triglyceride levels (r?=?0.32, P?<?0.01), but not significantly correlated with gender (r?=??0.07, P?>?0.05), age (r?=?0.05, P?>?0.05), GFR (r?=??0.006, P?>?0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure (r?=?0.11, P?>?0.05). Conclusion:?In non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients, the major risk factor for insulin resistance is the amount of total body fat. The insulin level is not dependent on the GFR in these patients.

AB  - Regulation of phosphate (PO4) in hemodialysis patients is very difficult and ideal levels are rarely maintained. A high removal and a normal phosphate level is important, as high and low levels are both associated with morbidity and a very high mortality. We studied phosphate dynamics and its relation to other small ?uremic? molecules in 48 patients by measuring pre- and postdialysis levels and all removed phosphate, urea and creatinine (creat) in all dialysate during 455 dialyses done at different frequencies (freq): 3.7?±?1.2, range 3?6 treatments per week and durations of dialysis (t): mean: 196?±?95, range 80?560?min and with high (HF) and low flux membranes. Kt/V-PO4, Kt/V-urea and Kt/V-creat, volumes (Vr) for all solutes and their relationships to frequency and duration of dialysis, urea clearance and predialysis phosphate were calculated. Factor/solute: PO4 Urea-N Creatinine Predialysis mg/dl 5.7?±?1.9 73?±?24 12?±?3 Postdialysis mg/dl 3.0?±?1.0 33?±?15 6?±?2 100???Vr/BW 63?±?78 58?±?24 41?±?15 Kt/V 1.01?±?0.66 1.04?±?0.32 0.97?±?0.26 Weekly stdKt/V 1.75?±?0.81 2.12?±?0.68 1.96?±?0.71 Removed gm/week 3.1?±?1.3 56?±?23 6.2?±?2.5 Vr?=?removed solute?÷?(predialysis minus postdialysis concentration.); BW?=?body weight. Uf?=?ultrafiltration. Results: Vr as a percentage of BW for PO4 was dependent on predialysis PO4 and rose steeply as predialysis PO4 decreased: Vr% BW?=?212???88???ln (predialysis PO4), (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.0001). There was no such relationship for Vr for urea or creatinine and no relation between urea and PO4 Vr, (r?=?0.07, p?=?0.141). In stepwise multiple regression analysis: Mg PO4 removed per week?=?t???6.5?+?freq???387?+?Uf???140?+?pre-PO4???273?+?PO4 stdKt/V???343???HF???375???1824, (r?=?0.73, p?<?0.0001). Blood flow(QB) and dialysate flow (QD), urea weekly stdKt/V were not significant variables in the model. Pre-dialysis PO4?=?6.8???Hrs/week???0.07???QB???0.003?+?Uf??? 0.26. QD, membrane type or dialyses/week did not enter the model. Only patients dialyzing>28 hrs/week could stop phosphate binders within 3 weeks. Conclusions:?Phosphate shows a highly variable dynamic during dialysis. Apparently, the body maintains extracellular PO4 concentration by releasing PO4 from unknown compartments when the blood concentration of PO4 decreases. Vr for phosphate thus varies not only from patient to patient but also in a patient, depending on blood concentration of PO4. Kt/V for urea and creatinine are inaccurate in describing PO4 removal. To remove PO4 efficiently it is most important to use long and daily dialysis. QB, QD and membrane type are relatively unimportant in phosphate removal.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - Currently there is no published data using the Cannon catheter. Our purpose was to confirm adequacy of hemodialysis using the Arrow Cannon catheter. This retrospective study used patients from one nephrology practice, utilizing two dialysis centers. All patients in a two year period meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria referred for tunneled catheter placement were included. All catheters were placed by interventional nephrologist using ultrasound for vein cannulation and fluoroscopy for placement confirmation. Pump speed (Qb), venous and arterial pressures, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and dialysis prescriptions/adherence to the prescription were reviewed at baseline and monthly for six months. Catheter removal or six months were the study endpoints. Complications were evaluated from time of insertion throughout the study period. 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated in the outpatient setting. Insertion outcome was successful in all 38 patients. The average dialysis prescription was approximately 400?ml/min, 3.7 hours, and 3 days a week. The mean average pump speed for all months evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline of 300?ml/min. by 67.9?101.4?ml/min. The differences were significant with p?<?0.01. The mean Kt/V and URR% data for each month evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline values of 1.2 for Kt/V and 63% for URR% by between .34?.24 and 8%?10%, respectively; the differences were all at a significant level with p?<?0.01. Mean arterial pressures for all months evaluated ranged from ?218.6 to ?238.1, and venous pressures averaged between 179.8 to 213.7. Only three patients experienced late complications (all of which were infections) and no patients required hospitalization post complication. Two were bacteremic; the other had tunnel infection without positive blood cultures. This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the adequacy of hemodialysis with the Cannon catheter. Our study showed that flow rates and adequacy of hemodialysis can be reached using the Cannon catheter, with minimal complications.

AB  - In end-stage renal failure, impaired renal catabolism leads to retention of beta 2 microglobulin (ß2M), identified as the major constituent of hemodialysis (HD) related amyloidosis. It has been previously shown that, while using a high flux (HF) HD membrane, nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) with its increased time and frequency provides a much higher clearance of ß2M compared to conventional HD. We compared serum ß2M levels between low flux (LF) and HF in a group of 9 NHD patients who dialyse 8 hours 6 nights/week. Fresenius polysulfone LF membrane size F6-F8 HPS dialyser were used for the first 15 months (mth) of NHD (SA 1.3?1.8?m2). Subsequently, polysulfone HF FX80 dialyzer were used (SA 1.8?m2). Blood flow and dialysate flow rates were unchanged throughout the study. ß2M levels were measured at 6, 12, 15?mth on LF and at 6, 12?mth on HF. Albumin, homocysteine (Hcy), and phosphate (Phos) levels were also recorded at these times. ß2M levels trended upwards during the 15?mth on LF (36.6?±?10.57 at 6?mth vs 47.1?±?11.7 at 15?mth). On introduction of HF, there was a significant fall in ß2M at 6?mth to 12.4?±?3.5 (p?<?0.003), while ß2M levels were unchanged at 12?mth of HF. A downward trend in Hcy levels with the use of HF was noted (12.9?±?2.9 at 0?mth Vs 11.1?±?3.7 at 12?mth). Plasma albumin and Phos levels remained unchanged as did the use of Phos supplementation. Levels of ß2M continued to rise on NHD with LF, indicating inadequate clearance. With the introduction of HF there was a significant fall in ß2M levels consistent with improved clearance. The implications of this are that ß2M clearance may be time and frequency dependent only if dialyser membrane flux is adequate.

AB  - Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used in critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF). The survival of patients who require CRRT and the factors predicting their outcomes are not well defined. We sought to identify clinical features to predict survival in patients treated with CRRT. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received CRRT at the Toronto General Hospital during the year 2002. Our cohort (n?=?85) represented 97% of patients treated with this modality in 3 critical care units. We identified demographic variables, underlying diagnoses, transplantation status, location (medical-surgical, coronary or cardiovascular surgery intensive care units), CRRT duration, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl), and presence of oliguria (<400?ml/d) on the day of CRRT initiation. The principal outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Among those alive at discharge, we assessed whether there was an ongoing need for renal replacement therapy. Greater than one-third (38%, 32/85) of patients survived to hospital discharge. Three (9%) of the survivors remained dialysis-dependent at the time of discharge. Survivors were younger than non-survivors (mean age 56 vs 60?y.), were on CRRT for a shorter duration (7 vs 13?d.), and had a higher baseline CrCl (79 vs 68?ml/min). Patient survival varied among different critical care units (medical surgical 33%, coronary 38%, and cardiovascular surgery 45%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of CRRT, non-oliguria, and baseline CrCl?>?60?ml/min were independently associated with survival to hospital discharge (p?<?0.05). Critically ill patients with ARF who require CRRT continue to have high in-hospital mortality. A shorter period of CRRT dependence, non-oliguria, and higher baseline renal function may predict a more favorable prognosis. The majority of CRRT patients who survive their critical illness are independent from dialysis at the time of hospital discharge.

AB  - Objective:? Blood-membrane interaction during hemodialysis may contribute to inflammatory process, which accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHD). Vitamin E has been widely used against oxidative stress in MHD. One of the strategies for the utilization of vitamin E in MHD patients is the usage of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer. We investigated the effects of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer on serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, the biomarker of inflammation, compared to polysulfone membrane dialyzer. Methods:?Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) and synthetic polysulfone dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) were manipulated in a crossover clinical study for 24 weeks in 10 non-diabetic MHD patients. Run-in and wash-out periods (Cellulose tri-acetate) were performed for 4 weeks before the treatment. Pre- and post-dialysis blood samples were taken at the begining and the end of each dialyzer period (12 weeks). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old. CRP and IL-6 levels were similarly increased after dialysis in both groups (4.8?±?0.7 and 37.2?±?9.4, respectively). The CRP and IL-6 level in vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer treatment were lower than in polysulfone treatment (5.0?±?1.2, p?<?0.008 and 67.2?±?12.4, p?<?0.04, respectively). Serum albumin, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count were not affected by types of dialyzer membrane. Conclusions:?In our study, hemodialysis stimulated the inflammation as the previous study. Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer may diminish the inflammatory process in MHD patients and may also prevent further atherosclerosis.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to observe the anticoagulant effect of the new type of citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate in renal failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Methods:?57 patients at high risk of bleeding were given hemodialysis for 4 hours and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures: Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate. Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysate and with no anticoagulant. Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and with nadroparin calcium (a low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) as anticoagulant. Bleeding complication, coagulation of extracorporeal circuit, venous blood pressure, heart rate, QTC, activated coagulation time (ACT), ionized-calcium (iCa++), total calcium and pH, , Na+, K+, Cl?, BUN, Cr, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the blood cell counts were monitored during hemodialysis, and a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of thrombus formation and cellular aggregation on the interior surface of hemodialysis membranes. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous blood pressure increased continuously, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 4 out of 19 patients. Hemodialysis for 4 hours in Group 2 were all successfully fulfilled. No bleeding episodes occurred. No severe clotting of dialyzers and blood accesses was observed. ACT was extended and iCa++ decreased obviously in the venous line, but ACT and iCa++ in vivo were normal. pH, tended to increase but not to metabolic alkalosis levels. Na+, K+, Cl?, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the counts of blood cells were all within the normal range. There was no severe thrombus observed by SEM in the hollow fibers. In Group 3, severe bleeding complication happened to 3 out of 19 patients, and one of them died. ACT was extended obviously at the arterial end. Conclusions:?The citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate was proved to be practical, safe and effective. So it is indicated for patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus.
