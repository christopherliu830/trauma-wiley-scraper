AB  - Objective:? Blood-membrane interaction during hemodialysis may contribute to inflammatory process, which accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHD). Vitamin E has been widely used against oxidative stress in MHD. One of the strategies for the utilization of vitamin E in MHD patients is the usage of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer. We investigated the effects of vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer on serum C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, the biomarker of inflammation, compared to polysulfone membrane dialyzer. Methods:?Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) and synthetic polysulfone dialyzer (1.5-m2 surface area) were manipulated in a crossover clinical study for 24 weeks in 10 non-diabetic MHD patients. Run-in and wash-out periods (Cellulose tri-acetate) were performed for 4 weeks before the treatment. Pre- and post-dialysis blood samples were taken at the begining and the end of each dialyzer period (12 weeks). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were examined. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old. CRP and IL-6 levels were similarly increased after dialysis in both groups (4.8?±?0.7 and 37.2?±?9.4, respectively). The CRP and IL-6 level in vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer treatment were lower than in polysulfone treatment (5.0?±?1.2, p?<?0.008 and 67.2?±?12.4, p?<?0.04, respectively). Serum albumin, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count were not affected by types of dialyzer membrane. Conclusions:?In our study, hemodialysis stimulated the inflammation as the previous study. Vitamin E-coated membrane dialyzer may diminish the inflammatory process in MHD patients and may also prevent further atherosclerosis.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to observe the anticoagulant effect of the new type of citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate in renal failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Methods:?57 patients at high risk of bleeding were given hemodialysis for 4 hours and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures: Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate. Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysate and with no anticoagulant. Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and with nadroparin calcium (a low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) as anticoagulant. Bleeding complication, coagulation of extracorporeal circuit, venous blood pressure, heart rate, QTC, activated coagulation time (ACT), ionized-calcium (iCa++), total calcium and pH, , Na+, K+, Cl?, BUN, Cr, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the blood cell counts were monitored during hemodialysis, and a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of thrombus formation and cellular aggregation on the interior surface of hemodialysis membranes. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous blood pressure increased continuously, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 4 out of 19 patients. Hemodialysis for 4 hours in Group 2 were all successfully fulfilled. No bleeding episodes occurred. No severe clotting of dialyzers and blood accesses was observed. ACT was extended and iCa++ decreased obviously in the venous line, but ACT and iCa++ in vivo were normal. pH, tended to increase but not to metabolic alkalosis levels. Na+, K+, Cl?, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the counts of blood cells were all within the normal range. There was no severe thrombus observed by SEM in the hollow fibers. In Group 3, severe bleeding complication happened to 3 out of 19 patients, and one of them died. ACT was extended obviously at the arterial end. Conclusions:?The citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate was proved to be practical, safe and effective. So it is indicated for patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to survival of patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Data were collected from 8 dialysis centers, and 432 patients were recruited. Among them, patients who underwent hemodialysis thrice a week for more than 3 years and received antihypertensive therapy or had systolic blood pressure of more than 160?mm Hg before dialysis secession were selected. Subsequent survival status and cause of death were ascertained for the next 3.5 years. The logistic multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of death. Variables used for the purpose of this analysis were patient gender, age, underlying renal disease (unknown and others (0), CGN (1), DM (2)), medication, serum albumin, history of having cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular accidents (yes or no), the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hemoglobin, serum calcium and inorganic phosphate, ?2-microglobulin, intact PTH, and other laboratory data. Results:?First step logistic regression analysis indicated age, underlying renal diseases, serum creatinine, GOT, ?2-microglobulin were associated with increased relative risk (RR) of dying. According to the formula calculated in this analysis, if the levels of serum creatinine increased 1?mg/dl, the ratio of dying increased by 1.210. Also, compared to the patients aged between 50 to 64 years old, the patients aged between 65 to 90 years old had 1.521 times dying ratio. Conclusions:?From this study, it is suggested that age, creatinine, underlying renal diseases, ?2-microblobulin, past history of cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and GOT were important factors contributing to patients? survival.

AB  - There are limited data on demographics, long-term follow-up, and iron/rHuEPO requirements of hemodialysis (HD) patients in Turkey. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of the HD duration, primary illness, blood pressure, and age on serum albumin, CRP, blood pressure, iron/rHuEPO requirements, PTH, and HCV positivity of HD patients. 703 patients (280 women, 423 men, aged 47.8?±?15.5 years) from 4 HD units were included and grouped according to the duration on HD. The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data of the last 3 months for each patient were recorded retrospectively. When the groups were compared, patients with a longer HD duration were younger and percentage of diabetic patients decreased as the duration increased. Serum albumin and CRP levels were similar between the groups. When the groups were compared according to the blood pressure profiles, after the 5th year, a decline in the systolic blood pressures was observed. Diastolic blood pressures were similar across the years. There was no significant difference in need of antihypertensive medicines. Iron requirements showed a fall after the 5th year, and an increase in after the 10th year. There was a decline in the hematocrit levels by the duration on HD but there was no change in rHuEPO requirements over the years. Parathyroid hormone levels and HCV positivity tended to increase across the years. Our results revealed that during the first 10 years, age, etiology (diabetes, hypertension), and blood pressure control seemed to be important factors affecting survival. Whereas, after the 10th year, patients seemed to be more prone to the long-term complications of HD, such as HCV infection, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - The most common complication of tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters is catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), which contributes to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Gram positive microorganisms are the most common etiologic agents; coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species are the two most prevalent strains in our center. These are the common inhabitants of skin flora, suggesting that infection of catheters occur through the exit site. The Biopatch is a chlorhexidine impregnated dressing designed to keep the exit site from colonization with skin flora. This may decrease the incidence of CRB due to organisms from the skin. Objective:?To investigate whether the application of the biopatch at the exit site has any effect on the incidence and the etiology of CRB. Methods:?Chart review of 63 pediatric chronic hemodialysis patients who were dialysed between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. The mean age at start of hemodialysis was 13.9?±?4.6 years. The pre-Biopatch era started in January 1999 till the end of June 2001, and the Biopatch era started in July 2001 to December 2003. Biopatch was applied at the beginning of every dialysis week after Betadine cleansing of the exit site, which was then covered with a transparent dressing. In the pre-Biopatch era, the exit site was cleansed with Betadine at every dialysis session and then covered with a transparent dressing. Results:?The use of the Biopatch at the exit site caused a significant decrease in the exit site infections. However, contrary to what was expected, there was no decrease in the incidence of CRB. Pre-Biopatch Era Biopatch Era p value Gram positive infections % 76% 76% NS Gram negative infections % 10% 14% NS Polymicrobial infections % 14% 10% NS Total number of infections 108 (19 patients) 143 (29 patients) NS Exit site infections-number 20 (9 patients) 5 (3 patients) p?<?0.05 Conclusion:? The use of the Biopatch decreases exit site infections. However, it fails to decrease the incidence of CRB. It has no effect on the etiologic agent of the bacterial infection.

AB  - When you are working with home HD education you often meet patients who are very afraid of the moment when they are going to puncture the fistula themselves. Our experience is that the patient sometimes can?t concentrate on anything but this moment. For this reason we let the patient try to puncture as soon as possible. We also get many questions from colleges, doctors, and nurses on how to do it. Most of the patients are very successful and prefer to puncture themselves after having tried it. They say that it is less painful if you puncture yourself and we also have a feeling that it is very rare that they are unsuccessful. To get proof for these feelings we made a small inquiry among our patients, asking about how it is to puncture yourself. We sent the inquiry to 30 patients. We also decided to make a film showing how to puncture yourself. We asked some of our home HD patients if they wanted to contribute. The result of this is a video, which is 9?min long, showing how to puncture in different types of fistulas, underarm, overarm, and grafts.

AB  - The increase in number of obese people seen in the general population, is also what is seen in the hemodialyzed population. It is generally believed that the location of deep forearm vessels in the subcutaneous fat tissue makes primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) a disadvantage because of difficulties in vessel puncturing. For obese patients, it is suggested that a fistula with PTFE is created or a central catheter inserted, but these solutions increase already high morbidity rate and significantly increase mortality rate. Methods:?The deep location of veins situated on the anterior part of the forearm involved 57 patients (45 female and 12 male) aged 13?87 years (mean 67?±?15.2 years). Patients? body mass index (BMI) ranged from 29.1 to 53.73 (mean 34.6?±?7.8). The causes of the renal failure were diabetic nephropathy in 30 patients, chronic glomerulonephritis in 4, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 5, lupus nephritis in 2, interstitial nephritis in 4, primary amyloidosis in 1, polycystic kidney disease in 3, and unknown in 3 patients.Two-step surgical procedure was performed in all patients. In the first stage, the standard distal radiocephalic AVF in the wrist region was created. In case of its failure, the next attempt was performed above the point of the first intervention. In the second stage, superficialization of the venous part of AVF was performed in the mode described by us (Kidney 2002;.1:1170). Results:?The first stage of the procedure was successful in 46 patients. In 6 cases it was necessary to perform a second attempt, and 2 cases required three operations. The second stage was undertaken in all of these patients (n?=?54), and complete success was achieved in 51. In 3 cases, in spite of superficialization, AVF was not suitable for puncturing because of poor blood flow. The causes of failure of the first stage procedure in 2 patients were severe arteriosclerosis and venous anomaly. All patients had non-altered cephalic veins in the wrist region, as opposed to patients with cannulated veins. In 51?pts (90%) an efficient flow of the blood through AVF was successfully obtained and allowed satisfactory dialyses. Conclusions:?The primary AVF creation on the forearm is feasible in 90% of obese patients. This result is similar to the general population of chronic renal disease patients of our center (95%)(NDT 1998;13:527) and is possible thanks to the location of the veins deep in the subcutaneous fat tissue, which protects against repeated cannulation and hence mechanical destruction in the pre-dialysis period.

AB  - Introduction:? Vascular access failure is one of the greatest sources of morbidity for chronic hemodialysis patients. Prophylactic and repeated measurement of access flow may be of importance in preventing clotting. The aim of the study was therefore to analyse the cost effectiveness of a shunt surveillance program, which reduces the appearance of occlusion of the vascular access. Methods: The number of vascular access interventions (surgery and radiology) in the period 2001 till 2003 (transonic measurement period, TMP; 63 patients) was compared with a reference period (RP, 1996 till 1998) during which no access flow was measured (58 patients). All measurements were done with Transonic? and interventions according to K/DOQI. Results:?During the RP, 123 vascular access operations (0.71 per patient year) were performed because of occlusion, whereas in the TMP 58 vascular access operations (0.3 per patient year) were performed. During the TMP, 298 angiographic measurements were performed (1.6 per patient year) in the RP 177, (1.0 per patient year). In the TMP, 1652 access flow measurements were performed. In order to prevent one shunt occlusion, 21 access flow measurements had to be performed. Total costs in the TMP (summary of angiography, angiography and PTA, hospitalization days, and operation costs) are reduced with 31% compared to the RP; costs per patient year in RP: ?2315. Costs per patient year in TMP: ?1606. Conclusion:?By means of a shunt surveillance program (based on access flow measurement), if necessary followed by angiography, it is possible to reduce the number of acute vascular access occlusions. Although a shunt surveillance program may take up a lot of time for the nursing staff, the beneficial effects, lower costs, and reduced morbidity for the patients outweigh this effort.

AB  - Purpose:? The use of tunneled, cuffed central venous catheters for hemodialysis is associated with poor flow, thrombosis, and infections due to the transcutaneous nature of these devices. A new design for a sutureless, tunneled cuffed catheter was evaluated in hemodialysis patients to determine the effect of its design on the incidence of exit site infection. Methods:?A polyurethane conduit with a uniquely designed cuff and subcutaneous skirt covered with Dacron velour was attached to standard double lumen central venous catheters. Seven (7) Ash catheters and one (1) Tesio catheter were fitted with the overtube and skirt and implanted in eight (8) patients undergoing routine hemodialysis. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, bacteremia, cuff extrusion, and serosanguineous exudate. Results:?Catheters were implanted for 6 to 26 weeks. All catheters remained patent and no cases of bacteremia were observed. There was no evidence of exit site or tunnel infection, and no reported serosanguineous exudate from the exit site. Exit site care consisted of soap and water cleansing by the patient. Patients were able to shower or bathe 4 weeks post-implant. Conclusions:?The new design for a subcutaneous cuff and skirt appears to inhibit exit site infection and other common complications of central venous catheters.

AB  - Objective:? To observe the factors that affect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber when using citrate hemodialysate. Methods:?By modeling hemodialysis in vitro, we studied 6 types of hemodialyzers at different blood flow rates, different dialysate flow-rate, and different fluids in vitro to detect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber. Results:?The citrate concentrations in different hemodialyzers were F60?>?FB-130UGA?>?GA-HP130?>?F6?>?FB-130AGA?>?WS-70 in turn. The concentrations at different blood flow-rates were different 100?mL/min?>?200?mL/min. Conclusions:?The concentration of citrate in hollow fiber is affected by different types of hemodialyzers and different blood as well as dialysate flow-rates. To achieve anticoagulation when using citrate hemodialysate, we must select suitable hemodialyzer such as FB-130UGA.

AB  - Daily hemodialysis greatly improves clinical and biochemical parameters and patient quality of life compared to conventional thrice weekly dialysis. However, mortality statistics are lacking as most centers providing daily dialysis have treated only a small number of relatively selected patients for relatively short observation times. To study patient survival we pooled experience from three sources: 51 French and 128 U.S. patients selected for daily home hemodialysis and 42 U.S. patients selected for short daily center hemodialysis because of many medical complications and cardiovascular instability. Results were compared to age-matched patients from the USRDS 2003 data base. The age of the patients was 51?±?16 (18?89) years; 29% were female; they had 3.3?±?1.8 comorbidities (twice that of USRDS patients); 32% had diabetes or hypertension as cause of renal disease (USRDS patients 70%); blood access was 61% fistulae, 25% grafts, and 14% CV-catheters. Mean duration of ESRD treatment at start of short daily hemodialysis was 6?±?7 years. The observation period was 315 patient years. Patients had been on daily hemodialysis for a mean of 17?±?18 (0?92) months and 11 patients were observed for more than 5 years. 35 of the 221 patients died (16%); deaths were 111 per 1,000 patient years (53% of expected) and 5-year cumulative survival was 63% compared to 32% for USRDS patients. Five-year survival was 0% in patients with >3 comorbidities, 75% in patients with <3 comorbidities (p?<?0.0001), and in patients aged <53 years was 80% vs. 50% in patients aged >53 years (p?=?0.0007). On Cox stepwise hazards analysis, comorbidity alone predicted survival when used with age. Comorbidity >3 HR?=?6.00 (95% CI 2.2?16.3). Conclusions: It is difficult to do survival comparisons between patient groups. However, these daily dialysis patients were age-matched with patients from the USRDS database. There were fewer diabetic and hypertensive patients but the comorbidity index was twice that of USRDS patients. Survival, both deaths per 1,000 patient years and cumulative count was approximately twice that reported by the USRDS and strongly suggests superior survival with short daily hemodialysis compared to thrice weekly conventional dialysis.

AB  - The Aksys PHD system is designed for short quotidian dialysis employing a 52-liter batch of ultrapure dialysate and up to 30 in situ hot water reuses of the entire extracorporeal circuit including a 40-liter physical cleaning before each dialysis. Methods:?We studied the effect of the 52-liter tank during 108 long 5?8 hour dialysis 3.5?6 times/week in 5 patients and one 50-liter patient simulator for 4 weeks. Phosphate (PO4), beta-2 microglobulin (b-2), urea (BUN), and creatinine (creat) were measured pre-, during, and post-dialysis 86 times and in total dialysate 74 times during long dialysis. Tank saturation, Kt/V, and monthly chemistries were also measured. Results:? Patient weight 76?±?2?kg, QB 234?±?23?ml/min, QD 498?±?13?ml/min. Dialysate was recirculated 4.8 times during 8 hours. Analyte Short Long dialysis p Pre-BUN ???70?±?18 ???49?±?15 <0.0001 Pre-creat ???12?±?3 ???10?±?2 <0.0002 Pre-PO4 ?5.2?±?1.5 ?4.1?±?1.1 <0.003 Pre-b-2 34.0?±?5.3 27.8?±?4.5 <0.0001 All patients on 8?hrs???5 dialyses/week stopped phosphate binders within 3 weeks. eKt/V(urea) rose to 0.5 in one hour and then slowly to 0.8 at 8 hours. Weekly stdKt/V: Dialyses/week/Hrs: 2 5 8 5 2.2 2.7 3.0 6 2.7 3.4 3.6 7 3.1 3.8 4.4 At 8?hrs the tank was 99?±?8% saturated with BUN, 86?±?12% with creat, 77?±?18% with PO4, and only 12?±?5% with b-2. Total removal per dialysis increased 2 gm BUN, 0.4?gm?creat, 0.4?gm PO4, and 40?mg?b-2. The decline per reuse in conductivity clearance was only 0.7?±?1.2% during short and 1.4?±?1.4% during long dialysis (p?=?0.11). There was no change in monthly chemistries or hematologies. Discussion:? The data show that the Aksys PHD is very effective for long 8-hour dialysis. The data for PO4 and b-2 are the same as reported for conventional dialysis machines using 5 times as much dialysate, and the weekly stdKt/V if the PHD is used every night is twice the standard defined by K/DOQI. The exceptional cleanliness and biocompatibility by way of the one-per-month reuse should be a great advantage to patients. The full automatization saves the patient one hour every night and 30 minutes every morning. The PHD also economizes on filters and dialysate and is good for the environment.

AB  - Decrease of HCV viral load and HGF plasma levels increase have been related to HD sessions. Beneficial effects of HGF stimulation in HD on the outcome of HCV liver disease have been described. Aim was to analyze potential differences between intermittent (3???week) and short daily (6???week) HD, examining differences between HCV+ and ? pts. We studied 41?pts from 2 HD centres, 26 on intermittent HD (6 on line HF), 8 HCV+, and 15 on short-daily HD with 4 HCV+ 40?pts used synthetic HD membranes (low-flux and high-flux). Among HCV?+?we determined viral load by Amplicor (Roche) pre- and post- HD. All pts were studied for HGF levels (ELISA) baseline, 15?min, end, and at start of the following session viral load is significantly higher preHD and decreases over session. High-flux membranes were more efficient in reducing viremia (67% vs 45%), which level was higher pre- and post-HD principally in patients using low-flux membranes. Viremia in DHD is lower than in intermittent (470067.3?±?663974.5 vs 1015695.5?±?1202679.0). HCV+ HCV? p HGF baseline 3261.3?±?1904.5 2186.5?±?815.7 0.01 HGF 15?min 8000.0?±?0.0 7774.0?±?1129.8 ns HGF end 6142.5?±?2262.3 4443.7?±?2515.7 0.03 HGF start 3391.0?±?1680.6 2311.7?±?633.6 0.007 HGF at baseline, at the end of the session, and starting the following one was significantly higher in HCV?+?patients. Maximum increase appears always at 15?min. HGF levels were significantly higher in daily HD than intermittent. Of the 14 patients who showed HGF after session higher than 8000, 8 were HCV+(3 in DHD, 5 high flux), 6 were HCV?(5 DHD and 3 high flux), 14?pts finished HD session with HGF>8000, 8HCV+(3 DHD, 5 high flux) and 6HCV?(5 DHD, 4 high-flux). HGF stimulation appears in daily and intermittent HD, with higher level in the latter; HCV+ showed higher HGF vs negative, independently from the HD frequency; HCV viral load diminishes in all HD sessions, more in those with high-flux membranes. Short-daily HD with high-flux synthetic membranes seems the best option for HCV+ patients, and when performed in home precludes nosocomial transmission.

AB  - Purpose:? Contamination of catheter hub connectors is known to cause catheter-related blood stream infections in patients undergoing hemodialysis via central venous catheters (CVC). The effectiveness of cleansing the hub with an antimicrobial agent was assessed by culturing the surface of the hub following sanitation. Methods:?The CVC hub connectors of 24 patients were sanitized using the standard hospital protocol of aseptically swabbing the connectors with a solution of bleach or Betadine, and then bathing the hub in sterile gauze soaked with the antimicrobial solution for 5 minutes. The exterior surface of the hub was then cultured for a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, and septicemia. In the laboratory, sterile hubs were inoculated with E. coli, staph. aureus neg., and yeast. Hubs were then immersed in Betadine for 5, 10, or 30?min. and cultures were taken. Results:?Positive cultures were obtained from the hubs of 17 of the 24 patients. Seven (7) of the patients with positive results developed bacteremia from the cultured organism within 7 weeks. Positive cultures were obtained from 50% of inoculated lab samples after 5?min, 10% after 15?min, and 0% after 30?min. of immersion sanitation. Conclusions:?The techniques for cleansing CVC hubs should be revisited.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.
