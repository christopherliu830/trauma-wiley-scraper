AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - Currently there is no published data using the Cannon catheter. Our purpose was to confirm adequacy of hemodialysis using the Arrow Cannon catheter. This retrospective study used patients from one nephrology practice, utilizing two dialysis centers. All patients in a two year period meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria referred for tunneled catheter placement were included. All catheters were placed by interventional nephrologist using ultrasound for vein cannulation and fluoroscopy for placement confirmation. Pump speed (Qb), venous and arterial pressures, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and dialysis prescriptions/adherence to the prescription were reviewed at baseline and monthly for six months. Catheter removal or six months were the study endpoints. Complications were evaluated from time of insertion throughout the study period. 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated in the outpatient setting. Insertion outcome was successful in all 38 patients. The average dialysis prescription was approximately 400?ml/min, 3.7 hours, and 3 days a week. The mean average pump speed for all months evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline of 300?ml/min. by 67.9?101.4?ml/min. The differences were significant with p?<?0.01. The mean Kt/V and URR% data for each month evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline values of 1.2 for Kt/V and 63% for URR% by between .34?.24 and 8%?10%, respectively; the differences were all at a significant level with p?<?0.01. Mean arterial pressures for all months evaluated ranged from ?218.6 to ?238.1, and venous pressures averaged between 179.8 to 213.7. Only three patients experienced late complications (all of which were infections) and no patients required hospitalization post complication. Two were bacteremic; the other had tunnel infection without positive blood cultures. This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the adequacy of hemodialysis with the Cannon catheter. Our study showed that flow rates and adequacy of hemodialysis can be reached using the Cannon catheter, with minimal complications.

AB  - Occult HCV infection in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis (anti-HCV, serum HCV RNA negative) and no renal diseases, has been reported (1). In this work we studied the existence of occult HCV infection in PBMC of HD patients. Inclusion criteria: high ALT (>28?IU/l) and/or gamma-GPT levels, negative serological HCV and HBV markers (anti-HCV, serum HCV-RNA and HBsAg negative), and exclusion of other causes of liver damage. Four Spanish HD units participated in the study and 40 patients were enrolled; 40 (25 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. HCV-RNA in PBMC was tested by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. Occult HCV infection was found in 24/40 (60%) patients by RT-PCR and all cases were confirmed by in situ hybridization. No differences were found regarding gender, etiology of renal disease, or fluctuant or persistent abnormal liver enzymes values. Among patients with occult HCV infection, 4/24 (16.7%) had only increased ALT levels; 7/24 (29.2.%) GGTP values; and both enzymes were elevated in 13/24 (54.2%). In our population, 60% HD patients with persistent or fluctuant ALT and/or GGTP values of unknown etiology and negative for serological viral markers (including serum HCV-RNA) have an occult HCV infection in PBMC and these patients could be potentially infectious.

AB  - Control of certain clinical and laboratory parameters affects morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) both before and after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). To identify areas and stage of renal failure where control of these critical variables needs improvement, we compared important clinical and laboratory parameters 6 months before (PRE) and 6 months after starting HD (POST) in 43 type 2 diabetic men with CRF, who were 69.3?Â±?10.7 years old at HD initiation. Differences, all at p?â‰¤?0.05, were found in blood pressure, in mm Hg, at the physician's office, both systolic (PRE 154?Â±?16, POST 138?Â±?18) and diastolic (PRE 77?Â±?13, POST 69?Â±?11), serum cholesterol in mg/dL (PRE 206?Â±?61, POST 159?Â±?40), and serum creatinine in mg/dL (PRE 4.1?Â±?1.3, POST 7.0?Â±?1.8), while no differences were noted in blood hematocrit (PRE 36?Â±?7%, POST 34?Â±?9%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin (PRE 7.4?Â±?1.7%, POST 6.9?Â±?2.3%), serum glucose in mg/dL (PRE 151?Â±?67, POST 184?Â±?94), serum phosphorus in mg/dL (PRE 4.5?Â±?0.8, POST 4.6?Â±?1.5), serum calcium in mg/dL (PRE 8.7?Â±?0.5, POST 8.5?Â±?1.4), and serum albumin in g/dL (PRE 3.2?Â±?0.5, POST 3.4?Â±?0.6). Compared to the POST category, significantly (p?â‰¤?0.05) higher percentages were found in the PRE category for systolic blood pressure >150?mm Hg (PRE 58.8%, POST 26.5%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin >8%(PRE 33.3%, POST 13.3%), serum cholesterol >200?mg/dL (PRE 48.4%, POST 19.4%). A lower percentage was found in the PRE category for serum phosphorus >5.5?mg/dL (PRE 13.2%, POST 31.6%), while the corresponding percentages for serum albumin <3.0?g/dL (PRE 21.6%, POST 18.9%) and serum calcium <8?mg/dL (PRE 7.9%, POST 13.2%) did not differ. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal failure, control of blood pressure, glycemia, and serum lipids appears to be better; whereas, control of serum phosphorus is worse in the first year after starting chronic hemodialysis than in the preceding year. There is room for improvement, both before and after hemodialysis initiation, in the control of these variables, which affect the clinical outcomes of hemodialysis.

AB  - Background:? Radon is a natural radioactive element found especially in drilled water wells. It may cause problems in HHD. In this study the occurrence and prevention of radiation exposure to radon among HHD patients was examined. Material and methods:?Since 1998, 103 patients have been trained for HHD and drilled wells were used in 7 patients. Apart from routine analyses, radon concentration was also determined. Results:?High radon concentration was observed in three drilled wells, in one of these 2000?Bq/L. Water was conducted into the HHD-equipment through a charcoal filter and reverse osmosis equipment. Radon concentration was less than 50?Bq/L in the purified water. It was thus considered acceptable for dialysis. As the charcoal filter adsorbs radon, its decay products build up in the filter and emit gamma radiation. Considering that the daily through-put of water is about 375 liters, the estimated dose rate for a radon concentration of 1,000?Bq/L is 0.4?microSv/h at one-meter distance. At this distance the annual dose would be 1.8?mSv, expecting a daily occupancy time of 12 hours. The average background gamma dose rate in Finnish dwellings is 0.1?microSv/h. National dose constraints of 3?mSv/year for adults and 1?mSv/year for children living in HHD-households have been recommended. Conclusions: Waterborne radon must be considered when planning of HHD in households where drilled wells are used. Elevated radon concentration should always be removed from household water. In addition, external gamma radiation from charcoal filters requires appropriate restrictions in order to achieve a safe treatment.

AB  - The analysis of infectious complications in patients after allotransplantation of a donor kidney. For the dynamic analysis of frequency of infection-purulent complications, all patients were divided into 2 groups. The first, control group included 33 patients who were operated from 2000 to 2002 (men-21, women-12, adults-28, children-5). The second, basic group included 35 patients (men-22 and women-13, adult-28, children-7), after allotransplantations, which have transferred operation?transplantations of kidney with 2003 on 2004. In the first group purulent?septic complications were marked at 9 patients (27.2%), from them two (6%) have died of a sepsis on a background of antibacterial therapy (cephalosporini 3 generations). Duration of treatment made from 7 up to 15 days. In the second group in the postoperative period purulent ? septic complications were marked at 5 of 35 patients (14,2%). All 35 patients in the second group after allotransplantation of a donor kidney carried out preventive antibacterial therapy maxipimi (cephalosporini IV generations) on dosage 1 gram 2 times per day in a combination with amykini intravenously during 7 days. Cases of development of sepsis in this group of patients were not observed. Thus, estimating the received results, it is possible to draw the conclusion, application of antibiotics of a wide spectrum (cephalosporini IV generations) the patient with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency after allotransplantation of a donor kidney were lowered with quantity of suppurations of postoperative wounds and occurrence of infectious complications on 13%.

AB  - Objective:? Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single pool Kt/V at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. This study was performed to investigate the effect of increasing dialysis needle size on dialysis adequacy in HD patients. Methods:?This study enrolled 73 patients receiving HD thrice weekly for more than 3 months with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft in a single center. Dialysis blood flow rate was 200?ml/min in 12 patients, 250?ml/min in 32 patients, and 300?ml/min in 29 patients. Surface area of dialyzer was 1.2?m2 in 56 patients and 1.6?m2 in 17 patients. We first performed HD using a 16-gauge needle. Then we increased needle size up to 15-gauge without change of any other dialysis conditions such as blood and dialysate flow rates, dialysis time, or distance between needle insertion sites. We compared compression time after removing the needles, venous dialysis pressure (VDP), Kt/V, and urea reduction ratio (URR) between these two methods. Results:?The mean age was 54?Â±?13 years and the number of patients with diabetes mellitus was 27 (37%). Fifty-eight patients (79.5%) have native AVF. Mean Kt/V at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (1.30?Â±?0.18 vs. 1.23?Â± 0.18, p?<?0.001). URR at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was also higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle. In contrast, VDP at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was lower than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (88?Â±?22?mmHg vs. 118?Â±?28?mmHg, p?<?0.001). There was no difference in compression time between the two methods. Conclusion:?This study suggests that increasing dialysis needle size is a safe and effective method in improving dialysis adequacy without increasing blood flow rate or dialysis time.

AB  - Objective:? We report a patient with urosepsis, Lleptospira syndrome, TTP-HUS syndrome, fulminant hepatic failure, vasculitis syndrome and TSS treated with plasma component exchange. Methods:?Conditions for plasma component exchange were membrane plasma separator (Evacure EC-3A), substitute fluid (3?% albumin solution), blood flow rate (150?mL/min), filtration rate (30?mL/min), quantity of substitute fluid (4,600?mL) and anticoagulant (nafamostat mesilate 30?mg/hr). Result: Plasma component exchange in combination with hemodiafiltration induced a rapid remission of both hepatic toxicity and renal failure caused by streptococcal sepsis. Membrane plasma separator evacure EC-3A allowed the use of 3% albumin solution as substitute fluid. Colloid osmotic pressure temporarily increased after the treatment, but within 24 hours, returned to the same level as before the treatment. Conclusion:?Plasma component exchange using a membrane plasma separator may allow the use of albumin instead of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as substitute fluid, which results in a lower risk of infection.
