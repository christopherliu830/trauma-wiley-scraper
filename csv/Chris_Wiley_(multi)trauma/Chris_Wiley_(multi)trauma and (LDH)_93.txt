AB  - The Aksys PHD System, designed to utilize ultrapure dialyzate for quotidian hemodialysis at home, uses mechanical cleaning and hot water sanitization of the blood, dialysate, and water flow-paths from inlet to outlet. Since January 2000, it has been used by 110 US patients and 8 UK patients for a total of 106 patient years and more than 30,000 dialyses runs. Of those treated, 75 patients were male and 43 female; mean age was 52?±?25 (range 22?82) years; 65% were white, 25% black, and 10% other; mean weight was 78?±?20 (44?125)?kg; the cause of renal failure was primary renal disease (50%), hypertension (24%), diabetes (19%), and other (4%). Dialysis access included fistula (61%), graft (25%), and catheter (14%). Patients had been on ESRD therapy on average of 6?±?7 (0?32) years when starting on PHD dialysis. As of August 2004, patients had dialyzed 11?±?8 (1?52) months on the PHD. Of those, 78 patients remained on the PHD, 12 were transplanted, 10 died, 7 returned to conventional dialysis at the end of the original study for the FDA and 7 for medical or social reasons, 2 returned to quotidian dialysis on other equipment, and 2 stopped during home dialysis training. Patients dialyzed an average of 145?±?27?min, 5.6?±?0.6 dialyses/week with a QB of 376?±?45?ml/min and a QD of 545?±?170?ml/min. eKt/V was 0.68?±?0.20 and weekly stdKt/V was 2.61?±?0.52. Mean dialyser reuse was 17?±?14 times without significant decline in urea clearance. 23/118 patients (19%) who came to the PHD from quotidian dialysis on other equipment thought the PHD twice as easy to use and experienced only half as many episodes hypotension, cramps, headache, backache, nausea, and arrhythmias (all p?<?0.02). They were hospitalized only half as many days on the PHD. Cumulative patient survival was 60% at 4 years, with 94 deaths/1,000 patient years, relative risk 0.56 compared with age-matched patients from the USRDS database. Conclusion: This large clinical experience shows the PHD System is easier to use and delivers smoother dialysis with better cardiovascular stability than conventional dialysis machines. It easily fulfills the DOQI guidelines for adequacy of dialysis, economizes on use of dialyzers, tubing, and dialysate, results in less hospitalization, and appears to result in superior patient survival.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.

AB  - Background:? Both chronic HCV infection and schistosomiasis are major health problems in Egypt. The high prevalence of HCV infection in bilharzial patients had been postulated to be due to HCV transmission during past anti-bilharzial parental therapy. The aim of the work was to study the possibility of transmission of HCV through the life cycle of schistosomiasis. Subject and Methods:?The study included 180 patients divided into four groups: Group I:?Included 40 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on regular hemodialysis (RH) with hepatic schistosmiasis (HS) and previous history of blood transfusion (BT). Group II:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with HS and had no previous history of BT. Group III:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with no evidence of HS and no previous history of BT. Group IV:?Included 60 patients with HS with normal renal function and no previous history of BT. In addition 20 healthy persons were included as a control group. In addition to the routine investigations the patient groups were subjected to HCV Ab, HBsAg, HBcAb, HBcAg, anti bilharzial Ab, abdominal ultrasonography, rectal snip for patients positive for anti bilharzial Ab, and in-situ hybridization (ISH) for HCV RNA and HBV DNA in the rectal snips positive for living schistosoma ova obtained from bilharzial patients positive for markers of HCV and HBV, respectively. Results:?HCV Ab was detected in 92.5%, 65%, 55%, and 76.7% in groups I, II, III, IV, respectively, compared to 25% in the control group. Anti-schistosomal Ab was detected in 75%, 50%, and 71.7% in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. A highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and anti-schistosomal Ab positivity among all bilharzial groups (P?<?0.01 in group I and P?<?0.001 in groups II & IV). Rectal snips were positive for living schistosoma ova in 76.7%, 90%, and 81.4% of anti-schistosomal Ab positive cases in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. Moreover, a highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and rectal snip positivity among the 3 bilharzial patients groups (P?<?0.001 in groups I & II and P?<?0.01 in group IV). On the other hand, there was no significant association between HBs Ag and either anti-schistosomal Ab positivity or rectal snip positivity. ISH revealed HCV RNA in 26.3% of schistosomal ova-positive rectal snips. In contrast, the examined biopsies were negative for hybridization of HBV DNA. Conclusion:?Schistosomiasis might play a role in the transmission of HCV through its life cycle and this also may explain the significant association between HCV and schistosomiasis.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects survival and morbidity of end-stage renal disease patients and also increases treatment costs. Aim of this study is to define prevalence of HCV infection in our hemodialysis (HD) units and documenting past interventions and clinical status of patients. 711 patients were included. Patient data were collected from 4 HD units of Baskent University. Patient records were examined for demograpic findings, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, liver biopsy, interferon treatment information, last 12 months? laboratory values (serum transaminases, albumin, lipid profiles, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein), and current clinical status, retrospectively. 143 patients (3%) were anti-HCV positive. These patients? alanine transferase levels (23.5?±?20.5 vs 15.5?±?12.8?U/L, p?<?0.0001) and HD duration (97.9?±?58.6 vs 46.3?±?35.6 months, p?<?0.0001) were significantly higher. No other significant difference could be identified between the groups. Analysis of HD duration of anti-HCV positive patients revealed that prevalance was increasing as the duration increased. Anti-HCV positivity was known for a mean of 60.4?±?38.8 months while 44 patients (30.7%) were already infected at initiation of HD. HCV RNA analysis was positive in 26.7% and a liver biopsy was performed in 23% of patients after 19.8?±?23.3 months following positive anti-HCV identification. Minimally active chronic hepatitis C was the most common pathological diagnosis (70, 3%). Only 18 patients (12.5%) recieved interferon therapy. None of the patients had chronic liver disease clinical and physical findings by the time this study was done. HCV infection is a common problem in HD patients that increases the need for medical interventions and treatment.

AB  - Background:? Because of high incidence of acquired renal cyst and renal malignancy, it is suggested that spontaneous renal rupture more frequently occurs in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis than in the general population. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?This retrospective study enrolled 12 hemodialysis patients who developed spontaneous renal rupture. We investigated primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, clinical symptoms and signs, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and histologic findings. Result:?The mean age of the patients was 54?±?10 years old and the number of male was 9. Primary renal disease consisted of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PCKD)(n?=?5), chronic glomerulonephritis (n?=?2), diabetic nephropathy (n?=?1), hypertensive nephropathy (n?=?1), unknown cause (n?=?3). Presenting symptoms and signs were sudden onset of flank pain in 9 patients and gross hematuria with mild flank pain in 3 patients. Mean duration from initiation of hemodialysis to development of spontaneous renal rupture was 53?±?36 months. Abdominal computed tomography showed subcapsular or perinephric hematoma in all patients. Of the 7 non-PCKD patients, 6 patients had multiple acquired renal cysts. Surgical exploration was undertaken in 9 patients. Pathologic examination demonstrated small sized renal cell carcinoma in 2 of 9 patients. Three patients were only treated with conservative management including blood transfusion. All 12 patients recovered without recurrence. Conclusion:?This study demonstrated that genetic or acquired renal cyst was an important cause of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients and presenting manifestations were sudden onset of flank pain and gross hematuria.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - An increased frequency of the Milk-Alkali syndrome in the last several years has been noticed related to increasing use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder in CKD patients, as an antacid or as calcium supplementation. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Milk-Alkali syndrome that precipitated acute renal failure requiring urgent hemodialysis. A 59-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acid reflux presented to the ER with confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His family relayed a history of recent indigestion and relief with Tums. He was taking several tablets at short intervals to self-treat the indigestion. At the time of presentation, patient was confused and noted to be dehydrated. Lab findings were significant for elevated BUN/Cr- 121?mg/dl/11.1?mg/dl (baseline Cr 1.1?mg/dl few months ago), bicarbonate 38?mg/dl, calcium 16.7?mg/dl, ionized Ca of 1.76?mmol/L, iPTH 10?pg/ml, PTHrP 0.7?pg/ml. Medical management with intravenous fluids and furosemide showed no improvement in renal failure, or calcium level. Patient was then started on hemodialysis with 2.0?mmol/L calcium in the dialysate the next day. There was gradual improvement in patient's mental status, calcium values, and renal failure over the ensuing 2 weeks. Discussion and Conclusions:? The diagnosis of Milk-Alkali syndrome is made on the basis of history. Metabolic abnormalities involved in this syndrome are hypercalcemia with low to normal PTH and Vit. D levels, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Failed medical management required acute dialysis in this patient. Acute hemodialysis in such a case could be life saving. Due to increasing use of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and osteoporosis, patients should be made aware of these severe, potentially life-threatening adverse effects.

AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.

AB  - Forty-one consecutive admissions to a hemodialysis center were evaluated. Demographic information including age, gender, race, and diagnosis was collected. Patients, >18 years old, with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis for at least one year were included. Those with edema or known ascites were excluded. Weight was measured before and after hemodialysis (HD) using a standard scale and by considering the amount of fluid loss by the hemodialysis machine. Body composition including total body water (TBW) was calculated before and after HD using near infrared interactance (NIR). All measurements were completed during half hour before and after HD. Forty-one patients included: men (n?=?26), women (n?=?15); median age 58 (range 28?88 years). Twenty-eight were African American and the rest Caucasians. The amount of intravascular fluid taken after HD (assessed by weight reduction) ranged 0?5?L with median 2.2?L. NIR analysis for the same patients at the same time showed different total body water measurements in 91% of cases (P?>?0.05). Moreover, NIR analysis showed increase in total body water in 24% of patients even though the hemodialysis machine showed a loss of total body water; median of 1.3 (range: 0?3L). The error in measuring body composition with NIR was both large and varied (random and not systematic error). We conclude that NIR analysis cannot be considered as a reliable method to evaluate body composition, especially total body water, amongst patients with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Purpose:? To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Methods:?Between January 1997 and December 2003, we treated 22 patients with non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas by PTA. Retrospective analysis was performed on the findings of fistulogram, techniques and success rate of PTA, and patency rate. Results:?Seventeen segmental stenoses and 5 segmental occlusions of cephalic veins were identified. Sixteen stenoses and 2 occlusions were located at the cephalic vein adjacent to the anastomosis site, and 3 occlusions and 1 stenosis were seen at the proximal vein near the elbow joint. In addition to venous stenosis, a focal arterial stenosis at the anastomosis site and two accompanying accessory veins that might hamper maturation of main cephalic vein was seen in each of two patients, respectively. Simultaneous occlusion of left innominate vein as well as occlusion of cephalic vein were noted in one patient. Initial success rate of PTA was 95.5%(21/22). Overall success rate including 11 additional PTAs performed during follow-up was 96.9%(32/33). No major complication occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 72% and 95% at 3 months, and 50% and 77% at 6 months, respectively. Conclusion:?PTA is an effective and safe method in salvaging non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of argatroban in a post-cardiac operation patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requiring hemodialysis and continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVH). Case Summary:A 23-year-old Caucasian female with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed acute renal failure after cardiovascular surgery. Argatroban was used as a substitute for heparin during hemodialysis and CVVH. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) were used to guide the dosage of argatroban. The patient was successfully dialyzed without clotting of the circuit. The dosage required in our patient was much lower than the manufacturer's recommendation. Discussion:Argatroban is a thrombin inhibitor that does not cross react with heparin. It is metabolized by the liver, and dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The correct dosage for patient with unstable hemodynamics is not known. Our patient had apparently normal hepatic function at the initiation of dialysis, but the dosage of argatroban recommended by the manufacturer resulted in prolonged elevation of the aPTT and ACT with associated gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to hepatic congestion secondary to poor cardiac function and/or severe anasarca. And the dosage of argatroban required during dialysis was much lower than the recommendation. Conclusions:Argatroban is an effective alternative of heparin for CVVH. The correct initial dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment and unstable hemodynamics is still unclear.

AB  - Several types of high flux dialyzers were developed and introduced for clinical applications to improve solute removal efficiency. In these dialyzers, internal filtration/backfiltration (IF/BF) is induced by pressure drop of blood and dialysate flow in a countercurrent manner under less net filtration. Higher IF/BF flow rate increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. In previously published papers, we reported the effects of IF on solute removal efficiency of the dialyzer during an analytical and an experimental study and the measurement of the internal filtration flow rate (QIF) by Doppler ultrasonography. Average blood flow rate (QBav) at a cross-sectional plane was measured by pulse Doppler and the longitudinal QBav profile along the dialyzer was obtained using a probe slider that can move the probe in parallel along the dialyzer. This is a suitable method for a bedside monitoring of the IF/BF flow rate of dialyzers because it is noninvasive to the patient and produces reliable data with higher reproducibility. Internal backfiltration flow rate (QBF) in six types of commercially available high flux dialyzers, having a higher 50?ml/min of ?2-microglobulin clearance (CL-?2?m), were examined by Doppler ultrasonography under 10?ml/min/m2 of net filtration flow rate. As a result, a wide range of QBF value, 12.1?28.4?ml/min, was obtained among those dialyzers. It means a fair amount of BF, 2.9?6.8 liter per session, occurs in a typical hemodialysis treatment. Strict management of dialysate purification is required for a dialyzer with a relatively larger BF. On the other hand, no correlation between the CL-?2?m value and the QBF value was seen because the CL-?2?m value depends on not only the IF/BF flow rate but also diffusive property of the membrane. The BF flow rate in every dialyzer should be examined to avoid suffering from the invasion of endotoxin and its fragment for safety.

AB  - K/DOQI has set the national standard of adequacy in dialysis. Clinical practice assesses these standards using ?routine? blood work schedules that vary from every 4?6 weeks and calculates these results using different urea kinetic formulas. This variance may result in under-dialysis of our patients that may not be detected until the next routine blood work. Comparing Kt/V blood work results using ?snapshot? laboratory results versus total run trending using Integra Diascan monitoring may help us define adequacy and may identify potential cost savings to the medical system and the hemodialysis patient. Diascan offers more than on-line Kt/V monitoring of clearances; it also reports patient serum plasma conductivity. Serum plasma monitoring helps to identify potential excess fluid gains which may compromise dialysis treatments leading to poor clearances, which in turn leads to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing costly dialysis interventions and potential emergent treatments. The small sampling of patients compared use a variety of vascular accesses and were examined for some of the barriers to effective ?snapshot? monitoring of Kt/V or PRU versus trending adequacy to explore the potential benefits and efficacy of the data obtained.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - Abstract NGF can regulate nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) can modulate NGF-mediated neurotrophic responses. To investigate the role of NO in NGF-activated expression of cholinergic phenotype, PC12 cells were treated with either the nonselective NOS inhibitor l-NAME (N??-nitro-l-arginine methylester) or the inducible NOS selective inhibitor MIU (s-methylisothiourea), and the effect on NGF-stimulated ChAT mRNA levels and ChAT specific activity was determined. NGF increased steady-state levels of mRNA and protein for both inducible and constitutive isozymes of NOS in PC12 cells, and led to enhanced NOS activity and NO production. MIU and, to a lesser extent, l-NAME blocked neurite outgrowth in nerve growth factor (NGF)-treated PC12 cells. Both l-NAME and MIU attenuated NGF-mediated increases in choline transferase (ChAT)-specific activity and prevented the increase in expression of ChAT mRNA normally produced by NGF treatment of PC12 cells. The present study indicates that NO may be involved in the modulation of signal transduction pathways by which NGF leads to increased ChAT gene expression in PC12 cells.
