AB  - Abstract The existence of interactions between sequential enzymes of metabolic pathways has been explored extensively throughout the field of biochemistry. These closely coupled pathways, termed metabolons, have been demonstrated to induce substrate channeling that results in increased efficiency by enhancing local substrate concentrations, protecting liable intermediates, and limiting distance between enzyme active sites. This phenomenon may have direct implication in the advancement of multi-enzyme enzymatic biofuel cells through the use of super-complex formations as bioanode catalysts. This will result in an efficient means of a more complete oxidation of a fuel, while optimizing the flux of the system through the recreation of a phenomenon that is conserved throughout biology.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the role of tobacco use in the development of psychosis in individuals at clinical high risk. Method The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study is a 2-year multi-site prospective case control study of persons at clinical high risk that aims to better understand predictors and mechanisms for the development of psychosis. The cohort consisted of 764 clinical high risk and 279 healthy comparison subjects. Clinical assessments included tobacco and substance use and several risk factors associated with smoking in general population studies. Results Clinical high risk subjects were more likely to smoke cigarettes than unaffected subjects (light smoking odds ratio [OR]?=?3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.9-5; heavy smoking OR?=?4.8, 95% CI?=?1.7-13.7). In both groups, smoking was associated with mood, substance use, stress and perceived discrimination and in clinical high risk subjects with childhood emotional neglect and adaption to school. Clinical high risk subjects reported higher rates of several factors previously associated with smoking, including substance use, anxiety, trauma and perceived discrimination. After controlling for these potential factors, the relationship between clinical high risk state and smoking was no longer significant (light smoking OR?=?0.9, 95% CI?=?0.4-2.2; heavy smoking OR?=?0.3, 95% CI?=?0.05-2.3). Moreover, baseline smoking status (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.16, 95% CI?=?0.82-1.65) and categorization as ever smoked (HR?=?1.3, 95% CI?=?0.8-2.1) did not predict time to conversion. Conclusion Persons at high risk for psychosis are more likely to smoke and have more factors associated with smoking than controls. Smoking status in clinical high risk subjects does not predict conversion. These findings do not support a causal relationship between smoking and psychosis.

AB  - Aim On average, there is a 10% to 12% likelihood of developing a psychotic disorder solely based on being at familial high risk. However, the introduction of the criteria for clinical high risk (CHR) of psychosis suggested for CHR individuals, 20% to 30% will go on to develop a full-blown psychotic illness within 3?years. Several studies suggest a role for family history in conversion to psychosis among those at CHR. However, we know very little about those who meet the CHR criteria and have a positive family history for psychosis compared to those at CHR with no known family history. The aim of this study was to compare these 2 groups on demographics, clinical symptoms, social and role functioning, IQ, environmental factors and conversion to psychosis. Method A total of 762 participants met criteria for being at CHR, 119 of whom had a family history (CHR?+?FH) and 643 without (CHR-FH). Groups were compared on attenuated symptoms, role and social functioning, IQ, past trauma, perceived discrimination and cannabis use. Survival analysis was used to compare groups on conversion rates. Results There were no major differences between the groups in symptoms, functioning, IQ, cannabis use or in the rate of conversion between the groups. The CHR?+?FH group reported increased amounts of early trauma. Conclusion There is a possibility that CHR?+?FH individuals believe that it is more difficult for them to cope with circumstances such as abuse or potential abuse. Future research on this subject should investigate family environment and its role in conversion to psychosis among CHR?+?FH individuals.

AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - There is a recent trend to feed pet dogs and cats in Britain and other developed countries on raw meat and animal by-products using either commercial preparations or home recipes. This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria. Other infectious organisms that may be of concern include Listeria, shiga toxigenic E scherichia coli , parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and exotic agents such as the zoonotic livestock pathogen Brucella suis, recently identified in European Union and UK raw pet meat imported from Argentina.

AB  - Abstract Objective The magnitude of acute tolerance is a strong predictor of the development of longer-term chronic tolerance and plays a decisive role in risky decisions (e.g., driving after drinking). Therefore, it is important to identify factors that increase the magnitude of this adaptive process. This study explored whether acute tolerance magnitude varied as a function of the overall rate of increase in breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). Methods Twenty-nine young adult social drinkers (M age = 22.55, SD = 3.10; 62.1% women) consumed a moderate dose of alcohol (men: 0.86 g/kg, women: 0.75 g/kg) in a controlled laboratory setting. Subjective intoxication was assessed at matched BrACs (~0.060 g/dl) on each limb of the BrAC curve. Results Hierarchical regression results indicated that faster overall increases in BrAC on the ascending limb were associated with greater acute tolerance for subjective intoxication ratings (p < .01, R2 = .29). Conclusions These results present some of the first evidence that faster increases in BrAC may be associated with greater acute tolerance, as indicated by greater reduction in subjective intoxication across the limbs of the BrAC curve. This greater reduction may, in turn, promote heavier drinking and/or engagement in behaviors for which one is unfit (e.g., driving after drinking).

AB  - Problem? The endocervix is a major target of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, but little is known about the immune repertoire in this tissue, or its response to these common bacteria. Method of study? Using a cytobrush, we isolated cells from the endocervix of 20 women during C. trachomatis infection, and post-antibiotic treatment. Endocervical swabs and blood were taken in parallel. Endocervical cells were enumerated, and endocervical and blood T cells immunophenotyped. Chlamydia trachomatis was genotyped by sequence analysis of the OmpA gene, and quantified by culture. Results? Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes were D, E, F and Ia, and infectious burden varied considerably. Endocervical T cell and neutrophil numbers were highly elevated during infection, with both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets accumulating. Regardless of the presence or absence of infection, the endocervical cell infiltrate was dominated by effector memory T cells, and the numbers of CCR5 and CD103 expressing T cells was significantly higher than in the blood. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) expression by endocervical T cells was significantly increased during infection. Conclusion? The human endocervix exhibits a distinct cellular response to C. trachomatis infection that can be longitudinally evaluated by cytobrush sampling. Infecting organisms can be sampled and analyzed in parallel.

AB  - We aimed to determine the sensitivity of available ?diagnostic? tests in detecting subclinical abnormalities characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with unexplained isolated myelopathy, and any relationship between test results and level of disability. The trial investigations were carried out in 69 prospectively selected patients with acute or chronic noncompressive myelopathies. Magnetic resonance scans were the most sensitive individual tests, revealing asymptomatic brain lesions in 51 patients (74%, C.I. 64?84). An abnormal IgG/albumin ratio (IgG/A) was present in 29 (42%, C.I. 30?54), oligoclonal bands (OCB) in 27 (39%, C.I. 17?39) and abnormal evoked potentials (EP) (visual and/or auditory brain stem) in 19 cases (28%, C.I. 17?39). OCB and abnormal EP were found significantly less often than in control patients with clinically definite MS (CDMS) and significantly more often than in patients with myelopathy due to other conditions. The number of anatomical brain areas with lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was significantly associated with CSF abnormalities; abnormal EP were correlated with abnormal MRI and elevated CSF immunoglobulins. Clinical classifications, age, symptom duration, disability levels and genetic factors did not appear to influence the prevalence of abnormal MRI or CSF. For the exclusion of compressive and structural diseases of the spinal cord, myelography has been superceded by cervical and thoracic MRI. In addition, MRI of the brain is the investigation of choice in patients with myelopathies that remain unexplained after spinal MRI. However, whether used alone or in combination with other tests, the specificity and predictive value of brain MRI abnormalities for the risk of developing MS, as well as the associated ?false positive? rates, remain to be defined by long-term follow-up of prospectively ascertained and representative cases.
