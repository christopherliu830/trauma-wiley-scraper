AB  - Abstract Background:? Surviving multi-trauma is strongly associated with emergent resuscitation and treatment in modern medical facilities. Multi-trauma survival before the advent of modern medicine is likely to have been extremely uncommon, particularly in primitive societies. The aim of this study was to investigate the case of an ancient Australian Aboriginal who appeared to have survived multi-trauma. Methods:? We investigated the skeletal remains of an adult Australian Aboriginal with healed fractures of the right femur and humerus. The time of death was assessed by carbon dating. The sex and approximate age of the subject were assessed from the skeleton's morphometry. The fractured bones were assessed by visual inspection, plain radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Results:? The remains were of a male aged approximately 50 years at the time of his death, approximately 1000 years ago, preceding European settlement. Analysis of the malunions indicated that all fractures occurred in one traumatic event, normally a life-threatening injury combination, and that the subject survived for years after this incident, despite no or failed active treatment of his fractures. Conclusions:? The survival of a man living in a primitive society after multi-trauma reflects an impressive depth of nursing and social support in a community of hunter gatherers.

(b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

The present article reviews the clinical and imaging clearance of the thoracic and lumbar spines of blunt trauma victims and the evolution of these strategies with the use of new imaging technologies. Methods:? A comprehensive literature search was performed, and articles identified were critically appraised Results:? Twenty papers were identified, 12 directly comparing computed tomography screening with plain X-rays. Evidence-based protocols are presented. The evolution of imaging strategies in response to new technology is described. Conclusions:? Thoracolumbar spine screening is best done using reformatted images acquired when scanning the chest and abdomen of high-risk multi-trauma patients. If computed tomography is not clinically indicated for investigation of other injuries then plain films are the first line investigation.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - Abstract The intersecting scenarios of multi-trauma, thoracic injury and traumatic cardiac arrest present some of the most demanding moments in paediatric trauma. For these reasons, decision support through teamwork, checklists, technology and guidelines are central to ensuring quality paediatric trauma care. The ?Rule of 4's? is a simple aide-memoire, which guides clinicians of all grades, expertise and distractedness in a reliable approach to injured children who require safe and effective emergency pleural decompression and timely insertion of a chest drain. The Rule of 4?s enables these important therapeutic goals to be met through: (i) four steps in a ?good plan?; (ii) fourth (or fifth) intercostal space as the basis for siting a ?good hole?; (iii) 4? uncuffed endotracheal tube size (4? [age/4?+?4]) to guide selection of a ?good tube?; and (iv) 4 cm mark for a ?good stop? to ensure the drain is in far enough but not too far.

AB  - Abstract Anecdotally critical incident debriefing (CID) is an important topic for staff in paediatric ED. The present study aimed to determine current baseline CID practices and perceived needs of ED staff. A questionnaire regarding CID practice was circulated to all 13 Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) sites in Australia and New Zealand (including all tertiary paediatric ED), and completed by 1 senior doctor and 1 senior nurse. All PREDICT sites participated (13 nurses, 13 doctors). Seventy per cent did not currently have a hospital protocol on debriefing and 90% did not have ED-specific guidelines. The most commonly debriefed topics were death of a patient, multi-trauma and sudden infant death syndrome, also ranked highest in importance for debriefing. The median reported debriefs per department were 4 per year (range 0?12), all conducted within a week of the CI with half within 24?h. ED workers most likely to be invited to the CID session were doctors, nurses and social workers (96%). Debriefing was mostly conducted internally (62%) and most likely facilitated by a doctor (81%) or nurse (54%). Debriefing addressed both clinical and emotional issues (89%) within the same session (69%). Debriefing was rated as very important, median of 8/10 by doctors and 10/10 by nurses. Almost 90% of those surveyed indicated that they would like a CID programme and guidelines for their department. Debriefing is perceived as important by senior ED clinicians, yet few ED have formalized guidelines or programmes. Best-practice guidelines should be developed.

AB  - Abstract Background There is limited evidence describing the long-term outcomes of severe pelvic ring fractures. The aim of this study was to describe the longer term independent living and return to work outcomes following severe pelvic ring fracture. Methods Adult survivors to discharge from two major trauma centres with AO/Tile type B and C fractures were followed up at 6, 12 and 24-months post-injury to capture functional (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E]) and return to work data. Multivariable, mixed effects models were used to identify predictors of outcome. Results A total of 111 of 114 (97%) cases were followed up. The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.9 (18.9) years, 77% were male, 81% were transport-related and 90% were multi-trauma patients. Further, 11% were managed conservatively, 10% with external fixation and 79% with open reduction and internal fixation. At 24 months, 77% were living independently (GOS-E > 4) and 59% had returned to work. Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were associated with lower risk-adjusted odds of return to work (P = 0.04) and independent living (P = 0.06). Post-operative infection was associated with living independently (P = 0.02). Conclusion Despite the severity of the injuries sustained, 77% of severe pelvic ring fracture patients were living independently and 59% had returned to work, 2-years post-injury. Fracture type and management were not key predictors of outcome. Large-scale multi-centre studies are needed to fully understand the burden of severe pelvic ring fractures and to guide clinical management.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: 1) Describe probabilistic linkage (PL) for road trauma and rehabilitation records in New South Wales (NSW) Australia. 2) Determine the accuracy of linkage for these records. Methods: Data were extracted from the NSW Trauma Registry for all road trauma admissions for the years 2009?2012 and from Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre for January 2009 to June 2013. PL was performed using: age; sex; residential postcode; and date of acute discharge = date of admission to rehabilitation. False matches were cases that linked but were not true matches; they were determined by manual review. Reasons for incomplete linkages were explored. The benefits and limitations of the linked study dataset are described. Results: Of 3,256 road trauma records, 683 were matched to rehabilitation records. Using the field of ?discharge destination? from the trauma records, 265 patients with unmatched records were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (missed matches). This gave an overall 72% linkage rate (or sensitivity) using PL. There were 16 cases of false matches, giving a specificity of 99%. Conclusion: It was feasible to use PL to link road trauma and rehabilitation datasets in the absence of identifiers. However, this needed to be combined with careful manual review before the linked dataset could be used to make inferences on trauma rehabilitation outcomes. Implication: PL may be a cost-effective way to capture inpatient rehabilitation outcomes of multi-trauma patients.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost a decade for hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Its off-label use as a hemostatic agent in massive bleeding caused by a wide array of clinical scenarios is rapidly expanding. While evidence-based guidelines exist for rFVIIa treatment in hemophilia, none are available for its off-label use. Objectives:?The aim of this study is to develop expert recommendations for the use of rFVIIa in patients suffering from uncontrolled bleeding (with special emphasis on trauma) until randomized, controlled trials allow for the introduction of more established evidence-based guidelines. Methods:?A multidisciplinary task force comprising representatives of the relevant National Medical Associations, experts from the Medical Corps of the Army, Ministry of Health and the Israel National Trauma Advisory Board was established in Israel. Recommendations were construed based on the analysis of the first 36 multi-trauma patients accumulated in the prospective national registry of the use of rFVIIa in trauma, and an extensive literature search consisting of published and prepublished controlled animal trials, case reports and series. The final consensus guidelines, together with the data of the first 36 trauma patients treated in Israel, are presented in this article. Results:?Results of the first 36 trauma patients: The prolonged clotting assays [prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] shortened significantly within minutes following administration of rFVIIa. Cessation of bleeding was achieved in 26 of 36 (72%) patients. Acidosis diminished the hemostatic effect of the drug, while hypothermia did not affect it. The survival rate of 61% (22/36) seems to be favorable compared with published series of similar, or less severe, trauma patients (range 30%?57%). Conclusions:?As a result of the lack of controlled trials, our guidelines should be considered as suggestive rather than conclusive. However, they provide a valuable tool for physicians using rFVIIa for the expanding off-label clinical uses.

AB  - Transfusion emergency preparedness is increasingly being recognized as an important element in the healthcare response to mass casualty events (MCE). Planning should be designed to support an integrated response between the blood services and hospitals. The lessons identified from the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017 and recent incidents in London have led to new guidance. Demand planning has been informed by the global experience of civilian MCEs and the changing trends in trauma care. Past evidence suggests that only a modest number of hospitalized patients following MCEs require transfusion. The mean blood use per patient admitted is consistently calculated at 2?3 red cell units. Most blood is used within the first 6 h. However, a small number of critically injured with multi-trauma may require massive transfusion and ongoing support. Many blood services have reported meeting the initial overall demand for blood from stock. However, universal components may be in short supply. The demand can be managed by pre-agreed substitutions. Early transfusion triage enables the best use of hospital laboratory and blood service support. Careful communication with donor communities is essential to manage a controlled replenishment of stocks. Future challenges for the transfusion community include the trend towards lower red cell stock holdings and the changing trends in weapon use and tactics. A standardized approach to transfusion data collection is required to support future planning. The transfusion community is encouraged to plan for MCEs, contribute to ?after action reviews? and work together for safe and sustainable transfusion support.

PY  - 1996
AB  - Background: The chief danger of colonic injury is sepsis resulting from faecal spill. Primary repair is now well established in the USA, particularly for penetrating injuries, in up to 81% of patients. However, in Australia, highly destructive blunt trauma forms a larger proportion of injuries, and the purpose of this study was to determine if there are any contrasts in the management of these patients. Method: A retrospective survey was undertaken over the past 20 years of all of the patients with full-thickness colorectal injuries presenting at the three major hospitals which receive multi-trauma patients in Brisbane. Results: Of 112 patients 114 sustained full-thickness colorectal injuries. Forty patients had penetrating injuries, 41 had blunt injuries and 33 had iatrogenic injuries. Primary repair or resection and anastomosis was performed in 39% of patients with colonic injuries and the leak rate was 8%. Exteriorized repairs had a 67% leak rate. A colostomy was used in 58% of patients. The mortality for penetrating injuries was zero. The mortality for blunt colonic injuries was 17% and for iatrogenic injuries was 7% but for blunt rectal injuries was 50%. The overall mortality was 10%. Colostomy closure had a 20% morbidity but no mortality. Conclusions: In the absence of shock, associated injuries, or gross faecal soiling primary repair or resection with anastomosis may be considered. For blunt injury, colostomy is still usually indicated, often with resection. For iatrogenic injury, when seen early, primary repair can be performed. We do not recommend exteriorized repair. Extraperitoneal rectal injuries require proximal colostomy and distal washout, with drainage where appropriate. Blunt devitalizing injury is relatively more common in Australia than in the USA and therefore there is less indication here for primary repair. Colostomy remains an important consideration in operative management.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.

AB  - Summary Burns are classified by cause and mechanism, as well as by extent (expressed as percentage of total body surface area or TBSA) and depth. Inhalation injury is caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion or chemical powders and vapours. Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis for a given extent of cutaneous injury. Timely initiation of appropriate first aid (20 minutes of cool running water for thermal injuries) minimises the extent of tissue damage. Extensive burns constitute major trauma and may be associated with multi-trauma. Patients with major burns require primary and secondary survey, and active resuscitation according to a formula related to size of burn. Burn wounds evolve and require regular review and appropriate dressings. Deep circumferential burns may require escharotomy. Extensive burns are associated with systemic effects, which are a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory response that involves all organs and necessitates provision of critical and multidisciplinary care. Surgical management of extensive burns entails early excision of all necrotic tissue, temporisation of the wound with skin substitutes, and timely grafting according to an established algorithm.

AB  - Abstract Background The pathway from acute trauma care to inpatient rehabilitation has not been previously studied in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of patients transferred from a trauma service to its ?in-house? rehabilitation service (Group A) compared with outcomes of patients transferred from a designated trauma centre to an external rehabilitation service (Group B). This is carried out to identify any inefficiencies, delays and opportunities for improvement. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using linked registry data. This study included all patients admitted after a motor vehicle collision to trauma services in NSW over the period of 2009?2012, who required inpatient rehabilitation. Those requiring specialized brain or spinal injury rehabilitation or those who went to private rehabilitation units were excluded. Results There were 249 patients in this cohort with majority (59%) in Group A and the remainder in Group B. There was no significant difference between the age of the patients, injury severity or acute length of stay (LOS) between the two groups. Admission and discharge functional independence measure scores were also similar between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the LOS in rehabilitation (30 days for Group A compared with 40 days in Group B, P?=?0.02). Conclusions Transferring patients to an external rehabilitation service from a designated trauma service is less efficient than providing the same care by the ?in-house? rehabilitation service. There may be opportunities to improve the efficiency of trauma management and reduce costs.
