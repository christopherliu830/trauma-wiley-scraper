AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives To explore aspects that promote and challenge long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower. Background Considerable research has been devoted to ICU patients? experiences; however, research on long-term ICU patients is limited. Studies in a health-promoting perspective focusing on long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower are scarce. Design A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, using in-depth interviews. Methods Seventeen long-term Norwegian ICU patients were interviewed once, at 6?18 months after ICU discharge. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research was used (Data S1). Results The lived experience of the phenomenon ?inner strength and willpower? and what promotes and challenges this phenomenon in long-term ICU patients were represented by four main themes and nine subthemes. Promoting aspects comprised of two main themes and five subthemes: (a) ?No doubt about coming back to life? with subthemes; ?Strong connectedness to life; feeling alive and present,? ?Meaning and purpose; feeling valuable to somebody.? (b) ?How to ignite and maintain the spark of life,? with the subthemes: ?Practical solutions, coping skills from previous life experiences,? ?Provocative and inspiring experiences? and ?Vivid dream experiences that ignite the willpower.? Two main categories and four subcategories represented challenging aspects: (a) Exhaustion, weakness and discomfort; subthemes; ?Physical challenges? and ?Mental discomfort? and (b) ?Tiring delusions,? subthemes; ?Living in the worst horror movie? and ?Feeling trapped.? Conclusion This study expands on previous studies by providing insights about what promotes and challenges long-term ICU patients? inner strength and willpower during their recovery trajectory. Relevance to clinical practice Insights into the variety of long-term ICU patients? experiences during the recovery trajectory are important for ICU nurses to support and facilitate ICU patients? inner strength and willpower.

AB  - Background Limited data Exists ? on the Australian epidemiology of renal trauma, with very few studies published in the literature. The authors aim to detail the trends of renal trauma in the coastal city of the Gold Coast. Methods Retrospective data collection yielded 81 patients who sustained renal trauma from our 3-year period. Data included information on demographics, mechanism, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade, presence of haematuria, associated injuries, management, and complications. Results Male patients accounted for 83% (n = 67) of cases, and the average age of all injuries was 36 years. Low-grade AAST Grade I?III injuries comprised of 76% (n = 62) of injuries, AAST Grade IV contributed to 20% (n = 16) and 4% (n = 3) of injuries were AAST Grade V. The most common mechanism of injury was road accidents accounting for 35% (n = 28) followed by fall-related injuries (26%, n = 21). Other mechanisms included sport-related (13.5%, n = 11), non-motorized bicycle injuries (8.5%, n = 7), alleged assault (8.5%, n = 7), pedestrian injuries (5%, n = 4) and horse-related injuries (2%, n = 2). Ninety-six percent (n = 78) of kidney injuries were managed conservatively. Of the patients requiring intervention, all were AAST Grade V kidney injuries. Conclusion Males accounted for the majority of renal trauma cases, similar to the 3:1 ratio of male-to-female injuries found in other studies. In line with other studies, renal trauma reviewed on the Gold Coast also revealed road trauma as the leading cause, closely followed by falls. The majority of high-grade renal trauma was managed conservatively.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with the retrievable Cook Celect inferior vena cava (IVC) filter (William Cook, Europe) with regard to insertion, efficiency, ease of retrieval, and any associated complications. A retrospective review was performed of 115 patients (41 female, 74 male, mean age 47.97?years) who underwent Cook Celect IVC filter insertion between December 2005 and October 2007. Filter insertion was successful in all patients. Of the 115 filters inserted, 57 have been successfully retrieved (49.6%) to date. The successful retrieval rate from attempted retrieval was 93.4%. The mean dwell time of successfully retrieved filters was 114.9?days (range 14?267?days). Failed retrievals were due to a thrombosed vena cava (n?=?1) and endothelialisation of the filter (n?=?3). In the failed retrieval group the mean implantation time was 142?days (range 78?211?days). While this is the first retrospective clinical study on the Cook Celect filter, results to date are promising. We demonstrated an efficacious filter with a high successful retrieval rate of 93.4% and a low complication rate. The filter was assessed with extended dwell times (range 14?267?days). Failed retrieval secondary to hook endothelialisation continues to be an issue with this filter. We recognize that a limitation of our study was the lack of systematic follow-up for clinically silent complications. Further studies to evaluate longer term outcomes and effectiveness of this filter are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To determine injuries significantly associated with traumatic thoracic spine (T-spine) fractures Methods:? This was a case?control study undertaken in an adult trauma centre. Cases were patients admitted with a traumatic T-spine fracture between January 1999 and August 2007. Each case had two controls matched for sex, age (±5?years) and injury severity classification (major/minor). Data were collected from patient medical records and the trauma service database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine injuries significantly associated with T-spine fracture. Results:? Two hundred and sixty-one cases and 512 controls were enrolled. In both groups, mean age was 41?years and 70% of patients were male. Univariate analysis revealed a range of injuries that were significantly more common among the cases, especially cervical and lumbar spine injuries, sternal/scapular/clavicular/rib fractures, pneumo/haemothorax and pulmonary contusions (P < 0.01). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were significantly more common among the controls (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures were positively associated with T-spine fracture (P < 0.001). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were negatively associated with T-spine injury (P < 0.001). Conclusion:? Cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures are significantly associated with T-spine fracture. The presence of these injuries should raise suspicion of concomitant T-spine injury.

AB  - Background Acute abdomen is a time-critical condition, which requires prompt diagnosis, initiation of first-line preoperative therapy and expedient surgical intervention. The earliest opportunity to intervene occurs at presentation to the emergency department triage. The aim of this audit was to evaluate the relationship between emergency triage and time performance measures in the preoperative management of abdominal emergencies. Methods Retrospective audit of time performance measures of key clinical events from emergency triage. Patient characteristics, elapsed time from triage to commencement of fluid resuscitation, intravenous antibiotics and emergency surgery and post-operative outcomes were obtained from review of operative medical records data over a 1-year duration. Results There was variability in triage allocation of patients with acute abdomen requiring urgent surgery. Category 3 was the most commonly assigned triage category (65.6%). The majority of patients (94.8%) had initial clinical assessment within the National Emergency Access Target ?4-hour? rule, and 41.7% seen within 1-h from triage. Despite this, in cases of intra-abdominal sepsis, there was nearly a fourfold elapsed time for first dose intravenous antibiotics, beyond the 1-h recommendation in the Sepsis Kills pathway. There was non-significant trend in faster overall time performances with successive higher triage category allocation. Conclusion This study highlights an opportunity to consider alternative triage methods or fast-track of patients with acute abdomen to promote early surgical assessment, resuscitation, antibiotic therapy and definitive intervention.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background:? There is an increasing trend towards early mobilisation post-split skin grafting of the lower limbs. This study was performed to determine if early mobilisation impacts negatively on graft healing and patient morbidity. Methods:? A retrospective review of 48 cases of lower limb split skin grafts performed by the plastic surgery department at Royal Perth Hospital was undertaken. Patients were stratified into early and late mobilisation groups. Results:? No difference in outcome was identified with early mobilisation, but an increased rate of deconditioning with increased length of stay was present with late mobilisation. Conclusion:? These results suggest that early mobilisation post-split skin grafting of the lower limb is beneficial to patient care and is associated with lower morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

Results A significant increase of substance-caused deaths with respect to the previous 4 years has been highlighted. Most of the subjects were young males, more than half were not Spanish. Males prevailed also amongst the victims of traffic accidents and suicides. The most commonly involved substances included MDMA, alcohol, cocaine, THC, opiates and prescription drugs. Conclusions Although the use of NPS is rapidly increasing in Europe, according to the results from our sample, alcohol and well-known stimulants (MDMA and cocaine) are still the substances of abuse mainly involved in the cases of substance-caused and substance-related fatalities. The significant increase of fatalities in Ibiza in the last 5 years is an issue that must be taken into account and should be better investigated, as other theories besides NPS-increased diffusion should be proposed, and therefore, targeted prevention strategies should be designed.

Relevant statistics for all patients were entered or calculated: demographics, length of stay, comorbidity and complications were available. After Variance Analysis, age-standardised rates of trauma were tested using confidence intervals. Results:? Of 2254 admissions for trauma in 32 months, 23% were indigenous (12% of the catchment population). Upper limb injuries were significantly higher for all indigenes, these males being admitted three times as frequently as non-indigenous males. Specific lesions showed greater differences and punch injuries were prominent in both indigenous sexes. Indigenous women were much more likely to be the victims of assault or fights than other groups. Conclusions:? Personal injury costs are high in the indigenous community, in human and material terms. More resources should be directed towards injury prevention.

AB  - ABSTRACT A relatively simple computerised emergency department (ED) attendance record was installed at the Western Hospital with no increase in staffing. The system allows for the entry of patient information and file creation, triage classification, diagnosis and disposition details. A McDonnell Douglas ED module (1988 version), upgraded at Western Hospital, was installed one year prior to the study period. Such systems have the potential to allow data from the 4,000,000 ED annual attendances in Australia to be analysed productively. The recent interest in workload indices and casemix funding formulae has added impetus to the need to computerise ED attendance records. Data entry was performed by clerical staff at the time of registration and following discharge. Diagnostic coding was performed by hospital medical officers. The introduction of the computerised attendance records was associated with no increase in staffing and was accepted by the staff with minimum difficulty.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

Methods We retrospectively assessed hemosiderosis screening and prevalence in adult patients that received over twenty RBC units in the University Medical Centre Utrecht from 2010 till 2015. Hemosiderosis was defined as ferritin ≥1000 ?g/L. Adequate screening for chronically transfused patients was defined as any ferritin determined up to 3 months before or any moment after the last transfusion, while for patients that received all transfusions within 3 months (bulk transfusion), ferritin had to be determined after at least twenty transfusions. Results Of 471 patients, only 38.6% was adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 46.7%. Hemosiderosis prevalence was 47% in the chronic transfusion group and 12% in the bulk transfusion group. In patients transfused because of hematological malignancy or cardiothoracic surgery, respectively, 74% and 31% were adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 53% and 13%, respectively. Conclusion Hemosiderosis screening in our routine practice is suboptimal. Hemosiderosis is not an exclusive complication of multiple transfusions in the hematology ward. We recommend screening for hemosiderosis in all patients receiving multiple transfusions.
