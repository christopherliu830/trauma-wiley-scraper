AB  - Background Free-tissue transfer flaps are an effective reconstructive option for complex wounds; however, flap failure is a dreaded complication requiring timely re-exploration and salvage. The aim of this study was to determine whether salvage rates were higher in skin flaps, as opposed to muscle flaps, due to the durability of the overlying skin paddle allowing for better visual post-operative monitoring and more timely recognition of the threatened flap. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent a free flap at an Australian tertiary centre between 2004 and 2014. Data were collected on patient demographics, indication, flap type, time of recognition of the threatened flap and re-exploration outcome. Data were analysed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Student's t-test, analysis of variance and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare groups. Results There were 560 patients who underwent 573 free flaps. The most common indication was trauma. There were 58 re-explorations with a successful salvage rate of 79.3% (46/58). Overall complete flap loss rate was 2.1% (12/573). In flaps requiring re-exploration, there was a higher complete flap loss rate for muscle only flaps versus those with a skin paddle (P-value?=?0.041). Conclusion While timely recognition and re-exploration of the compromised free flap in the early postoperative setting is important in determining the flap salvage success, it is demonstrated that salvage rates are poorer for muscle only flaps compared with flaps with a skin paddle.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Objective: To describe the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of amphetamine-related presentations to a tertiary hospital emergency department (ED). Design, setting and participants: Prospective observational study of amphetamine-related presentations to the ED of the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), an adult, inner-city, tertiary referral hospital, between 3?August and 2?November 2005. For all patients presenting to the ED, the treating doctors were automatically prompted by the computerised data entry system to consider amphetamine use. Main outcome measures: Proportion of ED presentations related to amphetamine use; demographic features and usage practices of amphetamine users; characteristics of presentations and admissions; associated psychiatric illnesses and use of other drugs. Results: Over the study period, there were 13?125?presentations, of which 156?(1.2%) were judged to be causally related to amphetamine use. Of those 156?patients, over half were habitual drug users (89?[57.1%] used amphetamines at least weekly), and the majority were men (111?[71.2%]). The mean age was 28?years (range, 16?55?years). Presentations were of high acuity: 104?patients [66.7%] were rated 1, 2?or 3?on the Australasian Triage Scale; 50?(32.1%) arrived by ambulance; and 25?(16.0%) arrived with police. The mean time spent in the ED was 6?h (range, 0.5?24?h). Fifty patients (32.1%) required sedation, and the likelihood of requiring sedation increased almost threefold if the heart rate was over 100?beats/min on presentation. Sixty-two patients (39.7%) were admitted and 58?(37.2%) required psychiatric evaluation. Repeat attendance was common, with 71?patients (45.5%) having previous amphetamine-related presentations to the RPH ED. Conclusions: Amphetamine-related presentations comprise 1.2% of all ED attendances and have a major impact on hospital EDs. Patients are often agitated and aggressive, require extensive resources, and frequently re-attend. The burden of amphetamine-related illnesses on EDs is likely to increase in the future.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? Despite widespread use of methoxyflurane as an inhaled analgesic by ambulance services in Australia there are no published data as to its use pattern, efficacy and safety in the prehospital setting. We set out to characterize methoxyflurane use in children in the prehospital setting. Methods:? An observational case series was conducted over an 8?month period. Children who received methoxyflurane while being transported to a tertiary children?s hospital by ambulance were enrolled. We analysed indications for use, verbal numerical pain scores, adverse events and depth of sedation based on paramedic, patient, parent and ED staff surveys and review of ambulance care records. Results:? During the study period 105 patients were enrolled with an age range of 15?months to 17?years (median age 11?years). Methoxyflurane was mainly used for extremity injuries (82%). Paramedic pain scores dropped from a mean of 7.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.5?8.3) prior to methoxyflurane use to 4.5 (95% CI 3.9?5.0) at 2?5?min and to 3.2 (95% CI 2.8?3.7) at 10?min. There were no serious adverse events (one-sided 97.5% CI 0?3%). Mild adverse events occurred in 38 patients (36.2%; 95% CI 27.0?46.1%). Five of 15 (33.3%) patients under 5?years of age were deeply sedated. Conclusion:? In the present paediatric case series methoxyflurane appears to be an efficacious analgesic with a low adverse events profile. In young children in particular it can briefly lead to deep sedation.

AB  - The nursing department of a 154-bed acute rehabilitation facility, cognizant of the changing trends in health care and responding to feedback from staff, developed and implemented a comprehensive documentation system. The previous system had been fragmented, inconsistent, and inefficient. The development of the new system focused on the complex needs of the rehabilitation client and the equally complex standards required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), and insurance carriers. The final product, which was based on the nursing process and functional health patterns, encompassed the following areas from admission to discharge: providing feedback on clients' functional abilities and progress toward goals, satisfying requirements of the 1990 JCAHO standards, and, finally, using a flow sheet that saves nursing time and increases objectivity. This article describes the system from conceptualization to successful implementation.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - This report describes a method to teach undergraduate students the knowledge base and skills needed to maximize the educational value of a subsequent cardiothoracic surgical clerkship. Sixty-three fourth year medical students underwent a structured teaching programme in which groups of five students rotated through a series of six teaching stations. Subject material, presented during 20 min at each station, covered the key issues relating to coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, chest trauma, lung cancer, prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers, thoracic sepsis and dysphagia. Group knowledge increased significantly (P < 0.001) from a mean mark of 23% (s.d. 12) in a pre-test to a mean mark of 46% (s.d. 12) in a test conducted 1 month after the teaching. The time taken to conduct the structured teaching/assessment was 5 h compared with 32 h to run the same programme by the traditional ward tutorial system. The dollar cost to stage the structured teaching was less than that to run the traditional tutorial programme. It was concluded that the teaching method is effective, economical and practical and that it has a role in an undergraduate curriculum to prepare students for clinical clerkship.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that children with isolated linear skull fractures have excellent clinical outcomes and low risk of surgery. We wish to identify other injury patterns within the spectrum of paediatric mild head injury, which need only conservative management. Children with low risk of evolving neurosurgical lesions could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Methods We retrospectively analysed all children with mild head injury (i.e. admission Glasgow coma score 13?15) and skull fracture or haematoma on a head computed tomography scan admitted to Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney over the years 2009?2014. Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical findings, mechanism of injury, head computed tomography scan findings, neurosurgical intervention, outcome and length of admission. Wilcoxon paired test was used with P value <0.05 considered significant. Results Four hundred and ten children were analysed. Three hundred and eighty-one (93%) children were managed conservatively, 18 (4%) underwent evacuation of extradural haematoma (TBI surgery) and 11 (3%) needed fracture repair surgery. Two children evolved a surgical lesion 24 h post-admission. Only 17 of 214 children transferred from peripheral hospitals needed neurosurgery. Overall outcomes: zero deaths, one needed brain injury rehabilitation and 63 needed child protection unit intervention. Seventy-five percentage of children with non-surgical lesions were discharged within 2 days. Eighty-three percentage of road transfers were discharged within 3 days. Conclusions Children with small intracranial haematomas and/or skull fractures who need no surgery only require brief inpatient symptomatic treatment and could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Improved tertiary hospital transfer guidelines with protocols to manage clinical deterioration could have cost benefit without risking patient safety.

Methods A total of 32 patients with thoraco-lumbar fractures, selected between August 2013 and February 2016, were managed by short-segment fixation with screws at the level of the fracture, and decompression was performed only for patients with neurological deficits. The patients' functional outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score for neurological condition. All patients were followed up with radiographs. Results Patients with complete neurologic deficits (n = 3) did not show any neurologic recovery. All ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C. Five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA E. The remaining five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA D. All ASIA D patients improved to ASIA B. At the final follow-up examination, the mean anterior vertebral height was 21?±?5?mm, indicating no significant height loss during the follow-up period. Conclusion Short-segment fixation of TL fractures with inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers good correction of segmental kyphosis, vertebral wedging, and vertebral height loss.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Victoria's new trauma care system has been followed by reductions in preventable and potentially preventable deaths and in deficiencies contributing to death. This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - Abstract Background The rate of hospitalization in elderly patients because of falls is increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term trends in injury profiles of low-energy falls and to identify injuries associated with need for in-patient rehabilitation. Methods A single-centre retrospective study was performed at an inner city Major Trauma Centre in Sydney. Trauma registry data were obtained from patients who were 65 years of age or over with low-energy falls (trip and fall from height ≤1?m, including falls from standing) from the trauma registry between January 2000 and December 2011. Demographic data, time and date of presentation and injury characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interests were proportions of hip fractures, head injuries and discharge to in-patient rehabilitation facilities. Results A total of 4964 cases were identified. There was a 6.5% per annum decrease in the proportion of elderly patients with low-energy falls who sustained hip fractures compared with a relative increase in severe head injuries, 5.7% per annum. Around 25% of patients were transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Severe head injuries and lower-limb injuries were the two injuries most associated with transfer to in-patient rehabilitation. Conclusion In elderly patients with low-energy falls, a significant decrease in hip fractures was associated with a rise in severe head injuries over the past decade.

AB  - Summary What is known and Objective:? Literature provides much evidence regarding liposomal amphotericin B treatment for fungal infections in neonates and infants. Relevant data regarding critically ill paediatric patients of older age are scarce. We aimed to present our experience regarding liposomal amphotericin B use in critically ill paediatric patients from a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Athens, Greece. Methods:? We prospectively identified all paediatric patients who received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-care paediatric hospital during a 3-year period (2005?2008). Data were retrieved from the evaluation of the available medical records. Results and Discussion:? Twenty-three (nine females, mean age: 26·4?months, range: 5?39 months) critically ill paediatric patients were included; 12 had malignancy. In 16 of the 23 included children, liposomal amphotericin B was administered for the treatment of confirmed fungal infections (all but one were invasive), whereas in seven patients, it was used as pre-emptive treatment. One patient received voriconazole concomitantly. Eleven of the 16 children with documented infections were cured; five improved. Six of the seven children who received pre-emptive treatment also showed clinical improvement. Nine deaths were noted, all attributed to underlying diseases. Two cases of hepatotoxicity and one case of nephrotoxicity (all leading to drug-discontinuation) occurred. Seven and five cases of mild reversible hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, respectively, were also noted. What is new and Conclusion:? According to the findings of our small case series, liposomal amphotericin B may provide a useful treatment option for fungal infections of vulnerable critically ill paediatric patients with considerable comorbidity.
