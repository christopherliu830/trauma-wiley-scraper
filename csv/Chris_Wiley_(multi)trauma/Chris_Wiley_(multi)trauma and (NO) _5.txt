AB  - Abstract Objectives: To review emergency sedation intubation as practised in the Melbourne-based ambulance helicopter. Specifically, to describe patient profiles, drug dosage, difficulties encountered, success rate and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of all helicopter primary and secondary retrieval patients, who received application of the emergency sedation intubation protocol using morphine and diazepam during a 3 year period (January 1995 to December 1997). Data were collected from an audit of patient care records completed by flight paramedics and from hospital records. Results: Emergency sedation intubation was performed on 128 patients: 103 adults and 25 children. The median dose of drugs required for emergency sedation intubation by adult patients was 20 mg morphine and 20 mg diazepam. The overall success rate for emergency sedation intubation was 94.5%, with 73.6% of these being successful intubations at the first attempt. On intubation, 54.1% of patients were fully relaxed, while a gag reflex was still present in 45.9% of patients during or just after emergency sedation intubation. Twenty-two per cent of patients had a change in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg. The maximum rise in blood pressure was 60 mmHg and the maximum fall was 80 mmHg. Conclusions: Flight paramedics achieved a high success rate for intubation with the morphine/ diazepam emergency sedation intubation protocol. However, there was still a significant percentage of patients for whom more than one attempt was required to achieve emergency sedation intubation and, in almost half the patients, gag reflexes remained present either during or immediately after intubation. Additionally, some patients experienced blood pressure changes following intubation that may have potential adverse consequences in terms of compromised cerebral perfusion or rises in intracranial pressure. Consideration should be given to revision of the protocol to allow the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and alternative airway management techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, for specified circumstances in the aeromedical environment.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Abstract Background Many authors advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis of pancreatitis and a cut-off level of three or more times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is often quoted. The literature contains no systematic review that explores alternative causes of a lipase level over three times as high as the ULN. Such a review was therefore the objective of this study. Methods The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1985 to August 2013) were searched for all eligible articles. Predetermined data were extracted and independently analysed by two reviewers. Results In total, data from 58 studies were included in the final analysis. The following causes other than pancreatitis of lipase levels exceeding three times the ULN were found: reduced clearance of lipase caused by renal impairment or macrolipase formation; other hepatobiliary, gastroduodenal, intestinal and neoplastic causes; critical illness, including neurosurgical pathology; alternative pancreatic diagnoses, such as non-pathological pancreatic hyperenzymaemia, and miscellaneous causes such as diabetes, drugs and infections. Conclusions A series of differential diagnoses for significant serum lipase elevations (i.e. exceeding three times the ULN) has been provided by this study. Clinicians should utilize this knowledge in the interpretation and management of patients who have lipase levels over three times as high as the ULN, remaining vigilant for an alternative diagnosis to pancreatitis. The medical officer should be aware of the possibility of incorrect diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient.

AB  - Background In health, the hormones amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) slow gastric emptying (GE) and modulate glycaemia. The aims of this study were to determine amylin and GLP-1 concentrations in the critically ill and their relationship with GE, glucose absorption and glycaemia. Methods In fasted critically ill and healthy subjects (n?=?26 and 23 respectively), liquid nutrient, containing 100?mg 13C-sodium octanoate and 3?g 3-O-methlyglucose (3-OMG), was administered via a nasogastric tube. Amylin, GLP-1, glucose and 3-OMG concentrations were measured in blood samples taken during fasting, and 30 min and 60?min after the ?meal?. Breath samples were taken to determine gastric emptying coefficient (GEC). Intolerance to intragastric feeding was defined as a gastric residual volume of ≥?250?ml and/or vomiting within the 24?h prior to the study. Results Although GE was slower (GEC: critically ill 2.8?±?0.9 vs. health, 3.4?±?0.2; P?=?0.002), fasting blood glucose was higher (7.0?±?1.9 vs. 5.7?±?0.2?mmol/l; P?=?0.005) and overall glucose absorption was reduced in critically ill patients (3-OMG: 9.4?±?8.0 vs. 17.7?±?4.9?mmol/l.60?min; P?<?0.001), there were no differences in fasting or postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, although fasting [1.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 0.7 (0.3?32.0)?pmol/l; P?=?0.04] and postprandial [3.0 (0.4?8.5) vs. 0.8 (0.4?34.3)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02] GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the critically ill and were greater in feed intolerant when compared with those tolerating feed [3.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 1.2 (0.7?4.6)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02], there were no relationships between GE and fasting amylin or GLP-1 concentrations. Conclusion In the critically ill, fasting GLP-1, but not amylin, concentrations are elevated and associated with feed intolerance. Neither amylin nor GLP-1 appears to substantially influence the rate of GE.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Increasing demand for acute surgical services is one of the major challenges facing modern health systems. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of implementing a dedicated surgical assessment and review area (SARA) on patient flow for acute general surgical patients at a major teaching hospital in New Zealand. Methods:? A specific area within inpatient surgical beds was redeveloped and staffed by a dedicated surgical team. Prospective data pertaining to patient flow and outcomes were collected (10-month period) and compared with historical controls (preceding 14 months prior to implementation). Results:? During the 24-month period 9182 acute general surgical patients were admitted (3836 [41.1%] post implementation of SARA). Subsequent to the introduction of SARA, 865 (22.5%) patients were referred directly from their general practitioner. Length of stay was reduced in all patients from 2.58 to 2.04 days (P < 0.001) and in those who did not require surgery from 2.56 to 1.96 days (P < 0.001). However, the number of days in which the department of surgery had outlying patients increased significantly from 76.7% to 86.3%, P < 0.001. Conclusions:? The introduction of a dedicated SARA significantly reduced hospital stay and improved efficiencies of the emergency department.

AB  - Abstract:? Until the late 1960s, splenectomy was routinely performed in children who had sustained blunt splenic injury. There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - Summary Abdominal trauma is second only to head injury as a cause of serious injury in children, and the third most common cause of trauma-related death. The most common organs injured in blunt abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver and kidneys. When the spleen and liver are injured, intraperitoneal bleeding occurs (haemoperitoneum). In all suspected intra-abdominal injuries, the presence or absence of macroscopic blood in the urine must be established. The presence of macroscopic haematuria is strongly predictive of serious intra-abdominal injury and may form part of the basis for further investigation with a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Apart from those patients with intraperitoneal haemorrhage, extraperitoneal extravasation or haematuria, there is a difficult group with ill-defined symptoms and signs that may persist for several days after the injury. On the rare occasion of penetrating thoracic trauma, injuries to the mediastinal structures and lungs should be assumed until proven otherwise.

AB  - Aim We aimed to investigate how Australian neonatologists made decisions when incompetent patients of different ages needed resuscitation. Methods A survey including vignettes of eight incompetent patients requiring resuscitation was sent to 140 neonatologists. Patients ranged from a very preterm infant to 80 years old. While some had existing impairments, all faced risk of death or neurological sequelae. Respondents indicated whether they would resuscitate, whether they believed resuscitation was in the patients' best interests, whether they would want intervention for a family member and whether they would comply with families' wishes to withhold resuscitation. They were also asked how they would rank the eight patients in a triage situation. Results Seventy-eight per cent of specialists completed the survey. The majority of respondents gave priority to the resuscitation of children over adults. Less than 40% would agree to withhold resuscitation at families' request for all children except for the preterm infant, where 96% would comply with families' wishes to withhold intensive care despite 77% believing resuscitation to be in the infant's best interest. Conclusion This study found inconsistencies between physicians' perceptions of the patient's best interest regarding resuscitation and their willingness to comply with families' wishes to withhold resuscitation and give comfort care. Accepting a family's refusal of resuscitation was more marked for the premature infant, even among respondents who thought that resuscitation was in the patient's best interest. These findings are consistent with other international studies.

AB  - Abstract Objective Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is recommended as the initial form of acute circulatory support for many disease processes. The epidemiology of its use in the ED is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess indications, use patterns and short-term effects of FBT in a paediatric ED. Methods Retrospective observational study in the ED of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (annual census >90?000) using hospital electronic medical record data for all patients who received an i.v. fluid bolus in the ED over the calendar year 2018 were included in the study. We extracted demographics, indications, volume, content of FBT as well as subsequent vital sign and biochemical changes. Results One thousand five hundred and thirty-nine fluid boluses were administered to 1343/90?000 children (1.5%), 1185 received 1, 123 received 2, 32 received 3, and 3 received 4 boluses. Fluid bolus volume of 10 mL/kg was used in 45.3%, 20?mL/kg in 35.7%, 500?mL in 6.4% and 1000?mL in 7.1%. The fluid content was 0.9% saline in 99.9% of cases. The most common indications for FBT were: vomiting/diarrhoea (23%), acute febrile illness (11%) and pneumonia or sepsis (10% each). FBT was associated with a reduction in median heart rate by 6 beats per minute (P?<?0.01), reduction in mean blood pressure by 3?mmHg (P?<?0.01), and reduction in venous lactate by 0.2?mmol/L (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Fluid bolus therapy is a commonly used intervention in the paediatric ED, most often for dehydration. Variability in indications, dose and effects of FBT warrant further exploration.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract Objective Primarily to determine mid-term functional outcome for patients with distal radius fracture (DRF) and to compare this between operative and conservatively managed patients. Secondarily to examine for differences in age, gender and number of instability factors between management groups. Methods Eligible patients (age 18?years or more, closed DRF managed to completion of care within Monash Health), presenting between 1 January and 31 December 2016. Completion of the patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) questionnaire was sought at 6?12 months post-injury. Management was noted (operative or conservative). Age, sex and number of defined instability factors present (dorsal angulation >20°, intra-articular fracture, associated ulna fracture, dorsal comminution, radial shortening >2 mm) are reported and compared between management groups. Results Of 369 eligible patients, 199 (54%) completed a PRWE. Median age was 60?years (interquartile range [IQR] 45?71), 150 (75%) were women, median number of instability factors present was 2 (IQR 1?4) and 45 (23%) underwent operative management. Difference in PRWE scores between operative and conservatively managed patients was not significant (20 [IQR 7?36] vs 16 [IQR 5?35]). Differences in age and gender between management groups were not significant. Significantly more in the operative group had presence of four or more instability factors (44% [95% confidence interval 30?60] vs 20% [14?27]). Conclusion The mid-term median PRWE score was 18 (IQR 5?36). This was not significantly different between operative and conservatively managed patients. Operation was more likely when four or more instability factors were present.

AB  - Abstract Objective This is an overview of the cellular biology of upper nasal mucosal cells that have special characteristics that enable them to be used to diagnose and study congenital neurological diseases and to aid neural repair. Study Design After mapping the distribution of neural cells in the upper nose, the authors' investigations moved to the use of olfactory neurones to diagnose neurological diseases of development, especially schizophrenia. Olfactory-ensheathing glial cells (OEGs) from the cranial cavity promote axonal penetration of the central nervous system and aid spinal cord repair in rodents. The authors sought to isolate these cells from the more accessible upper nasal cavity in rats and in humans and prove they could likewise promote neural regeneration, making these cells suitable for human spinal repair investigations. Methods The schizophrenia-diagnosis aspect of the study entailed the biopsy of the olfactory areas of 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 control subjects. The tissue samples were sliced and grown in culture medium. The ease of cell attachment to fibronectin (artificial epithelial basement membrane), as well as the mitotic and apoptotic indices, was studied in the presence and absence of dopamine in those cell cultures. The neural repair part of the study entailed a harvesting and insertion of first rat olfactory lamina propria rich in OEGs between cut ends of the spinal cords and then later the microinjection of an OEG-rich suspension into rat spinal cords previously transected by open laminectomy. Further studies were done in which OEG insertion was performed up to 1 month after rat cord transection and also in monkeys. Results Schizophrenic patients' olfactory tissues do not easily attach to basement membrane compared with control subjects, adding evidence to the theory that cell wall anomalies are part of the schizophrenic ?lesion? of neurones. Schizophrenic patient cell cultures had higher mitotic and apoptotic indices compared with control subjects. The addition of dopamine altered these indices enough to allow accurate differentiation of schizophrenics from control patients, leading to, possibly for the first time, an early objective diagnosis of schizophrenia and possible assessment of preventive strategies. OEGs from the nose were shown to be as effective as those from the olfactory bulb in promoting axonal growth across transected spinal cords even when added 1 month after injury in the rat. These otherwise paraplegic rats grew motor and proprioceptive and fine touch fibers with corresponding behavioral improvement. Conclusions The tissues of the olfactory mucosa are readily available to the otolaryngologist. Being surface cells, they must regenerate (called ?neurogenesis?). Biopsy of this area and amplification of cells in culture gives the scientist a ?window to the developing brain,? including early diagnosis of schizophrenia. The ?Holy Grail? of neurological disease is the cure of traumatic paraplegia and OEGs from the nose promote that repair. The otolaryngologist may become the necessary partner of the neurophysiologist and spinal surgeon to take the laboratory potential of paraplegic cure into the day-to-day realm of clinical reality.

AB  - Summary The inflammatory response to acute injury among humans has proved difficult to study due to the significant heterogeneity encountered in actual patients. We set out to characterize the immune response to a model injury with reduced heterogeneity, a tracheostomy, among stable critical care patients, using a broad cytokine panel and clinical data. Twenty-three critical care patients undergoing percutaneous bedside tracheostomies were recruited in a medical intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected at five intervals during 24-h peri-procedure. Patients were followed-up for 28 days for clinical outcomes. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the cytokines between the five time-points when studied as a whole cohort. Longitudinal analysis of the cytokine patterns at the individual patient level with a clustering algorithm showed that, notwithstanding the significant heterogeneity observed, the patients? cytokine responses can be classified into three broad patterns that show increasing, decreasing or no major changes from the baseline. This analytical approach also showed statistically significant associations between cytokines, with those most likely to be associated being interleukin (IL)-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and ferritin, as well as a strong tri-way correlation between GCSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP1?). In conclusion, in this standard human model of soft tissue injury, by applying longitudinal analysis at the individual level, we have been able to identify the cytokine patterns underlying the seemingly random, heterogeneous patient responses. We have also identified consistent cytokine interactions suggesting that IL-6, GCSF, MCP1 and MIP1? are the cytokines most probably driving the immune response to this injury.
