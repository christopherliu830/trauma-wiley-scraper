AB  - Salutogenic design is all about encouraging active health rather than merely treating illness. Biophilic design is all about engaging with nature to help in the healing process. Here, Richard Mazuch, a healthcare specialist at global design and technology firm IBI Group, presents several of their recent projects around the UK that illustrate these concepts in practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background There is a change in paradigm in intensive care units with trends towards lighter sedation. Light or no sedation protocols are, however, a radical change for clinical practice and can cause challenges for the patients. Undergoing mechanical ventilation when conscious can be a distressing experience for the patients. Receiving a tracheostomy increases patient comfort, but some patients still undergo prolonged endotracheal intubation during mechanical ventilation. The experience of being conscious during endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit has not previously been described. Aims The aim of the study was to explore adult intensive care unit patients' experience of being conscious during endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Design Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews and four patients were enrolled. Data were collected at two multidisciplinary intensive care units in Denmark. Method Data were analysed using Ricoeur's theory of interpretation, using the method described by Dreyer and Pedersen. The scientific tradition was phenomenological-hermeneutic. Result During the analysis, three themes emerged: (1) The tube in the throat. (2) To be conscious but feeling doped. (3) When passing of time is dragging on. Conclusion The findings shed a light over the experience of being conscious during endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. A no-sedation protocol may cause problems for the patients both of a physical and an existential character, but despite this, patients seem positive towards being conscious. Relevance to clinical practice The study suggests that clinical nursing practice may have to be further developed to accommodate the patients' needs, e.g. communicating and participating as well as optimizing nursing interventions towards thirst, pain and tube management. Furthermore, the intensive care unit setting may need revision, providing space for the patient and sensory meaningful inputs in the technologically intense environment.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aims to describe the implementation of a primary practitioner physiotherapy service within a large regional ED and to evaluate its impact on waiting time and length of stay. Methods Integration and scope of practice of the physiotherapy service within the ED were described. Retrospective analysis of waiting time and length of stay data for the 3 years, 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011, was performed. The performance of the physiotherapy service was compared with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) waiting time guidelines, the Victorian Department of Health length of stay targets and to a similar group of patients seen by medical staff. Results The primary practitioner physiotherapy service saw 5641 patients of which 33% were less than 18 years old. The most common presentations seen by the service were limb fractures, soft tissue injuries and low back pain. Ninety-two per?cent of patients were seen within the ACEM waiting time guidelines, and 91% of patients who went home were discharged within 4?h. Non-randomised comparisons with similar patients seen by medical staff indicated that patients seen by the physiotherapy practitioner service had shorter waiting times and length of stay. Conclusions The current study found that patients with musculoskeletal problems seen by a primary practitioner physiotherapy service had improved waiting times and length of stay relative to ACEM and Victorian Department of Health targets, and though constrained by a retrospective non-randomised design, to a similar group of patients seen by medical staff. Further evaluation of the physiotherapy practitioner service is required.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.

To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY After-hours radiological procedures are essential but expensive in any major teaching hospital. Using the criteria that radiological procedures performed after-hours should have a reasonable probability of influencing or changing patient management acutely, a study of the justification of after-hours radiological procedures was performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Computer print-outs were used to select the patients based on the dates and times of the procedures. Their charts were then reviewed. The study found that most after-hours radiological procedures were justified. However, it also identified certain procedures that need not be performed or at least could be reduced after-hours. The procedures were: (i) computed tomography (CT) head ? epilepsy, meningitis; (ii) CT abdomen ? trauma (intubated) ? unable to examine abdomen; (iii) CT spine ? obvious unstable fractures; (iv) Ultrasound abdomen ? biliary colic (afebrile); and (v) Ultrasound kidneys ? renal failure (afebrile).

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess emergency department (ED) doctors? knowledge of radiation doses associated with diagnostic imaging and to describe their practice with regard to informing patients of risk. Design, participants and setting: Prospective, questionnaire-based observational study in May 2009 among all 110 doctors in the EDs of a 570-bed teaching hospital and a 200-bed district hospital. Main outcome measures: Percentage knowledge score; and frequency of discussing radiation risk with patients, based on responses to three scenarios rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where a score of 100 indicates doctors would always discuss it. Results: 96 doctors (87%) completed the questionnaire. The overall mean knowledge score was 40% (95% CI, 38%?43%). Senior doctors scored somewhat higher than junior doctors, but not significantly (42% v 39%; P = 0.75). Over three-quarters of doctors (78%) underestimated the lifetime risk of fatal cancer attributable to a single computed tomography scan of the abdomen. Most doctors (76%) reported never having had any formal training on risks to patients from radiation exposure. The frequency at which doctors would inform patients of the risk of radiation varied greatly depending on the clinical scenario (mean VAS scores, between 38 and 90). Conclusion: Emergency doctors in our sample had a varied knowledge of the risks from radiation exposure, but overall knowledge was poor. Staff should receive education, and the diagnostic imaging request process may need to include information on radiation doses and risks.

AB  - Background Simulation-based medical education, often used for teaching teamwork, can be conducted in different settings: off-site (simulation centers or other settings away from clinical units) or in situ (real clinical environment), where the latter can be either announced or unannounced. Simulation in general, but especially unannounced in situ simulation, has been described as stressful and stress can affect learning. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and the perception of learning and stress. Methods Sixteen standardized in situ simulations were planned in an emergency department on eight predetermined dates, with one unannounced and one announced simulation per day. Authentic ad hoc teams were formed based on the on-call staff and included doctors, nurses, radiographers, biochemist, porters, and secretaries. Data were collected using questionnaires and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results Eleven of the 16 in situ simulations were completed. Self-perceived learning was ?good? or ?very good? for 27/47 (57%) participants and 33/50 (66%) in unannounced vs announced in situ simulation (P = 0.33). Two of 47 (4%) in unannounced in situ simulation ?agreed or partly agreed? that in situ simulation was stressful or unpleasant vs 12/50 (24%) in announced in situ simulation (P = 0.06). Conclusion No significant difference was found between unannounced and announced in situ simulation among emergency department staff according to self-perceived learning and self-perceived stress. This is relevant for the future planning of simulation when considering what is to be achieved from implementing different designs for simulation-based medical education.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? The aim of this study was to describe peoples? experiences of a personal diary written when they were critically ill and receiving care in an intensive care unit (ICU). Background:? In some ICUs, diaries are written by the ICU staff and close relatives of those who are critically ill and mechanically ventilated, but there is a lack of studies that focus on the experiences of the formerly critically ill of personal diaries written when in an ICU. Methods:? Qualitative personal interviews were conducted with nine people who were formerly critically ill. The interview texts were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings:? From the analysis of the data, one theme emerged ? touching a tender wound, with four categories: being afraid and being deeply touched, appreciating close relatives? notes, a feeling of unreality and gaining coherence. The participants were deeply touched when they read the diary for the first time. Parts of it were experienced as unreal, as if they were reading about someone else. The diary provided necessary knowledge about what had happened during the time when the participants were critically ill and from which they had only fragmented or no memories at all. Even though it aroused strong feelings, reading the diary was experienced as an important support for a long time after their stay in the ICU. Experiencing that one was not fully aware of what had happened and then reading about oneself being critically ill and about one?s close relatives? experiences was interpreted as touching a tender wound. Conclusions and relevance to clinical practice:? It is suggested that a diary may be a tool that can help formerly critically ill people to gain a sense of coherence concerning their critical illness experience, but reading it can be painful and demanding.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to test whether focus groups involving medical students, house officers, senior doctors, and nurses could identify an undergraduate emergency medicine core curriculum. Method:? From May 2001 to January 2002, we interviewed 12 homogenous focus groups within all 88 participants. Three focus groups were composed of medical students; three of house officers, three of senior doctors, and three focus groups were composed of nurses. Each interview lasted 2?h. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using qualitative methods. Results:? The focus groups suggested and discussed in all 196 objectives. Students, physicians, and nurses agreed that newly graduated physicians should master history taking, 21 clinical disorders, 15 practical skills, interpretation of two diagnostic tests, two general diagnostic skills, and two leadership skills. Apart from these 43 core objectives, disagreement was substantial. Participants gave very different priorities to communication, knowledge about clinical disorders, practical clinical skills, leadership, and ?the art of medicine?. Conclusion:? In conclusion, focus groups could identify an emergency medicine core curriculum. However, participants had very different perspectives on the curriculum. Focus groups could be one very practicable part of seeking consensus on what is core and securing local roots and ownership to an undergraduate emergency medicine curriculum before and during implementation.

AB  - Abstract Background Adequate nutrition is linked to improved patient outcomes during critical illness. Nutrition care is further enhanced by registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) order-writing privileges, which improve the implementation of nutrition interventions. The purpose of this performance improvement project was to evaluate the effect of RDN order-writing privileges on enteral nutrition (EN) order compliance and nutrition delivery in selected intensive care units (ICUs) at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Methods Patients admitted to selected ICUs from January 23, 2018, to January 25, 2018, were screened for eligibility. Demographic and nutrition data were collected retrospectively from the electronic health record. Percent of energy and protein needs met were calculated. Data were compared with historical internal controls identified prior to RDN order-writing privileges. Results Fifty adult patients (150 EN days) were included in data analysis, with 93 patients (279 EN days) included in historical data. Compared with historical data, cumulative EN order compliance increased by 17% and tube feed infusion rate compliance by 15% post-RDN order-writing privileges. Mean (± SD) protein needs delivered significantly increased from 72.1 ± 28.6% to 89.1 ± 24.8% after RDN order-writing implementation (P < 0.001). Conclusions RDN order-writing privileges improved EN order compliance and significantly improved protein delivery in selected ICUs. Future studies are recommended to confirm these results and determine if other variables besides protein delivery are statistically significant with a larger sample size.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the incidence and significance of novel plasma derived platelet aggregating activity (PAA) in 190 consecutive patients admitted to the medical wards of a general hospital. Seventy five patients (39%) demonstrated this activity. The incidence was highest in patients with a history of thrombosis (52%) or in those with a heightened thrombotic tendency, for example, patients with diabetes or hypertension. In contrast, platelet aggregating activity was observed in six out of 62 patients (approximately 10%) in whom a current or past medical history of thrombosis could not be elicited and in only two out of 72 healthy volunteers examined (3%). A high frequency of PAA was also noted in a small group of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia and patients who had previously received, platelet transfusions. In these patients, this activity presumably reflects the presence of antiplatelet antibodies. A good correlation between the presence of plasma derived platelet aggregating activity and the phenomenon of spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. The platelet aggregating activity was not heparin dependent, but was completely abolished by EDTA (5 mM) and benzamidine (8 mM), or by pretreating the platelets with aspirin. A synergistic response was observed with subaggregatory concentrations of thrombin and adrenalin. Our results suggest that the presence of this platelet aggregating activity may provide a marker for vascular thrombosis. Furthermore we postulate that this plasma derived activity may be partly responsible for platelet hyperactivity previously observed in patients with thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore undergraduate physiotherapy students' expectations and preconceptions of undertaking a rural/regional clinical placement and determine if these preconceptions differ between regional and metropolitan-based students. Design Data was collected via focus groups and analysed via thematic analysis of emerging themes. Setting All focus groups were undertaken in tutorial rooms at the participating universities between classes at a time convenient to participants. Participants Undergraduate physiotherapy students yet to complete a major clinical placement were invited to participate. Second year physiotherapy students from regional and metropolitan universities were recruited to form focus groups, allowing comparison between the two groups. Four metropolitan students and nine regional students made up the sample size. Results Three major themes were identified via thematic analysis of transcripts; socio-cultural factors, education and professional factors. The significance of socio-cultural factors was far beyond what was expected to be found. Regional students did not generally have a more accurate perspective of rural/regional placement and voiced more concerns about missing out on educational opportunities. Conclusions Rural/regional clinical educators need to be mindful of creating quality experiences with caseloads appropriate for the specific placement's requirements. The impact of external socio-cultural factors must be acknowledged. Supervision strategies must be put in place to ensure students on rural/regional clinical placements are well supported to achieve a successful outcome for student and educator.

AB  - Acquired neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) frequently develops in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 1?week. CIPNM may present with muscle weakness and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, but is discovered more often and earlier by electrophysiological examination. In this review, the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of CIPNM will be described. Risk factors for CIPNM are sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the severity of multi-organ failure. Presence of CIPNM is associated with higher mortality rate, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged rehabilitation. The majority of survivors with CIPNM have persistent functional disabilities and a reduced quality of life. There is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize CIPNM in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Summary Low donor supply and the high demand for transplantable organs is an international problem. The efficiency of organ procurement is often expressed by donor conversion rates (DCRs). These rates differ among countries, but a uniform starting point for defining a potential heart-beating donor is lacking. Imprecise definitions cause confusion; therefore, we call for a reproducible method like imminent brain death (IBD), which contains criteria in detail to determine potential heart-beating donors. Medical charts of 4814 patients who died on an ICU in Dutch university hospitals between January 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed for potential heart-beating donors. We compared two starting points: ?Severe Brain Damage? (SBD) (old definition) and IBD (new definition), which differ in the number of absent brainstem reflexes. Of the potential donors defined by IBD 45.6% fulfilled the formal brain death criteria, compared with 33.6% in the larger SBD group. This results in a higher DCR in the IBD group (40% vs. 29.5%). We illustrated important differences in DCRs when using two different definitions, even within one country. To allow comparison among countries and hospitals, one universal definition of a potential heart-beating donor should be used. Therefore, we propose the use of IBD.
