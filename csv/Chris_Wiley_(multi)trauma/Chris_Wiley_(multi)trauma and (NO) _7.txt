AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness is an aetiologically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome that is characterised by organ failure and immune dysfunction. Mortality in critically ill patients is driven by inflammation-associated organ damage and a profound vulnerability to nosocomial infection. Both factors are influenced by the activated complement protein C5a, released by unbridled activation of the complement system during critical illness. C5a exerts deleterious effects on organ systems directly and suppresses antimicrobial functions of key immune cells. Whilst several recent reports have added key knowledge of the cellular signalling pathways triggered by C5a, there remain a number of areas that are incompletely understood and therapeutic opportunities are still being evaluated. In this review, we summarise the cellular basis for C5a-induced vulnerability to nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction. We focus on cells of the innate immune system, highlighting the major areas in need of further research and potential avenues for targeted therapies.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The Canterbury earthquake of 22 February 2011 initiated a mass casualty event for Christchurch Hospital, which suffered damage itself, and faced logistical difficulties in continued operation. Radiology was part of the hospital-wide response. This paper reviews the radiology department response and surveys opinions of emergency doctors to provide an overview of events of the day and thoughts regarding any potential future response. Methods Two main approaches were undertaken: (i) informal data gathering and discussions with staff including radiographers, sonographers, radiologists, emergency doctors and others present on the day regarding their experiences; and (ii) survey of emergency doctors regarding their experiences and recommendations. A comparison with other similar events was also conducted. Results (1) Diagnostic radiology services were initially constrained by a lack of power and lift access. Usual imaging and reporting pathways were interrupted. Alternative processes were initiated to ensure an ongoing radiology service with available resources. Lessons were learned and changes implemented locally.(2) Survey data confirmed several primary outcomes: (i) Ultrasound was crucial while CT was down; (ii) all available imaging modalities remain important in a disaster response; and (iii) preliminary reports from radiologists in the emergency department (ED) were useful in the immediate post-earthquake period. Conclusion Although resources were limited, a diagnostic radiology service remained operational. The Christchurch experience reinforces the need for disaster planning and rehearsal of plans.

AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010; 32: 628?636 Summary Background? The importance of adequate nutritional support in selected patient groups is well established. Traditionally, the amounts of macronutrients provided have been based on a perceived need to achieve, if not exceed, energy and protein balance. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the concept of ?permissive underfeeding?. Aim? To determine whether or not there is evidence of benefit for permissive underfeeding in selected groups. Methods? Studies were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed databases and the Cochrane collaboration. The search was limited from January 1950 to January 2010. Further searches were made from the references of original articles. The literature search revealed 591 abstracts of relevant studies. All abstracts were initially reviewed by the primary author (AO) and those that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were discarded. The remaining articles were requested and were reviewed independently by two authors (AO, JM). Results? Twelve studies were included in the final analysis. Eight of these were randomized interventional trials. Three were prospective cohort studies and one was a retrospective analysis. Conclusion? This review suggests that permissive underfeeding may be associated with improved outcomes and reduced morbidity in patients requiring short-term nutritional support.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children ≤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the concept acute semantically. The concept is being used both in clinical and theoretical contexts, without questioning whether a clear meaning of the concept has been established. The analysis has been applied according to the semantic analysis strategy of the philosopher (and pedagogue) Koort (1975). First, the results show that the concept of acute has had an unclear meaning and perception in the Norwegian language. Second, the synonyms indicate two different contents. The experiences and events that occur acute might be experienced as ?sharp? and ?intense?. The synonyms point also at time, such as quick, rapid and swift. Third, it reveals that the shortlived experience as synonym does have a very little binding to the concept acute. The occurence that began suddenly is not meant to subside the same way as it began.

Method A mixed method prospective observation study was conducted between September 2014 and April 2015 in 19 EDs where a physiotherapy service is provided. Results Patients seen by the primary contact physiotherapist (PCP) were associated with a significant reduction in ED length of stay by 108?min, wait time to treatment by 10 min (n =?4 EDs) and time-to-first analgesia by 18?min (n =?19 EDs) compared to those seen through usual care processes. Patients who received care by a doctor first and then physiotherapist (secondary contact model) had a prolonged length of stay compared to other care pathways. High levels of satisfaction with the PCP role were expressed by ED staff (n =?17 EDs) and patients (n =?19 EDs). More than 95% of patients who received care by PCP were satisfied with the management of their condition, understood the advice and discharge information provided and had enough time to ask questions. Conclusion ED implementation of the PCP model may improve patient flow and efficiency of clinical skill utilisation in a complex, high demand workplace.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Transfusion emergency preparedness is increasingly becoming an integrated part of major incident planning. The spectrum of planning extends from the sophisticated healthcare system dealing with multiple casualties, to the isolated healthcare facility resuscitating the critically ill patient with massive haemorrhage. Transfusion preparedness should follow risk assessment and be nested within the wider emergency planning system. The response should be designed to deliver both safety and sufficiency of transfusion support and includes diagnostics, donation and distribution. The biggest transfusion risks in emergency situations are those of red cell ABO incompatibility and delayed provision. Sufficiency and supply may be compromised when communities are isolated and cannot access mutual support. Planning may need to consider local collection and testing of blood as a further resilience measure. Considerations include demand planning; inventory management and transfusion triage; a whole blood preparedness model; resilience and resupply and the human factor. We suggest a whole blood programme can simplify the whole vein-to-vein process for production, laboratory and clinical staff and can be integrated into a range of healthcare systems.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study tested the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer (PU) prevention bundle in reducing the incidence of PUs in critically ill patients in two Saudi intensive care units (ICUs). Design A two-arm cluster randomized experimental control trial. Methods Participants in the intervention group received the PU prevention bundle, while the control group received standard skin care as per the local ICU policies. Data collected included demographic variables (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission trajectory, length of stay) and clinical variables (Braden Scale score, severity of organ function score, mechanical ventilation, PU presence, and staging). All patients were followed every two days from admission through to discharge, death, or up to a maximum of 28 days. Data were analyzed with descriptive correlation statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Poisson regression. Findings The total number of participants recruited was 140: 70 control participants (with a total of 728 days of observation) and 70 intervention participants (784 days of observation). PU cumulative incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (7.14%) compared to the control group (32.86%). Poisson regression revealed the likelihood of PU development was 70% lower in the intervention group. The intervention group had significantly less Stage I (p = .002) and Stage II PU development (p = .026). Conclusions Significant improvements were observed in PU-related outcomes with the implementation of the PU prevention bundle in the ICU; PU incidence, severity, and total number of PUs per patient were reduced. Clinical Relevance Utilizing a bundle approach and standardized nursing language through skin assessment and translation of the knowledge to practice has the potential to impact positively on the quality of care and patient outcome.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - Abstract Title.? Receiving power through confirmation: the meaning of close relatives for people who have been critically ill Aim.? This paper is a report of a study to elucidate the meaning of close relatives for people who have been critically ill and received care in an intensive care unit. Background.? Falling critically ill can bring about a difficult change in life. In previous reports such events are described as frightening experiences, and close relatives are described as an important source of support in this difficult situation. Method.? A purposive sample of 10 adults, eight men and two women, narrated how they experienced their close relatives during and after the time they were critically ill. The data were collected in 2004. The interview texts were transcribed and interpreted using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach influenced by the philosophy of Ricoeur. Findings.? One major theme was identified, experiencing confirmation, with six sub-themes: receiving explanations; a feeling of being understood; a feeling of safety; gaining strength and will-power; having possibilities and realizing their value. Close relatives served as tools for the person who was ill, facilitating better communication and an increased ability to do various things. Simultaneously, feelings of dependence on the close relatives were expressed. There were descriptions of loneliness and fear in the absence of close relatives and, in order to feel safe, the participants wanted their close relatives to stay near them. Conclusion.? Close relatives are vital, as they are the ill person's motivation to stay alive and to continue the struggle. Their presence is of great importance for the ill person and must be facilitated by staff.

AB  - Background Changes in water balance and the presence of unmeasured anions perturb the inverse relationship between serum chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations in people, affecting accurate interpretation of acid-base status. Objectives The aim of this study was to demonstrate that corrected serum Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations, based on serum sodium (Na) concentration and anion gap (AG), would be inversely correlated and could be used to better characterize causes of acid-base disorders in dogs. Methods In this retrospective study, electrolyte data from dogs with at least one abnormality in serum Na, Cl, or HCO3 concentrations were analyzed. Profiles were classified before and after calculations using 2 methods, a modified Feldman and an institutional method, to correct Cl concentration and predict HCO3 concentrations based on Na concentration and AG. Dogs were classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) based on Cl (first letter) and HCO3 (second letter) concentrations, as follows: LL, LN, LH, NL, NN, NH, HL, HN, or HH. Results For profiles from 261 dogs, reclassifying corrected Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations resulted in a shift from the initial classification into a different one in 73% of dogs; in most cases, the shift was to LH, NN, or HL categories. Albumin concentration was a significant factor in acid-base balance. Conclusions When interpreting acid-base status based on results of a standard biochemical panel, erroneous conclusions can be drawn if concentrations of Na, unmeasured anions, and albumin are not taken into account. The inverse relationship between serum Cl and HCO3 concentrations may be used to identify frequent acid-base disorders as well as to unmask abnormalities obscured by irregularities in water balance or AG.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study provides evidence of the outcome trends following inpatient rehabilitation services. Methods The methodology of this study design uses descriptive statistical analysis, paired t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine multiple variables. This quantitative, non-experimental study describes the research population and the data collection instrument, the inpatient rehabilitation facility patient assessment instrument (IRF PAI), including the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Findings Identified trends provide evidence that functional gains of the disabled population were maintained post discharge from an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Demographics, medical information, and discharge information were studied to describe relationships between the discharge information (discharge living setting, discharge with home health services, discharge to the person living with) and maintained functional performance. Conclusions This evidence provides essential information for healthcare providers, including nurses, policy makers, and governments regarding functional gains following inpatient rehabilitation, and community discharge trends of people receiving inpatient rehabilitation services. Clinical Relevance The evidence in this study supports that inpatient rehabilitation services should be provided to all persons with disabilities to increase functioning to the greatest level of independence possible. Further evidence-based knowledge regarding the proposed 75% Rule of the Prospective Payment System (PPS) is needed and required, affecting the access and delivery of rehabilitation services. All patients have a right to quality, cost-effective care without restrictions to certain populations to encourage return to community dwelling.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemorrhage due to elective or emergency surgery results in significant patient morbidity and mortality and consumption of scarce transfusion resources. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been proposed as a universal hemostatic agent which may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and in treating unexpected massive hemorrhage in surgical patients. In elective surgery, a small number of randomized studies have shown a limited benefit for rFVIIa in the reduction of transfusion requirements. In massive hemorrhage associated with surgery, two case series and a growing number of case reports suggest that rFVIIa is successful as salvage therapy. However, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal dose, the true rate of thromboembolic complications and the overall survival and cost benefit when rFVIIa is used for this indication. In this review, the role of rFVIIa in managing blood loss in surgical patients is assessed in the light of current evidence.
