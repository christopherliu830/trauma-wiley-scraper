AB  - Summary Imaging in trauma patients has dramatically evolved since the advent of computed tomography (CT), particularly multidetector CT (MDCT) technology. Axial MDCT images of the body can be acquired in seconds and shown any plane, allowing immediate viewing and interpreting. These factors make CT an invaluable means to detect many injuries not previously visible by any other noninvasive imaging techniques. Potentially subtle, but significant, thoracic injuries such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, aortic injury, sternal and spinal fractures can be detected on MDCT easily. In this article, the author will discuss the use of MDCT in the diagnosis of various thoracic injuries.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - Abstract Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) has increasingly been proposed as an effective therapeutic procedure for post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems. However, views on EMDR in the research literature have been polarized. Reasons for this are explored as is the nature and theoretical basis of EMDR. Fifteen controlled studies thus far published on EMDR and PTSD are reviewed, and it is concluded that (i) EMDR is an effective psychotherapy, (ii) EMDR's relative efficacy in comparison to behavioural exposure therapies has yet to be established, (iii) the role of eye movements and laterality in attentional focus remains controversial and (iv) a direct link between the theoretical basis of the therapy and observable psychological and neurobiological changes has yet to be established.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Summary Injury is a leading cause of death and disability, carrying with it a large economic burden to society. Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

AB  - Summary Due to advances in non-invasive vascular imaging, anatomic variants and anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) have become more commonly recognized in routine practice. Anomalies of the IVC have been described more frequently in those with other cardiovascular defects, and less frequently in otherwise healthy individuals. Their embryological basis is incompletely understood with the aetiology of infrarenal interrupted IVC being particularly controversial, thought most likely to be the result of perinatal IVC thrombosis. Knowledge of the anatomic variants of the portal and hepatic veins is of prime importance for precise lesion localization, insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and in planning liver transplantation. The impact of hepatic venous anatomic variations on hepatic resection and transplantation is the least understood aspect of liver surgery. The right hepatic vein may pass through the caval diaphragmatic opening before joining the IVC.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

Using a descriptive qualitative design, 75 Army Nurse Corps officers with deployment experience participated in a focused interview either in person or by telephone. Deployment locations included Bosnia, Honduras, Iraq, Afghanistan and other worldwide locations. Nurses recounted challenges and adjustments made to deliver high quality patient care to soldiers and civilian casualties especially for multi-level traumatic injuries. Specialized skill sets and personal adaptation were necessary for practice under austere conditions in these environments. By understanding the practice of nursing in MOOTW and wartime, nurses can best prepare and train to effectively function and care for patients in these challenging settings.

AB  - Aims.? This paper reports a study to identify patient's perceptions of quality of care at an emergency department and areas for quality improvement. Background.? Patients are not always satisfied with the care received at emergency departments. More attention needs to be paid to the specific needs and expectations of the non-urgent group of patients, who make up the majority of attenders at many emergency departments. Nurses? and physicians? perceptions about good quality of care do not always agree with patients? perceptions. Instruments measuring patient satisfaction have often been focused on inpatient treatment. Method.? A prospective, descriptive survey design was adopted and the study took place in one emergency department at a Swedish university hospital in 2002. The participants were 99 women and 101 men, with an average age of 51?years. The emergency department version of the questionnaire Quality from the Patient's Perspective was used for data collection. Results.? Patients estimated quality of care at the emergency department as fairly good, but there were areas in need of improvement. A high percent of inadequate quality was related to the environment in the emergency department. About 20% of patients reported that they did not receive effective pain relief. More than 20% estimated that nurses did not show an interest in their life situation and patients did not receive useful information on self-care and about which physician was responsible for their medical care. Conclusions.? The use of a research-based instrument gave valuable information for quality improvement in clinical practice. Many of the identified areas for quality improvement are related to nursing care. Therefore, the importance of nursing care in the emergency department should be highlighted to nurses and physicians and they also need to be more attentive to the need of the individual patient. Relevance to clinical practice.? Identifying areas for quality improvements are important, to know where to take action. These findings may facilitate the work with changing attitudes and working routines, which are needed to deliver effective care and to improve patients? perceptions of quality of care at emergency departments.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To review the literature addressing the assessment and management of pain in patients with polytraumatic injuries including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-related headache, and to identify patient, clinician and systems factors associated with pain-related outcomes. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? We conducted searches in MEDLINE of literature published from 1950 through July 2008. Due to a limited number of studies using controls or comparators, we included observational and rigorous qualitative studies. We systematically rated the quality of systematic reviews, cohort, and case-control design studies. Results.? One systematic review, 93 observational studies, and one qualitative research study met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded no published studies that assessed measures of pain intensity or pain-related functional interference among patients with cognitive deficits due to TBI, that compared patients with blast-related headache with patients with other types of headache, or that assessed treatments for blast-related headache pain. Studies on the association between TBI severity and pain reported mixed findings. There was limited evidence that the following factors are associated with pain among TBI patients: severity, location, and multiplicity of injuries; insomnia; fatigue; depression; and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions.? Very little evidence is currently available to guide pain assessment and treatment approaches in patients with polytrauma. Further research employing systematic observational as well as controlled intervention designs is clearly indicated.
