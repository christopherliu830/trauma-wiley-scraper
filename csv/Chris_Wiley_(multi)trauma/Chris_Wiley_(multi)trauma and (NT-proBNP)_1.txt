AB  - Exercise training (ET) and secondary prevention measures in cardiovascular disease aim to stimulate early physical activity and to facilitate recovery and improve health behaviours. ET has also been proposed for heart failure patients with a ventricular assist device (VAD), to help recovery in the patient's functional capacity. However, the existing evidence in support of ET in these patients remains limited. After a review of current knowledge on the causes of the persistence of limitation in exercise capacity in VAD recipients, and concerning the benefit of ET in VAD patients, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology has developed the present document to provide practical advice on implementing ET. This includes appropriate screening to avoid complications and then starting with early mobilisation, ET prescription is individualised to meet the patient's needs. Finally, gaps in our knowledge are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims Assess the prevalence of peri-transplant heart failure and its potential relation to post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Methods A retrospective study was performed on 234 consecutive cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a single European center from 1999 to 2007 (mean age 52, 30% women, 36% with alcoholic liver disease, 24% with viral hepatitis, 18% cholestatic liver disease). Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was defined as E/A ratio ≤ 1. We used the Boston classification for heart failure to assess the prevalence of peri-transplant heart failure. Patients were followed up for a mean of 4 years post-transplant (0.5?9 years). Results Eighteen per cent of patients demonstrated diastolic dysfunction pretransplant. During the peri-transplantation period highly possible heart failure occurred in 27%. In logistic regression analysis, heart failure was independently related to lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.94, 95% CR 0.91?0.98) and prolonged corrected QT time on ECG (OR 9.10, 95% CI 3.77?21.93) pretransplant. Peri-transplant mortality amounted to 5%, and was independently related to heart failure (OR 15.11, 95% CI 1.76?129.62) and the peri-transplant need of dialysis (OR 14.18, 95% CI 1.65?121.89). Heart failure was also associated with longer stay in the intensive care unit and peri-transplant cardiac events (P < 0.05). Long-term transplant-free mortality was independently related to diastolic dysfunction at baseline (Hazard ratio 4.82, 95% CI 1.78?13.06). Conclusion Heart failure occurs in approximately a quarter of patients with cirrhosis following liver transplantation and it is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) performed by emergency and critical care (ECC) specialists or residents in training improves differentiation of cardiac (C) versus non-cardiac (NC) causes of respiratory distress in dogs compared to medical history and physical examination alone. Design Prospective cohort study (May 2014 to February 2016). Setting University hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs presenting with respiratory distress. Interventions FOCUS. Measurements and Main Results Medical history, physical examination, and FOCUS were obtained at presentation. Emergency and critical care clinicians, blinded to any radiographic or echocardiographic data, categorized each patient (C vs NC) before and after FOCUS. Thoracic radiography (within 3 h) and echocardiography (within 24 h) were performed. Percent agreement was calculated against a reference diagnosis that relied on agreement of a board-certified cardiologist and ECC specialist with access to all diagnostic test results. Reference diagnosis included 22 dogs with cardiac and 13 dogs with noncardiac causes of respiratory distress. In 3 dogs a reference diagnosis was not established. Prior to FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8?98.9) and 53.9% (25.1?80.8), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 27 of 35 dogs (77.1%). Two C and 6 NC cases were incorrectly categorized. Following FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 95.5% (77.2?99.9) and 69.2% (38.6?90.9), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 30 of 35 dogs (85.7%). Three dogs with discrepant pre-FOCUS diagnoses were correctly re-categorized post-FOCUS. One C and 4 NC cases remained incorrectly categorized. No correctly categorized dogs were incorrectly re-categorized following FOCUS. The proportions of dogs correctly classified pre- versus post-FOCUS were not significantly different (P = 0.25). Conclusions FOCUS did not significantly improve differentiation of C vs NC causes of respiratory distress compared to medical history and physical examination alone.

AB  - Abstract Perioperative medicine is rapidly emerging as a key discipline to address the specific needs of high-risk surgical groups, such as those on chronic dialysis. Crude hospital separation rates for chronic dialysis patients are considerably higher than patients with normal renal function, with up to 15% of admission being related to surgical intervention. Dialysis dependency carries substantial mortality and morbidity risk compared to patients with normal renal function. This group of patients has a high comorbid burden and complex medical need, making accurate perioperative planning essential. Existing perioperative risk assessment tools are unvalidated in chronic dialysis patients. Furthermore, they fail to incorporate important dialysis treatment-related characteristics that could potentially influence perioperative outcomes. There is a dearth of information on perioperative outcomes of Australasian dialysis patients. Current perioperative outcome estimates stem predominantly from North American literature; however, the generalisability of these findings is limited, as the survival of North American dialysis patients is significantly inferior to their Australasian counterparts and potentially confounds reported perioperative outcomes; let alone regional variation in surgical indication and technique. We propose that data linkage between high-quality national registries will provide more complete data with more detailed patient and procedural information to allow for more informative analyses to develop and validate dialysis-specific risk assessment tools.

AB  - Abstract Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significantly hampered by the lack of easily accessible biomarkers that can detect disease presence and predict disease risk reliably. Fluid biomarkers of AD currently provide indications of disease stage; however, they are not robust predictors of disease progression or treatment response, and most are measured in cerebrospinal fluid, which limits their applicability. With these aspects in mind, the aim of this article is to underscore the concerted efforts of the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group, an international working group of experts in the field. The points addressed include: (1) the major challenges in the development of blood-based biomarkers of AD, including patient heterogeneity, inclusion of the ?right? control population, and the blood?brain barrier; (2) the need for a clear definition of the purpose of the individual markers (e.g., prognostic, diagnostic, or monitoring therapeutic efficacy); (3) a critical evaluation of the ongoing biomarker approaches; and (4) highlighting the need for standardization of preanalytical variables and analytical methodologies used by the field.

AB  - The antioxidant effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) contribute substantially to the health benefits of this compound. Resveratrol has been shown to be a scavenger of a number of free radicals. However, the direct scavenging activities of resveratrol are relatively poor. The antioxidant properties of resveratrol in vivo are more likely to be attributable to its effect as a gene regulator. Resveratrol inhibits NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS by down-regulating the expression and activity of the oxidase. This polyphenolic compound reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation by stimulating mitochondria biogenesis. Resveratrol prevents superoxide production from uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase by up-regulating the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. In addition, resveratrol increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes. Some of the gene-regulating effects of resveratrol are mediated by the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 or by the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2. In this review article, we have also summarized the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol observed in clinical trials.
