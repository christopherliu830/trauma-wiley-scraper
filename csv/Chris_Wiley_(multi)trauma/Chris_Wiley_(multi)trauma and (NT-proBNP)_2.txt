AB  - Abstract Aims Left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling is an important marker of improved outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). We examined the impact of the intramyocardial administration of bone-marrow-derived, lineage-directed, autologous cardiopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (C3BS-CQR-1) on LV remodelling in patients with advanced HF enrolled in the CHART-1 study. Methods and results Patients (n=351) with symptomatic advanced HF secondary to ischaemic heart disease, and reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF <35%) were randomized to receive C3BS-CQR-1 or a sham procedure. In a post hoc analysis we examined the effect of C3BS-CQR-1 on LV reverse remodelling within 1 year of the procedure and the influence of C3BS-CQR-1 dosing in the 271 patients treated as randomized. Delivery of C3BS-CQR-1 was associated with a progressive decrease in both LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV) within 52 weeks after treatment. At 1 year, the LVEDV and LVESV of treated patients decreased by 17.0 mL and 12.8 mL greater than controls (P=0.006 and P=0.017, respectively). The effect on LVEDV was maintained after multivariable adjustment for baseline age, systolic blood pressure, LVEDV, LVEF and history of myocardial infarction. The largest reverse remodelling was evident in the patients receiving a moderate number of injections (<20). Conclusion In CHART-1, intramyocardial administration of cardiopoietic stem cells led to reverse remodelling as evidenced by significant progressive decreases in LVEDV and LVESV through the 52 weeks of follow-up. Further studies are needed to explore the dose response with regard to cell number and injected volume, and reverse remodelling.

AB  - Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at an approximately 0.5% to 3% increased risk of thromboembolism during and immediately after catheter ablation. Treatment guidelines recommend periprocedural oral anticoagulation plus unfractionated heparin during ablation. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are the only non?vitamin K oral anticoagulants for which there are randomized controlled trials assessing uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is noninferior vs warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular AF. The ELIMINATE-AF (Evaluation of Edoxaban Compared With VKA in Subjects Undergoing Catheter Ablation of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation) trial is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily edoxaban 60?mg (30?mg in patients indicated for a dose reduction) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing catheter ablation (http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02942576). A total of 560 patients are planned for randomization to edoxaban or VKA (2:1 ratio) to obtain 450 patients fully compliant with the protocol. Patients will complete 21 to 28?days of anticoagulation prior to the ablation and a 90-day post-ablation period. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, and major bleeding. The primary safety endpoint is major bleeding. A magnetic resonance imaging substudy will assess the incidence of silent cerebral lesions post-ablation. ELIMINATE-AF will define the efficacy and safety of edoxaban for uninterrupted oral anticoagulation during catheter ablation of AF.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.

AB  - Objectives To determine the underlying disease prevalence in acute feline dyspnoea and to examine whether historical and clinical examination findings can differentiate between acute cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea in cats in primary practice. Materials and Methods We prospectively enrolled cats presenting with dyspnoea for the first time to primary practice between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2016. We collected signalment, historical and clinical data at presentation using a standard form. Cases were investigated by primary clinicians, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the authors. Records lacking critical data were excluded. Relationships between historical or clinical variables and dyspnoea aetiology were examined. Diagnostic test performance analyses were used to find optimal cut-off values for select historical or clinical variables that could differentiate cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea. Results Participants included 108 cats. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 92 cases; 60 were cardiac (65%), 15 respiratory (16%), 10 neoplastic (11%) and 7 traumatic (8%). Of cats with cardiac dyspnoea, 25% had a history of cough. A gallop sound, rectal temperature less than 37·5°C, heart rate of greater than 200?bpm and respiratory rate greater than 80 per minute were all useful to predict cardiac-associated dyspnoea. A triage algorithm using these findings in combination was designed to optimise the rapid diagnosis of probable cardiac dyspnoea. Clinical Significance Dyspnoeic cats presenting in practice with hypothermia, tachycardia, gallop sounds or profound tachypnoea are likely to have a cardiac cause underlying their dyspnoea. Although diagnosis requires confirmation, clinicians may be able to stratify risk and prioritise further investigation based on these findings.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents in a continuum of severity that spans from incidentally discovered subsegmental PE to central or saddle PE that causes cardiogenic shock and sudden death. To date there has been limited dissemination of catheter-based interventions for PE partly due to the lack of prospective randomized controlled clinical trials that demonstrate their efficacy and safety. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is rarely used in current practice since it does not appear to offer any meaningful advantages to systemic thrombolysis. Although experience with right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) for the treatment of massive PE is extremely limited, there are case reports that suggest they can be a life-saving intervention in selected cases. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are indicated in patients with acute PE who have contraindications to anticoagulation, and in patients with acute PE who have poor cardiopulmonary reserve and who are deemed to be at high risk of death if they develop another PE.
