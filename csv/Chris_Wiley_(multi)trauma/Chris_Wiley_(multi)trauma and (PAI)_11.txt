AB  - Abstract Due to the fact that psychopathy is prevalent in forensic settings and potentially relevant to a wide range of legal issues, particularly violence risk, the assessment of psychopathy is a fundamental skill for clinical-forensic psychologists. The chapter begins with a discussion of the nature of psychopathy. It then reviews the most commonly used procedures for assessing psychopathy, including diagnostic interviews, self-report questionnaires and inventories, and expert rating scales. This is followed by a discussion of the legal relevance of psychopathy. It ends by summarizing recommendations for best practice and identifying areas in need of further research.

AB  - Clinicians should possess current knowledge about the prognosis and expected outcome of endodontic treatment, including apical surgery. This knowledge cannot be acquired by indiscriminate review of the many available studies because they vary in the level of evidence they provide. Therefore, seven studies that best comply with methodology criteria defining the levels of evidence were selected and used as the basis of this review. In spite of their methodological consistency, the outcomes reported in these studies still differ considerably, mainly because of differences in inclusion criteria. According to these studies, 37?91% of teeth can be expected to be healed, while up to 33% can still be healing several years after surgery. Importantly, 80?94% of teeth can remain in symptom-free function, even if they are not healed. Several pre-operative factors may influence the outcome of treatment; the outcome may be better in teeth with small lesions and excessively short or long root canal fillings, and it may be poorer in teeth treated surgically for the second time. With regard to intra-operative factors, the choice of the root-end filling material and the quality of the root-end filling may influence the outcome, while the retrograde retreatment procedure clearly offers a better outcome than the standard root-end filling. In summary, the expected outcome of apical surgery is good and therefore, before considering tooth extraction and replacement, apical surgery should be attempted when it is feasible.

AB  - Aim To determine whether intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy improves performance and performance satisfaction in goal areas identified by patients' parents. Method This study formed part of an ongoing multicentre national audit involving six paediatric ITB pump implant centres across Australia. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was the primary outcome measure utilized at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after pump implants in paediatric patients receiving ITB therapy for the first time between 31st December 2009 and 31st December 2014. Results Twenty-five children had goals identified (mean age 11y 1mo), 19 had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy and 22 were at Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV, V, or equivalent. Strong evidence for an improvement in goal performance (2.33, 95% CI 1.70, 2.96, p<0.001) and performance satisfaction scores (3.08, 95% CI 2.28, 3.88, p<0.001) were demonstrated at 6 months, compared to baseline. The differences were clinically significant and were sustained to 12 months. Interpretation ITB therapy in paediatric patients with hypertonia results in clinically significant improvements in average performance and performance satisfaction scores. What this paper adds The most commonly identified goals of parents of children treated with intrathecal (ITB) therapy were: improving ease of dressing, positioning, and transfers. ITB therapy is effective in improving performance and performance satisfaction in children with hypertonia. Score improvements are mainly evident within the first 6 months of therapy.
