AB  - Aim Mental health conditions and problems are often reported in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). A systematic review was undertaken to describe their prevalence. Method MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases from 1996 to 2016 were searched and reference lists of selected studies were reviewed. Studies were included if they reported point prevalence of mental health diagnoses or symptoms in a general population of children and/or adolescents with CP. Pooled prevalence for mental health symptoms was determined using a random effects meta-analysis. Results Of the 3158 studies identified, eight met the inclusion criteria. Mental health disorders were diagnosed by psychiatric interview in one study, giving a prevalence of 57% (32 out of 56 children). The remaining seven studies (n=1715 children) used parent-report mental health screening tools. The pooled prevalence for mental health symptoms using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (n=5 studies) was 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] 20?61) and using the Child Behavior Checklist (n=2 studies) was 28% (95% CI 22?36). Evidence was characterized by a moderate level of bias. Interpretation More studies are needed to ascertain the prevalence of mental health disorders. Mental health symptoms are common and mental health evaluations should be incorporated into multidisciplinary assessments for these children. What this paper adds Children with cerebral palsy and intellectual disability have a higher risk of mental health symptoms. The prevalence of mental health symptoms for age and severity groups is unclear.

AB  - Summary Colibacillosis refers to any localized or systemic infection caused entirely or partly by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), including colisepticemia, hemorrhagic septicemia, coligranuloma (Hjarre's disease), air sac disease (chronic respiratory disease, CRD), swollen-head syndrome, venereal colibacillosis, coliform cellulitis (inflammatory or infectious process, IP), peritonitis, salpingitis, orchitis, osteomyelitis/ synovitis (including turkey osteomyelitis complex), panophthalmitis, omphalitis/yolk sac infection, and enteritis. Often colibacillosis is among the most frequently reported diseases in surveys of poultry health or condemnations at processing. The etiology of colibacillosis is APEC. Other infectious agents and noninfectious factors usually predispose a bird to infection or contribute to the severity of the disease. Two additional Escherichia species, E. fergusonii and E. albertii, have been isolated from birds and are capable of causing disease or are of public health significance. Escherichia coli possess no unique resistance capabilities and have a susceptibility pattern to chemical and physical agents typical of vegetative, Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Summary The past few decades have seen major advances in multidisciplinary obstetric care and management of gynecological conditions in women with bleeding disorders. Awareness of the impact of bleeding disorders has improved among the obstetric and gynecological community. Undiagnosed bleeding disorders can be the underlying cause for a significant proportion of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. They may also be the cause or a contributory factor for other gynecological problems, such as dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and endometriosis. Hemostatic assessment should be considered in women referred for menstrual abnormalities if they have a positive bleeding history as quantified by bleeding assessment tools. The reproductive choices and options for prenatal diagnosis are also expanding for families with hemophilia with a drive toward achieving a non-invasive approach. Current non-invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques are limited to identification of fetal gender. Research is ongoing to overcome the specific diagnostic challenges of identifying hemophilia mutations, utilizing free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The management of obstetric hemorrhage has recently evolved to include a greater focus on the identification of and early treatment for coagulation disorders. Deficiencies in certain hemostatic variables are associated with progression to more severe bleeding; therefore, specific interventions have been proposed to target this. Evidence is still lacking to support such strategy, and future research is required to assess the efficacy and the safety of these hemostatic interventions in women with persistent PPH.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) comprise of heterogeneous coagulation factor deficiencies and platelet disorders that are underreported worldwide. Aim First report on RBD data from United States haemophilia treatment center network (USHTCN). Methods A national surveillance system for the federally recognized USHTCN developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Thrombosis and Haemostasis Network (ATHN) was queried for patients with RBDs. Patient counts were extracted from the HTC Population Profile (HTC PP) component including limited data on patients followed through the USHTCN, and from the Registry component, including patient authorized, detailed clinical data. The prevalence of RBDs in the United States was estimated based on the HTC PP data and compared to the expected national prevalence based on data extrapolated from Orphanet, an international registry. Results Based on the estimated prevalence of RBD in the overall 2017 US population, the cases in the HTC network were lower than expected for FI, FII, FX, and FV + FVIII deficiencies by 36%, 61%, 75% and 94%, respectively, and higher than expected for FXIII, FV, FVII, and FXI deficiencies by 7%, 14%, 33% and 185%, respectively. The proportion of RBD patients reported in the HTC PP, enrolled in the Registry, was 10.8%. Conclusions There is a clear need to identify individuals with RBDs who could benefit from the comprehensive care provided in the USHTCN. In addition, increased enrolment of people with all RBDs in the Registry is needed to improve knowledge of treatment outcomes of patients with RBDs in the United States.

AB  - The antioxidant effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) contribute substantially to the health benefits of this compound. Resveratrol has been shown to be a scavenger of a number of free radicals. However, the direct scavenging activities of resveratrol are relatively poor. The antioxidant properties of resveratrol in vivo are more likely to be attributable to its effect as a gene regulator. Resveratrol inhibits NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS by down-regulating the expression and activity of the oxidase. This polyphenolic compound reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation by stimulating mitochondria biogenesis. Resveratrol prevents superoxide production from uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase by up-regulating the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. In addition, resveratrol increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes. Some of the gene-regulating effects of resveratrol are mediated by the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 or by the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2. In this review article, we have also summarized the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol observed in clinical trials.

AB  - Summary The haemostatic or coagulant system is designed primarily to prevent bleeding and haemorrhage following injury to blood vessels, although some of its constituent proteins have additional roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. This chapter describes the function and components of the haemostatic system and its role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It explores the effect of variants in genes coding for proteins in the haemostatic system on cardiovascular risk. The chapter describes the effect of dietary components on the haemostatic system, both directly and via the development of chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Platelets have a key function in normal haemostasis and are activated by a number of agonists, particularly thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and also adrenaline and serotonin, some of which act synergistically in vivo with other agonists. The fibrinolytic system regulates the degradation of the fibrin matrix. It consists of fibrinolytic factors and fibrinolysis inhibitors.
