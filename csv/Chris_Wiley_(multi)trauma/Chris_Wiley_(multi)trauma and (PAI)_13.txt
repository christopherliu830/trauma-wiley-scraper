AB  - Adhesions are a common and unfortunate consequence of most abdominal surgical operations, which start to form within three hours of surgery. Some patients form extensive permanent adhesions that can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the extent of this problem and the cost to the Health Service, and although there are numerous approaches to prevent adhesion formation by careful laparoscopic or microsurgical techniques or the use of various adhesion barriers, no method so far has proved completely efficacious in randomised controlled trials. This article reviews the pathogenesis of adhesions, the epidemiological data and the various methods used to try to prevent their formation.

AB  - Aim Project TEAM (Teens making Environment and Activity Modifications) teaches transition-age young people with developmental disabilities, including those with co-occurring intellectual or cognitive disabilities, to identify and resolve environmental barriers to participation. We examined its effects on young people's attainment of participation goals, knowledge, problem-solving, self-determination, and self-efficacy. Method We used a quasi-experimental, repeated measures design (initial, outcome, 6-week follow-up) with two groups: (1) Project TEAM (28 males, 19 females; mean age 17y 6mo); and (2) goal-setting comparison (21 males, 14 females; mean age 17y 6mo). A matched convenience sample was recruited in two US states. Attainment of participation goals and goal attainment scaling (GAS) T scores were compared at outcome. Differences between groups for all other outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed effects models. Results At outcome, Project TEAM participants demonstrated greater knowledge (estimated mean difference: 1.82; confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 2.74) and ability to apply knowledge during participation (GAS: t[75]=4.21; CI: 5.21, 14.57) compared to goal-setting. While both groups achieved significant improvements in knowledge, problem-solving, and self-determination, increases in parent reported self-determination remained at 6-week follow-up only for Project TEAM (estimated mean difference: 4.65; CI: 1.32, 7.98). Significantly more Project TEAM participants attained their participation goals by follow-up (Project TEAM=97.6%, goal-setting=77.1%, p=0.009). Interpretation Both approaches support attainment of participation goals. Although inconclusive, Project TEAM may uniquely support young people with developmental disabilities to act in a self-determined manner and apply an environmental problem-solving approach over time. What this paper adds Individualized goal-setting, alone or during Project TEAM (Teens making Environment and Activity Modifications) appears to support attainment of participation goals. Project TEAM appears to support young people with developmental disabilities to apply an environmental problem-solving approach to participation barriers. Parents of young people with developmental disabilities report sustained changes in self-determination 6 weeks after Project TEAM.

AB  - Summary A low platelet count is a frequently encountered haematological abnormality in patients treated in intensive treatment units (ITUs). Although severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ? 109/l) can be associated with bleeding, even moderate-degree thrombocytopenia is associated with organ failure and adverse prognosis. The aetiology for thrombocytopenia in ITU is often multifactorial and correcting one aetiology may not normalise the low platelet count. The classical view for thrombocytopenia in this setting is consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, but other concepts, including platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and leucocytes, platelet aggregation by increased von Willebrand factor release, red cell damage and histone release, and platelet destruction by the complement system, have recently been described. The management of severe thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion in the presence of active bleeding or invasive procedure, but the risk-benefit of prophylactic platelet transfusions in this setting is uncertain. In this review, the incidence and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITU, its prognostic significance and the impact on organ function is discussed. A practical approach based on the authors' experience is described to guide management of a critically ill patient who develops thrombocytopenia.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the hemostasis literature relevant to development of coagulopathy in the critically ill equine patient. Data Source ? Original scientific and review articles. Human Data Synthesis ? Inflammation plays a critical role in the activation and amplification of clot formation, as well as the impairment of physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms, and fibrinolysis. Earlier identification of coagulopathy in patients at risk and restoration of physiologic hemostasis may result in better outcome. Development of scoring systems based on information other than coagulation markers alone may better identify patients with subclinical coagulopathy. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Critically ill equine patients commonly at risk for coagulopathy include those with severe gastrointestinal disease, septic foals, and adults subjected to severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Publications provide information regarding coagulation markers helpful for identification of hemostatic dysfunction in specific patient populations, as well as information regarding the influence of coagulopathy on outcome. Data regarding clinically relevant information on therapeutic intervention are lacking. Conclusions ? The relationship between inflammation and endotoxemia and development of coagulopathy is better understood in both human patients and the critically ill equine patient. Prospective clinical trials evaluating clinically relevant and financially feasible approaches to treatment are still needed.
