AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

AB  - Abstract Hyperprolactinaemia is suggested to be associated with metabolic and hormonal complications. No previous study has compared the effect of different dopamine agonists on plasma lipids, carbohydrate metabolism markers and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with elevated prolactin levels. The study included eight bromocriptine-resistant women with prolactinoma (group 1) and twelve matched women with hyperprolactinaemia unrelated to prolactinoma (group 2). Group 1 was then treated with cabergoline, while group 2 with bromocriptine. Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers and plasma levels of prolactin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed before and after 6 months of therapy. Both treatments normalized plasma prolactin levels. Cabergoline reduced triglycerides, 2-hr post-challenge plasma glucose, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and circulating levels of IGF-1, free fatty acids (FFA), uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine and fibrinogen, as well as increased HDL cholesterol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. With the exception of a reduction in HOMA-IR, bromocriptine treatment produced no significant effect on the investigated biomarkers. Cabergoline was superior to bromocriptine in affecting 2-hr post-challenge plasma glucose levels, HOMA-IR, as well as circulating levels of IGF-1, FFA, uric acid, hsCRP, homocysteine, fibrinogen and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Our results may suggest that cabergoline is superior to bromocriptine when it comes to affecting atherogenic dyslipidaemia, insulin sensitivity and circulating levels of cardiovascular risk factors in hyperprolactinaemic patients. These findings seem to support previous observations that cabergoline may be a better treatment for patients with elevated prolactin levels than bromocriptine.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.

AB  - Abstract Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a major public health concern. Intra-uterine exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of growth and neurodevelopmental problems during childhood and later life. Few studies have focussed on visual difficulties in children in the context of maternal smoking during pregnancy. A systematic search of online databases was carried out between February and May 2013 to examine the trend in visual outcomes in children exposed to maternal cigarette smoking during intra-uterine life. Twenty-four non-randomized studies were identified. Each study was rated for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most studies (n = 18) reported fetal exposure to active or passive maternal cigarette smoking to be associated with an increased risk of adverse visual outcomes in children. In particular, there were higher rates of strabismus, refractive errors and retinopathy among children of women who smoked during pregnancy. These findings suggest that fetal exposure to cigarette smoke is a significant risk factor for visual problems during later life and that certain visual faculties, such as the intraocular muscles and retinal neurons, are more affected than others. The findings provide evidence in support of public health policies aimed at reducing fetal exposure to smoking by advising both women and their partners to quit smoking during pregnancy.
