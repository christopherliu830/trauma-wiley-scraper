AB  - Homeobox genes are transcription factor that form nested patterns in specific regions throughout the body. Homeobox genes are important for wound healing study because some have been shown to be related to scarless fetal wound healing. Muscle segment homeobox-2 (Msx-2) is a homeobox gene commonly expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tissue morphogenesis. Overexpression of Msx-2 leads to craniosynostosis, epidermal dysplasia, and abnormal hair growth. A knockout of this gene causes pleiotropic defects in bone growth, cyclic alopecia, and a thinner dermis. While Msx-2 has been found to play many critical roles in development, no functional study has been conducted on Msx-2 and wound healing. We hypothesize that Msx-2 regulates skin morphogenesis during wound repair which was tested by studying excisional skin wound closure. Isolated keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of Msx-2 WT and KO mice were also studied to determine the effects of Msx-2. Results showed that Msx-2 mRNA was induced in epidermis and dermis during wound repair. Additionally, Msx-2 KO mice exhibited enhanced re-epithelialization and faster wound closure than the WT control. These repair phenotypes may be attributed to keratinocyte motility and fibroblast interaction with collagen matrix as, in vitro, Msx-2 KO keratinocytes exhibited increased motility, and fibroblasts show stronger collagen matrix contraction and expressed higher levels of α2?1 than WT control. Msx-2 KO fibroblasts were refractory to BMP4 in collagen matrix contraction, demonstrating a disruption in the Msx-2 pathway. In conclusion, Msx-2 may regulate skin morphogenesis during repair at both epithelial and mesenchymal levels. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM055081(TLT).

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.
