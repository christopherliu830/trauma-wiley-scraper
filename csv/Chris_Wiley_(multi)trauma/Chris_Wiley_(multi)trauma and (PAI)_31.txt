AB  - Summary Two detailed reviews of the management of neonatal thrombosis were published in 2012; one was an up-dated version of guidance first issued in 2004 and the other was a comprehensive review. Both of these publications gave very similar advice regarding the practical aspects of the indications, dosage and management of antithrombotic therapy. The authors stated that the evidence supporting most of their recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy in neonates remained weak and so the therapy for a neonate with a thrombosis has to be based on an individualized assessment of estimated risk versus potential benefit. The aim of this present review is to give the treating physician an outline of the unique physiology of neonatal coagulation and how this affects the monitoring, dosing and even the choice of therapeutic strategy for the management of thrombosis in the neonate.

AB  - AbstractSamples of adults representative of Teziutlán, Puebla, and Villahermosa, Tobasco, were interviewed 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the devastating 1999 flood and mudslides. The interview contained multiple measures of social support that had been normed for Mexico. Comparisons between sample data and population norms suggested minimal mobilization of received support and substantial deterioration of perceived support and social embeddedness. Social support was lowest in Teziutlán, which had experienced mass casualties and displacement, and among women and persons of lower educational attainment. Disparities according to gender, context, and education grew larger as time passed. The results provide compelling evidence that the international health community must be mindful of social as well as psychological functioning when disasters strike the developing world.

AB  - Increasing numbers of Americans are living with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) and disabilities. Addressing health care needs of persons with MCCs or disabilities presents challenges on many levels. For health services researchers, priorities include (1) considering MCCs and disabilities in comparative effectiveness research (CER) and assessing quality of care; and (2) identifying and evaluating the data needed to conduct CER, performance measure development, and other research to inform health policy and public health decisions concerning persons with MCCs or disabilities. Little information is available to guide CER or treatment choices for persons with MCCs or disabilities, however, because they are typically excluded from clinical trials that produce the scientific evidence base. Furthermore, most research funding flows through public and private agencies oriented around single organ systems or diseases. Likely changes in the data landscape?notably wider dissemination of electronic health records (EHRs) and moving toward updated coding nomenclatures?may increase the information available to monitor health care service delivery and quality for persons with MCCs and disabilities. Generating this information will require new methods to extract and code information about MCCs and functional status from EHRs, especially narrative texts, and incorporating coding nomenclatures that capture critical dimensions of functional status and disability.

AB  - Abstract Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. The majority of these deaths are due to metastasis, with the liver easily accounting as the most common site of deposit. While there are multiple steps in the CRC hepatic metastatic cascade, this review attempts to summarize the different processes involved, focusing on the most recent discoveries, as well as the associated effects in relation to prognosis.
