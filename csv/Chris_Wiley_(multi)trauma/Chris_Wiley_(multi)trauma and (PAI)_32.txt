AB  - Translations of summary This paper attempts to distil out a particular quality of psychic (non)existence, which I call here ?void existence?, from the quality predominantly explored in the psychoanalytic discourse on primitive mental states, which I call ?annihilation existence?. Achieving this phenomenological differentiation may make it easier to identify and work through extreme states in the analytic situation, when the patient is under the dominance of ?void existence?. I suggest that it is, as it were, a one-dimensional existence, in an infinite contour-less void, lacking any substantial internal object, lacking any substantial sense of psychic and/or somatic occurrences, and lacking any live representation of this very state of being. Hence, it lacks distress and anxiety, as well as calmness and peace. One might say that it is the inorganic within the organic; a quality of non-alive-ness within life. ?Annihilation existence? is existence in a two- or three-dimensional hollowed world, with flat and/or partial representations of self and object, which attracts acute distress and annihilation anxiety. It is a sort of existence on the brink of non-life, on the brink of the void; where a sense of catastrophic danger is brought on by the never-ending potentiality of the annihilation's realization. Both these psychic qualities can be encapsulated within neurotic and personality disorders, and the dominance of each can serve as defence against the dominance of the other. The theoretical discussion is supported by excerpts from an analysis.

AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

These medical conditions are all complicated by acute provoked seizures and chronic epilepsy, involve treatment with medications with complex interactions with anti-epileptic drugs, and provide opportunities for translational research. The goals of the symposium are: 1)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of acute provoked seizures in children with congenital heart disease, CNS and non-CNS neoplasms, and organ transplantation. 2)? Understand the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of chronic epilepsy in these patients, including interactions between anti-epileptic drugs and anti-arrhythmic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressive agents. 3)? Recognize opportunities for translational research in this area, including neuro-protection, pharmacology and immunology.

AB  - Background Burn survivors tend to have complex medical issues requiring rehabilitation to improve overall function and quality of life. A subset of burn patients treated in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) may require more than 1 rehabilitation stay for the same injury. Objective To compare the rehabilitation outcomes among burn patients admitted to an IRF who were discharged to acute care and then readmitted to an IRF with burn patients admitted to an IRF only 1 time. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Participants Burn injury patients aged 18 years or more who were admitted to IRFs between 2002 and 2011. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation, a national data repository. Outcomes of the repeaters' second stay (n = 188) were compared to the nonrepeaters' first and only stay (n = 6,855), using linear regression and logistic regression to determine whether repeater status was associated with rehabilitation outcomes. Main Outcome Measurements Functional status (using the Functional Independence Measure [FIM] instrument) at admission, discharge and change, length of stay, FIM efficiency (total FIM points gained per day), and discharge disposition. Results Repeater status was inversely associated with discharge FIM total (coefficient = ?3.42, 95% confidence interval = ?5.76, ?1.07) and FIM change (coefficient = ?4.05, 95% CI = ?6.34, ?1.75) in linear regression models. No other significant differences were found, and those differences in discharge FIM total and FIM change were small. Conclusions Differences found in rehabilitation outcomes between the repeater and nonrepeater groups were small and may not reflect clinically meaningful differences. Burn injury patients who required a second IRF admission had rehabilitation outcomes similar to those of burn injury patients who did not require a second IRF admission, emphasizing the value of inpatient rehabilitation for burn injury IRF readmissions.
