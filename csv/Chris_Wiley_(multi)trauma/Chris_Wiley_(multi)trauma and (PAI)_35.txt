AB  - Abstract The effects of cell size, shape and deformability on cellular function have long been a topic of interest. Recently, mechanical phenotyping technologies capable of analysing large numbers of cells in real time have become available. This has important implications for biology and medicine, especially haemato-oncology and immunology, as immune cell mechanical phenotyping, immunologic function, and malignant cell transformation are closely linked and potentially exploitable to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the technologies used to analyse cellular mechanical properties and review emerging findings following the advent of high throughput deformability cytometry. We largely focus on cells from the myeloid lineage, which are derived from the bone marrow and include macrophages, granulocytes and erythrocytes. We highlight advances in mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension that are revealing novel signatures of human blood diseases and providing new insights into pathogenesis of these diseases. The contributions of mechanical phenotyping of cells in suspension to our understanding of drug mechanisms, identification of novel therapeutics and monitoring of treatment efficacy particularly in instances of haematologic diseases are reviewed, and we suggest emerging topics of study to explore as high throughput deformability cytometers become prevalent in laboratories across the globe.

AB  - Abstract Angioedema is a rare adverse effect of the commonly used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and is reported to occur with a prevalence of 0.1%-0.7%. Although most ACEi-induced angioedema (ACEi-A) cases are mild, severe cases requiring intensive care and even resulting in death have been reported in the literature. The mechanisms underlying ACEi-A are not yet fully understood, but bradykinin and/or substance P accumulation resulting from inhibition of ACE is believed to play a crucial role. ACEi-A occurs at variable frequencies across different racial groups, suggesting a genetic association with the development of ACEi-A. To date, one genome-wide association study and several candidate gene studies have been published on the association of genetic variation with ACEi-A. Genetic associations reported have been attributed to several distinct mechanisms: (a) genes coding for alternative enzymes responsible for the degradation of bradykinin and/or substance P in the diminution of ACE activity (b) ACE gene function, (c) bradykinin receptor genes, (d) genes implicated in immune and inflammation regulation and (e) genes in the fibrinolytic and coagulation pathway. Despite several plausible genetic associations, there are currently no genetic variants with sufficient effect to be clinically useful. The low incidence of ACEi-A suggests that a combination of genomic approaches with the capability to detect potentially important variants might be required to shed light on the mechanism of this adverse reaction. Additionally, many non-genetic risk factors associated with ACEi-A suggest the potential contribution of epigenetic dysregulation.

AB  - We present results from two cross-modal morphological priming experiments investigating regular person and number inflection on finite verbs in German. We found asymmetries in the priming patterns between different affixes that can be predicted from the structure of the paradigm. We also report data from language disorders which indicate that inflectional errors produced by language-impaired adults and children tend to occur within a given paradigm dimension, rather than randomly across the paradigm. We conclude that morphological paradigms are used by the human language processor and can be systematically affected in language disorders.

AB  - PROBLEM.? Adequate pain control continues to be an enigma in the face of the Joint Commission (TJC) well-intended pain management standards. Notable in the pain standards is the mandate to make pain the fifth vital sign to increase pain visibility and awareness. METHOD.? The following databases were searched: EBSCOHost, CINHAL, PubMed Central, Medline, and government/societies sites for guidelines on pain control. Various search terms used included pain, post operative pain, pain control, pain as the 5th vital sign, pain documentation, pain assessment, Joint Commission Pain Standard, PRN effectiveness, and pay-for-performance. FINDINGS.? Accredited facilities are mandated to have plans to assess for pain and evaluate pain management effectiveness. These mandates have necessitated a flurry of initiatives and programs by hospitals and healthcare facilities focusing on documentation processes to meet TJC compliance. Notable programs include Pain as the 5th Vital Sign and PRN (as needed) effectiveness documentation. Many facilities have programs to assess and document pain but lack programs that effectively control patient's pain. CONCLUSION.? This article is a call for facilities to refocus on pain control. A need to evaluate current programs by facilities is evident. Studies show that Pain as the 5th Vital Sign and PRN effectiveness documentation are not effective and invariably have not met the goals of TJC pain standard?adequate and effective pain control.
