AB  - Objectives To describe the demography, clinical characteristics, treatment, functional limitations and outcomes of patients referred to a paediatric multidisciplinary pain clinic. Design Prospective data collection, descriptive study. Patients and setting Tertiary referral centre pain clinic (Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne) over two years (March 1998 ? March 2000). Main outcome measures Pain profile; functional disability (school absenteeism, sleep disturbance and inability to perform sport); treatments received; outcome. Results 207 patients (mean age, 13.1 years; 73% females; 29% rural residents) were referred in the two years. Concomitant medical conditions were present in 106/207 (51%) patients, the commonest being cerebral palsy or spasticity (22 patients) and malignancy (18). Complex regional pain syndrome was diagnosed in 44 patients. Functional disability due to pain included school absenteeism (95% of school attenders), sleep disruption (71% of all patients) and inability to perform sport (90% of those able to participate in sport previously). Of the 105 patients who missed five or more days of school because of pain, 93 attended school regularly after treatment. Sleep disturbance improved in 129/146 (88%) patients, and 129/147 (88%) resumed sporting activity after multidisciplinary intervention. Outcome was classified as good in 134 patients (65%), moderate in 32 (15%) and poor in 16 (8%). Conclusions Chronic pain in children and adolescents often results in considerable functional disability. Functional improvement can be achieved using a multidisciplinary approach to pain management in children.

AB  - Abstract Thailand's public health system is in transition, reflecting the economic status of the country. The decentralized system has made great strides in improving the health of its people. But paradoxes exist. While some urban areas have an oversupply of CT Scanners, rural villages still cope with hygiene-related illnesses. Malaria and Yellow Fever no longer dominate health resources. Now AIDs, heart disease and accidents top the problem list. Like other countries, Thailand also struggles with health financing to address the unmet needs.

AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract Psychologists may be asked to assist the court and child welfare professionals in making informed, objective decisions regarding families in cases of child abuse and neglect. Mental health information may be requested regarding a child's emotional or psychological needs, a parent's caregiving abilities, the likelihood of successful remediation of parenting deficits, risk and protective factors relevant to making placement or visitation decisions, and whether various options reflect the child's best interest. Forensic mental health evaluations differ importantly from therapeutic evaluations and require psychologists to obtain specialized competence. Challenges include the coercive context of assessment, the dearth of appropriate assessment measures, difficulties in predicting behavior, and the absence of universally accepted standards of minimal parenting adequacy. This chapter provides an overview of the legal context, empirical foundations and limits, forensic mental health concepts and frameworks, methods of data collection, and recommended methods for communicating assessment findings in child protection evaluations. Psychologists who provide evaluations in a forensic context must approach the task with an open mind, tolerance for ambiguity, and confidence that full information enhances fair decision making.
