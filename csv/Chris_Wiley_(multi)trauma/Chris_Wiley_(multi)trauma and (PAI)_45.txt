AB  - Abstract Neurophysiological and behavioral data obtained from 9 patients with presenile dementia and 10 with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type were compared with similar data from 25 age- and sex-equivalent controls. Compared with the healthy controls, both patient groups demonstrated increased background electroencephalographic slowing with a reduction in fast activity (synchronization). Topographic analyses of data from electroencephalographic and evoked potential studie indicate that areas of maximal group differences between the presenile patients and their controls include the right posterior temporal and, to a lesser extent, left midtemporal to anterior temporal areas, whereas the maximal differences between the senile patient group and their controls involve the midfrontal and anterior frontal lobes, bilaterally. Moreover, right-sided numerical features derived from topographic maps proved most useful in differentiating the presenile patients and their age-matched controls, whereas bilateral features were more useful in separating senile patients from their controls. These topographic dissimilarities between patient groups suggest that an age-disease interaction exists between patients with presenile and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Correlational analyses between neuropsychological test scores and neurophysiological features indicate that increased slowing and decreased fast activity were associated with poorer test performance.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a quick reference for the busy clinician covering diagnosis and management of apical periodontitis. It then presents a case of a male patient and his non-surgical endodontic retreatment of the maxillary canine tooth and surgical endodontic treatment of the maxillary incisor tooth. An accurate and detailed pain history followed by clinical examination is essential to distinguish necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis from reversible and irreversible pulpitis. In addition to the standard radiographic examination, advanced imaging methods have been used for the diagnosis and management of endodontic diseases. Endodontic retreatment is indicated on previously root-treated teeth with persistent periapical disease if the tooth is still restorable and is amenable to non-surgical treatment. Prognostic factors and outcomes of non-surgical and surgical endodontic treatments are discussed in this chapter.

AB  - Abstract Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPls) are generally characterized as heterogeneous and non-specific autoantibodies directed against various phospholipids such as cardiolipin, ph-serine, ph-inositol, ph-acid, ph-glycerol, ph-sphyngomyelin, ph-choline, annexins, and co-factor ?2-glycoprotein I. aPls occur not only during autoimmune diseases but also during infectious diseases, essential hypertension, neurological complication, metabolic diseases, some drug abuse, and transplant loss. aPls are very often found in connection with reproductive failure such as repeated pregnancy loss and/or missed abortion, intrauterine fetal death, in preeclampsia, and repeated delivery of hypothrophic fetus. The presence of aPls, thrombosis, and fertility failure create primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. This article explains some aspects and clinical and laboratory significance of the aPls in female infertility.

AB  - Scientific discovery and clinical management strategies for Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) have advanced in recent years. The 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders stated that a mental health component to care is integral to promote positive adaptation, yet the parameters of this element have not been described. The objective of this paper is threefold: to describe the psychosocial screening protocol adopted by the clinical centers of the DSD-Translational Research Network; to summarize psychosocial data collected at 1 of the 10 network sites; and to suggest how systematic behavioral health screenings can be employed to tailor care in DSD that results in better health and quality of life outcomes. Steps taken in developing the largely ?noncategorical? screening protocol are described. These preliminary findings suggest that DSD, as one category of pediatric chronic conditions, is not associated with marked disturbances of psychosocial adaptation, either for the family or the child; however, screening frequently uncovered ?risk factors? for individual families or patients that can potentially be addressed in the context of ongoing clinical care. Administration of the DSD-TRN psychosocial screening protocol was demonstrated to be feasible in the context of interdisciplinary team care and was acceptable to families on a longitudinal basis. The ultimate value of systematic screening will be demonstrated through a tailoring of psychosocial, medical and surgical services, based on this information that enhances the quality of patient and family-centered care and subsequent outcomes.
