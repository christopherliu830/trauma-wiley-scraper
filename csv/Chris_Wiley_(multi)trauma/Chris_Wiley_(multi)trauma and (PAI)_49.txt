AB  - Accessible summary What is known about the subject? This paper describes crisis resolution/home treatment (CRHT) teams, which are part of mental health services in the United Kingdom. CRHT is expected to assist individuals in building resilience and work within a recovery approach. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? This paper arises from an interview with one individual, Dale, as part of a larger study exploring service users? experiences of CRHT. It adds to the body of narrative knowledge in CRHT through Dale's co-authorship of this paper, reflecting on his original interview 4 years later, with co-authors providing critical interpretation of his experience, in turn supported by cognate literature. What are the implications for practice? Implications for practice are considered, themselves mediated through Dale's own descriptions of how CRHT interventions impacted upon him. These impacts are analysed with respect to three themes: Resilience, Recovery and Power. It is centrally contended that clinicians need to more clearly comprehend three core matters. First, what resilience ?is? for service users as well as the complex process through which these individuals move in developing resilience. Second, the distinction that service users might make between ?recovery? and ?functionality?, and how this in turn can impact on individuals both in personal and socioeconomic sense. Finally, the mechanics of power within CRHT contexts and how these interpersonal dynamics can affect the relationship between service user and clinician in practice. Abstract Introduction and Aim The central purpose of this paper, part of a larger study exploring the experiences of Service Users (SUs) with CRHT, is to emphasise the importance of the SU voice itself within the domain. Following an interrogation of the historical contexts of CRHT. Method This paper uses interpretative phenomological approach around detailed thematic examination of an extended, semi-structured with a single SU: Dale. Moreover, four years after the interview was originally conducted, Dale was himself invited to reflect upon, and critically re-evaluate, his initial participation as a co-author of this paper. In this way, a genuinely participant-centred narrative on experiences with CRHT could be generated. Implications for Practice This resulted in Dale describing what ?crisis? meant to him, and his personal journey within that crisis. Although framing some experiences as negative, he primarily argues that the CRHT team was very personable, affirming his personal values and beliefs, and encouraging him to use coping skills that he had utilised effectively in prior periods of crisis. Analysis highlights three major themes permeating Dale's narrative: Resilience, Recovery and Power. It is contended that this analysis begins to demonstrate implications for practice and highlight that (and how) CRHT clinicians might more clearly engage with what resilience ?is? for SUs, and also the complex process through which these individuals move in developing it. Equally, it is proposed that practitioners should be mindful of the distinction that SUs might make between ?recovery? and ?functionality?, and how this in turn can impact on individuals both in personal and socio-economic sense. Finally, the mechanics of power within CRHT contexts are foregrounded, and how these interpersonal dynamics can affect the working relationship between SU and clinician.

AB  - Perhaps the most exciting issue currently facing the dental research community centers around a hypothesized connection between chronic inflammatory oral infections, most notably periodontal disease, and the development of adverse systemic health conditions. To date, inflammation of endodontic origin (i.e., apical periodontitis (AP)) has not been extensively studied in this regard despite being a commonly found sequel to bacterial infection of the dental pulp space. Although numerous differences exist between chronic inflammatory disease of periodontal and endodontic origins, there are some notable similarities, primarily that: (1) both often are associated with Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and (2) elevated cytokine levels may be released systemically from acute and chronic manifestations of both disease processes. This article provides a brief review of several important concepts concerning adverse general health outcomes as they relate to periodontal disease, summarizes recent epidemiologic studies of AP and root canal therapy, and reviews some general issues involved in the conduct of epidemiologic studies as well as how these issues apply to investigations that address potential links between endodontic inflammatory disease and adverse systemic health outcomes.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this review was to comprehensively summarize existing studies utilizing validated instruments to measure psychosocial outcomes among bereaved parents of children with cancer. This population has increased risks of anxiety, depression, prolonged grief, and poor quality of life. Parental morbidity is associated with psychiatric co-morbidities, prior loss, economic hardship, duration, and intensity of child's cancer-therapy, perceptions of medical care, child's quality of life, preparedness for and location of the child's death. Rigorous, prospective research is needed to identify risk-groups, define outcomes, and design interventions which will improve parental outcomes after the death of a child due to cancer.
