AB  - Abstract A consultation commemorating the 20th anniversary of the culmination of the Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women took place in Kingston, Jamaica, in October 2018 to reflect on the achievements and challenges in building a just community of all people in church and society, and to strengthen ecumenical collaboration in reading the signs of the times. The Decade was launched in 1988, following a decision of the central committee of the World Council of Churches (WCC). It was ?addressed to churches and to women at the local level to empower women to challenge structures and to respond to the issues in the society around them? and focused on ?the situation of women in the churches as well as the churches? participation in improving the conditions for women in society.? It concluded in December 1998 with a festival held in Harare, Zimbabwe, immediately before the WCC?s 8th Assembly. The global consultation in October 2018, hosted by the Jamaica Council of Churches, gathered intergenerational women and men from WCC member churches and their theological institutions and ecumenical partners. Below we document several of the contributions at the Jamaica consultation as well as the report of the event.

TI  - Mechanism of memantine block of NMDA-activated channels in rat retinal ganglion cells: uncompetitive antagonism.

AB  - 1. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-activated currents were recorded from dissociated rat retinal ganglion cells using whole-cell recording. The NMDA open-channel blocking drug memantine was evaluated for non-competitive and/or uncompetitive components of antagonism. A rapid superfusion system was used to apply various drugs for kinetic analysis. 2. Dose-response data revealed that memantine blocked 200 microM NMDA-evoked responses with a 50% inhibition constant (IC50) of approximately 1 microM at -60 mV and an empirical Hill coefficient of approximately 1. The antagonism followed a bimolecular reaction process. This 1:1 stoichiometry is supported by the fact that the macroscopic blocking rate of memantine (kon) increased linearly with memantine concentration and the macroscopic unblocking rate (koff) was independent of it. The estimated pseudo-first order rate constant for macroscopic blockade was 4 x 10(5) M-1 S-1 and the rate constant for unblocking was 0.44 s-1. Both the blocking and unblocking actions of memantine were well fitted by a single exponential process. 3. The kon for 2 microM memantine decreased with decreasing concentrations of NMDA. By analysing kon behaviour, we estimate that memantine has minimal interaction with the closed-unliganded state of the channel. As channel open probability (Po) approached zero, a small residual action of memantine may be explained by the presence of endogenous glutamate and glycine. 4. Memantine could be trapped within the NMDA-gated channel if it was suddenly closed by fast washout of agonist. The measured gating process of channel activation and deactivation appeared at least 10-20-fold faster than the kinetics of memantine action. By combining the agonist and voltage dependence of antagonism, a trapping scheme was established for further kinetic analysis. 5. With low agonist concentrations, NMDA-gated channels recovered slowly from memantine blockade. By analysing the probability of a channel remaining blocked, we found that memantine binding appeared to stabilize the open conformation of the blocked channel and did not affect ligand affinity. Validity of the 'trapping model' and stabilization of the open conformation were further suggested by agreement between the predicted dose-response curve for NMDA in the presence of 2 microM memantine and the empirically derived dose-response relationship. 6. Based on simple molecular schemes, the degree of blockade at various concentrations of agonist for 'pure' non-competitive vs. uncompetitive inhibition was computer simulated. The measured degree of blockade by 6 microM memantine was close to ideal for pure uncompetitive antagonism. Taken together, we conclude that the predominant mechanism of open-channel blockade by memantine is uncompetitive. In general, the relative magnitude of the dissociation rate of an open-channel blocker from the open but blocked channel (the apparent off-rate) compared with the rate of leaving the closed and blocker-trapped state (the leak rate) will determine the contribution of uncompetitive vs. non-competitive actions, respectively. 7. Millimolar internal Cs+ competed with memantine for binding in the NMDA-gated channel, and reduced the association rate of memantine, but had no effect on the voltage dependence of the dissociation rate. After removal of Cs+, the calculated Ki for memantine remained voltage dependent. These observations would be difficult to reconcile with models in which memantine binds to a site outside the channel pore and instead strongly support the supposition that the blocking site for memantine is within the permeation pathway.

KW  - Diabetic foot ulcers; Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
PY  - 2014
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been used as an adjunct for healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) for decades. However, its use remains controversial. A literature search was conducted to locate clinical studies and assess the available evidence. Ten prospective and seven retrospective studies evaluating HBO for DFUs were located. These were reviewed and the outcomes were discussed. One study reported no difference in outcomes between patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen and the control group. However, their regime differed from all other studies in that the patients received hyperbaric oxygen twice rather than once daily. Reduced amputation rates and improved healing were the most common outcomes observed.

AB  - Abstract There are increasing reports of using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat advanced liver disease. We consider several critical issues that underlie this approach. For example, are there multipotent stem cell populations in human adult bone marrow? Can they develop into liver cells or supporting cell types? What are stromal stem/progenitor cells, and can they promote tissue repair without replacing hepatocytes? Does reversal of end-stage liver disease require new hepatocytes, a new liver microenvironment, both, neither or something else? Although many of these questions are unanswered, we consider the conceptual and experimental bases underlying these issues and critically analyze results of clinical trials of stem cell therapy of end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Abstract. This report from the first International Course on Integrated Biomarkers, Biochemical and Bioimaging Endpoints in Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Prevention, Therapy and Drug Development provides the basis for optimizing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information in four areas of cardiovascular medicine: primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and stroke. Risk stratification and treatment strategies can be refined and enhanced through integration of bioimaging and biochemical markers to characterize sub-clinical and clinical atherosclerosis. For the integrative approach to be useful, each of the biomarkers must be validated and cost-effective. Clinical decision is the primary level of integration and is based on clinical evaluation and the use of a combination of bioimaging and biochemical markers. The decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic intervention must take into account the factors affecting the levels of expression of the biomarker and the potential input the biomarker has on metabolic processes or modulation of other biomarkers. The optimal approach to intervention must take into consideration the risk?benefit and cost?effectiveness ratios.
