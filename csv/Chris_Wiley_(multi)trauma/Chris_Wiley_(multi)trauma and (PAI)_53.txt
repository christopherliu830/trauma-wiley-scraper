AB  - The nursing profession is and always has been at the cutting edge of research and development into innovative and effective methods to treat, manage and enhance wound regeneration. One such method which was developed specifically for nursing science is a non-invasive, easily administered technique known as therapeutic touch (TT). Although there have been numerous anecdotal reports over the last two decades attesting to the efficacy of TT for cutaneous wounds, there have been only five experimental studies to date which have examined the phenomena in a scientifically rigorous manner. These five studies utilized randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled protocols to analyse the effect of an experimental derivative of TT-non-contact therapeutic touch (NCIT)-on the healing rate of surgically administered full thickness human dermal wounds. The experiments introduced many original concepts and approaches to healing research and nursing practice. The data from the five studies indicated a statistically significant accelerated rate of wound healing for the treatment group in the initial two experiments, and nonsignificant and reverse significant effects for the remaining three studies. Although, experimentally, these results are far from impressive, clinically, the significant results of the first two experiments should be enough to encourage the nurse clinican to explore and utilize a similar non-invasive TT treatment method for patients with dermal lacerations. While the results of the studies were inconsistent overall, the series of experiments nonetheless significantly expanded the theorectical boundaries and understanding of the TT process and, due to the rigorous, double-blind methodological protocols used, have established the critical groundwork and guidelines for future nursing science research in the area.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective Expression of Spam1/PH20 and its modulation of high/low molecular weight hyaluronan substrate have been proposed to play an important role in murine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation in vitro and in normal and demyelinated central nervous system (CNS). We reexamined this using highly purified PH20. Methods Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20. Results BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed the inhibitory effects of BTH on OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was undetected in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS. Interpretation We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, ?BTH? effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2014 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration. As the official journal of the International Federation for Artificial Organs, the International Faculty for Artificial Organs, the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, the International Society for Pediatric Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Support, and the Vienna International Workshop on Functional Electrical Stimulation, Artificial?Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial?Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our Publisher, John Wiley & Sons, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial?Organs. We look forward to reporting further advances in the coming years.
