AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are present in saliva and may impact wound healing within the oral cavity. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that psychosocial factors such as elevated depression scores are associated with delayed oral wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between salivary levels of EGF and VEGF and depression and loneliness scores. Whole saliva was collected from 43 individuals in groups aged 18?35 years and 50+?years. On the same day, volunteers were asked to complete the Beck?s Depression Inventory (BDI) and the UCLA loneliness scale. Salivary concentrations of EGF and VEGF were determined by standard ELISA. Mean concentrations of EGF and VEGF were 2860?pg/ml and 421?pg/ml, respectively. In the younger age group, significant negative correlations were found between scores on the BDI and UCLA indices and salivary levels of EGF. A median split, based upon BDI scores, similarly revealed that more depressed or lonely individuals exhibited significantly lower EGF levels. A similar trend was observed for VEGF. These preliminary results indicate that psychosocial factors such as depression and loneliness may be related to growth factor expression in saliva. This, in turn, may play a part in the delayed mucosal wound healing observed in depressed individuals. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Wound healing is a complex biological event orchestrated by various resident and infiltrating cell types spanning multiple stages. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease released upon wounding, stimulates fibroblasts and macrophages at the sites of wounds to express, chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have used cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanisms involved in thrombin induces IL-8 expression in human macrophages. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR show that thrombin stimulates IL-8 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. Various inhibitors for signal transduction proteins were used to delineate the pathways involved. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibitors for both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NFÉ»B strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced production of IL-8 suggesting that they are major regulators of this stimulation. JNK was shown to be phorsphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to thrombin treatment confirming its involvement. In order to identify the mediator of JNK and the thrombin receptor, we use affinity pull down and found that Rho GTPase was activated by thrombin suggesting that Rho may be the mediator of JNK activation. In addition, we found that PKC is a negative regulator of thrombin-induced IL-8 expression. Our study broadens the horizon of how IL-8 is regulated in wound healing and may help develop pharmaceutical methods to manipulate this process in pathological conditions.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the effects of hibernation drugs on early wound sepsis in severely scalded rats. Methods:? Sprague-Dawley rats inflicted 30% TBSA deep thickness were randomly divided into A (immediate resuscitation) and B (immediate resuscitation and lytic cocktail). After infusion of 108?CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound on third postburn day, survival was compared between two groups. Local tissue samples and plasma were collected and the plasma level of IL-2 mRNA, IL-4 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA, and IFN-? mRNA were assayed by fluorescence PCR. Results:? Compared with Group A, host survival significantly increased (0.663?±?0.026, P?<?0.01), viscera injury decrease in group B after infusion bacteria. The plasma Th1 cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IFN-?) levels in B group were significantly increased compared with A group. However, the plasma Th2 cytokine mRNA (IL-4, IL-10) levels in group B were not as significantly increased as group A. Conclusions:? Immediate resuscitation with hibernation drugs can decrease viscera injury after sepsis, increase host survival and improve host immune system by preventing Th1 cell from over activation and decrease Th2 cytokines.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that ends with scar formation in adult skin. In contrast, fetal skin within the first and second trimesters of development heals without a scar. One of the most important aspects of scarless fetal wound repair appears to be the lack of inflammation in these wounds, suggesting that acute inflammation can promote scar formation in the skin. While it is well accepted that inflammation causes scar formation in the fetus, it is not known what specific factors produced during inflammation are responsible for these effects. The present experiments tested the possibility that oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells can contribute to scar tissue production by inducing inflammation in the fetus. Using a murine fetal wound repair model we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide increased E15 (embryonic day 15) fibroblast proliferation and ultimately interfered with scarless healing in E15 skin, possibly through the induction of TGF-?1. Defining the factors produced during the inflammatory response that contribute to scar formation could be important for the development of new therapies designed to minimize adult scarring.

AB  - An initiative to bring wound care ?back to the bedside? was introduced in a large teaching hospital. Wound consultation was available from either a nurse or physician member of a hospital-based wound team. Confusion over whom to consult coupled with multiple product options led to decreased critical thinking at the bedside. The volume of consultations precluded follow-up visits by the team, further fragmenting care. The proposed solution included partnering with a sole vendor to standardize wound products and assist with education on product selection and function. New policies and procedures were created. Each patient unit was staffed by a Nurse clinical specialist as part of a hospital-wide ?Magnet? application process. This individual assumed the role of ?skin care leader? and was required to attend two in-depth educational programs. All skin care leaders were required to become part of a hospital-wide quarterly prevalence and incidence project. The wound nurse assumed a more ?consultative? role for the skin care leaders who subsequently assisted the end user in this model; the bedside nurse. This paradigm shift in care did not result in any statistically significant changes in wound incidence and reintroduced skin care as an integral component of the assessment and care for the bedside nurse. This presentation will describe the process in detail. Acknowledgments:? This study was supported with an educational grant from Smith and Nephew, Largo, FL.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Introduction:? Currently freeze-dried, gamma-sterilized, or glycerol-preserved amniotic membranes are widely used. However, it is not clear whether this devitalized state is the optimal application form. Therefore within this study the ideal condition for midterm storage of human amniotic membranes was assessed to ensure the availability of vital amniotic membranes, in particular for burn wounds. Methods and Materials:? For this purpose mothers were serologically tested and term placentae were collected and washed. After the amniotic membrane was peeled off and further washed, biopsies were taken for microbiological testing and various storage experiments (different media and temperatures). ?? cell culture medium, 37?°C ?? glycerol, 4?°C ?? 10% DMSO, ?80?°C Viability of fresh and stored amniotic membranes was determined with the MTT-based EZ4U- Assay (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Results and Discussion:? Best results were obtained while storing the membranes in cell culture medium at 37?°C, whereas storage in glycerol at 4?°C resulted in cell death within the first 4 days. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the viability of amniotic membrane under different storage conditions. The influence on wound healing is currently under investigation.

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Introduction:? Healing wounds are characterized by high lactate levels. In the past, the shift to an anaerobic energy metabolism was thought to be the main source for increased lactate concentration. Lactate is also generated by leukocytic NADPH-linked oxygenase using oxygen and glucose as one of its substrates, a mechanism called aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen therapy by increasing oxygen availability enhances wound lactate production by aerobic glycolysis. Material and methods:? Four wire mesh wound cylinders (n?=?142) were implanted underneath the dorsal skin in each of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (312?±?11?g). Animals were randomized to two groups: The first group (n?=?18) received 100% oxygen with 2.1 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for a total of 7 days. The second group (n?=?18) was treated with 21% oxygen with 1 ATA for the same time schedule. Hyperbaric treatments were administered in a hyperbaric chamber designed for small animals. Wound fluid from the cylinders was aspirated between the two treatment cycles at day 2 and 5 and analysed for lactate using a lactate analyser. Additionally, at day 10 (after 2 days of treatment with 21% oxygen in 1 ATA in both groups) lactate concentrations in wound fluid were measured again. Data are expressed as mean?±?SD. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results:? Wound lactate concentration was significantly increased both in control and hyperbaric rats at day 5 and day 10 compared to day 2 (controls 4.5?±?1, 5.9?±?0.8, 6.7?±?1.2?mmol/l; p?=?0.04 and hyperbarics 4.4?±?1.2, 6.5?±?1.3, 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). At day 2 and day 5 there was no significant difference in lactate levels between control and hyperbaric rats. However, at day 10 lactate concentration was significantly higher in the hyperbaric group compared to the control group (6.7?±?1.2 vs. 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). Conclusion:? This investigation provides evidence for the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen action since lactate is known to stimulate collagen production and angiogenesis.

AB  - Background:? Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a novel method for producing a strong tissue-tissue seal using photosensitization. PTB cross-links tissues without causing thermal damage, although the mechanism of action in skin is not completely understood. Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered skin construct, is currently applied to chronic wounds and fixed in place by bolster, suture, staple, or glue. We postulated that PTB may have application for attaching Apligraf to skin. Materials and Methods:? An ex vivo model was used to characterize bonding of Apligraf and skin by PTB. Argon laser (514?nm) or IPL irradiation in the presence of the photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal was used to bond Apligraf and human cadaveric or porcine skin. Various outcome measurements were made to evaluate the efficacy and histological characteristics of the bonding. Conclusions:? Photochemical tissue bonding of Apligraf to human skin can be performed and further characterization is under way. Potential applications of PTB and Apligraf include the treatment of acute wounds, split thickness skin graft donor sites, burns, and debrided chronic wounds.

AB  - The understanding of bioengineered tissue has evolved over the past 5 years. Now considered ?cell therapy,? bioengineered tissue can provide a nonhealing wound with the appropriate complement of cytokines, growth factors, and healthy cells to promote the patient?s healing process. As clinicians have gained experience with Apligraf*, the process of wound bed preparation has proven to be a critical step in order to achieve optimal outcomes with the tissue construct. Recently, the investigators have evaluated a novel device, MIST? ultrasound , recently FDA cleared for the cleansing and debriding of wounds. A subgroup from a total of 23 patients in a research trial using MIST therapy for nonhealing wounds received an Apligraf as part of their treatment regimen. The'bioengineered tissue remained intact for a full 4 weeks postapplication and the appearance of the graft was quite different than our prior experience with the product. On removal of the wound/graft eschar, patients had achieved complete epithelialization. This report describes the patients who underwent this combination of technologies along with wound photographs, measurements and patient histories. As we learn more about the biochemistry of healing we are able to ?look? at how we combine and use advanced wound care technologies. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Wound healing is a multistep process that concludes with scar formation. A common clinical observation is that oral wounds exhibit privileged healing compared to extra-oral wounds. Current data demonstrates reduced inflammation and more rapid reepithelialization of oral wounds suggesting that reduced inflammation is vital to privileged repair. To examine the initiation of inflammation, the present study examines IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα production by oral versus cutaneous keratinocytes and compares mast cell infiltration in oral versus cutaneous wounds. Two 1?mm diameter excisional wounds were placed on the lateral tongue or dorsal skin of anesthetized BALB/c mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, wound tissue was harvested for analysis. Cytokine expression levels were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin. At every time point, levels of IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα mRNA were less in oral than dermal wounds. When analyzed by ELISA, IL-1 protein levels peaked at 6 hours in both oral and cutaneous wounds, yet the levels were lower in oral wounds. Mast cell infiltration was measured by counting toluidine blue positive cells in fixed wound sections. The number of mast cells/mm2 was decreased overall in oral mucosal wounds. These findings suggest that a decreased early inflammatory response to injury may be responsible for the privileged repair of oral mucosa.
