AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is a potent cell mitogen and chemotactic signal involved in normal wound healing. PDGF-B is present at decreased levels in diabetic wounds and has been shown to improve wound healing when applied in a topical form. However, clinical results with topical PDGF in the treatment of diabetic wounds have been equivocal. In this study, we investigated whether application of PDGF-B via gene therapy can effectively promote wound healing in the diabetic environment in an animal model. Retroviral vectors carrying the gene for human PDGF-B were constructed using the LNCX virus and the G418 resistance gene for selection (LN-PDGF-B), and transduced into mouse dermal fibroblasts. LN-PDGF-B transduced fibroblasts were seeded into alginate hydrogel scaffolds at a concentration of 25???106 cells/implant and implanted into 2?cm???2?cm full thickness excisional dermal wounds created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. At 21 days, animals treated with LN-PDGF-B transduced cells suspended in alginate hydrogel demonstrated a significantly smaller epithelial gap (0.97 +/? 0.34?cm) than animals receiving untransduced mouse dermal fibroblasts alone (1.44 +/? 0.37?cm; P?<?0.05) or animals receiving dermal fibroblasts transduced with LNCX viral vector alone (1.40 +/? 0.20?cm; P?<?0.01). These results suggest tissue-engineered retroviral gene therapy with PDGF-B specifically promotes diabetic wound healing and may yield advances in the effective treatment of diabetic wounds.

AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - The role of proteases in chronic wounds has been the subject of many investigations in recent years. These studies have reported biochemical differences between chronic and acute wound fluids and have shown that elevated levels of proteases, in particular the matrix metalloproteinases are abundant in chronic wounds. While this has led to the hypothesis that the chronic wound environment is hostile and not conducive to wound repair, it is still unknown whether this is due to a direct or indirect defect in protease regulation or their inhibitors. We hypothesize that an excess of proteases, specifically the serine proteases present in chronic wounds, are primarily responsible for this hostile wound environment. These proteases degrade endogenous growth factors, reducing their efficacy and delaying healing. In this study, fluid and tissue from chronic and acute wounds were collected over a 24-hour period. Using ELISA, samples were assessed for protease activity (specifically elastase and typsin-like enzymes), their inhibitors and growth factors. Our results show that serine proteases, predominantly elastase, were significantly elevated in the chronic wound fluids. The serpins designed to control these proteases were not up-regulated when compared to the acute controls, resulting in excessive proteolytic activity. An increase in serine protease production without an increase in their serpins is thought to result in a reduction in growth factors, an effect, which was also observed in the chronic wound samples. This work indicates that there is an imbalance in the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme, due to an up regulation of protease production in chronic wounds. We also conclude that misregulation of serine proteases may be responsible for the observed excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix and growth factors in these chronic wounds.

AB  - Clinically the outcome of pressure ulcers is predicted by the severity/stage of the ulcer, patient health and health care options. These factors, however, cannot be used to accurately evaluate the prognosis and healing in these ulcers, thus delaying any required change in the treatment plan. Techniques are needed that can help in the assessment of healing and improve the clinical management of these ulcers. Studies of tissue health such as angiogenesis, by measuring blood flow in the ulcer at different time points, has been examined as a way to evaluate the state of healing ulcers. Although the Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager (LDPI) has been used to assess various wounds, there is a need to validate it as a predictor of wound healing. The standard clinical outcome parameter for skin wounds has been time to heal. To validate the LDPI as predictor of healing, however, a measure that gives periodic feedback such as healing rate is a more useful outcome measure. The goal of this study therefore was to determine a protocol for the LDPI and evaluate its ability to predict healing in pressure ulcers. Previous studies have indicated that perfusion values obtained after heat stress may reflect the blood flow more accurately than absolute perfusion values. It was hypothesized that the difference in the blood perfusion after heat provocation is expected to correlate with the healing rate. The selected heat provocation (increase of 20?°F) was evaluated on five spinal cord injured pressure ulcer patients. The LDPI assessment and healing rate measurements were done weekly for 5 weeks. Preliminary results suggest a relationship between the difference in the perfusion and the healing rate for the following week. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact relationship. This tool has the potential to play a critical role in the clinical management of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It is expected that by 2030, 20% of the American population will be over 65 years of age. Forty percent of Americans are expected to die in nursing homes in the near future. Pressure ulcer prevalence rates of 13% are reported at long-term care units but healing rates are infrequently published from these settings. Current wound protocols fail to consider patients goals of care. The possibility that a wound will not heal is rarely communicated to the patient or family. Palliative care focuses on the relief of suffering and improvement in the quality of life. It can be the sole focus of care or can be delivered parallel to aggressive curative treatments. This presentation describes a case history of an unfortunate 40-year-old patient suffering from multiple sclerosis who developed a stage 4 pressure ulcer during a pregnancy. Postpartum, the patient underwent flap coverage of the wound. Her MS worsened, the flap broke down and a family conference resulted in the decision to provide palliative wound care and involve hospice. Wound care continued with a silver impregnated absorptive dressings and ultraviolet light therapy to control bioburden, diminish odor and dressing frequency, which improved quality of life. Palliative wound protocols will be reviewed along with details of the above-mentioned case. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Aim:? To determine the viability/effects of incorporating Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT )/V.A.C.? Therapy as an adjunct in the treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum. Material and Methods:? A 74-year-old white female presented with clinical evidence of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). The wound exhibited pathergy and therefore aggressive debridement remained contraindicated. The patient applied topical Elidel cream to the periwound. With meticulous wound management, the lesion remained free of infection. Clinicians utilized various systemic treatment regimes including Minocycline 100?mg twice daily, Dapsone 50?mg daily, Cyclosporine 150?mg twice daily, and ultimately Infliximab 5?mg/kg every 2 months. The latter drug created a significant positive response; however, the wound continued to ?wax and wane.? Researchers began NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy to facilitate granulation tissue, epithelization, and ultimate wound closure. Results:? The researchers observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue with the addition of NPWT/V.A.C.? therapy. Conclusions:? NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy appears to augment healing in a patient with Pyoderma Gangrenosum and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgments:? KCI?, San Antonio, TX

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

AB  - Hypothesis:? The use of Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy will stimulate the development of angiogenesis in the subjacent tissues underlying and surrounding the wound base to a greater degree than can be achieved with standard wound healing efforts. Study Background:? The presence of tissue ischemia and hypoxia due to compromised arterial blood flow is a primary factor compromising wound healing. Wounds that are compromised by impaired angiogenesis will have poor blood supply and are unlikely to progress through the stages of healing in an orderly and timely fashion. The VAC is a subatmospheric pressure system utilizing medical grade polyurethane foam wound dressing that is fitted at the bedside to the appropriate size for each patient?s wound, and then covered with an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. The VAC enhances wound healing by stimulating granulation tissue. The etiology of this granulation is thought to be increased blood flow to the wound base and stimulation of angiogenesis, but the physiologic tissue changes due to VAC therapy that lead to the development of angiogenesis has not been proven or documented. A recent clinical observation demonstrated angiographic evidence of subadjacent angiogenesis in a patient with a wound that was managed successfully with VAC therapy. However, to date no randomized controlled trials have been performed to document wound angiogenesis. We propose that subatmospheric pressure dressings applied to lower extremity ulcers will promote angiogenesis more effectively than moist wound therapy dressings.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars are a resultant of a fibroproliferative disorder observed at the time of the wound healing of large surface, like burns. In normal wound, the process of healing begins with the invasion in the wound of microvascular cells and by the migration of myofibroblasts to form the granulation tissue. There, myofibroblasts play an important role since they synthesize the extracellular matrix and are responsible for the contraction of the wound. At the end of the healing process, the myofibroblasts disappear by apoptosis via unknown stimuli. In the case of hypertrophics scars, there is persistence of a high density of cells and collagen in comparison with normal granulation tissue. Scientists associate this disorder with a problem in the regulation of apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that endothelial cells play an important role in the persistence of myofibroblasts in wound healing. We have compared the apoptotic rates of human myofibroblasts from normal wounds (Wmyo) with those from hypertrophic scars (Hmyo) when exposed with supernatants from microvascular cells isolated from normal skins (CEMV) or hypertrophic scars (CEMVH). The first results showed a significative reduction of apoptosis for Hmyo while Wmyo were not found to respond to the microvascular supernatant. There were, however, no difference in the apoptotic rates of both populations of cells when exposed to CEMV or CEMVH supernatants. These results suggest that endothelial cells secrete one or many factors that inhibit Hmyo apoptosis, thus preventing the disappearance of those cells and inducing the formation of hypertrophic scars. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the formation of hypertrophic scars will open the way to new treatments. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Background:? Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate the healing of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcerations. It appears to function as cell-based therapy (e.g., delivering growth factors), rather than as a true graft. Given this mechanism of action, its use could be expanded to areas in which traditional skin grafting is not routinely employed. Methods:? A 64-year-old wheel-chairbound Caucasian male presented to the wound clinic with a grade III left trochanteric pressure ulcer which had been present since 1976. He had been seen by numerous physicians and treated with debridement, topical antimicrobials, negative pressure therapy, growth factors, and a variety of dressings. We spent several months preparing the wound bed: maintaining adequate moisture balance, performing serial debridement, utilizing offloading surfaces and reducing the bacterial burden. His nutritional status was optimized. The wound bed developed a healthy granulating base but failed to close. Results:? A single unit of Apligraf was meshed at a 1:1.5 ratio and applied to the wound. It was fixed in place using a nonstick silicone dressing, foam, and a self-adhesive covering. The dressing was changed weekly in the wound clinic. The initial response was a decrease in wound depth followed by steady epithelialization. Complete closure occurred 17 weeks after grafting. The wound has not recurred. Conclusion:? This single case study suggests that bilayered cell therapy may have application in difficult wounds, such as pressure ulcerations. Further study into the efficacy of Apligraf in pressure ulcerations is ongoing.

AB  - In persons with venous ulcers and an absence of arterial disease, high compression as exemplified by the four layer bandage (Profore) has been demonstrated to be effective by a meta-analysis of existing studies. Despite optimized compression, some venous ulcers do not heal at the expected rate and persistent inflammation or infection may delay or prevent healing. We report the results of a case series that demonstrates an ionized silver dressing with prolonged release of nanocrystalline crystals (Acticoat 7) can decrease bacterial burden and accelerate healing in venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under a four layer bandage (Profore) for 12 weeks, or until healing. The primary efficacy objective measured the effect of the silver dressing on the wound microflora. Biopsies of the wounds were taken at baseline and after treatment with the silver dressing (Acticoat 7) and were analyzed for the bacterial species and number of bacteria present. In addition, serum silver levels were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and week 12 or final assessment. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. Of those patients who did not heal, 4 had more than a 94% reduction in wound area by the end of the 12-week study period. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase (p?=?0.054) in serum silver concentration during the treatment period. At baseline, prior to the silver dressing treatment (Acticoat 7), the median silver concentration was 0.3??g/L (range: 0.20?1.90??g/L). The median within patient change from baseline serum silver concentration was an increase of 0.15??g/L (range: ?0.3?2.8??g/L). Although this small increase was observed it was not considered clinically significant. This study illustrates the use of prolonged release nanocrystalline silver dressing to decrease the bacterial burden of chronic venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate.

AB  - Often chronic wounds have an increased bacterial burden that can impair healing without the classical clinical signs of infection. Silver dressings may provide an alternative topical method to control bacterial burden. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2?4 weeks therapy with the Silver Containing Hydrofiber? dressing on quantitative bacterial burden and clinical improvement in chronic wounds not healing at the expected rate. This was a single centre, four-armed study which included a total of 30 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and miscellaneous wounds that did not fit into any of the above categories. Patients had a baseline quantitative bacterial biopsy and this was repeated at weeks 2 to 4. The wound size was recorded along with a semi quantitative estimate of exudate and the periwound temperatures. Repeat measurements were performed at the follow-up visits and the decrease in wound size calculated. The underlying cause of the ulceration was be treated and corrected. This was followed by application of silver containing hydrofiber? dressing. There was a significant delay in healing of the leg ulcers associated with increased bacterial burden in the quantitative biopsy bacterial burden results at week 0 and healing at week 2. (p?=?0.01). Other subgroups had a similar association that did not reach statistical significance. The presence of an increased exudate in the leg ulcers at week two was associated with delayed healing at week 4 (p?=?0.05). There was also a significant increase in skin surface temperature of the surrounding skin with an increased quantitative bacterial biopsy of the deep wound compartment for venous, diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers with p values of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively. There was no significant decrease in exudate or increased healing of the wounds with the application of the silver hydrofiber dressing in this difficult to heal population. The population studied in this case series had increased bacterial burden in the deep compartment as measured with increased exudate and or an increased temperature of the periwound skin. These patients have an increased bacterial burden in the deep wound compartment that does not respond to topical ionized silver in the dressing studied.

AB  - How wound dressings may act locally to aid chronic wound healing is poorly understood. Along with an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and the realization that these ulcers exhibit a high degree of inflammation, models have been developed linking the disease etiology and the visible ulcer. Furthermore, these models have suggested ways in which present therapeutic regimens, such as compression, aid healing. However, little focus has been placed on understanding how locally applied wound dressings aid in the overall healing response in the context of elevated inflammation. Here, we propose that if wound dressings have the correct combination of novel materials and physical characteristics they may provide effective management of the damaging local factors (i.e., proteinases and/or bacteria), thereby promoting a local environment supportive of healing. For example, the management of damaging wound exudates, limiting its exposure to the wound bed and surrounding skin, reduces the irritant effects of these exudates, leading to a reduction in the localized stimulation of inflammation. A better understanding of local environment and wound dressing interactions will help in the development of more effective wound dressings in the future.

AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Purpose:? The purpose of this study was to determine the current use of wet-to-dry dressings as the principal wound care modality ordered by health care providers. In addition, this study describes the types of wounds wet-to-dry dressings are currently used for, the specialty of health care providers most likely to order these dressings, and associated data that indicates whether or not the clinical condition of the wound warrants the use of wet-to-dry dressing for mechanical debridement. Method:? This descriptive study involved a retrospective chart review of 202 home health and HMO case managed patients with open wounds One hundred and two HMO charts were reviewed; only 74 had sufficient data documented. One hundred and sixty-one home health charts were reviewed; only 128 were appropriate for data collection (closed incisions, drainage tubes, ostomies, and those charts where more than six items on the data collection sheet were not documented in the chart, were not used). The data was analyzed using SPSS. Findings:? This study suggests that the current use of wet-to-dry dressings is over 41% of all principal wound care modalities, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). The majority of wet-to-dry dressings ordered are for surgical wounds (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Furthermore, this study suggests that general surgeons are most likely to order wet-to-dry dressings (38%). Data also indicated that in over 78.6% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings, mechanical debridement was not indicated (the percent of granulating tissue in the wound bed was?>?75%). In only 3.5% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings was mechanical debridement possibly indicated by the amount of nonviable tissue in the wound bed. Discussion:? Clinicians need to be involved in research that will lead to evidenced based clinical practice and standardized wound care. The scientific literature suggests that wet-to-dry dressings are not evidenced based, but are detrimental to the granulating wound bed, painful, costly, and one of the least effective methods of debridement available today.

AB  - Induced organ regeneration is de novo synthesis of a physiological, or nearly physiological, organ at the same anatomical site as the organ that is being replaced. Regeneration of skin, peripheral nerves, and the conjunctiva have been accomplished using nothing more than biologically active scaffolds (regeneration templates) seeded with epithelial cells; devices for regeneration of the first two organs are in clinical use. Templates appear to function by blocking contraction well as by acting as temporary configurational guides for synthesis of new stroma that resembles that of the organ under replacement. The combined evidence supports a theory which predicts that selective blocking of the adult healing response uncovers part, at least, of the latent fetal response to injury and, in the presence of the appropriate scaffold, eventually leads to organ regeneration. An independent theory suggests that loss of regenerative potential, which is observed during the mammalian fetal-adult transition, is associated with simultaneous acquisition of individual immunocompetence.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.

AB  - Background:? Previously, we showed in a human forearm biopsy model of wound healing that acute healing dynamics can be characterized at the clinical and genetic level. Growth factor application by recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) accelerates the velocity of wound healing and modulates gene expression in wounds. To profile the function, structure, and genomics of acute healing, the human results were compared with a murine model of acute circular and incisional wounds. Methods:? Full thickness 8?mm circular skin wounds and linear surgical incisional wounds were created in 6-week-old Balb-C mice and recombinant angiogenic growth factors (PDGF vs. PDGF/FGF2/VEGF) were administered topically to wounds daily. Velocity of healing and time to complete closure were determined by digital planimetry. Tissue was examined for histopathological, morphometric, functional, and gene expression parameters, and compared to human results. Results:? Acute healing velocity can be quantified and compared in human and murine models. Linear incisions heal in distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and gene expression patterns compared to circular wounds. The cellular profile shows differences between wound types. Topical PDGF accelerates angiogenesis and time to complete acute healing. Human and murine gene expression was correlated. Results will be presented. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan component of normal dermis and a major component of the matrix synthesized during wound healing. Previous studies have shown that uncrosslinked HA is rapidly degraded and cleared in vivo, limiting its clinical utility. We have used a novel HA hydrogel scaffold that is crosslinked for prolonged bioavailability. It has a porous interior and a smooth surface. This scaffold can also be fabricated with collagen and linked to proteins or DNA to direct cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that this novel HA formulation might itself improve wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Purpose:? The present study explored the effects of a crosslinked HA hydrogel on wound healing. Methods:? Using an established model of wound healing, four 7?mm punch wounds were made on each ear of New Zealand rabbits. Each wound was immediately treated with topical application of one of the following: HA hydrogel (n?=?26), HA/collagen hydrogel (n?=?27), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(n?=?16). Wounds were harvested on day 8 for histologic evaluation. Sections were examined for epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth into wounds. Results:? HA- and HA/collagen-treated wounds showed statistically significant increases in epithelial (p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.007, respectively) and granulation tissue ingrowth (p?=?0.004 and p?=?0.01, respectively) when compared to PBS-treated controls. Conclusions:? In the rabbit ear ulcer model, the application of crosslinked HA and HA/collagen hydrogels accelerated wound healing as measured by epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth.
