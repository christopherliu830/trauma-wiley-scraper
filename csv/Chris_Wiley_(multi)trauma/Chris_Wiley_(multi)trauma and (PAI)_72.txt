AB  - Abstract:? This paper reviews the research published in the last 18?yr on QoL and psycho-social sequelae in pediatric patients who have undergone HSCT. A corpus of 47 empirical studies was selected and is presented here. From this selection five main topics linked to psychological adjustment to HSCT emerged: QoL; psychological symptoms; cognitive sequelae; social adaptation; psycho-social interventions for children. The information which emerged from the review of the literature is discussed with special attention to methodological issues. Directions for future research are proposed.

AB  - Background In 1993, Kavanagh and colleagues outlined outcomes from a training programme designed to equip mental health practitioners to deliver evidence-based cognitive-behavioural family interventions within routine care. The authors highlighted how the training had not been able to deliver notable increases in the numbers of families being seen by the trained clinicians. There were significant issues in the translation and provision of family interventions within clinical settings, specifically difficulties with the integration of family interventions and caseload demands, and insufficient time within job plans and service settings to undertake the work. The authors posed the question: what can the matter be? Interestingly, the same question was being asked over a decade later. Objective The current article provides a narrative review of the issues on implementation of family interventions in psychosis. Results Current evidence suggests that while there exist pockets of good practice and provision for family interventions, it was a mistake to assume that care coordinators would be able to include these family interventions as part of their role, effectively to add duties without significant modification to their current roles and duties. It also seems to have been an underestimate of the skills required for delivering family work in psychosis and the ongoing requirements for high-quality supervision. Conclusion We argue for carer specialists to be involved in mental health teams, particularly early intervention teams, and for a triage system to offer families a range of evidence-based support, as well as family interventions for more complex problems and presentations.
