AB  - Summary The genetic and molecular epidemiology studies carried out in recent decades have considerably enhanced our understanding of the genetic factors contributing to the development of obesity and involved in shaping interindividual differences not only in body weight and adiposity, but in susceptibility to response to energy-balance challenges and the development of several obesity-associated comorbidities. In addition, psychological factors focusing on the association between over-nutrition and behavioural, cognitive, and emotional processes, which may be under genetic or environmental influence, have to be taken into consideration. Weight gain is the consequence of many interacting processes. The majority of surgeons contend that gastric bypass is the bariatric procedure of choice for most patients with severe obesity. In morbidly obese patients refractory to diet and drug therapy, a substantial and sustained weight loss after bariatric surgery is obtained. However, the most effective treatment in the long term is, and will be, obesity prevention.

AB  - Abstract EFSA is requested to assess the safety of a broad range of biological agents in the context of notifications for market authorisation as sources of food and feed additives, enzymes and plant protection products. The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) concept was developed by EFSA for its own use to provide a generic food safety assessment approach applicable across EFSA's scientific Panels, for biological agents notified for intentional use in the whole food chain. The safety of unambiguously defined biological agents at the highest taxonomic unit that is appropriate for the purpose for which an application is intended are assessed, considering if the body of knowledge is sufficient. Identified safety concerns for a taxonomic unit could be reflected as ?qualifications? when considered appropriate for an inclusion on the QPS list. The list of QPS recommended biological agents is reviewed and updated annually. The 2009 update reviews the previously assessed microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi and assesses several additional notifications concerning gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. Lactobacillus cellobiosus, L. collinoides, Propionibacterium acidopropionici and Oenococcus oeni were included in the QPS list. No filamentous fungi were included because of potential production of toxic metabolites. For the first time viruses were assed. Insect viruses (Baculovirideae) and in the case of zucchini yellow mosaic viruses the Potyvirideae family as the highest possible taxonomic unit were added to the QPS list. Bacteriophages were considered as not appropriate for the QPS list. A potential presence of antimycotic resistance of yeasts referred to on the QPS list was considered. It was concluded that yeast strains resistant to antimycotics used for treatment of infections in humans might be of public health concern.
