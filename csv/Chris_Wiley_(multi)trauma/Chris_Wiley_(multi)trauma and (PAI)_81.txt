AB  - Summary? Over the past 10 years, more than 40 potentially oncogenic genes, termed protooncogenes, have been identified in the human genome. Little is known of the physiological role of the proteins encoded by these genes, but they seem to be involved in the reception and transmission of hormonal and other environmental information from the cell membrane to the nucleus. These proteins may acquire transforming properties when over-expressed or if structurally altered following partial deletions or point mutations. Cytogenetic analysis shows loss of genetic material from specific chromosomal loci in many human tumors, suggesting that the absence of a functional gene at these loci may permit tumor development. The genes involved have been termed ?anti-oncogenes?. Understanding the control mechanisms of cell proliferation is essential in order to understand how cancer cells escape from this control. To this end, numerous oncogenes have been cloned, permitting the production of modified forms of oncogenic proteins and identification of the regions essential for their biological activity. Availability of large amounts of protein also allows the production of specific antibody which can be used to verify whether blockage of a given protein results in reversion of the transformed phenotype. If it can be shown that the expression of an oncogenic protein is essential for transformation, it should be possible to search for molecules that inhibit its action or which mimic the effects of an anti-oncogene. This type of research is already well advanced for the oncogenic ras proteins, and models have been established that permit both screening for potential inhibitors and design of specific antagonists.

AB  - In this study, the morphological and anatomical features of Lamium lycium Boiss. (Lamiaceae) are described in detail. L. lycium has a perennial tap-root, and the stem is ascending and clearly quadrangular. The leaves are simple and broadly ovate to narrowly ovate in shape. The inflorescense is a verticillate cyme. The corolla is purple and the upper lip is hooded. For anatomy, the cross-sections of root, stem, leaf, petiole, calyx, corolla and generative organs were examined and the anatomical features of the taxon are discussed. The morphological features were in most respects congruent with previous reports. However, the anatomy of L. lycium has not been studied before and the results are here compared with trose of previous studies on other members of Lamiaceae. Furthermore, glandular trichomes are illustrated. The results are presented with photographs and tables.

AB  - Abstract The authors conducted a systematic BRS and English-language literature review of the last 10 years of research on the assessment, prevalence, and antidepressant treatment of major depression in the medically ill to determine the current state of knowledge and to make recommendations for future studies. Ninety-three prevalence studies (13,518 patients and 33 conditions or medical settings) met basic methodological inclusion criteria. The great majority (68.8%) of these studies did not describe their methodological approach to the diagnostic assessment of symptoms such as fatigue, which could be due to either a depression or a comorbidphysical disorder. This problem of overlapping symptomatology has been termed the ?problem of etiological assessment.? The 29 (31.2%) studies which did describe an approach to this problem used one or more of four different approaches: an ?inclusive? approach, an ?exclusive? approach, an ?etiological? approach, or a ?substitutive? approach. Prevalence rates of major depression varied greatly (0-78%). Regarding treatment, of eight controlled studies of antidepressant therapies for major depression, six reported statistically significant differences between medications and placebo. The authors conclude that many recent studies concerning the assessment, prevalence, and treatment of major depression in the medically ill have been inadequate to generate reliable and valid information. Guidelines for future research, especially focusing on the collection of validation data, are proposed. Depression 1:181-204 (1993). ? 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
