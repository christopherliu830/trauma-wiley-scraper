AB  - Summary The resiliency framework within child and adolescent research has developed as both a conceptual and methodological framework for guiding the investigation of protective factors in young people. There are two key reasons: childhood as the origin of adult disorder and considering strengths as a counter to stigma. A balanced approach to clinical work and research with young people that accommodates adversity, dysfunction, and protective factors or strengths may reduce stigma and help to build optimism. The dual-factor model of mental health represents one framework which outlines a multidimensional approach to mental health, which has been advocated for use in young people. This model frames mental health in terms of two distinct continua, one capturing psychopathology and the other capturing subjective well-being (SWB). It is possible to integrate resilience approach into clinical practice and this may have advantages over an adversity, dysfunction and symptom-reduction dominated approach.

AB  - Abstract The World Congress of Psychiatric Genetics (WCPG) has become an annual event since the early 1990's sponsored by the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics (ISPG). Each year the latest published and unpublished findings are aired for discussion by representatives of the majority of research programs on this topic world-wide. The 2007 congress was held in New York City and attracted over 1000 researchers. The topics emphasized included results from whole genome association studies, the significance of copy number variation and the important contributions of epigenetic events to psychiatric disorders. There were over 20 oral sessions devoted to these and other topics of interest. Young investigator recipients of travel awards served as rapporteurs to summarize sessions and these summaries follow.

AB  - Diaspora migration is one of many types of migration likely to increase considerably during the early twenty-first century. This article addresses the many ambiguities that surround diaspora migration with a view to developing a meaningful theoretical scheme in which to better understand the processes involved. The term diaspora has acquired a broad semantic domain. It now encompasses a motley array of groups such as political refugees, alien residents, guest workers, immigrants, expellees, ethnic and racial minorities, and overseas communities. It is used increasingly by displaced persons who feel, maintain, invent or revive a connection with a prior home. Concepts of diaspora include a history of dispersal, myths/memories of the homeland, alienation in the host country, desire for eventual return ? which can be ambivalent, eschatological or utopian ? ongoing support of the homeland and, a collective identity defined by the above relationship. This article considers four central issues: How does diaspora theory link into other theoretical issues? How is diaspora migration different from other types of migration? Who are the relevant actors and what are their roles? What are the social and political functions of diaspora? On the basis of this analysis a theoretical paradigm of diasporas is presented to enable scholars to move beyond descriptive research by identifying different types of diasporas and the dynamics that differentiate among them. Use of the proposed typology ? especially in comparative research of different diasporas ? makes it possible to focus on structural differences and similarities that could be critical to the social processes involved.

AB  - Following the principles of care recommended in the 2006 Consensus Statement on Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), along with input from representatives of peer support and advocacy groups, this study surveyed DSD clinical management practices at healthcare facilities in the United States. DSD are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. Facilities providing care for patients with DSD were targeted for participation. Specialty providers completed a survey with questions in six broad categories: Institution Information, Nomenclature and Care Guidelines, Interdisciplinary Services, Staff and Community Education, DSD Management, and Research. Twenty-two of 36 targeted sites (61%) participated. Differences were observed between sites with regard to what conditions were considered to be DSD. All sites reported some degree of involvement of pediatric urology and/or surgery and pediatric endocrinology in the care of DSD patients. Gynecology and neonatology were most frequently not represented. Wide variation was observed across sites in continuing education standards, obtaining informed consent for clinical procedures, and in specific clinical management practices. This survey is the first to assess DSD clinical management practices in the United States. The findings establish a baseline of current practices against which providers delivering care to these patients and their families can benchmark their efforts. Such surveys also provide a practical framework for collaboration in identifying opportunities for change that enhance health and quality of life outcomes for patients and families affected by DSD.
