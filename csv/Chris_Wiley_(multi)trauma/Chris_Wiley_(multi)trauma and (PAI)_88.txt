AB  - Abstract Aims To conduct a concept analysis of clinical practice contexts (work environments) in health care. Background Context is increasingly recognized as important to the development, delivery, and understanding of implementation strategies; however, conceptual clarity about what comprises context is lacking. Design Modified Walker and Avant concept analysis comprised of five steps: (1) concept selection; (2) determination of aims; (3) identification of uses of context; (4) determination of its defining attributes; and (5) definition of its empirical referents. Methods A wide range of databases were systematically searched from inception to August 2014. Empirical articles were included if a definition and/or attributes of context were reported. Theoretical articles were included if they reported a model, theory, or framework of context or where context was a component. Double independent screening and data extraction were conducted. Analysis was iterative, involving organizing and reorganizing until a framework of domains, attributes. and features of context emerged. Result We identified 15,972 references, of which 70 satisfied our inclusion criteria. In total, 201 unique features of context were identified, of these 89 were shared (reported in two or more studies). The 89 shared features were grouped into 21 attributes of context which were further categorized into six domains of context. Conclusion This study resulted in a framework of domains, attributes and features of context. These attributes and features, if assessed and used to tailor implementation activities, hold promise for improved research implementation in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Widespread observations of malformed amphibians across North America have generated both concern and controversy. Debates over the causes of such malformations?which can affect >50% of animals in a population?have continued, likely due to involvement of multiple causal factors. Here, we used a 13-year dataset encompassing 53,880 frogs and toads from 422 wetlands and 42 states in the conterminous USA to test hypotheses relating abnormalities and four categories of potential drivers: (i) chemical contaminants, (ii) land use practices, (iii) parasite infection, and (iv) targeted interactions between parasites and pesticides. Using a hierarchically nested, competing-model approach, we further examined how these associations varied spatially among geographic regions. Although malformations were rare overall (average = 1.6%), we identified 96 hotspot sites with 5%?25% abnormal individuals. Using the full dataset of 934 collections (without data on parasite infection), malformation frequency was best predicted by the presence of oil and gas wells within the watershed. Among collections also examined for parasite infection (n = 154), average parasite load and its interaction with pesticide application positively predicted malformations: wetlands with a greater abundance of the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae were more likely to have malformed amphibians, but these effects were strongest when pesticide application was also high, consistent with prior experimental research. Importantly, however, the influence of these factors also varied regionally, helping explain divergent results from previous studies at local scales; parasite infection was more influential in the West and Northeast, whereas pesticide application and oil/gas wells correlated with abnormalities in the Northeast, Southeast, and western regions of the USA. These results, based on the largest systematic sampling of amphibian malformations, suggest that increased observations of abnormal amphibians are associated with both parasite infection and chemical contaminants, but that their relative importance and interaction strength varied with the spatial extent of the analysis.

AB  - This article analyses the critique of militaristic geopolitical worldviews in two novels by Martín Kohan (Dos veces junio, 2002 and Ciencias morales, 2007). Drawing on ?everyday nationalism? and the insights of feminist geopolitics, it explores these novels' use of space and gendered violence to present Argentina's 1976?1983 dictatorship and the Falklands/Malvinas war as unexceptional manifestations of the relationship between the state and its citizens. This reading foregrounds Kohan's emphasis on the origins and consequences of national identity discourses, framed as powerful narratives capable of generating a vision of the nation-state that privileges the security of borders over bodies.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses two main groups of enzymes, namely those involved in cell signalling and those that perform a number of protein modifications, such as glycosylation. The signalling enzymes include protein kinases and phosphatases, cyclases and phosphodiesterases, also an extensive group of small GTP-binding proteins. Some lipid kinases and phosphatases relating to inositol signalling are listed with the protein kinases and protein phosphatases, respectively. Lastly, the 'other signalling enzymes' list entries (prenyltransferases and phospholipases for example), that do not readily fit into the other categories. The protein modification enzymes are involved in protein synthesis and folding, as well as breakdown by peptidases and their inhibitors. There are also sections devoted to glycosylation, ubiquitylation (and related) modifications as well as specific (epigenetic) modifications to chromatin proteins. The section on 'other protein modifications' includes such diverse enzymes as the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, transglutaminases and tubulin tyrosine ligases.

AB  - Abstract This paper provides an historical overview of Spain's nation-building process from the nineteenth century to the present time. Using Stein Rokkan's centre-periphery paradigm, the paper argues that a pervasive feature in contemporary Spanish history is the dialectical relationship between the Spanish nation and the peripheral nations of Catalonia and the Basque Country. From this perspective, the Spanish nation-building process is understood as one of the main triggering events for the emergence of peripheral nationalisms at the end of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, tensions between the core and the periphery help to explain why Spain has a quasi-federal institutional structure. Recent interest in ?constitutional patriotism? for example, can only be understood in relation to Catalan and Basque initiatives to reform their autonomy status.
