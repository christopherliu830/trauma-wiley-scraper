AB  - Until the beginning of the 1990s Poland did not receive foreign migrants. Thereafter, the situation changed dramatically. A large part of the inflow proved to be illegal migrants, many of whom were in transit to Western Europe. Although these movements gradually declined in the second half of the decade, some became increasingly identified with relatively sophisticated smuggling of people. Foreigners smuggled from the South to the West, together with the international criminal networks assisting them, became typical of the migratory movements of people in Central and Eastern Europe during the 1990s. This article seeks to describe illegal migration from the perspective of Poland, a country often perceived as a major transit area in the smuggling of persons to Western Europe. The conclusions draw on the findings of several surveys recently carried out in Poland. Basic concepts related to illegal migration are defined and juxtaposed, and various myths and stereotypes concerning it that most often stem from the paucity of empirical evidence are examined. Finally, the trends observed in Poland are interpreted within the larger context of contemporary European migration.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, the author explores some aspects of Almodóvar's early life as a narrative that was always already inscribed in cultural myths as articulated in films. In tracing the cultural narratives that frame Almodóvar's autobiographical account, the author is attempting to read the materials provided by the director as nonnatural, or constructed, and non-transparent, in other words, as a site for the kind of ideological discourse Roland Barthes called ?mythologies,? in which the critical operation consists in deciphering the excessive accumulation of reasons, alibis and appearances, that is, the ?natural,? in order to make evident the rule-governed exchange that underlies the both semantic meaning and collective life. In this ?deciphering? by taking into account reasons or alibis through cultural mythologies, the author is trying to clarify the meaning of autobiographical discourse for Almodóvar.

AB  - ABSTRACT Latin America witnessed the election of ?new Left? governments in the early 21st century that, in different ways, sought to open a debate about alternatives to paradigms of neoliberal development. What has this meant for the way that human rights are understood and for patterns of human rights compliance? Using qualitative and quantitative evidence, this article discusses how human rights are imagined and the compliance records of new Left governments through the lens of the three ?generations? of human rights ? political and civil, social and economic, and cultural and environmental rights. The authors draw in particular on evidence from Andean countries and the Southern Cone. While basic civil and individual liberties are still far from guaranteed, especially in the Andean region, new Left countries show better overall performances in relation to socio-economic rights compared to the past and to other Latin American countries. All new Left governments also demonstrate an increasing interest in ?third generation? (cultural and environmental) rights, though this is especially marked in the Andean Left. The authors discuss the tensions around interpretations and categories of human rights, reflect on the stagnation of first generation rights and note the difficulties associated with translating second and third generation rights into policy.
