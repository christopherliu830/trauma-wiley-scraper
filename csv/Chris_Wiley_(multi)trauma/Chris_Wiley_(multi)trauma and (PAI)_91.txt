AB  - Summary Beside the ?classical? bacterial zoonoses, this chapter covers infectious diseases such as listeriosis, in which the causative agents are frequently found in animals and that are traditionally regarded as zoonoses. However, since these agents may also be found in the environment and are not necessarily transmitted directly from animals to humans, diseases caused by them have also been termed ?sapronoses,? ?geonoses,? or ?saprozoonoses.?

AB  - The issue of the researcher's relationship with the subject of ?extreme violence? is approached here from the point of view not of subjective motivations, but of the scientific rule of distanc-ing which, in the absence of specific epistemo-logical recommendations, seems to apply in this case as in others. At times of ?exit? from violence, when a repressive authoritarian regime is replaced by a democratic government, the ?right Distance? of the researcher has particular consequences: it may coincide with the tenets of governmental ?reconciliation? policies, in particular the injunction to victims to weigh their demands against the need for pacification in the general interest. This convergence - which does not necessarily involve collusion - shows how difficult it is to find the right stance towards the subject of ?violence?: epistemological rules cannot be dissociated from a particular political context and from a social relationship with violence, and may thus have normative implications.

AB  - Abstract Phase I of this study was designed to inform the development of a range of responses to hazardous and harmful amphetamine use. Research techniques from Rapid Assessment Methodology (RAM) were utilized to collect data. A survey of current amphetamine users included the Short Form 36 (SF36) Health Status Questionnaire, for which South Australian population norms were published in 1995. This facilitated comparisons of the health of this sample of amphetamine users with that of the general population. The sample were found to have significantly poorer health than the general population. The self-reported prevalence of mental health problems in the sample was consistent with previous Australian research on amphetamine use. Approximately one-third of the sample reported that they had experienced symptoms of anxiety, depression, mood swings and aggressive outbursts prior to their use of amphetamines. Two-thirds of the sample reported symptoms of anxiety and depression since starting to use amphetamines, almost half reported mood swings and aggressive outbursts, and over a third reported panic attacks and paranoia. One of the most important findings was a strong association between mental and physical health problems and the severity of dependence on amphetamines. The implications of these results for interventions with amphetamine users are discussed.
