AB  - Summary Athens and Rome?the only political entities in the classical world for which sufficient information has survived to permit meaningful discussion of the erotic experience of unfree persons?demonstrate slaves' sexual situation. At Athens, in contrast to some other Greek cities, slaves had no duty to defer in any context (including the erotic) to free persons outside their own oikos, and even within the oikos they were to some extent protected?by social structure and by law?from flagrant sexual abuse. Modern scholarship consistently sketches Rome as a unitary world in which a slave?Latin servus (masculine), serva (feminine) servi, servae (plural)?devoid of sexual rights, was vulnerable to severe erotic abuse. Slave owners had unlimited erotic access to servi and servae, and supposedly made full exploitative use of that power?which was restrained only by their (occasional) self-control.

AB  - Summary With their company Sudaca Films, Mariana Rondón (b. 1966, Barquisimeto) and Marité Ugás (b. 1963, Lima) have offered a model for incisive political filmmaking in Venezuela. The filmmakers met at Cuba's Escuela Internacional de Cine y Televisión San Antonio de los Baños [International School of Film and Television or EICTV] where they were introduced to a model of filmmaking that they have promoted in all their subsequent work as directors, screenwriters, producers and in Ugás's case editor. In this interview they reflect on their training, their process for making work, co-directing and their habitual practice alternating producer and director roles on each other's work. The conversation also covers wider issues of filmmaking in Venezuela and the classification of Latin American cinema.

AB  - The article seeks to elucidate and academically position the genre of critical arts-based research in education. The article fuses Critical Race Theory (CRT), life history and performance, alongside work with undocumented American students of Mexican origin, to show how a politicised qualitative paradigmatic re envisioning can occur in which counter-histories and counter-stories can be co-created into a powerful, evocative, and transformative arts-based performance text: Undocumented Historias. The article reflects on how critical arts-based research in education can function as a means to legitimise, empower and promote the voices of the educationally and socially marginalised; evoking an experiential and sensual means of feeling and knowing by which researcher and researched may co-recover, interrogate and enrich an anti-colonialist critique of the dominant social order.

AB  - This two-year autoethnographic action research study explores the processes a multiethnic/multiracial family uses to maintain their children's heritage language of Spanish and the family's multiculturalism. Data sources (including interviews and participant observations in the home and the dual-language school) specifically focus on the eldest child, Nelia, from her kindergarten and first-grade years where she attended a public dual-language program. The findings illuminate the integral link between the family's ideology toward valuing bilingualism and the necessity of school support.

AB  - SUMMARY Calcium plays a central role as a second messenger in plant and fungal cells and as such is involved in controlling numerous biological processes. Direct demonstration of signal-response coupling via Ca2+ requires the measurement and localization of changes in cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, during these processes in living cells. In recent years this has become possible with the introduction of a range of fluorescent dyes (e.g. Indo-1 Fura-2 and Fluo-3) which have a high affinity and selectivity for free Ca2+. When used with recently developed microscope technologies (e.g. fluorescence ratio imaging or confocal scanning laser microscopy), subcellular localization and precise quantification of [Ca2+]i dynamics in single cells can be achieved. This review describes the principles of [Ca2+]i imaging and measurement using fluorescent dyes, the equipment required to do it, the problems with botanical material and how they are being overcome, future developments for this approach in plant cell biology, and an entirely different strategy for the imaging and measurement of [Ca2+]i involving genetic transformation with the aequorin gene.

AB  - Summary Parasitic zoonoses belong to the most important human diseases worldwide. They are caused by protozoa, helminths [trematodes (flukes), cestodes (tapeworms), and nematodes (round worms)], Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), pentastomids (tongue worms), and arthropods. The last of these plays an additional role as a transmitter of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths.
