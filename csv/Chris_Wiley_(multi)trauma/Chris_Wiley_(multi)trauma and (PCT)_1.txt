AB  - Objective The contributions of disorder severity, comorbidity and interpersonal variables to therapists' adherence to a cognitive?behavioural treatment (CBT) manual were tested. Method Thirty-eight patients received panic control therapy (PCT) for panic disorder. Trained observers watching videotapes of the sixth session of a 24-session protocol rated therapists' adherence to PCT and their use of interventions from outside the CBT model. Different observers rated patients' behavioural resistance to therapy in the same session using the client resistance code. Interview measures obtained before treatment included the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the anxiety disorders interview schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, Axis II. Questionnaire measures were the anxiety sensitivity index at intake, and, at session 2, the therapist and client versions of the working alliance inventory?short form. Results The higher the patients' resistance and the more Axis II traits a patient had, the less adherent the therapist. Moreover, the more resistant the client, the more therapists resorted to interventions from outside the CBT model. Stronger therapist and patient alliance was also generally related to better adherence, but these results were somewhat inconsistent across therapists. Pretreatment disorder severity and comorbidity were not related to adherence. Conclusions Interpersonal variables, particularly behavioural resistance to therapy, are related to therapists' ability to adhere to a treatment manual and to their use of interventions from outside of the CBT model. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner message Patients' behavioural resistance to therapy may make it more difficult for cognitive?behavioural clinicians to adhere to a structured treatment protocol and more likely for them to borrow interventions from outside the CBT model. Patients' Axis II traits may make adherence to treatment CBT protocol more difficult, although whether this is true varies across therapists. Therapists' adherence to a structured protocol and borrowing from outside of the CBT model do not appear to be affected by disorder severity or Axis I comorbidity.

AB  - Abstract In 2017, 1492 patients were added to the pancreas transplant waiting list, 964 listed as active, a slight increase from 2016. This is significant because for the first time in the past decade, the steady downward trend in additions to the waiting list has been reversed. Proportions of pancreas donors with cerebrovascular accident as cause of death decreased, with a concomitant increase in proportions with anoxia and head trauma. This is partly a result of the national opioid crisis, and it reflects increasing use of younger donors for pancreas transplant. The 2017 outcome report remains compromised by previous variation in reporting graft failure. Although the OPTN Pancreas Transplantation Committee has approved more precise definitions of pancreas graft failure, implementation of these definitions took place recently, and the data are not reflected in this report.

AB  - Background The socioeconomic factors have an impact on case mix and outcome in critical illness, but how these factors affect the use of intensive care is not studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in patients from residential areas with different annual incomes. Methods Single-center, retrospective study in Northern Finland. All the non?trauma-related emergency admissions from the hospital district area were included. The postal codes were used to categorize the residential areas according to each area's annual median income: the low-income area, ?18,979 to ?28,841 per year; the middle-income area, ?28,879 to ?33,856 per year; and the high-income area, ?34,221 to ?53,864 per year. Results A total of 735 non?trauma-related admissions were included. The unemployment or retirement, psychiatric comorbidities and chronic alcohol abuse were common in this population. The highest incidence, 5.5 (4.6?6.7)/1000/year, was in population aged more than 65 years living in high-income areas. In working-aged population, the incidence was lowest in high-income areas (1.5 (1.3?1.8/1000/year) compared to middle-income areas (2.2 (1.9?2.6)/1000/year, P = 0.001) and low-income areas (2.0 (1.7?2.4)/1000/, P = 0.009). Poisonings were more common in low-income areas. There were no differences in outcome. Conclusion The incidence of ICU admission in working-aged population was 25% higher in those areas where the annual median income was below the median annual income of ?38,775 per inhabitant per year in Finland.

AB  - The BIOMED international outcome study on childhood depression offered a unique opportunity for the systematic treatment of children and families with major depression using systemic psychotherapy. This paper describes the experiences of clinicians working with the families referred and the theoretical and clinical models that evolved during the treatment process. The concept of ?keeping company with hope and despair? emerged as an overarching framework for thinking about the quality of the therapeutic relationship in this developing area of clinical practice. We illustrate our systemically informed interventions with case examples and discuss the role played by therapists' ?use of self? in engaging and fostering change in families gripped by depression.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, 2409 active candidates aged 12 years or older were added to the lung transplant waiting list; 2072 transplants were performed, the most of any year. The median waiting time for candidates listed in 2015 was 3.4 months; the shortest waiting time was for diagnosis group D. Despite the highest recorded transplant rate of 157 per 100 waitlist years, waitlist mortality continued a steady decade-long rise to a high of 16.5 deaths per 100 waitlist years. Measures of short- and long-term survival showed no trend toward improved overall survival in the past 5 years, except that 6-month death rates decreased from 9.4% in 2005 to 7.9% in 2014. At 5 years posttransplant, 55.5% of recipients remained alive. In 2015, 23 new child (ages 0?11 years) candidates were added to the list; 17 transplants were performed. Incidence of death was 6.1% at 6 months and 8.2% at 1 year for transplants in 2013?2014. Important policy changes will affect access to transplant. In February 2015, OPTN implemented a comprehensive revision of the lung allocation score to better reflect mortality risk. Broader geographic sharing of donor lungs for pediatric candidates and allowance for selected transplants across blood types for candidates aged younger than 2 years have been approved and are expected to improve pediatric access to transplant. The impact of these changes on lung transplant trends will be observed in the coming years.

AB  - Abstract In 2016, 2692 candidates aged 12 years or older were added to the lung transplant waiting list; 2345 transplants were performed, the largest number of any prior year. The median waiting time for listed candidates in 2016 was 2.5 months, and waiting times were shortest for group D candidates. The transplant rate increased to 191.9 transplants per 100 waitlist years in 2016, with a slight decrease in waitlist mortality to 15.1 deaths per 100 waitlist years. Short-term survival continued to improve, with a 6-month death rate of 6.6% and a 1-year death rate of 10.8% among recipients in 2015 compared with 8.0% and 13.3%, respectively, among recipients in 2014. Long-term survival rates remained unchanged; 55.6% of recipients were alive at 5 years. In 2016, 23 new candidates aged 0-11 years were added to the waiting list and 16 lung transplants were performed. Incidence of posttransplant mortality for lung transplant recipients aged 0-11 years who underwent transplant in 2014-2015 was 13.8% at 6 months and 19.6% at 1 year. Changes in waitlist and transplant demographic features continued to evolve following implementation of the revised lung allocation score in 2015. Some early trends that may be attributable to the revised LAS are shorter waiting times, stabilization of the number of group D candidates listed for transplant, and convergence of LAS with lower prevalence of extremely high scores.

AB  - Abstract The primary goal of US lung allocation policy is to ensure that candidates with the highest risk for mortality receive appropriate access to lung transplant. In 2018, 2562 lung transplants were performed in the US, reflecting a 31% increase over the past 5 years. More candidates are being listed for lung transplant, and the number of donors has increased substantially. Despite an increase of 84 lung transplants in 2018, 365 adult candidates died or became too sick to undergo transplant. In 2018, 24 new child (ages 0-11 years) candidates were added to the lung transplant waiting list. Fifteen lung transplants were performed in recipients aged 0-11 years, three in recipients aged younger than 1 year, two in recipients aged 1-5 years, and ten in recipients aged 6-11 years. Of 27 child candidates removed from the waiting list in 2018, 16 (59.3%) were removed due to undergoing transplant, six (22.2%) due to death, one (3.7%) due to improved condition, and one (3.7%) due to becoming too sick to undergo transplant.

AB  - Abstract Each year since 2012, the number of lung transplants has increased, reflecting an increase in the number of donors, improved use of recovered organs, and more candidates being listed for transplant. However, the need for organs continues to outpace available donors. Despite an increase of 126 donors in 2017, 1360 candidates remained on the waiting list at the end of the year, and 326 patients died or became too sick to undergo transplant. Approximately 14,000 individuals were living with a lung transplant in 2017; 9492 were aged 50 years or older, 4075 were aged 18-49 years, and 408 were aged younger than 18 years.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.
