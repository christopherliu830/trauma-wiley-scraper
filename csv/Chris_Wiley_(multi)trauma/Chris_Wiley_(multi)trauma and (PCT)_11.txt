AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Introduction:? The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) has established target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11?12?g/dL for all dialysis patients. For patients who leave an inpatient hospitalization with an Hb under this target, it is hypothesized that several factors contribute to the length of time required to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL after hospitalization. Objective:? To identify factors contributing to a decreased likelihood of reaching this target Hb. Methods:? Using the first hospitalization of patients who initiated HD in 1999 and who were regularly treated with EPO, we identified those with a mean Hb of less than 11?g/dL on EPO claims during the same month as their index hospitalization. Patients were then followed up to see how long it took them to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL, censored at death, re-hospitalization, a switch of modality, or suspension of EPO treatment. Results:? A total of 6050 HD patients were identified. 3 months after hospitalization, 70% had achieved 11?g/dL, and 12% had been censored. For the remaining patients who eventually reached 11?g/dL, the average number of additional months required was 2.69 (SE of 0.09). From proportional hazards regression on the time (in months) to achieving an Hb of 11?g/dL, factors that significantly decreased the likelihood of reaching a target Hb included: a diagnosis on the index hospitalization of CHF or hepatic disease, a low Hb prior to the hospitalization, a high dose of EPO prior to the hospitalization, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusions:? Patients with anemia after hospitalization are at high risk of both persistent anemia and rehospitalization. It is important to address patient comorbidities, to ensure adequate medication usage, and to monitor patient progress to prevent hospitalizations and potential impact on Hb levels.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - Background:? Daily hemodialysis (DHD) markedly ameliorates cardiovascular instability (CVI) and discomfort (DIS) during dialysis, but patients continue to have some of these problems during DHD. We studied what contributed to these problems during 4445 DHD in 23 patients. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR), maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP), and a subjective score of patients' overall evaluation of the quality of dialysis (OEQ), adding a score of 14 symptoms (0 best, 40 worst). Independent variables were ultrapure dialysate and biocompatible dialysis (UP) (1626 dialyses) vs. conventional dialysis (CONV) (2819 dialyses), ultrafiltration (Uf) as percentage of body weight (BW), pre?post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1 kg?BW?1), and target??post-dialysis BW (Ta-Po BW). Relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased by 1.6?±?13/min; MAX BP fall was 25?±?20?mmHg; OV BP fall was 13?±?22?mmHg; OEQ?=?0.6 ±?1.2. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=??BUN???0.12?+?Ta-Po BW?????1.8?+?K/V???1.1???5 r?=?0.13, p?<?0.0001 MAX BP?=?CONV???8?+?T???0.2???Ta-Po BW ?????6?+?Uf???2.7??13 r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001 OV BP?=?CONV???11?+?Uf???4???Ta-Po BW ????4?+??BUN???0.3???9 r?=?0.35, p?<?0.0001 OEQ?=?K/V???0.3???Ta-Po BW???0.1???0.2 r?=?0.20, p?<?0.0001 Conclusion:? To minimize drop in BP and hypotensive crashes, use of ultrapure dialysate and a biocompatible membrane (UP) was by far the most important factor, followed by slowing dialysis. To avoid post-dialysis tachycardia and discomfort during dialysis, slow dialysis was most important. Overall, ?fast? dialysis and use of ?impure? regular dialysate appear to be the major dialysis factors causing CV instability and discomfort during daily hemodialysis.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.
