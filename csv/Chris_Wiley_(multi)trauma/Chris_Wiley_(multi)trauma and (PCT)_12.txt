AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis patients is, to a large extent, determined by demographics and by existing comorbidities, but it is obvious that variations in dialysis dose have substantial effects. Using eKt/V, 1.2 monthly comparisons are recommended by European guidelines, but they assume that dose is maintained during all monthly sessions. Because of dialysis-related problems like hypotension, reduction of blood flow, dialysis time, microclotting of the dialyzer, and vascular access problems, the delivered dose may vary from session to session. New developed devices based on online conductivity clearance reflect the electrolyte clearance and, thus, clearance of urea. The aim of this prospective study was to show the variability of dialysis dose. 24 anuric patients were studied during 3 months: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with online conductivity monitor (OCM) and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Each patient was subjected to OCM on regular sessions during 3 months, and blood Kt/V samples were taken on midweek day, once a month. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation with other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The conductivity-based OCM provides an accurate tool to monitor the dose and control of each hemodialysis session and adds to the efficiency of current dialysis adequacy monitoring. OCM device requires little maintenance, and no extra effort is needed. Monthly Kt/V does not reflect the variability of each session. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its influence on morbidity and mortality. ? Descriptives ?

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialysis is often complicated by cardiovascular instability (CVI). We studied factors contributing to this problem during 720 hemodialyses (HDs) in 20 patients; 480 dialyses were 6/week and 240 were 3/week. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR) and maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP). Independent variables were dialyses/week (DIAL), ultrafiltration (Uf), % of body weight (BW), pre-post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1?kg?1 BW), target-postdialysis BW (Ta-Po BW), Kt/V, ?PO4, ?bicarbonate, ?potassium, ?BUN, an ?unphysiology index? summing up changes in electrolytes, and BUN and BW during dialysis (UPI). The relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased 0.5?±?11/min; MAX BP fall was 23?±?17?mmHg; OV BP fall was 12?±?19?mmHg. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=?38???DIAL???4?+?T???0.1?+?Uf???1.8?+?PO4 ??1.8???UPI??0.2???K/V???2, r?=?0.30, p?<?0.0001; MAX BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+??PO4???2.6?+?11, r?=?0.34, p?<?0.0001; OV BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+?PO4???2.7 +?1, r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001. Conclusion:? To prevent BP fall and tachycardia during hemodialysis, the most important factor to decrease is unphysiology, i.e., the oscillations in electrolytes, fluid spaces, and osmolality that occur during dialysis. The best way to do this is to dialyze patients daily. An unexpected finding worthy of further investigation was the large detrimental influence of ?PO4 on CVI.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.

AB  - Low serum albumin, high serum phosphorus, and fluid overload are common issues in dialysis patients. This can be attributed to many causes such as inadequate understanding and lack of accountability in the patients' care. These abnormal levels contribute to increased medical complications and increased mortality. Objective:? (i) Improve patient education of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid maintenance. (ii) Improve patients' albumin, phosphorus, and fluid levels by 25 percent. Methods:? A baseline level was collected on all patients by averaging last 3 laboratory findings. All patients were educated recognizing several different learning styles. Educational posters were displayed, one-on-one education was provided, as well as educational games on the role of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid. Patients were also educated on the role of diet in these levels. Positive reinforcement, peer pressure, and intensive team approach were used through the 8-week incentive contest. Feedback on progress was provided in written and verbal format. Prizes were awarded for best shift levels and shift with most improvements. Results:? Levels measured at the end of the educational period and contest showed a 71% improvement in albumin levels, 52% improvement in phosphorus levels, and a 42% improvement in fluid levels. Conclusion:? Significant improvements found in all areas are attributed to three factors: education, consistent, individual, intensive attention, and incentives. Peer pressure was found not to be as effective but that individual tracking for incentives may be more effective if done ongoing. Our follow up several months later found a slight decrease in improvements, and we recognize a need for an ongoing intervention. Yet, we found an overall improvement of level of understanding and commitment to their overall health.

AB  - Aim:? The comparative study of hemodialysis (HD) adequacy of Kt/V measurement between classic method (Daugirdas formula) and urea sensor monitor (online). Patients and methods:? 30 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis were studied. A comparative evaluation of HD adequacy during the same session was done with two different methods: (1) blood samples were drawn in the beginning and in the end of HD session for the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and after measurement of HD adequacy by 3rd generation Daugirdas formula and (2) urea sensor monitor use for continuous HD adequacy measurement during HD session. Results:? There was statistically significant correlation of Kt/V Daugirdas with Kt/V online (r?=?0.8, p?<?0.001). Also there was statistically significant correlation between solute removal index (SRI), Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=?0.81, p?<?0.001) and Kt/V online (r?=?0.92, p?<?0.001). From nutrition indices that were measured, the protein catabolic rate (PCR) had marginal negative correlation with the two compared adequacy indices, Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=??0.24, p?<?0.03), and Kt/V online (r?=??0.17, p?<?0.03) although the nPCR (normalized PCR) had marginal positive correlation (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.05) (r?=?0.42, p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? The use of online urea sensor monitors contributes to the easy measurement of adequacy and nutrition indices and hence complicated mathematical formulas are not necessary. The results of these measurements are reliable and comparable with classic methods of HD adequacy evaluation.

AB  - Interest in quotidian (daily) hemodialysis (DHD) seems to be growing. DHD improves quality of life, blood pressure control, and nutrition, and decreases the need of medications, including erythropoiesis stimulating factors (ESF). We evaluate the short daily dialysis (SDHD) efficacy in 14 patients in conventional hemodialysis (HD) (3 weekly sessions/4?h), mean age 52.1 years, range 25?75, 10 males and 4 females, and found that they needed to increase dialysis efficiency by different medical indications: in 11 cases traditional indications ? 5 cases with hypertensive myocardiopathy and severe LVH (2 of them with low left ventricle ejection fraction), 2 cases with symptomatic, ischemic cardiopathy 2 patient with big body-surface area and elevated phosphorus levels, and 2 patients by inadequate dialysis (infradialysis conditioning malnutrition status) secondary to HD with permanent catheter. In one female (25 yr old), SDHD was prescribed to improve cardiac toxicity secondary to chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The index resistance of ESF decreased since the first month, and the Aranesp doses decreased by more than 40%. 1 male (49 years) with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy showed skin lesions with osteoblastic transformation. The skin lesions were improving since the first week, obtaining a decrease of the index resistance ESF higher than 60% in the first month. 1 male with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy showed improvement of symptoms and quality of life since the first weeks, as well as echocardiograpic signs and improvement in Hb levels and decreasing dose of ESF. The schedule in all of them was 5?6 days/week sessions between 2.15?h and 3?h, depending on body-surface area. To obtain a weekly Kt/V nearest to 4, HD sessions were realized in the hospital (7?pts) or in satellite unit (7?pts). The time remaining in this schedule was between 1 and 42 months. All the patients showed clinical improvement, subjective and objective, since the first week of start of SDHD. 3 patients could be included in Tx waiting list again. Anemia improved, decreasing index resistance of ESF. In relation with this, the time necessary to improve the response to ESF was different, showing a decrease in the first month higher than 40% in two cases dialyzing with a membrane high-flux with pore size 100?A, appearing high Hb levels also in a polycystic patient always without ESF. We observed by analyzing the results in 12 stable patients; the patients with high-flux dialyzers showed better response to ESF. Perhaps it could offer a better clearance of large molecules (inhibitor erythropoiesis factor and high molecular weight toxins) that participate to respond to ESF. Conclusion:? Our experience shows new indications for SDHD with very good results. Anemia was improved in relation with SDHD, when synthetic high-flux membranes and high pore size were used.

AB  - The Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) has dialyzed >320 patients with ESRD since 1993. Objective:? To identify differences, and their causes, in the practice of dialysis between Nigerian state-owned dialysis units and U.S.A. Methods:? We analyzed the characteristics of chronic dialysis at JUTH. Results:? At JUTH, chronic dialysis is started at development of frank uremia (K/DOQI standard: creatinine clearance >10?mL/min, no overt uremia). Frequency of hemodialysis was 3 times weekly in 2 patients, twice weekly in 1 and once weekly or longer in 7 patients. Breakdowns in the dialysis machinery, which is outdated, forced additional decreases in the frequency of dialysis. Duration of a dialysis session was 4?h by prescription, but much longer in several sessions because of dialysis machine breakdown during the session (US standard: 4?h). 2 patients were dialyzed through arterio-venous fistulas and 8 patients were dialyzed though temporary femoral vein dialysis catheters removed after each dialysis session. A vascular surgeon was unavailable. The urea reduction ratio was 45.38.6% (U.S.A target: 65%). The cost of the first dialysis session at JUTH is $160. With reuse of dialysis supplies, including dialyzers, dialysis tubing, femoral catheters, and guide wires, the cost of each subsequent dialysis session is $33. The minimal cost of dialysis with 3 dialysis sessions weekly and a new dialyzer every week is $501 per month. The cost of dialysis is borne exclusively by the patient. For comparison, average monthly income is $74 for unskilled laborers, $222 for dialysis technicians, $296 for dialysis nurses, and $889 for academic nephrologists. The low dose of dialysis has adverse effects on patient quality of life (frequent admissions with uremia). Despite notable exceptions (2 patients on dialysis for 12 and 9 years, respectively), survival of dialysis patients at JUTH appears to be poor. Conclusions:? Underdialysis is frequent in Nigeria and is the consequence of socioeconomic conditions and technologic deficits. Removal of the economic burden of dialysis from the patients with ESRD is the first logical step toward correction of underdialysis.

AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Introduction:? The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) has established target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11?12?g/dL for all dialysis patients. For patients who leave an inpatient hospitalization with an Hb under this target, it is hypothesized that several factors contribute to the length of time required to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL after hospitalization. Objective:? To identify factors contributing to a decreased likelihood of reaching this target Hb. Methods:? Using the first hospitalization of patients who initiated HD in 1999 and who were regularly treated with EPO, we identified those with a mean Hb of less than 11?g/dL on EPO claims during the same month as their index hospitalization. Patients were then followed up to see how long it took them to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL, censored at death, re-hospitalization, a switch of modality, or suspension of EPO treatment. Results:? A total of 6050 HD patients were identified. 3 months after hospitalization, 70% had achieved 11?g/dL, and 12% had been censored. For the remaining patients who eventually reached 11?g/dL, the average number of additional months required was 2.69 (SE of 0.09). From proportional hazards regression on the time (in months) to achieving an Hb of 11?g/dL, factors that significantly decreased the likelihood of reaching a target Hb included: a diagnosis on the index hospitalization of CHF or hepatic disease, a low Hb prior to the hospitalization, a high dose of EPO prior to the hospitalization, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusions:? Patients with anemia after hospitalization are at high risk of both persistent anemia and rehospitalization. It is important to address patient comorbidities, to ensure adequate medication usage, and to monitor patient progress to prevent hospitalizations and potential impact on Hb levels.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - Background:? Daily hemodialysis (DHD) markedly ameliorates cardiovascular instability (CVI) and discomfort (DIS) during dialysis, but patients continue to have some of these problems during DHD. We studied what contributed to these problems during 4445 DHD in 23 patients. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR), maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP), and a subjective score of patients' overall evaluation of the quality of dialysis (OEQ), adding a score of 14 symptoms (0 best, 40 worst). Independent variables were ultrapure dialysate and biocompatible dialysis (UP) (1626 dialyses) vs. conventional dialysis (CONV) (2819 dialyses), ultrafiltration (Uf) as percentage of body weight (BW), pre?post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1 kg?BW?1), and target??post-dialysis BW (Ta-Po BW). Relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased by 1.6?±?13/min; MAX BP fall was 25?±?20?mmHg; OV BP fall was 13?±?22?mmHg; OEQ?=?0.6 ±?1.2. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=??BUN???0.12?+?Ta-Po BW?????1.8?+?K/V???1.1???5 r?=?0.13, p?<?0.0001 MAX BP?=?CONV???8?+?T???0.2???Ta-Po BW ?????6?+?Uf???2.7??13 r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001 OV BP?=?CONV???11?+?Uf???4???Ta-Po BW ????4?+??BUN???0.3???9 r?=?0.35, p?<?0.0001 OEQ?=?K/V???0.3???Ta-Po BW???0.1???0.2 r?=?0.20, p?<?0.0001 Conclusion:? To minimize drop in BP and hypotensive crashes, use of ultrapure dialysate and a biocompatible membrane (UP) was by far the most important factor, followed by slowing dialysis. To avoid post-dialysis tachycardia and discomfort during dialysis, slow dialysis was most important. Overall, ?fast? dialysis and use of ?impure? regular dialysate appear to be the major dialysis factors causing CV instability and discomfort during daily hemodialysis.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.
