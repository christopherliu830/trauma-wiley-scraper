AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.

AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Quality control of dialysis treatment has received wide attention since inadequate dialysis dose was an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Each 0.1 decrease in Kt/V less than 1.2 is estimated to increase the relative risk of death by 5?7%. A higher Kt/V can be achieved by increasing treatment time, using a larger dialyzer or increasing blood or dialysate flow rates. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to know, using online conductivity monitor (OCM) routinely, whether a certain subgroup of patients is being treated inadequately. 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFI and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Inadequate dialysis dose was considered at OCM Kt/V less than 1.2. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Watson volume (Wv) to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The OCM Kt/V weekly was inversely related to Wv (r?=??0.833, p?<?0.001). 20.8% of our patients are at risk of inadequate dialysis dose, and it reflects our current practice of dialysis prescription. All of them are anuric young men with a Wv?>?40?L. Specific efforts are required to deliver an adequate dialysis dose in this kind of patients. This can be achieved by altering dialysis frequency, increasing membrane surface, and/or increasing dialysis flow. OCM Kt/V device permits a daily dialysis dose delivery and, consequently, an individualized prescription. Prospective studies are required to establish whether adequate dialysis dose in patients with Wv?>?40?L may further improve their survival.

AB  - Frequent or occasional symptomatic intradialytic hypotension during hemodialysis may influence patients' well being, but its effects on survival, independent of comorbidities, have not previously been investigated. Objective:? To assess the effect of frequent (f-IDH) or occasional (o-IDH) dialysis-associated hypotension on survival. Methods:? During the run in period in 1998, 77 patients with f-IDH (≥10 hypotensive events/10 months, responding only to medical intervention) and 101 patients with o-IDH (1 or 2 events/10 months) were identified among all 958 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients of a network. Eighty-five patients who had no hypotensive episodes (no-IDH) served as controls. Patients were followed for a median of 27 months (range 0.3?37), and survival of patients was compared by log-rank test. Independent association of f-IDH and o-IDH on survival, compared to no-IDH, was assessed by proportional hazards model that included patient's demographics, laboratory data, comorbidity as well as medications. Results:? Forty-five patients (58%) with f-IDH, 47 (47%) with o-IDH, and 33 (39%) with no-IDH died during the follow up that represents mortality rates of 37 (p?=?0.013 vs. no-IDH), 26 (p =?0.375 vs. no-IDH), and 21 deaths/100?patient years in the three groups, respectively. In multivariate proportional hazards regression, where age, sex, time on dialysis, CHD, diabetes, Kt/V, albumin level, use of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates have been adjusted for, neither f-IDH nor o-IDH was associated with survival. Conclusion:? Mortality in patients with f-IDH is significantly higher than in those without such events. Our data, however, did not provide evidence that f-IDH, independent of age and comorbidities, contributes to mortality in these patients.

AB  - Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a frequently used form of vascular access in children receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). Whereas standard dual-lumen catheters (DL) are used in many centers, the Tesio catheter has proven to be superior to the DL catheter in terms of catheter survival and infection rates in at least one pediatric study (Sheth RD et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001). Recently, the Ash Split catheter became available which, while similar to the Tesio internally, being comprised of 2 separate catheters, may be preferable because of the requirement for only one skin puncture for placement vs. two for the Tesio. However, no pediatric data pertaining to the Ash Split catheter have been published to date. Therefore, we reviewed and compared our experience with a small number of Ash Split (# 16) and Tesio (# 8) catheters used for semipermanent vascular access in our chronic HD population with reference to survival, infectious complications, patency, and dialysis adequacy. The results of this experience are as follows: Tesio Ash Split Survival >3 months 6/8 12/15 Sepsis (epi/catheter mo) 1/30 1/25 Exit-site infection (epi/catheter mo) 1/8.6 1/19 sp Kt/V urea 1.67 1.88 % sp Kt/V urea >1.2 100 90 Reasons for the removal of Tesio catheters were transplant (4), sepsis (1), deterioration of tubing (1), and accidental (1). Ash Split catheter removal resulted from sepsis (2), fistula placement (4), thrombosis (1), and accidental (2). This preliminary experience reveals similar outcome data for the Tesio and Ash Split catheters when used in pediatric HD patients. Definitive statements regarding the superiority of either catheter awaits additional data collection and analysis.

AB  - Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. started its nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) program in September 1997. Purpose of study:? To evaluate episodes of exit site infections, catheter sepsis, safety, and longevity of accesses for patients doing NHHD. Methods:? If IJ catheter was chosen, patient was started on Coumadin 2?mg/day when catheter was placed. If catheter malfunctioned, it was locked with a thrombolytic agent and Coumadin was adjusted to meet a goal INR of 1.5?2.25. If the problem persisted, the catheter was exchanged. For catheters, the B-D InterLink device was used to prevent air emboli and infection, and a locking device was used to prevent disconnects. If AV fistula was used, 4 buttonholes were established using 16 gauge needles. If AV graft was used, patients were taught the ladder cannulation technique using 16 gauge needles. Results:? As of September 1, 2003, 45 patients have completed training and have performed 27,063 treatments at home. Total catheter time at home was 930 months. Total AV fistula and AV graft time at home was 190 and 20 months, respectively. Upon completion of training, 34 patients were using tunneled IJ catheters, 10 using AV fistulas, and 1 using an AV graft. The IJ catheter exit site and sepsis infection rate was 0.35 and 0.49 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Average catheter life was 8.5 months with the longest 66.7 months and the shortest 0.2 months. The AV fistula and graft exit site and sepsis infection rates were 0.16 and 0 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Catheter complications included 1 episode of disconnect due to patient's failure to use locking device, 1 episode of central stenosis, and 1 episode of intracranial hemorrhage, due to prolonged INR, with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:? Data support that tunneled IJ catheters, AV fistulas, and AV grafts were effective and safe permanent accesses for patients on NHHD.

AB  - Poorly functioning dialysis access, whether graft or AV fistula, is a contributor to decreased efficiency of dialysis. Thrombosis results in the need for surgery and increases patient suffering. Objectives:? To determine whether an advanced glycation end product (AGE), pentosidine, might serve as a marker of disease activity and thrombosis of dialysis access. These results were obtained during the blinded phase of a study to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant vitamin E in preventing vascular access thrombotic events. Methods:? Twenty-six patients had blood drawn and access flow evaluated initially and at intervals for up to 1.5 years. In the study design, participants received either 800?IU vitamin E daily by mouth or identical placebo capsules. Blood plasma was examined to determine pentosidine content at baseline and every 3?m. Patients with an access flow of <800?mL/min were referred to a surgeon for evaluation. Access flow was evaluated by using the transonic flow meter and the saline release method. When sequential double dialyzers were used, saline injection method was applied post dialyzers, but before the venous drip chamber. Results:? Mean initial level of pentosidine before the administration of vitamin E was 20.22?pmol/mg (range 5.04?59.62?pmol/mg). During the study period, 5 patients had procedures related to thrombosis performed on their accesses. Blood drawn before the thrombotic event showed an increase above baseline of 6.87?±?15.47 (range ?5.9 to +33.7?pmol/mg). Patients without events showed a mean decrease of 9.7?± 12.24?pmol/mg pentosidine (p?<?0.02). Conclusion:? An increase in levels of pentosidine was associated with clotting of hemodialysis access. This change may reflect the effects of oxidative stress and/or thrombus formation. As these data are gathered from an ongoing double-blinded study, the effect of vitamin E on thrombus formation and pentosidine levels has not yet been ascertained.

AB  - It has been shown that daily hemodialysis as well as convective transfer by hemofilitration improve the quality of extra renal treatment. Two following phases of treatment of three weeks each were tested in 2 patients: daily hemodialysis 2.5?h 6 times/week (HD*6) and daily hemofiltration 2.75?h 6 times/week (HF*6) performed according to the following modalities. Phase I, blood flow rates (QB): 300?mL/min, hemofilter 1.4 m2AN 69 dialysate flow 500?mL/min. Phase II, QB: 150?mL/min, hemofilter 1m2AN 69, exchange volume of 10?L/session; 5?L predilution and 5?L postdilution (conditions were limited by the device). We measured, during the third week of treatment of each phase, the weekly mass transfers and the predialysis plasma levels of urea (U), creatinine (C), phosphate (P), and B2 microglobulin (B2M). In the 2 phases, HD*6 and HF*6, respectively, the weekly urea Kt was: 120 vs. 60?L; std Kt/V: 3.30 vs. 2.0; npcr: 1.26 vs. 1.42?g?kg?1?day?1. Mass transfer/week Predialytic levels/L HD*6 HF*6 HD*6 HF*6 U (mmol) ?2366 ?2204 ?23.2 ?38.5 C (µmol) 67240 51096 769.5 934.8 P (mmol) ??127 ??111.5 ??1.91 ??2.34 B2M (mg) ??311 ??763.5 ?34.2 ?30.16 In HF*6, predialysis solute concentration increased and weekly small molecule mass transfer was insufficient. B2M mass transfer was significantly increased and predialytic plasma concentration decreased, showing a higher clearance of middle molecules with convective transfer. The clinical tolerance was excellent during the two phases of treatment. This study allows to determine the optimal conditions for adequate daily HF: higher QB and exchange volume. Further studies with QB of at least 300?mL/min and with exchange volume of 15?L/session seem to be necessary.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.
