AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. The incremental elastic modulus (Einc) measurement is a good marker of arterial wall stiffness. Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. Metabolic, inflammatory, and hemodynamic alterations cause structural changes and vascular complications in end-stage renal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors that may affect the development of arteriosclerosis by measurement of Einc in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Thirty-two patients (16 men and 16 women) on chronic HD with a mean age of 42.2?±?19.3 (range, 15?80) were included in the study. The carotid Einc was measured to determine arteriosclerosis by high-resolution echo-tracking system. Einc measurement was calculated from transcutaneous measurements of carotid arterial internal diameter and wall thickness and carotid pulse pressure. Common carotid compliance (CCC) and distensibility (CCD) were determined from changes in carotid artery diameter during systole and simultaneously measured carotid pulse pressure. Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), predialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), predialysis diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), age, HD duration, CCC, and CCD were correlated with Einc in all patients. A significant positive correlation was found between Einc and age (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), SBP (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.02), PP (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), Ca (r?=?0.43, p?<?0.01), CRP (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.02). As expected, Einc was correlated inversely with CCD (r?=??0.77, p?<?0.0001). The correlation between Einc and HD duration, DBP, ferritin, P, PTH, and CCC was not significant. In conclusion, the stiffening of carotid artery in HD patients is related not only to hemodynamic changes (increased SBP and PP) but also to metabolic (increased Ca) and inflammatory (increased CRP) responses. Carotid Einc is an accepted independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Because of the positive correlation between Einc and serum Ca, vitamin D and Ca-containing P binder should be used carefully in HD patients.

AB  - Background:? Renal failure in elderly patients often generates an ethical question ?should dialysis be initiated?? The nephrologists are faced with the dilemma of conveying the prognosis of renal failure in elderly patients and also explain the pros and cons of offering a renal replacement therapy (RRT). Methods:? We report a retrospective study conducted between 6/2001 and 6/2003 to evaluate the clinical situations where initiating RRT was considered inappropriate. All patients who opted for not initiating/withdrawal of RRT were included in the study. Results:? Twenty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were males with average age 70.7 years. 17/24 were in the intensive care unit. Complex medical illnesses with poor quality of life were the major reasons for opting out of RRT. 20/24 patients opted for not initiating RRT and 3/24 patients opted for withdrawal. 1/24 opted for a trial of RRT before taking long-term decisions. 3/20 who opted against initiating RRT had advanced directives. 18/20 who opted for not initiating RRT died within 3 days of the need for RRT, 2/20 are alive without RRT after 6 and 4 months with estimated GFR of 14 and 12?mL/min, respectively. Patient who opted for a trial of RRT died eventually, 4 months after a prolonged bedridden stay in a nursing home. 3/3 ESRD patients died within a week after withdrawing dialysis. Conclusion:? The decision to initiate RRT should be made considering the overall prognosis. A decision to not initiate or withdraw RRT is possible in critically ill patients and if taken judiciously can reduce physical and mental stress of both patient and their family members.

AB  - The presence of persistently high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is well known to be associated with a state of inflammation, malnutrition, and erythropoietin resistance in hemodialysis (HD) population. Meanwhile, a substantial group of patients present with intermittent elevations of CRP levels, and its clinical consequences are unclear. We designed this study to compare the inflammatory and nutritional parameters and erythropoietin requirements in HD patients with persistent or intermittent CRP elevation and those with CRP levels in without. We included 100 HD patients [age: 48.4?±?14.3 years; HD duration: 69.3?±?49.0 months (minimum 12 months)]. The 6-month retrospective clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the patient records, and those with chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, infectious complications, and surgery were excluded. The monthly determined CRP levels (at least 6 for each patient) were reviewed, and the patients were grouped according to their CRP levels as those with persistent (group 1), intermittent (at least one level of CRP?10?mg/L) (group 2), and those with CRP in normal ranges set by the laboratory (group 3). We compared the fibrinogen, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, albumin, prealbumin, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct results of the patient groups. The patient groups revealed significant differences in terms of fibrinogen (p?<?0.001), albumin (p?<?0.0001), prealbumin (p?<?0.007), ICAM-1 (p?<?00.2) levels and nPCR (p?<?0.03), IDWG (p?<?0.02), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct (p?<?0.03) values. Group 2 presented to be in risk of inflammation and malnutrition with a decrease in albumin levels and nPCR and presence of rHUEpo resistance when compared to patients in group 3. We conclude that, similar to HD patients with persistently high CRP levels, those with intermittent elevation of CRP must also be considered to be in a state of chronic inflammatory response associated with malnutrition and erythropoietin resistance. This signifies the importance of regulatory monitoring of CRP in HD population.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - Several types of dialyzers with enhanced internal filtration have been introduced in order to increase solute clearance, especially in relatively larger molecular solutes. In these dialyzers, enhanced internal filtration increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. The internal filtration flow rate (QIF) has not, however, been measured in clinical situations, because none of monitoring techniques can measure this value. Herein, the QIF value was estimated during an experimental and an analytical study. Namely, we measured blood flow velocity in a cross-sectional plane of the dialyzer by pulse Doppler ultrasonography. An in vitro study with bovine blood was carried out to determine the local blood flow velocity profile with a newly designed probe slider that enables parallel movement of the probe along the dialyzer. Furthermore, an analytical model was newly introduced to calculate changes in flow rate and pressure of blood and dialysate streams and solute concentrations along the dialyzer. The QIF value could be estimated by a simulation analysis to the experimental data using the analytical model.

AB  - Some authors suggest that inflammation can be one of the reasons of erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. The purpose of the study was to follow-up some laboratory markers of inflammation in 21 dialysis patients, all treated with adequate anaemia doses EPO, divided in 2 groups: first one adequately responding to EPO treatment (with Hb higher than 9?g/L) and second one resistant to it (with Hb lower than 9?g/L). Some acute phase proteins and markers of inflammation were measured as follow: C-reactive protein (CRP), α1-AGT, α1-antitrypsine, and haptoglobine (HP), as some anti-acute phase proteins, transferrin (TF). WBC count, some enzymes: ASAT, ALAT, and substrates: urea, creatinine, albumins (Albs), lipid profile, glucose, phosphate, iron, electrolytes, and parathyroid hormone were tested as well. The study found significant higher CRP, HP, Tg, P, and Alb in the second group than in the first. TF was lower in all patients, which may be connected to the chronic inflammatory status (uremia), and there was no iron deficit or severe parathyroid hyperfunction to be convinced for EPO resistance. The study suggests that EPO resistance may be related to some inflammatory factors and treatment of the inflammation possibly will overcome the problem.

AB  - During the last decade, the number of patients starting renal replacement therapy has increased for all ages, but the increase for patients over 65 years old has been particularly dramatic. Objective:? The aim of our study was the analysis of the outcome of all the patients who were over 65 years of age at the time they started chronic hemodialysis, in our Center (n, 52). Methods:? A total of 76 patients were treated by the chronic hemodialysis program of 251 Hellenic Air Force and VA General Hospital, between 1992 and 2002, while totally 309 patients were offered dialysis at this time. We found that 52 of them (68.4%) were over 65 years old [40 male (76.9%), 12 female (23.1%)]. Results:? Elderly patients manifest more often intradialytic complications, such as hypotensive episodes (28.8%) and arrhythmias (23.1%), due to their hemodynamic instability. Polypharmacy is a big deal for dialysis patients, especially elderly ones. Each patient was taking 9.1 PO and 1.9 IV medications on average, per day. Most of them (84.6%) required recombinant human erythropoietin. The most common co-morbid factors we observed in this population were cardiovascular diseases (36.5%), neurological problems, respiratory failure, bone disease, malignancy (17.3%), depression, malnutrition, and infections (30.8%). Deaths were often associated with more than one morbid factors. Survival and the quality of life in the elderly patients on hemodialysis are frequently acceptable. The 1, 3 and 5-year patient survival rates during 1990?2000 were 63.4%, 56.1%, and 26.8%. Conclusion:? We believe that if there are no extracontraindications, elderly patients can benefit from hemodialysis, taking into consideration that we should adapt the therapy to the geriatric special needs.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of daily dialysis since long-term experiences have shown good results. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is an HDF technique that combines diffusion with high convection in which the ultrapure dialysis fluid itself is used as a reinfusion solution. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the more effective dialysis schedule (daily dialysis) with the dialysis modality that offers the highest uremic toxin removal (OL-HDF). Five children with left ventricular hypertrophy, mean age 12.3?±?6.2 years, on standard 3??4?h 3 times a week OL-HDF at least during the last 6 months, were switched to D-OL-HDF, 3??4?h 6 times per week with a minimal follow up of 6 months. Dialysis parameters were similar during both periods and only frequency of each session was changed. Tolerance, anemia control, phosphatemia, and phosphate binders, need of blood pressure medications, and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated. Only 3 of the 5 enrolled children could be followed 12 months, 1 was transplanted after 3 months, the other after 5 months D-OL-HDF. For all the children the disappearance of postdialysis fatigue was rapidly reported. There was a significant decrease in predialysis levels of phosphatemia (from 1.67±0.23 to 1.28±0.29?mmol/L) despite phosphate binders reduction of more than 50%. Hemoglobin significantly increased (from 11.8±0.9 to 13.4±1.3?g percentage ml) allowing EPO doses reduction. Left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared after 6 months D-OL-HDF, fractional shortening increased, allowing registration on transplantation list for 1 child. Our results clearly demonstrate that daily online HDF is able to offer to children on chronic dialysis a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk factors. Is it ethical to reserve this dialysis modality only to selected children?

AB  - Vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Genetic mutations, inflammation, and changes in the vascular wall are some factors that are thought to increase thrombosis risk. In this study, we tested for possible relationships between vascular thrombosis and some known thrombophilic mutation/polymorphisms in coagulation factors [factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin (Pt) G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), factor XIII (F-XIII) Val34Leu, alpha-fibrinogen (AF) Thr312Ala, factor VII (F-VII) R353Q] and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene in our HD patients. Patients who had experienced at least 3 episodes of AVF thrombosis composed of the study group, and patients who had never encountered this complication composed of the control group. None of the patients in either group had a history of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis, or vasculitis. In order to find the frequency of F-XIII Val34Leu, AF Thr312Ala, and F-VII R353Q polymorphisms in our population, we also searched persons without renal disease or history of thrombosis (normal group). Results are summarized in Table. There was a tendency toward thrombotic mutation/polymorphisms in the study group for FVL, Pt G20210A, ACE I/D, and AF Thr312Ala. We suggest that patients who develop recurrent AVF thrombosis should be screened for the above-mentioned factors and investigated for other possible risk factors. This screening would allow more effective focus on prophylaxis.

AB  - Purpose:? To analyze survival and causes of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diabetic patients treated by hemodialysis. Methods:? Data of 1203 ESRD hemodialyzed patients between 1975 and 2002 were analyzed, 116 patients were excluded and 1087 patients included in the study. We studied the prevalence of the diabetic nephropathy, the rate of survival and causes of death by comparing diabetic patients with a control group of patients without diabetes. Results:? Among the 1087 patients requiring dialysis, 272 (25%) were diabetic and 815 non-diabetic whose causal nephropathy was nephroangiosclerosis 32%, glomerulonephritis 15%, chronic interstitial nephropathy 14%, and others 14%. The diabetics were older at the beginning of dialysis than non-diabetic patients: 60.33?±?11.39 years vs. 52.23?±?17.20 years, p?<?0.001. Average time on dialysis is more important in non-diabetic than diabetic group [5.90?±?5.73 years vs. 2.71.?±?2.48 years, p?<?0.001]. The rate of death was higher in diabetics than in control group [71.7% vs. 55.8%, respectively, p?<?0.003]. The difference in survival between the two groups remains significant for the same age. Death caused by cardiovascular disorders is higher in diabetics (68.8%) than non-diabetics (31.2%) (p?<?0.05). Among death causes, stroke is the most frequent cause in diabetics (18.4% vs. 11.6%) in non-diabetics, p?<?0.05. Death by heart failure and infections is higher in diabetics but the difference is not statistically significant (12.3% in diabetics vs. 9.4% in non-diabetics for heart failure and 13.8% vs. 11.4% for infections). Death due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetics (4.39% vs. 1.02% in diabetics, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? In our cohort, mortality in diabetic patients is higher than in non-diabetic patients. Cardio-vascular disorders are the most cause of death in diabetics and above all stroke, whereas mortality due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetic patients. Diabetes is an important risk factor of mortality in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - One of the main symptoms of terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. One of the best applicable methods correcting anemia is using recombinant human erythropoietin preparation. Using recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of events had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patient had refraction to erythropoietin, which has spurred the search for new efficient methods correcting anemia. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of the laser on erythropoiesis and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency. In the course of the study, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocytes in blood, and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) were determined. At the beginning of the treatment, all hematological parameters 5 and 15 days after marrow stimulation were defined. 15 days after marrow stimulation with laser, increasing amounts of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were observed. The initial erythrocyte count was 2.22?±?0.1???1012/L, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/L and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During the laser treatment, erythrocyte count increased up to 2.9?±?0.8???1012/L, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/L and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3% (p?<?0005).

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.

AB  - Objective:? To have 1 nurse successfully train 2 patients at a time for nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) within a 7?10 week time period. Methods:? Over the past 6 years, Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. has evolved its NHHD program from 1 nurse training 1 patient during an average 6 week period to training 2 patients in a 7?10 week period. Patients came either from our in-center population or directly from internal medicine. Our pre-evaluation procedures and manual were revised. Patients were pre-evaluated for literacy, manual dexterity, strength, hearing and visual deficits, substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and compliance before being accepted into the program. A home visit was made to evaluate their environment, family interactions, and water source. Our training manual was rewritten to fifth grade level. Every patient was given index cards printed in 20 size font with step-by-step procedures for machine setup, put-on and takeoff, re-circulation, and power failure. Patients were dialyzed 4 days/week to improve cognitive function and ?dialyzed the bucket? 1 day, thus training 5 days/week. One nurse trained 2 patients, staggering their start dates 2 weeks apart to allow for both individual and group teaching. Fistula or IJ catheter was used for access. Patients were trained alone or with a partner. In the last week of training, patients were dialyzed for 7?h and were expected to complete all procedures independently. Results:? From March 2003 to August 2003, 6 patients were trained for NHHD. 2 patients finished training in 7 weeks, 2 in 9 weeks, and 2 in 10 weeks. Conclusion:? One nurse can successfully train 2 patients at a time for NHHD in a 7?10 week time period at a decreased cost to dialysis provider.
