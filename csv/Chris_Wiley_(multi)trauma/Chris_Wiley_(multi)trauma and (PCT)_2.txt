AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Background The ?New Forest Parenting Package? (NFPP), an 8-week home-based intervention for parents of preschoolers with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), fosters constructive parenting to target ADHD-related dysfunctions in attention and impulse control. Although NFPP has improved parent and laboratory measures of ADHD in community samples of children with ADHD-like problems, its efficacy in a clinical sample, and relative to an active treatment comparator, is unknown. The aims are to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and generalization effects of NFPP compared to an established clinic-based parenting intervention for treating noncompliant behavior [?Helping the Noncompliant Child? (HNC)] in young children with ADHD. Methods A randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms was the design for this study. A total of 164 3?4-year-olds, 73.8% male, meeting DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria were randomized to NFPP (N = 67), HNC (N = 63), or wait-list control (WL, N = 34). All participants were assessed at post-treatment. NFPP and HNC participants were assessed at follow-up in the next school year. Primary outcomes were ADHD ratings by teachers blind to and uninvolved in treatment, and by parents. Secondary ADHD outcomes included clinician assessments, and laboratory measures of on-task behavior and delay of gratification. Other outcomes included parent and teacher ratings of oppositional behavior, and parenting measures. (Trial name: Home-Based Parent Training in ADHD Preschoolers; Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01320098; URL: http://www/clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01320098). Results In both treatment groups, children's ADHD and ODD behaviors, as well as aspects of parenting, were rated improved by parents at the end of treatment compared to controls. Most of these gains in the children's behavior and in some parenting practices were sustained at follow-up. However, these parent-reported improvements were not corroborated by teacher ratings or objective observations. NFPP was not significantly better, and on a few outcomes significantly less effective, than HNC. Conclusions The results do not support the claim that NFPP addresses putative dysfunctions underlying ADHD, bringing about generalized change in ADHD, and its underpinning self-regulatory processes. The findings support documented difficulties in achieving generalization across nontargeted settings, and the importance of using blinded measures to provide meaningful assessments of treatment effects.

AB  - Abstract The number of pancreas transplants performed in the United States increased by 7.0% in 2016 over the previous year, the first such increase in more than a decade, largely attributable to an increase in simultaneous kidney pancreas transplants. Transplant rates increased in 2016, and mortality on the waiting list decreased. The declining enthusiasm for pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplants persisted. The uniform definition of graft failure was approved by the OPTN Board of Directors in 2015 and will be implemented in early 2018. Meanwhile, SRTR continues to refrain from reporting pancreas graft failure data. The OPTN/UNOS Pancreas Transplantation Committee is seeking to broaden allocation of pancreata across compatible ABO blood types in a proposal out for public comment July 31 to October 2, 2017. A new initiative to provide guidance on the benefits of PAK transplants is also out for public comment.

AB  - Abstract The overall number of pancreas transplants continued to increase to 1027 in 2018, after a nadir of 947 in 2015. New additions to waiting list remained stable, with 1485 candidates added in 2018. Proportions of patients with type II diabetes waiting for transplant (14.6%) and undergoing transplant (14.8%) have steadily increased since 2016. Waiting times for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant have decreased; median months to transplant was 13.5 for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant and 19.7 for pancreas transplant alone in 2018. Outcomes, including patient and kidney survival, as well as rejection rates, have improved consistently over the past several years. Pancreas graft survival data are being collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and will be included in a future report once there are sufficient cohorts for analysis.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Several notable developments in adult liver transplantation in the US occurred in 2015. The year saw the largest number of liver transplants to date, leading to reductions in median waiting time, in waitlist mortality for all model for end-stage liver disease categories, and in the number of candidates on the waiting list at the end of the year. Numbers of additions to the waiting list and of liver transplants performed in patients with hepatitis C virus infection decreased for the first time in recent years. However, other diagnoses, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, became more prevalent. Despite large numbers of severely ill patients undergoing liver transplant, graft survival rates continued to improve. The number of new active candidates added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list in 2015 was 689, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent pediatric candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) continued to decline, to 373 active and 195 inactive candidates. The number of pediatric liver transplants peaked at 613 in 2008 and was 580 in 2015. The number of living donor pediatric liver transplants increased to its highest level, 79, in 2015; most were from donors closely related to the recipients. Pediatric graft survival rates continued to improve.

AB  - This paper explores user-driven organizational change in the National Health Service (NHS). The NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000) created Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALS) to provide information, solve problems and drive user-led change. Evidence is drawn from a study of PALS in London acute, primary care, mental health and specialist trusts, drawing on discussion forums, interviews with PALS officers and documentation. From context and role profiles, two conclusions are evident. First, organizational instability, boundary disputes, variable management support, resource limitations, financial insecurity and multi-site working characterize the context in which PALS operate, and the officer role is characterized by problem diversity, overlap with complaints systems, monitoring problems, relationship building and ?serial users?. Second, these context and role attributes restrict PALS to ?repair and maintenance?, ensuring that established systems work correctly. While PALS sit on the bottom rung of a ?participation ladder?, their contribution is more than tokenistic. However, a processual perspective demonstrates how a fluid, networked, and diversified context isolates PALS structures from management decision-making, constraining their power base, and inhibiting the promotion of substantive change agendas.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2016 are no-table for (1) the largest total number of transplants performed (7841); (2) the shortest median waiting time in recent history (11.3 months); (3) continued reduction in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) increasing numbers of patients whose clinical profiles are consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) equilibration of transplant rates in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increase in the number of available organs, waitlist mortality remained an important concern. Graft survival rates continued to improve. In 2016, 723 new active candidates were added to the pediatric liver transplant waiting list, down from a peak of 826 in 2005. The number of prevalent candidates (on the list on December 31 of the given year) was stable, 408 active and 169 inactive. The number of pediatric living donor liver transplants decreased from a peak of 79 in 2015 to 62 in 2016, with most from donors closely related to the recipients. Graft survival continued to improve over the past decade among recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The number of pancreas transplants performed in the United States stabilized over the last 3 years after nearly a decade of steady decline. Numbers of new additions to the list also stabilized during the same period. Notably, the persistent decline in pancreas after kidney transplants also seems to have abated, at least for now. The first full year of data after implementation of the new pancreas allocation system revealed no change in the distribution of organs between simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant and pancreas transplant alone. The percentage of kidneys used in SPK transplants was also unchanged. While a uniform definition of pancreas graft failure was approved in June 2015, it is awaiting implementation. Meanwhile, SRTR will refrain from publishing pancreas graft failure data in the program-specific reports. Therefore, it is difficult to track trends in outcomes after pancreas transplant over the past 2 years. New initiatives by the OPTN/UNOS Pancreas Transplantation Committee include facilitated pancreas allocation and broadened allocation of pancreata across compatible ABO blood types to increase organ utilization.

AB  - Abstract Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2017 are notable for (1) continued growth in numbers of new waitlist registrants (11,514) and of transplants performed (8,082); (2) continued increase in the transplant rate (51.5 per 100 waitlist-years); (3) a precipitous decrease in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) reciprocal increases in waitlist registrants and recipients with alcoholic liver disease and with clinical profiles consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) continued improvement in graft survival despite changing recipient characteristics such as older age and higher rates of obesity. Variability in transplant rates remained by candidate race, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, urgency status (status 1A versus model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >35), and geography. More than half of all children listed for liver transplant in 2017 were aged younger than 5 years in 2017, and the highest rate of pretransplant mortality persisted for children aged younger than 1 year. Children underwent transplant at higher acuity than the past, as evidenced by higher MELD/pediatric end-stage liver disease scores and listings at status 1A and 1B. Higher acuity at transplant is likely due to lack of access to suitable donor organs, which has been compensated for by persistent trends toward use of partial or split liver grafts and ABO-incompatible grafts. Despite higher illness severity scores at transplant, pediatric graft and patient survival posttransplant have improved over time.
