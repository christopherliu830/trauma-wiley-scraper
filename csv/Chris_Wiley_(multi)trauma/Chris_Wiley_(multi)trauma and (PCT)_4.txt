AB  - Leeches are a unique group of annelids arising from an ancestor that would be characterized as a freshwater oligochaete worm. Comparative biology of the oligochaetes and the leeches reveals that body plan changes in the oligochaete-to-leech transition probably occurred by addition or modification of the terminal steps in embryonic development and that they were likely driven by a change in the feeding behavior in the ancestor of leeches. In this review article, developmental changes that are associated with the evolution of several leech-specific traits are discussed. These include (1) the evolution of suckers, (2) the loss of chaetae, (3) the loss of septa, and (4) a fixed number of segments. An altered developmental fate of the teloblast is further proposed to be a key factor contributing to the fixation of the segment number, and the evolutionary change in teloblast development may also account for the loss of the ability to regenerate the lost body segments in the leech.

AB  - ABSTRACT Fixation of osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures has remained challenging, but may be improved by careful pre-operative planning. The aim of this study was to investigate how well the failure of locking plate fixation of osteoporotic proximal humerus fractures can be predicted by bone density measures assessed with currently available clinical imaging (realistic case) and a higher resolution and quality modality (theoretical best-case). Various density measures were correlated to experimentally assessed number of cycles to construct failure of plated unstable low-density proximal humerus fractures (N?=?18). The influence of density evaluation technique was investigated by comparing local (peri-implant) versus global evaluation regions; HR-pQCT-based versus clinical QCT-based image data; ipsilateral versus contralateral side; and bone mineral content (BMC) versus bone mineral density (BMD). All investigated density measures were significantly correlated with the experimental cycles to failure. The best performing clinically feasible parameter was the QCT-based BMC of the contralateral articular cap region, providing significantly better correlation (R2?=?0.53) compared to a previously proposed clinical density measure (R2?=?0.30). BMC had consistently, but not significantly stronger correlations with failure than BMD. The overall best results were obtained with the ipsilateral HR-pQCT-based local BMC (R2?=?0.74) that may be used for implant optimization. Strong correlations were found between the corresponding density measures of the two CT image sources, as well as between the two sides. Future studies should investigate if BMC of the contralateral articular cap region could provide improved prediction of clinical fixation failure compared to previously proposed measures. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract:? Among the most challenging patients cared for in critical care medicine are the recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is now widely used as a definitive therapy for the treatment of pediatric malignancies and inborn errors of metabolism. Critical care services are required for treatment of complications of HSCT. Formerly thought to have an essentially futile prognosis, outcomes from critical care of HSCT patients have demonstrated steady improvement in many areas during the past two decades. Improvements in the management of respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple organ system failure have resulted from improvement in oncology and critical care practices. Herein, we review the methods available for outcomes prediction, recent advances in critical care of HSCT patients, and possible directions for future investigation.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Objective To systematically review outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mind?body treatments for PTSD. Methods Inclusion criteria based on guidelines for assessing risk of bias were used to evaluate articles identified through electronic literature searches. Results Twenty-two RCTs met inclusion standards. In most of the nine mindfulness and six yoga studies, significant between-group effects were found indicating moderate to large effect size advantages for these treatments. In all seven relaxation RCT's, relaxation was used as a control condition and five studies reported significant between-group differences on relevant PTSD outcomes in favor of the target treatments. However, there were large within-group symptom improvements in the relaxation condition for the majority of studies. Conclusions Although many studies are limited by methodologic weaknesses, recent studies have increased rigor and, in aggregate, the results for mindfulness, yoga, and relaxation are promising. Recommendations for design of future mind?body trials are offered.

AB  - Summary Understanding anxiety in youth is of paramount importance as anxiety disorders are associated with negative outcomes in several domains of life. This chapter broadly covers the assessment and treatment of children, adolescents and youth with anxiety disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) criteria for diagnosing anxiety disorders are briefly reviewed and commonly used methods of assessing anxiety are discussed. In reviewing psychological treatments, particular attention is devoted to the principles underlying cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) given the empirical support for its efficacy. Clinical case descriptions are provided to illustrate assessment and treatment techniques and challenges. The chapter provides an overview of treatments that are tailored for specific anxiety disorders in youth. It highlights elements that are specific to the individual treatments. The research findings with regard to efficacy as well as considerations when working with comorbid disorders are also discussed.
