AB  - Objective:? Given striking advances in translational developmental neuroscience and its convergence with developmental psychopathology and developmental epidemiology, it is now clear that mental illnesses are best thought of as neurodevelopmental disorders. This simple fact has enormous implications for the nature and organization of psychotherapy for mentally ill children, adolescents and adults. Method:? This article reviews the ?trajectory? of psychosocial interventions in pediatric psychiatry, and makes some general predictions about where this field is heading over the next several decades. Results:? Driven largely by scientific advances in molecular, cellular and systems neuroscience, psychotherapy in the future will focus less on personal narratives and more on the developing brain. In place of disorders as intervention targets, modularized psychosocial treatment components derived from current cognitive-behavior therapies will target corresponding central nervous system (CNS) information processes and their functional behavioral consequences. Either preventive or rehabilitative, the goal of psychotherapy will be to promote development along typical developmental trajectories. In place of guilds, psychotherapy will be organized professionally much as physical therapy is organized today. As with other forms of increasingly personalized health care, internet-based delivery of psychotherapy will become commonplace. Conclusion:? Informed by the new field of translational developmental neuroscience, psychotherapy in the future will take aim at the developing brain in a service delivery model that closely resembles the place and role of psychosocial interventions in the rest of medicine. Getting there will be, as they say, interesting.

AB  - Background The present study aimed to determine which method of anaesthesia (spinal anaesthesia or general anaesthesia) is better in reducing post-operative analgesic requirements in patients undergoing major limb amputation for lower-limb ischaemia. Another aim was to find out if anaesthesiologists use neuraxial anaesthesia in high-risk patients despite abnormal coagulation profile or use of anticoagulation. Methods The study was a retrospective cohort study. All patients undergone above-the-knee amputation or below-the-knee amputation due to peripheral artery disease between 1996 and 2010 were reviewed to evaluate post-operative opioid consumption and complications. Results A total of 434 amputations in 323 patients were included in the study. The number of surgical complications, the need for surgical revision and the number of intensive care unit admissions were significantly higher in the general anaesthesia group. The need for post-operative opioid medication was significantly lower in patients with above-the-knee amputation and spinal anaesthesia. The use of post-operative epidural analgesia did not reduce analgesic requirements. In the present study, there were patients who received neuraxial anaesthesia despite abnormal coagulation profile or uninterrupted warfarin or clopidogrel. There were no reported cases of spinal or epidural haematoma. Conclusion Patients with spinal anaesthesia had a lower rate of surgical complications, re-operations and intensive care unit admissions. Patients with above-the-knee amputation and spinal anaesthesia had a lesser need for opioid medication in the post-operative period than patients with general anaesthesia. Anaesthesiologists performed neuraxial anaesthesia and/or analgesia in high-risk patients despite abnormal coagulation profile or ongoing anticoagulation, but no adverse outcomes were reported.

AB  - Summary Valid consent for the treatment of children and young people can come from people with parental responsibility, young patients themselves (if judged to be competent) or the courts. The evolving nature of young people's competence and the extent to which it is appropriate to intervene to protect them against their own harmful actions, or the actions of others, can lead to a sense of conflicting rights and duties. Knowing when and how to intervene requires careful consideration of the principles, rules and guidelines, and a weighing up of the relative benefits and harms of the various options available in each case. This chapter aims to pull together the law, principles and key ethical guidance around the treatment of young people in order to help doctors with this ethical decision-making process.
