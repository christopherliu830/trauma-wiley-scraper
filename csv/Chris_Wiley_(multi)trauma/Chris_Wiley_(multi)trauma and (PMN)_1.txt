AB  - Summary While the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying portosystemic encephalopathy may not be fully understood, management strategies are relatively well established. These include the identification and elimination of precipitating factors, in association with, or followed by, specific measures designed to reduce arterial ammonia levels. In many patients, liver transplantation may offer the only chance of effective management of this challenging clinical problem.

AB  - Abstract We examined the effects of glutathione (GSH) preconditioning through the portal vein on rat warm liver ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R injury) and investigated the mechanisms involved. In rats with warm liver I/R injury, administration of GSH by means of the portal vein before ischemia increased the 7-day survival rates of rats after liver I/R from 38% to 75%. This effect was correlated with significantly improved liver function, depressed MDA content in the liver and fewer histologic features of hepatocyte injury. Intrahepatic expression of P-selectin and infiltration of neutrophils were increased significantly after liver I/R. GSH pretreatment decreased intrahepatic MPO content and the expression of P-selectin. However, it did not significantly affect the mRNA levels for P-selectin after liver I/R. Thus, preconditioning with GSH protects the liver against I/R injury by a mechanism dependent on free radical species scavenging, down-regulation of adhesion molecule expression and inhibition of neutrophil accumulation. These findings document the potential clinical utility of GSH to improve the overall success of diverse procedures, such as liver surgery and liver transplantation.

AB  - Summary According to transplant registries, grafts from elderly donors have lower survival rates. During 1999?2005, we evaluated the outcomes of 89 patients who received a liver from a donor aged ≥?60?years and managed with the low liver-damage strategy (LLDS), based on the preoperative donor liver biopsy and the shortest possible ischemia time (group D?≥?60-LLDS). Group D ≥?60-LLDS was compared with 198 matched recipients, whose grafts were not managed with this strategy (89 donors?<?60?years, group D?<?60-no-LLDS and 89 donors aged ≥60?years, group D?≥?60-no-LLDS). In the donors proposed from the age group of ≥60?years, the number of donors rejected decreased during the study period and the LLDS was found to be responsible for this in a significant manner (47% vs. 60%, respectively P?<?0.01). Among the recipients transplanted, the clinical features (age, gender, viral infection, child and model for end-stage liver disease score) were comparable among groups, but group D ≥?60-LLDS had a lower mean ischemia time: 415?±?106?min vs. 465?±?111 (D?<?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05 and vs. 476?±?94 (D?≥?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05. After a median follow-up of 3?years, the 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of group D ≥?60-LLDS (84% and 76%) were comparable with group D <?60-no-LLDS (89% and 76%) and were significantly higher than group D ≥?60-no-LLDS (71% and 54%), P?<?0.005. In conclusion, the LLDS optimized the use of livers from elderly donors.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the genomic alterations that occur in malignant cells, the immune system is increasingly appreciated as a critical axis that regulates the rise of neoplasms and the development of primary tumours and metastases. The interaction between inflammatory cell infiltrates and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment is complex, with inflammation playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes that act as key signalling hubs of the innate immune system. They respond to cellular stress and trauma by promoting activation of caspase-1, a protease that induces a pro-inflammatory cell death mode termed pyroptosis along with the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18. Here, we will briefly introduce inflammasome biology with a focus on the dual roles of inflammasome-produced cytokines in cancer development. Despite emerging insight that inflammasomes may promote and suppress cancer development according to the tumour stage and the tumour microenvironment, much remains to be uncovered. Further exploration of inflammasome biology in tumorigenesis should enable the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the effect of acepromazine (ACP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by stimulated equine neutrophils. Study design? Ex vivo biochemical experiments. Animals? Isolated neutrophils from healthy untreated horses. Methods? Neutrophils were incubated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m and then stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) before measurement of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). In a second experiment neutrophils were incubated in the presence of α-keto-? methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and treated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m. Subsequent PMA stimulation lead to neutrophilic ROS production and decomposition of KMB to ethylene, which is measured by gas chromatography. Electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping (EPR) analysis was performed with PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of ACP (10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m) directly added to the cell suspension. In the second experiment, the same concentrations of ACP were pre-incubated with neutrophils, then centrifuged to eliminate the excess of ACP and re-suspended in phosphate buffer before stimulation with PMA. In all experiments, the results of ACP-treated and ACP-untreated stimulated neutrophils were compared. Results? Overall, results obtained with lucigenin-enhanced CL and KMB oxidation were in agreement with those seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acepromazine induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on neutrophilic ROS production. Electron paramagnetic resonance also showed, at high ACP concentration, the appearance of a cation radical derived from ACP. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance study performed with pre-incubated neutrophils showed an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of ACP. Conclusion? The results indicate that ACP can neutralize O??2 or its by-products during the stimulation of neutrophils. Clinical relevance? These findings may have a therapeutic relevance when phenothiazines are used in horses suffering from inflammatory diseases in which neutrophil activation and ROS production are implicated.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - Summary Coagulation and innate immunity are linked evolutionary processes that orchestrate the host defence against invading pathogens and injury. The complement system is integral to innate immunity and shares numerous interactions with components of the haemostatic pathway, helping to maintain physiological equilibrium. The term ?immunothrombosis? was introduced in 2013 to embrace this process, and has become an area of much recent interest. What is less apparent in the literature however is an appreciation of the clinical manifestations of the coagulation-complement interaction and the consequences of dysregulation of either system, as seen in many inflammatory and thrombotic disease states, such as sepsis, trauma, atherosclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and some thrombotic microangiopathies to name a few. The growing appreciation of this immunothrombotic phenomenon will foster the drive for novel therapies in these disease states, including anticoagulants as immunomodulators and targeted molecular therapies.

AB  - Abstract We evaluated the concept that the vascular entrance of both bacterial and nonbacterial participate material could lead to hepatic parenchyma) cell injury, either due to post-phagocytic Kupffer cell activity or the margination of activated leukocytes in the liver. Injection of denatured, collagen-coated particles as well as heat-killed bacteria were used as particulate challenges. Hepatic parenchymal cell injury in vivo during postoperative sepsis was evaluated by plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) enzyme levels over 3-72 h. AST and OCT levels elevated following either laparotomy plus cecal ligation (mild sepsis) or laparotomy plus cecal ligation with puncture (severe sepsis), with the peak level at 24 h. In addition, the direct intravenous injection of either nonbacterial foreign particles or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa into normal rats also produced a dose-dependent elevation of AST and OCT. The plasma level of either AST or OCT actually increased 350-400% after injection of the non-bacterial particles. A similar dose related elevation in enzymes followed the intravenous injection of heat-killed Pseudomonas. To differentiate the potential contribution of activated hepatic Kupffer celts versus activated marginated neutrophils to the in vivo hepatic injury, we determined the release of the hepatic specific enzyme OCT by cultured hepatic parenchymal cells when they were exposed to isolated Kupffer cells or isolated PMNs that were activated by exposure to dead bacteria. Bacteria alone when added to cultured hepatocytes did not induce significant OCT release. In contrast, activated PMNs but not Kupffer cells induced a significant (p < 0.05) release of OCT from parenchymal cells into the culture media. Thus, in vivo transient hepatic parenchymal cell injury with post-operative sepsis may be mediated by the margination of activated PMNs in the liver.

AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - Abstract: Early postoperative infections and septic complications are predominant causes of morbidity and mortality in patients following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration after OLTx was found to decrease the number of sepsis episodes and sepsis-related mortality. Since polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are one of the major determinants of antimicrobial defense, alteration of their functions may influence the development of sepsis in these patients. Therefore, we investigated in vitro whether or not priming with G-CSF affects the neutrophils? respiratory burst (RB) in immunosuppressed liver-transplanted patients. Venous blood was drawn from liver allograft recipients (n=12) between the 5th and 15th day postoperatively. Patients without clinical signs of infection or rejection were included in this study. Leukocytes were obtained as supernatant following sedimentation and incubated with 1000 IE ml?1 G-CSF. The RB was measured by the intracellular oxidation of non-fluorescent dihydrorhodamine to the fluorescent rhodamine by flow cytometry. The results were expressed as a percentage of increasing stimulation compared to the control responses, which are made up of the percentage of cells with RB reaction after stimulation with phorbol ester (PMA), bacteria (E. coli), or the combination of a cytokine (TNF-α) and a bacterial peptide (FMLP) in the absence of G-CSF. In vitro priming with G-CSF resulted in significantly increased activity of the RB after PMA (from 71.7% to 85.6%) and TNF-α/FMLP (from 58.4% to 72.7%) stimulation. These data demonstrate that G-CSF in vitro augments the RB of PMNs, thereby suggesting a possible therapeutic role for G-CSF as immunomodulating agent during bacterial and fungal infections following OLTx.

The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.
