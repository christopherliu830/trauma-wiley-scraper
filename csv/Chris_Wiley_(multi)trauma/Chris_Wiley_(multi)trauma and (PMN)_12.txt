AB  - Aim? Variant MNS (vMNS) phenotypes are characterised by the presence of multiple antigens that provoke complex antibody responses. The hypothesis tested was that red cell-agglutinating antibodies of a single specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on peptides representing vMNS antigens. The Vw and Hut/Mut antigens vary only at glycophorin residue 28, Vw methionine-28, Hut and Mut lysine-28. The Mur peptide TYPAHTANEV was aa 33 to 42 of GpMur. For each experiment a 5?ml pool of 4 and 10 sera that agglutinated Mi-positive cells of known MNS-peptide-ELISA activity, was subjected to affinity chromatography on a single peptide. Result? For a serum pool that was strong peptide-ELISA positive with the lysine-28 peptide but was methionine-28 peptide negative, the antibody eluate was lysine-28 pos by ELISA and agglutinated all MUT and HUT pos cells tested but not Vw cells or Mi(a) negative cells. For the MUT antigen the hypothesis that a rbc-agglutinating antibody of a defined specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on a linear peptide representing the antigen was confirmed. In a similar fashion a specific anti-Mur was prepared. However, for one serum pool the antibody eluted from the Mur-column reacted with Hut (MiII) as well as Mur-positive cells, suggesting that Mut.Mur was recognised as a single antigen. Conclusion? Purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies that define vMNS phenotypes may be useful in resolving difficult serological investigations. The complexity of responses to vMNS glycophorins is confirmed by the recovery of an antibody reacting with sequentially adjacent antigens as a single entity.

AB  - Aim? To find incidence of partial D variants in India and classify them by molecular techniques. Method? Partial D variants were identified by screening blood samples of subjects from Western India by using partial D kit (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service). Molecular characterization of partial D variants was performed using multiplex PCR(M-PCR). Result? The incidence of partial D was 0.15% in the population studied. Forty eight partial D variant samples identified by serological studies were classified by M-PCR. 29% of partial D variants identified were of DFR and 14.6% were of DVI category. 77% of partial D variants identified in Indian population were characterized by M-PCR. Fifteen families of partial D variants were studied and ten more individuals of same variant were identified. All partial D variants were of R1r (DCe/dce) phenotype. The family studies showed partial D hybrid (RHD-CE-D) was linked with Ce gene. Conclusion? DFR was most frequently found partial D in Indian population. Majority of partial D variants characterized in Indian population arise due to substitution of part of RHD exon with RHCE equivalent.

AB  - Adherence of red blood cells (RBCs) to vascular endothelium impairs blood flow, decreases oxygen delivery and leads to vaso-occulusion. RBCs are relatively non-adherent however little is known of how changes to RBCs for transfusion during storage may affect their adherence properties. The aim of this study was to monitor adherence of stored RBCs to vascular endothelium under conditions of continuous flow in vitro. Specifically the influence of RBC storage time and leucocyte burden of stored red cell preparations was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Nonleucocyte- reduced, buffy-coat-reduced and leucocyte-filtered RBC products were prepared according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected at multiple time points until product expiry and perfused across an EC monolayer using a parallel flow chamber mounted to an inverted microscope. Perfusion of RBCs was controlled for shear stress and temperature. RBC-EC interactions were recorded using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The number of RBCs adhering to the EC layer progressively increased with product storage time. RBCs from products stored for 28 and 42?days were significantly more adherent than fresher cells. RBCs from products containing leucocytes were also significantly more adherent to the EC layer on days 28 and 42 of storage than RBCs from leucocyte-reduced products. Our findings indicate that product storage time and leucocyte burden increase the adhesion of RBCs to an EC layer. These results may lead to greater understanding of the interaction of transfused RBCs with recipient endothelium and the biological consequences of this adherence.

AB  - Following the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the introduction of testing for erythropoietin in elite athletes, it became apparent that many athletes had reverted to blood doping using homologous and autologous transfusions. The Science and Industry Against Blood doping research consortium approached Dr Nelson at RPAH to determine if a test could be developed to detect recent blood transfusions. A grant was provided by the US Anti-Doping Agency to develop a flow cytometric assay which detects the expression of a panel of minor blood group antigens. Most blood bank reagents are IgM and are not satisfactory as they cause aggregation. A series of IgG polyclonal antibodies were sourced and the optimal titre of each antibody to detect minor negative and positive red cell populations in in vitro mixtures was determined. The test was validated by four Sydney flow cytometry laboratories who tested unknown samples in a proficiency exercise. In April 2004, IOC, WADA and ATHOC agreed to introduce the test into the Athens laboratory in time for the 2004 Olympics with assistance from RPAH. From May till August, RPAH sourced suitable antibodies, performed antibody titrations, provided a standard operating procedure, consulted daily with both the Athens lab and the Anti-doping lab in Lausanne and conducted a series of 3 Proficiency Testing exercises for both labs. No false positives were found in 254 antibody/sample test combinations. The Athens lab used a panel which included antibodies to C, c, E, Jka, Jkb, Fyb, Fyb, M, N and S. Reagents for anti s, K and e were also provided by RPAH. Two weeks before the Games, the lab personnel moved into the IOC Athens Testing lab. A total of 350 endurance athletes were tested. This included placegetters plus randomly selected competitors.

AB  - The regulation of blood, blood product, tissue and gene technology therapies are viewed as critical to protecting the health of Australians. In response to the growing community concerns regarding the ethics, quality and safety of tissue and biological therapy products, the Australian Health Ministers Council, in 2002, recommended the development and introduction of a regulatory framework for tissues and emerging biological therapies. The proposal for tissues and emerging biological therapies parallels the regulation of blood and blood components introduced by the TGA in 2000 following similar ministerial recommendations, policy development and consultation A comprehensive system for the regulation of cellular and tissue based therapies within a proposed trans Tasman framework will be characterised by the following principles: ??All therapeutic products definable as cellular and tissue therapies, including cell-based gene therapy products, will be overseen by the system ??The level of regulation will be classified according to the risks posed by the therapies to the individual and the community. ??The classification system will align regulation of therapies to: ??standards ??standards and GMP ??standards, GMP and pre-market evaluation according to the level of risk. ??All facilities responsible for the manufacture and supply of cellular and tissue based products will be required to register their organisation with the TGA.

AB  - Aim To identify the medical officers responsible for blood transfusion therapy across the ACT. Method? Medical records of patients having transfusions were audited in one tertiary referral hospital, one general hospital and one associated private hospital as part of a quality improvement project. The clinical status patients, reasons for transfusion and laboratory data were extracted and the appropriateness of transfusion was assessed independently by two of the authors. Differences were resolved by consensus. The prescriber was also identified where possible, defined as the most senior clinician recorded in the medical record involved in the decision to transfuse. Result? The prescriber could be determined in 78% of transfusion episodes. In the majority of cases the decision to transfuse was attributed to specialist staff, in all hospitals. Registrars at the tertiary hospital prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (12%) than specialists (18.1%, p?<?0.05). This was not found at the smaller public hospital. After hours resident and registrar staff prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (3%) than other prescribers across the Territory (18.7%, p?<?0.005). Conclusion? Medical practitioners with varying levels of experience make medical decisions in hospitals. Who is responsible for these decisions has not been well studied. Our findings demonstrate specialist involvement in the majority of transfusion decisions. The results favour a ?top down? approach to quality improvement in transfusion, rather than targeting junior medical officers. The findings also have significant implications in understanding the dynamics of clinical decision making in the hospital setting and for the targeting of other quality improvement strategies.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.

AB  - Aim? ARCBS collection sites are located in capital city centres, regional and metropolitan static sites and mobile units. The project aimed to establish a ?donor-centric? collection facility that met evolving donor needs. Methods  (a) the eastern based skew of the existing Pirie Street operation and (b) the demographic profiles of donor and non-donor cohorts, potential sites for further investigation were identified. This process was further enhanced by surveying donors (stakeholder buy in and input) who indicated a preference for a mid-CBD site. This selection was supported by retailing and traffic analysis that reinforced the Currie St. location ? a major street frontage with a transport hub to the western suburbs. ?Guiding Principles? for the design and operation of the centre were developed and stated that the site must; ? have a WOW factor ? make donation easy for donors ? have a modern and professional outlook ? have its own personality ? be creative and bold ? not compete with the existing city site ? cater for a different market segment to existing sites. The Guiding Principles and recommendations from donor focus groups, were used by the architects to develop concept drawings. These were reviewed by the Donor Advisory Committee, and specifications finalised. Furniture, fittings, refreshments and marketing strategies also focussed on the target donor groups and Guiding Principles. Conclusion? A donor focus in the planning, design and development of this centre has produced a facility that currently exceeds collection targets and has been nominated for building industry awards.

AB  - In 2002 the Victoria Government, through a Blood Matters Collaborative, supported the introduction of Transfusion Nurse roles in participating Victorian Hospitals. The TN role, based on haemovigilance roles internationally, was key to the introduction of change initiatives undertaken as part of the collaborative project. TNs required a broad knowledge of transfusion practice along with training in organisational change and implementation of change concepts. Training for the TNs was provided through a Graduate Certificate in Transfusion Practice developed specifically for the project. This program has now been developed for online delivery. This paper will outline the role development and role vision developed for TNs throughout the Blood Matters Collaborative and considers the issues that have arisen since completion of the project in terms of role sustainability. Important issues include the place of TNs within organisational structures, development of sustainable systems of role integration and the ongoing integrity and sustainability of programs developed for role preparation.

AB  - Aim? Anti-Mi(a) has been used as a generic term to describe a number of antibodies to variant MNS (vMNS) antigens. The aim of this study was to compare the specificty reported for an anti-Mia) monoclonal antibody with monospecific polyclonal antibodies recovered from human sera by affinity chromatography. The hypothesised pattern was equal reactions with QNTDK28HKRDT and QNTDM28HKRD peptides. Sepharose columns one with each form of the peptide (K28 or M28) were prepared. A 10?ml pool of sera that reacted with the M28-peptide AND strongly agglutinated Vw cells, was subjected to affinity chromatography on the M28-peptide column. Result? A concentrated eluate reacted only with the M28-peptide by ELISA and agglutinated all Vw, HUT, MiIII and Mi VI cells tested. This was an anti-Mi(a) but with different pattern of ELISA reactivity to that reported for the monoclonal antibody. In a sequential second affinity chromatography, the fraction that did NOT bind to the M28-peptide was applied to the K28-peptide column: The concentrate reacted with K-containing peptide and agglutinated all Vw, HUT, MiIII and Mi IV cells ? an anti-Mi(a) with a different (lysine-specific) pattern of reactivity. In one case an antibody that also reacted with cells with an Sta phenotype was isolated from the K28-peptide column. Conclusion? In human antisera to Mi(a) there are several patterns of reaction for antisera that agglutinate Vw and Mi(a) cells. None of these resembled the MAb (hypothesis refuted). Complex reactivities predicted by early serolgists in the field can now be studied using specific antisera.

AB  - Aim? A lady of 30?years was referred to our Institute for investigations who had an obstetric history of one living child, followed by one still birth and then a termination of pregnancy due to suspected fetal ascitis. Method? Blood grouping and Rh genotyping was done by us by standard serological procedures and patient?s serum was investigated for atypical antibodies by panel of cells. Fourteen family members were investigated for ABO grouping and Rh genotyping. Result? Patient?s blood group was identified as O Rh Positive showing a rare Rh genotype D-- with presence of only D antigen and absence of C, c, E and e antigens. Confirmation of this was done by absorption of patient?s red cells with anti-C, anti-c, anti-E and anti -e antisera and testing the eluate reactivity for presence of the respective antigens. Patient?s serum reacted with all panel red cells of the common Rh genotypes and the antibody is anti ? Hro which is the most potent antibody a D-- individual produces. Amongst the family members of the propositus, seven probable heterozygote D-- individuals were identified by testing with incomplete anti -D by saline technique. Conclusion? The patient had a rare Rh genotype D--/D-- and had produced anti ? Hro antibody due to fetomaternal leak during pregnancies and this must have been responsible for the fetal loss. No other family member exhibited this rare Rh genotype in homozygous form.

AB  - Aim? Correct patient and specimen identification and labelling are critical to ensuring that the correct results are issued for the right patient, and that medical decisions and treatments given on the basis of these test results are appropriate. This is particularly critical in pre-transfusion testing with the risk of ABO mismatch transfusion and potential fatality a real possibility. Background: Over 11?months, data relating to mislabelled specimens demonstrated a basal rate of 2 ?wrong-blood-in-tube?(WBIT) incidents per month and 8 of 23 were for pre-transfusion testing. These incidents were detected only where inconsistencies either in clinical information or previous test results were apparent. Intervention Our pathology service developed a set of strict minimum identification criteria for ALL pathology specimens and a policy of rejection of specimens that do not comply. These criteria align with ANZSBT guidelines for pre-transfusion samples. An 8?week education and notification phase followed by strict application of the criteria in February 2004 and a subsequent follow-up phase was conducted. Result? Smooth implementation of a major network-wide initiative has occurred over the last 5?months, as evidenced by the low specimen incident rate of 1%. Early indicators of success include an increased awareness of WBIT episodes with three self-reported episodes of WBIT since implementation. Unlabelled specimens have reduced by at least 50% compared to the same period prior to intervention. Conclusion? Our experience may be of interest to other institutions considering similar initiatives. A reduction in WBIT events is the most preferred outcome, however it may be many months before this can be appreciated due to low detection levels.
