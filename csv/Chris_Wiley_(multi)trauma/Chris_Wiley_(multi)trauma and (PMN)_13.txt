AB  - Factor XIII (FXIII) is the last enzyme in the clotting cascade. Its main function is to convert the loose fibrin polymer into a firm, cross-linked structure. FXIII inhibitor is a rare condition, in which three different types of inhibitors have been described usually due to IgG antibodies. We describe two male patients with acquired FXIII deficiency (age; 73 and 69?years), who had a history of significant bleeding. Functional assay using the acetic acid/urea clot solubility test showed residual FXIII levels between 1?2%. Molecular studies by PCR and DNA sequencing excluded an inherited FXIII deficiency. In addition, we demonstrated an inhibitor pattern for FXIII by in vitro mixing studies with both purified FXIII (Fibrogammin, Aventis Behring) and cryoprecipitates as sources of FXIII. Transglutaminase assay of FXIII (Dade Behring) was normal for both patients, consistent with a type III FXIII inhibitor, which believed to be directed against the activated FXIII-fibrin complex. Both patients showed transient correction of clot solubility to normal after infusion of high doses of Fibrogammin. In view of previous reports describing FXIII inhibitors of the IgG class, we attempted a novel treatment with rituximab (chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, Roche) to interfere with production of the inhibitor. However, neither patient showed correction of FXIII activity as measured by clot solubility tests during and up to 2 weeks after therapy. Preliminary results suggest that high dose Fibrogammin is required to correct FXIII deficiency due to an acquired type III inhibitor. The role of rituximab or other immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation.

AB  - Aim? Review of four failures of refrigeration facilities in Victorian institutional blood banks reported to ARCBS in the first 4?months of 2004. These incidents at both public and private institutions, in metropolitan and regional settings, resulted in loss of 148 units of red cells, 7 vials of RhD Ig and 2 bottles of Albumex. Incidents were investigated and root causes identified by initial phone interview and visits to blood bank storage facilities. Result? Case 1: Temperature fell below 0?°C at remote site, alarm was activated at monitoring centre (main lab) but without response. Case 2: Power failure resulted in rise in temperature. Alarm did not activate until power was restored. Alarms were set outside required storage temperatures. Case 3: Circuit failure resulted in loss of power. Alarm was activated, but then switched off and no further action taken. Case 4: Compressor failure resulted in alarm activation. Alarm and monitoring devices were deactivated while repairs carried out. Product was not moved to other storage facilities. These cases all highlight the importance of procedures, training, equipment and maintenance. Conclusion? Losses of precious blood components and products through refrigeration failures are preventable. Vital improvements should include commissioning refrigeration equipment that meets AS 3864, protocol development and staff training in use of procedures to be followed when out of temperature events occur, and performance of regular preventative maintenance, calibration and testing of storage and monitoring equipment. ARCBS can work with institutional blood banks to improve storage and management of blood.

AB  - The aim of this project was to identify potential protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions in stored red cell concentrates. Previously, research into protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions has focussed on specific proteins, such as cytokines. In this study, a global approach was taken which involved two-dimensional electrophoresis based Proteomics, which has the potential to uncover previously unrecognised mediators or novel proteins. Red cell products with and without pre-storage leukoreduction (each n?=?6) were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. Supernatant samples were taken at several time points until product expiry. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and those that accumulated in the supernatant were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. The protein profile of supernatant from leukoreduced red cell products was less complex compared to non-leukoreduced products (from 4.4 fold fewer proteins at day 1 to 1.6 fold fewer at day 43). Several proteins were observed to be predominantly present in leukoreduced products which may potentially be beneficial to red cell survival. These proteins were identified as being involved in the maintenance of a stable extracellular environment. Conversely, a number of proteins, which may have detrimental effects, were predominantly expressed in non-leukoreduced products. These proteins included a neutrophil chemoattractant (activator) and a potential acute-phase reactant. A number of proteins identified by mass spectrometry were matched to theoretical proteins of unknown function. The findings confirm the usefulness of Proteomics to investigate storage effects on blood products. The clinical relevance of these proteins is the focus of our future investigations.

AB  - Following the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the introduction of testing for erythropoietin in elite athletes, it became apparent that many athletes had reverted to blood doping using homologous and autologous transfusions. The Science and Industry Against Blood doping research consortium approached Dr Nelson at RPAH to determine if a test could be developed to detect recent blood transfusions. A grant was provided by the US Anti-Doping Agency to develop a flow cytometric assay which detects the expression of a panel of minor blood group antigens. Most blood bank reagents are IgM and are not satisfactory as they cause aggregation. A series of IgG polyclonal antibodies were sourced and the optimal titre of each antibody to detect minor negative and positive red cell populations in in vitro mixtures was determined. The test was validated by four Sydney flow cytometry laboratories who tested unknown samples in a proficiency exercise. In April 2004, IOC, WADA and ATHOC agreed to introduce the test into the Athens laboratory in time for the 2004 Olympics with assistance from RPAH. From May till August, RPAH sourced suitable antibodies, performed antibody titrations, provided a standard operating procedure, consulted daily with both the Athens lab and the Anti-doping lab in Lausanne and conducted a series of 3 Proficiency Testing exercises for both labs. No false positives were found in 254 antibody/sample test combinations. The Athens lab used a panel which included antibodies to C, c, E, Jka, Jkb, Fyb, Fyb, M, N and S. Reagents for anti s, K and e were also provided by RPAH. Two weeks before the Games, the lab personnel moved into the IOC Athens Testing lab. A total of 350 endurance athletes were tested. This included placegetters plus randomly selected competitors.

AB  - The regulation of blood, blood product, tissue and gene technology therapies are viewed as critical to protecting the health of Australians. In response to the growing community concerns regarding the ethics, quality and safety of tissue and biological therapy products, the Australian Health Ministers Council, in 2002, recommended the development and introduction of a regulatory framework for tissues and emerging biological therapies. The proposal for tissues and emerging biological therapies parallels the regulation of blood and blood components introduced by the TGA in 2000 following similar ministerial recommendations, policy development and consultation A comprehensive system for the regulation of cellular and tissue based therapies within a proposed trans Tasman framework will be characterised by the following principles: ??All therapeutic products definable as cellular and tissue therapies, including cell-based gene therapy products, will be overseen by the system ??The level of regulation will be classified according to the risks posed by the therapies to the individual and the community. ??The classification system will align regulation of therapies to: ??standards ??standards and GMP ??standards, GMP and pre-market evaluation according to the level of risk. ??All facilities responsible for the manufacture and supply of cellular and tissue based products will be required to register their organisation with the TGA.

AB  - Aim To identify the medical officers responsible for blood transfusion therapy across the ACT. Method? Medical records of patients having transfusions were audited in one tertiary referral hospital, one general hospital and one associated private hospital as part of a quality improvement project. The clinical status patients, reasons for transfusion and laboratory data were extracted and the appropriateness of transfusion was assessed independently by two of the authors. Differences were resolved by consensus. The prescriber was also identified where possible, defined as the most senior clinician recorded in the medical record involved in the decision to transfuse. Result? The prescriber could be determined in 78% of transfusion episodes. In the majority of cases the decision to transfuse was attributed to specialist staff, in all hospitals. Registrars at the tertiary hospital prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (12%) than specialists (18.1%, p?<?0.05). This was not found at the smaller public hospital. After hours resident and registrar staff prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (3%) than other prescribers across the Territory (18.7%, p?<?0.005). Conclusion? Medical practitioners with varying levels of experience make medical decisions in hospitals. Who is responsible for these decisions has not been well studied. Our findings demonstrate specialist involvement in the majority of transfusion decisions. The results favour a ?top down? approach to quality improvement in transfusion, rather than targeting junior medical officers. The findings also have significant implications in understanding the dynamics of clinical decision making in the hospital setting and for the targeting of other quality improvement strategies.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.

AB  - Aim? ARCBS collection sites are located in capital city centres, regional and metropolitan static sites and mobile units. The project aimed to establish a ?donor-centric? collection facility that met evolving donor needs. Methods  (a) the eastern based skew of the existing Pirie Street operation and (b) the demographic profiles of donor and non-donor cohorts, potential sites for further investigation were identified. This process was further enhanced by surveying donors (stakeholder buy in and input) who indicated a preference for a mid-CBD site. This selection was supported by retailing and traffic analysis that reinforced the Currie St. location ? a major street frontage with a transport hub to the western suburbs. ?Guiding Principles? for the design and operation of the centre were developed and stated that the site must; ? have a WOW factor ? make donation easy for donors ? have a modern and professional outlook ? have its own personality ? be creative and bold ? not compete with the existing city site ? cater for a different market segment to existing sites. The Guiding Principles and recommendations from donor focus groups, were used by the architects to develop concept drawings. These were reviewed by the Donor Advisory Committee, and specifications finalised. Furniture, fittings, refreshments and marketing strategies also focussed on the target donor groups and Guiding Principles. Conclusion? A donor focus in the planning, design and development of this centre has produced a facility that currently exceeds collection targets and has been nominated for building industry awards.

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.

AB  - The prophylactic use of rhesus immunoglobulin has led to a significant reduction in the incidence of haemolytic disease of the newborn secondary to rhesus alloimmunisation, which now only occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. Despite prophylaxis, antibodies to the D antigen are still the commonest cause of rhesus isoimmunisation. Although now a rare pregnancy disorder rhesus isoimmunisation continues to be a challenging obstetric complication and while the face of this disease has undergone many changes over recent years, the principles of management remain unchanged. Pregnancies at risk of the disease are identified by past obstetric history and the antenatal detection of red cell antibodies with serial measurement of antibody levels. In cases of heterozygous paternity the real risk of fetal disease can be determined using new DNA techniques to determine the fetal blood cell type with tissue obtained from amniocentesis, and now by molecular analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and serum. Sensitised pregnancies are monitored for the development of fetal anaemia. Since its introduction into clinical practise by Liley over 40?years ago, spectral analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis has been the primary method of screening for fetal anaemia. Noninvasive evaluation is now possible with the use of doppler ultrasound to detect changes to fetal blood flow secondary to fetal anaemia, most commonly using the middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound evaluation of fetal haemopoetic organs and for the diagnosis of hydrops. Ultrasound guided intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells remains the treatment for the severely affected fetus. Perinatal survival rates in the non hydropic fetus are reported at over 90% and long term studies have revealed normal neurological outcomes for more than 90% cases.

AB  - Training doctors in transfusion medicine needs a new perspective because the existing knowledge based structure has neither attracted enough doctors nor made the system safer. Safety: Intra-hospital transfusion systems, where most transfusions are delivered by overworked, under skilled PGY1s or PGY2s or nurses, are usually inherently unstable and unsafe. The system itself has to be designed to protect the patient in real hospital life situations. That means competency based training of all staff connected with transfusion and fail safe system design with continuous quality review. Knowledge: The range of knowledge required in a blood centre underscores the difficulty of pigeon holing transfusion medicine in a particular College. More fundamentally, the issue is about what practical benefit the knowledge brings to its owner in terms of jobs or recognition. It includes ?Health assessment of well donors ?Relevant viruses, bacteria and prions, ?Immunology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels and the associated clinical syndromes and their management ?Haematology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels of inflammation and coagulation and the congenital anaemias ?Cytotoxic, immunological or inflammatory effects of chemotherapy and transplantation in malignant haematology ?Resuscitation and immunological or inflammatory conditions in medicine & surgery, with implications for blood products ?Public health particularly for management of public safety, regulatory systems and health economics Transfusion knowledge is broad and often task specific. Developing appropriate task specific experts requires training and research publications to develop credibility and professional networks.

AB  - The use of autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) has increased in Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. A patient, who had a relapse of Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma after a remission of 13?years, required an autologous stem cell transplant. However, he was found to have cold agglutinins. The problem was raised as to whether or not he could have stem cells collected and if they would survive following freezing and storage. A literature search was undertaken and very little information found on stem cell collection in patients with cold agglutinins. Some anecdotal information was reported by colleagues all of which seemed to point to less than favourable outcomes. It was decided to mobilize the patient for stem cell collection and devise a method of collection, storage and transplantation. This paper will give an account of the collection, treatment and progress of the patient, and discuss the procedures involved. It will demonstrate the collaboration between medical, nursing and laboratory staff to achieve a positive patient outcome.

AB  - During their education all Medical Scientists will be exposed at some stage to the intricacies of blood grouping, crossmatching and the investigation of adverse responses to the transfusion of blood and blood products. For some, this exposure engenders fear and trepidation and they cannot wait to get into a discipline that is less demanding and stressful. For others the discipline is a challenge that allows them to use their problem solving skills and to experience the adrenal rush of responding to urgent requests for blood from theater or casualty to help save a bleeding patient. As in all disciplines of Laboratory Medicine, technology, especially information communication technology (ICT), is having a significant impact upon how blood transfusion science is being practiced. However unlike all other disciplines, blood transfusion is also subject to the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Authority which impose a broad range of safety requirements on the products that Medical Scientist work with and release for patients. Whilst some testing technology such as column agglutination and ICT is seemingly simplifying the preparation and release of products for patients, developments in other areas are opening up new challenges. The creation of Cell Therapies laboratories in a number of the major hospitals in Australia is the latest development in transfusion practice. Could the next stage in our progression be the incorpor ation of the hospital blood bank into the Cell and Tissue Therapies Laboratory, where the testing and processing of all cell and tissue products is undertaken under the one coordinating body. This presentation will review the education and training of Medical Scientists at RMIT University for the discipline of Transfusion Science and present a perspective on where future directions in our educational programs might go.

AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.
