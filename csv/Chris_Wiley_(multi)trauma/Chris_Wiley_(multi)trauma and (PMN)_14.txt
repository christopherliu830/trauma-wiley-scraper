AB  - Aim? ARCBS collection sites are located in capital city centres, regional and metropolitan static sites and mobile units. The project aimed to establish a ?donor-centric? collection facility that met evolving donor needs. Methods  (a) the eastern based skew of the existing Pirie Street operation and (b) the demographic profiles of donor and non-donor cohorts, potential sites for further investigation were identified. This process was further enhanced by surveying donors (stakeholder buy in and input) who indicated a preference for a mid-CBD site. This selection was supported by retailing and traffic analysis that reinforced the Currie St. location ? a major street frontage with a transport hub to the western suburbs. ?Guiding Principles? for the design and operation of the centre were developed and stated that the site must; ? have a WOW factor ? make donation easy for donors ? have a modern and professional outlook ? have its own personality ? be creative and bold ? not compete with the existing city site ? cater for a different market segment to existing sites. The Guiding Principles and recommendations from donor focus groups, were used by the architects to develop concept drawings. These were reviewed by the Donor Advisory Committee, and specifications finalised. Furniture, fittings, refreshments and marketing strategies also focussed on the target donor groups and Guiding Principles. Conclusion? A donor focus in the planning, design and development of this centre has produced a facility that currently exceeds collection targets and has been nominated for building industry awards.

AB  - Aim? Blood Matters was a project funded by the Victorian Department of Human Services to introduce sustainable improvements in hospital transfusion practice. An evaluation was conducted at two metropolitan hospitals to review progress against stated aims and identify key elements leading to changes in transfusion practice and highlight any unintended consequences. Method? During the project, each hospital chose to focus improvement efforts in key areas. Measurable, specific goals were developed. Using a case study approach, the evaluation was conducted by review of the aim-specific data collected during the project and by semi-structured interviews from which key themes (eg assumptions underpinning decisions) were identified. Interviews were conducted with at least 10 representative individuals from each organisation whose roles were considered necessary for change in their institution?s transfusion practice. Result? Measurable improvements have been made (eg an 87 percent improvement in reduction of patient identification error) and the Transfusion Nurse position made operational at both sites. Examples of key success factors identified are: a committed transfusion team to direct improvements in the organisation; integration of transfusion data reporting into existing organisational quality/risk management structures to provide ongoing visibility for transfusion issues and; mentorship and support for the Transfusion Nurse role. Conclusion? This project has, in the short term, successfully generated improvements in hospital transfusion practice and influenced hospital systems to enable changes to be sustainable in the longer term.

AB  - As in many aspects of transfusion medicine, practices have developed based on low levels of evidence. Let?s review some assumptions and think how these might change in future:- (1)?Indications. 80% of platelet transfusions are given prophylactically to patients with bone marrow failure, yet no trials have demonstrated the value of prophylaxis over treatment of bleeding alone. (2)?Trigger. A trigger of 10???10?g/l is now accepted. Reducing this further will depend on accurate counting, challenging at this level. (3)?Dose & frequency. The optimum dosing schedule has not been derived by pharmacokinetic studies, but by what can be conveniently manufactured. An adult dose of 3???1011 platelets is accepted, but there is wide variation in practice. (4)?Manufacture. Globally, 3 methods (pooled buffy coats, platelet rich plasma and apheresis) all produce an efficacious product. Although apheresis platelets reduce donor exposure, no functional advantage has been demonstrated. (5)?In vitro assessment of function. A battery of tests is recommended, but only pH has been shown to correlate with posttransfusion survival. (6)?ABO matching. ABO compatible platelets give better increments, and transfusing ABO incompatible plasma can be associated with haemolysis, but ABO matching to patient is often compromised by stock management. (7)?Use of platelet additive solution. A 70:30 mix of PAS:plasma would reduce reactions and perhaps TRALI but this is not standard practice. Is the plasma useful? (8)?CMV safety. Overall, leucocyte depletion alone appears to provide a high degree of protection, but this is not universally accepted. (9)?Assessment of response. 1 and 24?hr increments are standard, but is regression analysis the way forward? (10)?Management of refractoriness. Better HLA and HPA matching is now technically possible. Should these lead to better HLA matching for all? (11)?Is one product for all appropriate? 20% of platelets go to surgical patients who are bleeding. Do they need a product with a different specification?

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.

AB  - The prophylactic use of rhesus immunoglobulin has led to a significant reduction in the incidence of haemolytic disease of the newborn secondary to rhesus alloimmunisation, which now only occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. Despite prophylaxis, antibodies to the D antigen are still the commonest cause of rhesus isoimmunisation. Although now a rare pregnancy disorder rhesus isoimmunisation continues to be a challenging obstetric complication and while the face of this disease has undergone many changes over recent years, the principles of management remain unchanged. Pregnancies at risk of the disease are identified by past obstetric history and the antenatal detection of red cell antibodies with serial measurement of antibody levels. In cases of heterozygous paternity the real risk of fetal disease can be determined using new DNA techniques to determine the fetal blood cell type with tissue obtained from amniocentesis, and now by molecular analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and serum. Sensitised pregnancies are monitored for the development of fetal anaemia. Since its introduction into clinical practise by Liley over 40?years ago, spectral analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis has been the primary method of screening for fetal anaemia. Noninvasive evaluation is now possible with the use of doppler ultrasound to detect changes to fetal blood flow secondary to fetal anaemia, most commonly using the middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound evaluation of fetal haemopoetic organs and for the diagnosis of hydrops. Ultrasound guided intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells remains the treatment for the severely affected fetus. Perinatal survival rates in the non hydropic fetus are reported at over 90% and long term studies have revealed normal neurological outcomes for more than 90% cases.

AB  - Training doctors in transfusion medicine needs a new perspective because the existing knowledge based structure has neither attracted enough doctors nor made the system safer. Safety: Intra-hospital transfusion systems, where most transfusions are delivered by overworked, under skilled PGY1s or PGY2s or nurses, are usually inherently unstable and unsafe. The system itself has to be designed to protect the patient in real hospital life situations. That means competency based training of all staff connected with transfusion and fail safe system design with continuous quality review. Knowledge: The range of knowledge required in a blood centre underscores the difficulty of pigeon holing transfusion medicine in a particular College. More fundamentally, the issue is about what practical benefit the knowledge brings to its owner in terms of jobs or recognition. It includes ?Health assessment of well donors ?Relevant viruses, bacteria and prions, ?Immunology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels and the associated clinical syndromes and their management ?Haematology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels of inflammation and coagulation and the congenital anaemias ?Cytotoxic, immunological or inflammatory effects of chemotherapy and transplantation in malignant haematology ?Resuscitation and immunological or inflammatory conditions in medicine & surgery, with implications for blood products ?Public health particularly for management of public safety, regulatory systems and health economics Transfusion knowledge is broad and often task specific. Developing appropriate task specific experts requires training and research publications to develop credibility and professional networks.

AB  - The use of autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) has increased in Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. A patient, who had a relapse of Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma after a remission of 13?years, required an autologous stem cell transplant. However, he was found to have cold agglutinins. The problem was raised as to whether or not he could have stem cells collected and if they would survive following freezing and storage. A literature search was undertaken and very little information found on stem cell collection in patients with cold agglutinins. Some anecdotal information was reported by colleagues all of which seemed to point to less than favourable outcomes. It was decided to mobilize the patient for stem cell collection and devise a method of collection, storage and transplantation. This paper will give an account of the collection, treatment and progress of the patient, and discuss the procedures involved. It will demonstrate the collaboration between medical, nursing and laboratory staff to achieve a positive patient outcome.

AB  - During their education all Medical Scientists will be exposed at some stage to the intricacies of blood grouping, crossmatching and the investigation of adverse responses to the transfusion of blood and blood products. For some, this exposure engenders fear and trepidation and they cannot wait to get into a discipline that is less demanding and stressful. For others the discipline is a challenge that allows them to use their problem solving skills and to experience the adrenal rush of responding to urgent requests for blood from theater or casualty to help save a bleeding patient. As in all disciplines of Laboratory Medicine, technology, especially information communication technology (ICT), is having a significant impact upon how blood transfusion science is being practiced. However unlike all other disciplines, blood transfusion is also subject to the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Authority which impose a broad range of safety requirements on the products that Medical Scientist work with and release for patients. Whilst some testing technology such as column agglutination and ICT is seemingly simplifying the preparation and release of products for patients, developments in other areas are opening up new challenges. The creation of Cell Therapies laboratories in a number of the major hospitals in Australia is the latest development in transfusion practice. Could the next stage in our progression be the incorpor ation of the hospital blood bank into the Cell and Tissue Therapies Laboratory, where the testing and processing of all cell and tissue products is undertaken under the one coordinating body. This presentation will review the education and training of Medical Scientists at RMIT University for the discipline of Transfusion Science and present a perspective on where future directions in our educational programs might go.

AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.

AB  - In July 2003, The Royal Women?s Hospital, Melbourne implemented the use of Prophylactic Rh D Immunoglobulin in obstetrics to help reduce the incidence of Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer in December 2002. Successful implementation required the coordinated efforts of a large working party including haematologists, laboratory staff, blood bank, product technicians, CSL, clinical managers, midwives, obstetricians, clerical staff and educators. New practice guidelines, system processes, procedures and staff education needed to be developed and coordinated to support the successful implementation across the Royal Women?s Hospital complex maternity care programme sites. This talk firstly outlines how this implementation was achieved across a complex organisation as is The Royal Women?s Hospital, and the tools that were invaluable in contributing to its consistent success. Examples of materials developed to support staff, from discussion guidelines to materials developed to aid pregnant women to make an informed choice will be shown. The second part of this talk offers an insight into the concerns that pregnant women raise regarding the offering of prophylactic Anti ? D, from a midwifery perspective. What does the consumer think and how can we best serve their needs? What are the practical considerations that help Rh D negative women choose what is best for themselves and their babies? It is hoped that this talk contributes practical information to anyone involved in the delivery of prophylactic Anti-D to pregnant women for the prevention of HDN.

AB  - Bombay phenotype, one of the rare blood group was discovered in India in 1952 by Bhende et al. The frequency of this in Western India is about 1 in 7600. Aim? Our Institute gets referral samples from various hospitals and blood banks with problems in grouping and cross matching for identification of blood group and atypical antibodies. We have identified many Bombay phenotype cases out of these by serological procedures. We undertook molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene on this large series of Bombay phenotypes to see whether the earlier reported mutations on Indian Bombay phenotypes from South Africa and Reunion Island are present in our population or not. Method? Serological confirmations of Bombay phenotypes was done as per standard procedures. Thirty of these serologically confirmed samples were undertaken for molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene. DNA extraction was done from these samples and FUTI(H) gene was amplified by performing nested PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzyme Nae 1 to screen for T 725 G mutation. The digested product was run on agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed. Result? Out of these 30 samples 27 samples were homozygous for T 725 G mutation and one sample was heterozygous for T 725 G mutation which serologically had shown absence of H antigen on red cells and two samples did not show the presence of this mutation. Conclusion? The T 725 G mutation of FUTI(H) gene appears to be the common mutation amongst the Bombay phenotypes detected in India.

AB  - By comparison with many other procedures in medicine, apheresis for collection of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is a relatively innocuous process. The procedure itself is straightforward, serious adverse effects are rare and many donors experience real benefits. But the apparent simplicity of HPC harvest is misleading as apheresis raises substantial issues of consent, risk assessment and conflict of interest. G-CSF primed apheresis is associated with a number of predictable shortterm risks and unpredictable long-term risks, particularly in those who submit to a second or third donation. Donors are often coerced by the very nature of their relationship to the recipient and by expectations of altruism and are infrequently offered a true choice between bone marrow harvest and peripheral HPC harvest. And, as is the case in solid organ donation, HPC donors may consent to HPC collection for a number of different reasons, some of which may negatively impact upon their experience of apheresis and may give rise to concerns regarding late withdrawal from donation. While these issues are complex enough where competent adults are the donors, they are more difficult again where the ?donor? in not competent, is mentally ill or is a child. In this paper I will review the ethics of apheresis, critique the concept of informed consent and the disproportionate concern with unrelated donors, and consider whether current practices are ethically justifiable.

AB  - Aim? To understand the underlying cause of a cluster of haemolysis-type adverse event (AE) reports received by CSL/ARCBS in patients receiving Intragam? P. Method? The cluster of AE reports were analysed with respect to patient factors (clinical indication, dose, blood group, concomitant medications and blood products, bone marrow reserve), product factors (batch results, production records) and changes in clinical practice (administration protocols, infusion kits). All Intragam P haemolysis related AEs from clinical trials and post-marketing exposure were reviewed, as well as international literature on this subject. Result Sixteen haemolysis type cases were reported to ARCBS/CSL over a 3?month period, ranging from abnormal laboratory test results (positive Coombs test) to clinical symptoms requiring transfusion. Ten of these reports were received in 4?days from 2 Victorian hospitals following the detection of 2 cases, which precipitated a retrospective review that identified additional similar cases. All patients received high dose (doses exceeding 400?600?mg/kg given every 3?4 weeks either in frequency or quantity) and all but one (where evidence suggested an underlying disorder) were of blood group A or AB. Eight patients were recipients of bone marrow transplants. No product or batch related factors or processes likely to have contributed to the haemolysis type AEs were identified. Anti-A and Anti-B titres of all Intragam P batches were investigated and confirmed to be within regulatory approved release specifications and pharmacopoeial limits. Conclusion? Haemolysis type adverse events are a recognised consequence of IVIG administration and are widely discussed in the literature. This investigation has confirmed the association of high dose IVIG in recipients of blood group A or AB and increased risk of haemolysis type adverse events. It also highlighted the possibility of accentuating any consequent anaemia in patients with diminished bone marrow reserve (eg post bone marrow transplant patients). Pre-infusion ABO blood groups should be determined in patients receiving high dose IVIG and their haemoglobin levels monitored in the?days following therapy.
