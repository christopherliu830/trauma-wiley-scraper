AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Summary A 4-week-old Thoroughbred filly foal with a history of sepsis was evaluated for right hindlimb lameness. Bilateral femoropatellar and femorotibial joint effusions were detected. Ultrasonography and radiography of the right stifle revealed signs of joint collapse and periarticular swelling. Computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the bone density of the medial femoral condyle of the right hindlimb and lateral femoral condyle of the left hindlimb. Euthanasia was recommended based on the severity of the lesions. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed extensive separation of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex from the subchondral bone of the femoral condyles. The histological features suggest an ischaemic aetiology; comparisons are made with lesions of osteochondrosis and avascular necrosis of bone.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Causal theory and causal models have proven to be helpful in understanding the multi-factorial causation of many diseases, including periodontitis. The design and application of causal models is essential to the appropriate design, conduct and analysis of studies on periodontal disease causation. This review discusses the principles of causation and causal theory, both in general and as they pertain to studies of the etiology of periodontitis. Specifically, we present an overview of models of causation, including the potential outcomes model, the sufficient component cause model, and directed acyclic graphical models. More thorough explanations and accompanying illustrations are provided for the sufficient component cause model and the directed acyclic graphical model. Topics related to the study of periodontitis, as illustrated by such models, include the principles of confounding and effect measure modification (interaction). Existing models of periodontitis etiology are critically reviewed in this context.

AB  - Summary Preclinical evidence supports targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To support ongoing clinical development of an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody, we have investigated for the first time the mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of a blocking anti-murine C5aR (anti-mC5aR) surrogate antibody in mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). First, efficacy was demonstrated in a multiple-dose treatment study. Almost complete inhibition of clinical disease progression was obtained, including reduced bone and cartilage destruction in anti-mC5aR-treated mice. Then, the mechanism of action was examined by looking for early effects of anti-mC5aR treatment in single-dose treatment studies. We found that 48?h after single-dose treatment with anti-mC5aR, the neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the paws was already reduced. In addition, several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A were reduced locally in the paws, indicating reduction of local inflammation. Furthermore, dose-setting experiments supported a beneficial clinical effect of dosing above the C5aR saturation level. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrated rapid onset effects of antibody blockade of C5aR. The data have translational value in supporting the Novo Nordisk clinical trials of an anti-C5aR antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients, by identifying potential biomarkers of treatment effects as well as by providing information on pharmacodynamics and novel insights into the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody blockade of C5aR.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To examine plaque accumulation on silk and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sutures at different time intervals. Methodology? Twenty-one male albino rabbits received sutures under general and local anaesthesia. After 3, 5 and 7?days sutures were removed and processed for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The Friedman and the Wilcoxon tests were used to compare contamination on PVDF and silk suture materials at different time intervals. Results? At all time intervals, the whole surface of silk sutures was covered with a thick layer of bacterial plaque and debris. Microorganisms and blood cells on the surface and between the filaments of the silk suture material were observed. Light debris appeared around the knot area of PVDF sutures after 3?days. At 5 and 7?days, contamination could be seen in scattered areas along the suture material. The average contaminated area was smaller on PVDF suture materials, which were removed at 5 than at 7?days after insertion. At 3?days, PVDF sutures showed significantly less contamination than at 5 and 7?days (P?=?0.002). There were statistically significant differences between silk and PVDF sutures at 3, 5 and 7?days. Conclusion? SEM observation showed that PVDF sutures were contaminated less than silk sutures at 3, 5 and 7?days.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

AB  - Regenerative medicine has sparked interest in potential strategies for bone repair. Bone defects are widespread and could be caused by trauma, congenital malformations, infections, and surgery. Although bone has a large self-healing capacity, some defects or fractures are too big to regenerate. To regenerate bone structures which can be used for treatment of patients, bone growth must be induced by a number of bioactive implantable materials, cell types and intracellular, and extracellular molecular signaling pathways. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation during remodeling processes have important roles in bone regeneration, it is believed that understanding molecular signaling pathways involved is crucial to the development of bone implants, bone substitute materials, and cell-based scaffolds for bone regeneration. In this review, we briefly introduce concepts in fracture repair and regeneration following bone injuries, and then discuss the current clinical methods in bone regeneration. In the next section, we review the involvement of the various key signaling pathways in bone regeneration.
