Abstract Aim: To compare histopathological characteristics of peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions. Methods: A search was conducted on publications up to July 2010. Studies carried out on human biopsy material and animal experiments were considered. Results: While comprehensive information exists regarding histopathological characteristics of human periodontitis lesions, few studies evaluated peri-implantitis lesions in human biopsy material. Experimental peri-implantitis lesions were evaluated in 10 studies and three of the studies included comparisons to experimental periodontitis. Human biopsy material: the apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate (ICT) was more pronounced in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis and was in most cases located apical of the pocket epithelium. Plasma cells and lymphocytes dominated among cells in both types of lesions, whereas neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages occurred in larger proportions in peri-implantitis. Experimental studies: placement of ligatures together with plaque formation resulted in loss of supporting tissues and large ICTs around implants and teeth. Following ligature removal, a ?self-limiting? process occurred in the tissues around teeth with a connective tissue capsule that separated the ICT from bone, while in peri-implant tissues the ICT extended to the bone crest. Conclusion: Despite similarities regarding clinical features and aetiology of peri-implantitis and periodontitis, critical histopathological differences exist between the two lesions.

AB  - Myelin plays a critical role in proper neuronal function by providing trophic and metabolic support to axons and facilitating energy-efficient saltatory conduction. Myelination is influenced by numerous molecules including growth factors, hormones, transmembrane receptors and extracellular molecules, which activate signaling cascades that drive cellular maturation. Key signaling molecules and downstream signaling cascades controlling myelination have been identified in cell culture systems. However, in vitro systems are not able to faithfully replicate the complex in vivo signaling environment that occurs during development or following injury. Currently, it remains time-consuming and expensive to investigate myelination in vivo in rodents, the most widely used model for studying mammalian myelination. As such, there is a need for alternative in vivo myelination models, particularly ones that can test molecular mechanisms without removing oligodendrocyte lineage cells from their native signaling environment or disrupting intercellular interactions with other cell types present during myelination. Here, we review the ever-increasing role of zebrafish in studies uncovering novel mechanisms controlling vertebrate myelination. These innovative studies range from observations of the behavior of single cells during in vivo myelination as well as mutagenesis- and pharmacology-based screens in whole animals. Additionally, we discuss recent efforts to develop novel models of demyelination and oligodendrocyte cell death in adult zebrafish for the study of cellular behavior in real time during repair and regeneration of damaged nervous systems.

AB  - Abstract Healthy human brain undergoes significant changes during development. The developmental trajectory of superficial white matter (SWM) is less understood relative to cortical gray matter (GM) and deep white matter. In this study, a multimodal imaging strategy was applied to vertexwise map SWM microstructure and cortical thickness to characterize their developmental pattern and elucidate SWM-GM associations in children and adolescents. Microscopic changes in SWM were evaluated with water diffusion parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) in 133 healthy subjects aged 10?18 years. Results demonstrated distinct maturational patterns in SWM and GM. SWM showed increasing FA and decreasing MD and RD underneath bilateral motor sensory cortices and superior temporal auditory cortex, suggesting increasing myelination. A second developmental pattern in SWM was increasing FA and AD in bilateral orbitofrontal regions and insula, suggesting improved axonal coherence. These SWM patterns diverge from the more widespread GM maturation, suggesting that cortical thickness changes in adolescence are not explained by the encroachment of SWM myelin into the GM-WM boundary. Interestingly, age-independent intrinsic association between SWM and cortical GM seems to follow functional organization of polymodal and unimodal brain regions. Unimodal sensory areas showed positive correlation between GM thickness and FA whereas polymodal regions showed negative correlation. Axonal coherence and differences in interstitial neuron composition between unimodal and polymodal regions may account for these SWM-GM association patterns. Intrinsic SWM-GM relationships unveiled by neuroimaging in vivo can be useful for examining psychiatric disorders with known WM/GM disturbances.

AB  - Acute infections caused by pathogenic bacteria have been studied extensively for well over 100Â years. These infections killed millions of people in previous centuries, but they have been combated effectively by the development of modern vaccines, antibiotics and infection control measures. Most research into bacterial pathogenesis has focused on acute infections, but these diseases have now been supplemented by a new category of chronic infections caused by bacteria growing in slime-enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Biofilm infections, such as pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients, chronic wounds, chronic otitis media and implant- and catheter-associated infections, affect millions of people in the developed world each year and many deaths occur as a consequence. In general, bacteria have two life forms during growth and proliferation. In one form, the bacteria exist as single, independent cells (planktonic) whereas in the other form, bacteria are organized into sessile aggregates. The latter form is commonly referred to as the biofilm growth phenotype. Acute infections are assumed to involve planktonic bacteria, which are generally treatable with antibiotics, although successful treatment depends on accurate and fast diagnosis. However, in cases where the bacteria succeed in forming a biofilm within the human host, the infection often turns out to be untreatable and will develop into a chronic state. The important hallmarks of chronic biofilm-based infections are extreme resistance to antibiotics and many other conventional antimicrobial agents, and an extreme capacity for evading the host defences. In this thesis, I will assemble the current knowledge on biofilms with an emphasis on chronic infections, guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of these infections, before relating this to my previous research into the area of biofilms. I will present evidence to support a view that the biofilm lifestyle dominates chronic bacterial infections, where bacterial aggregation is the default mode, and that subsequent biofilm development progresses by adaptation to nutritional and environmental conditions. I will make a series of correlations to highlight the most important aspects of biofilms from my perspective, and to determine what can be deduced from the past decades of biofilm research. I will try to bridge in vitro and in vivo research and propose methods for studying biofilms based on this knowledge. I will compare how bacterial biofilms exist in stable ecological habitats and opportunistically in unstable ecological habitats, such as infections. Bacteria have a similar lifestyle (the biofilm) in both habitats, but the fight for survival and supremacy is different. On the basis of this comparison, I will hypothesize how chronic biofilm infections are initiated and how bacteria live together in these infections. Finally, I will discuss different aspects of biofilm infection diagnosis. Hopefully, this survey of current knowledge and my proposed guidelines will provide the basis and inspiration for more research, improved diagnostics, and treatments for well-known biofilm infections and any that may be identified in the future.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of 106 horses presenting with chronic colic examined over a 5 year period were reviewed. Chronic colic was defined as colic signs observed, daily for 3 days or longer, except when masked by analgesics. The diagnosed causes of chronic colic included colonic impaction (31%), peritonitis (16%), enteritis/colitis (7%), colonic displacement/torsion (6%) and lymphosarcoma (4%). A variety of other diseases were diagnosed in a small number of cases, including intestinal adhesions, ileal obstructions, grass sickness, liver disease, caecal impactions, thromboembolic disease, intussusceptions etc. No diagnosis was reached in 8% of cases. Diagnosis was relatively easily achieved in most cases of colonic impaction and peritonitis by results of transrectal palpation and evaluation of peritoneal fluid. Specific clinical features, transrectal palpation, abdominal paracentesis and laboratory evaluations of blood were helpful in the diagnosis of some of the other diseases, but exploratory laparotomy remained necessary in a few cases to achieve a diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Staging and therapeutic planning for dogs with malignant disease in the popliteal lymph node are based on the expected patterns of lymphatic drainage from the lymph node. The medial iliac lymph nodes are known to receive efferent lymph from the popliteal lymph node; however, an accessory popliteal efferent pathway with direct connection to the sacral lymph nodes has also been less frequently reported. The primary objective of this prospective, anatomic study was to describe the frequency of various patterns of lymphatic drainage of the popliteal lymph node. With informed client consent, 50 adult dogs with no known disease of the lymphatic system underwent computed tomographic lymphography after ultrasound-guided, percutaneous injection of 350Â mg/ml iohexol into a popliteal lymph node. In all 50 dogs, the popliteal lymph node drained directly to the ipsilateral medial iliac lymph node through multiple lymphatic vessels that coursed along the medial thigh. In 26% (13/50) of dogs, efferent vessels also drained from the popliteal lymph node directly to the internal iliac and/or sacral lymph nodes, coursing laterally through the gluteal region and passing over the dorsal aspect of the pelvis. Lymphatic connections between the right and left medial iliac and right and left internal iliac lymph nodes were found. Based on our findings, the internal iliac and sacral lymph nodes should be considered when staging or planning therapy for dogs with malignant disease in the popliteal lymph node.

AB  - Abstract Among various classes of biomaterials, the majority of non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials exhibit piezoelectric properties, i.e., the accumulation of charge in response to applied mechanical stress or deformation. Due to the growing interest in nanomaterials, piezoelectric nano-biomaterials have been widely investigated, leading to remarkable advancements throughout the last two decades. Piezoelectric properties, high surface energy, targeting properties, and intricate cell?material interactions render piezoelectric nanomaterials highly attractive for application in therapeutics as well as regenerative medicine. Herein, the major focus is to highlight the wide range of applications of piezoelectric nano-biomaterials in drug delivery, theranostics, and tissue regeneration. After a brief introduction to piezoelectricity, an overview is provided on the major classes of piezoelectric biomaterials as well as a description of the origin of biopiezoelectricity in different tissues and macromolecules. Subsequently, relevant properties and postfabrication strategies of nanostructured piezoelectric biomaterials are discussed aiming to maximize piezoresponse. Finally, recent studies on nano- piezoceramics and piezopolymers are presented, with specific focus on barium titanate, zinc oxide, and polyvinylidene fluoride.

AB  - Abstract The complexity of providing adequate care after radiation exposure has drawn increasing attention. While most therapeutic development has focused on improving survival at lethal radiation doses, acute hematopoietic syndrome (AHS) occurs at substantially lower exposures. Thus, it is likely that a large proportion of such a radiation-exposed population will manifest AHS of variable degree and that the medical and socioeconomic costs of AHS will accrue. Here, we examined the potential of rBPI21 (opebacan), used without supportive care, to accelerate hematopoietic recovery after radiation where expected survival was substantial (42%-75%) at 30 days. rBPI21 administration was associated with accelerated recovery of hematopoietic precursors and normal marrow cellularity, with increases in megakaryocyte numbers particularly marked. This translated into attaining normal trilineage peripheral blood counts 2-3 weeks earlier than controls. Elevations of hematopoietic growth factors observed in plasma and the marrow microenvironment suggest the mechanism is likely multifactorial and not confined to known endotoxin-neutralizing and cytokine downmodulating activities of rBPI21. These observations deserve further exploration in radiation models and other settings where inadequate hematopoiesis is a prominent feature. These experiments also model the potential of therapeutics to limit the allocation of scarce resources after catastrophic exposures as an endpoint independent of lethality mitigation.

AB  - Summary Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile human pathogen causing diseases ranging from uncomplicated mucosal infections to life-threatening invasive disease. The development of human-relevant animal models of GAS infection and introduction of new technologies have markedly accelerated the pace of discoveries related to GAS host?pathogen interactions. For example, recently investigators have identified pili on the GAS cell surface and learned that they are key components for adherence to eukaryotic cell surfaces. Similarly, the recent development of a transgenic mouse expressing human plasminogen has resulted in new understanding of the molecular processes contributing to invasive infection. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GAS pharyngeal, invasive and other infections holds the promise of assisting with the development of novel preventive or therapeutic agents for this prevalent human pathogen.

Hepatic IL-8 release during graft procurement is associated with impaired graft function after human liver transplantation.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 29?35. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? In experimental models, brain death induces inflammatory cascades, leading to reduced graft survival. Thus far, factors prior to graft preservation have gained less attention in clinical setting. We studied pre-preservation inflammatory response and its effects on graft function in 30 brain dead liver donors and the respective recipients. Before donor graft perfusion, portal and hepatic venous blood samples were drawn for phagocyte adhesion molecule expression and plasma cytokine determinations. Donor intensive care unit stay correlated with donor C-reactive protein (R?=?0.472, p?=?0.013) and IL-6 (R?=?0.419, p?=?0.026) levels, and donor (R?=?0.478, p?=?0.016) and recipient gamma-glutamyl transferase (R?=?0.432, p?=?0.019) levels. During graft procurement, hepatic IL-8 release was observed in 17/30 donors. Grafts with hepatic IL-8 release exhibited subsequently higher alkaline phosphatase [319 (213?405) IU/L vs. 175 (149?208) IU/L, p?=?0.006] and bilirubin [101 (44?139) ?mol/L vs. 30 (23?72) ?mol/L, p?=?0.029] levels after transplantation. Our findings support the concept that inflammatory response in the brain dead organ donor contributes to the development of graft injury in human liver transplantation.

A recombinant form of BPI(rBPI21) has been developed and is being tested as atherapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections andexposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a targetantigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCAare present in cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appearsassociated with a higher inflammatory disease activity and greaterorgan damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at otherneutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecificeffects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCAmay further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI topromote clearance of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associatedendotoxin.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in an immediate loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site and is associated with a poor prognosis. The inhibitory environment that develops in response to the injury is mainly due to local expression of inhibitory factors, scarring and the formation of cystic cavitations, all of which limit the regenerative capacity of endogenous or transplanted cells.Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective.Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.
