AB  - Fibroblast migration from the peri-wound collagenous stroma into the fibrin-laden wound is critical for granulation tissue formation and subsequent healing. Previously we found that fibroblast transmigration from a collagen matrix into a fibrin matrix required the presence of fibronectin (FN). Several cell surface receptors, namely integrins α4?1, α5?1 and αv?3 were also required for this invasive migration. Here we demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, known to bind FN at the highly cationic HepII domain is also required for fibroblast invasive migration of a fibrin/FN gel. This conclusion was based on fibroblast migration using two independent means of disrupting syndecan-4: heparinase degradation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans or suppression of syndecan-4 core protein with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Isolated syndecan-4 from these fibroblasts bound the Hep II recombinant constructs FN III12?15v?>?FN III12?15?>?FN III12?14 but did not bind the alternatively spliced IIICs (V) domain. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is required to stimulate fibroblast migration, markedly increased cell levels of syndecan-4 core protein in a time and dose dependent fashion. PDGF also induced up-regulation of syndecan-4 at transcriptional level as determined by RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that syndecan-4 is essential for fibroblast invasive migration into fibrin clot and that PDGF, the stimulus for migration, induces increased syndecan-4 core protein expression.

AB  - Introduction: Venous ulcers are the most common chronic wounds of the lower limbs. In our laboratory, the self-assembly method is used to reconstruct autologous skin that can be used as a biological dressing (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318; J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). Goals and Methods: The aim of this study was to establish if our self-assembled skin substitute (SASS) allows the closure of nonhealing venous leg ulcers. A case study of a 68-year-old woman with a chronic venous leg ulcer present for over one year and measuring 135?cm2 is thus herein presented. The autologous cells were isolated from a cutaneous biopsy (1?cm2) and cultivated in vitro(J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). The autologous SASS was produced and assembled by the cells thus it does not contain any exogenous or synthetic material (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318). The wound was debrided, covered with grafts of SASS and maintained in place with a compressive dressing (Coban, 3M, St-Paul, MN). A new SASS was applied weekly until wound closure. The SASS seemed to lessen the pain caused by the ulcer. Seven applications of the SASS were necessary to lead to a full wound closure. Conclusion: Venous leg ulcer quickly reepithelialized after application of our SASS This case indicates that use of the SASS can reduce pain and promote closure of nonhealing leg ulcers Furthermore, we thus hope that our SASS biological dressing maybe clinically useful to treat difficult-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was approved by the Health Canada?s Therapeutic Products Directorate and by the Ethic Committee of the CHAUQ, Saint-Sacrement Hospital.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - A number of strategies have been explored for the treatment of cutaneous defects such as protein growth factor or gene therapy approaches. Alternative approaches include dermal or dermal-epidermal skin substitutes or clot substitutes such as fibrin sealants (FS?s). Here we test the fibrinogen-thrombin formulation of fibrin sealant combined with fibroblasts and PDGF in wound healing models. Four formulations varying in fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were applied to full-thickness biopsy wounds in the rabbit ear cutaneous wound-healing model with or without cultured rabbit dermal fibroblasts (RDFs; 3???105 cells/wound) embedded in the fibrinogen component. At post-wounding day 7, there was no difference in the diluted vs. non-diluted formulations for either the promotion of granulation tissue coverage of the open wounds or total granulation tissue area when tested without embedded cells. Including the RDFs, the highest degree of wound coverage by granulation tissue was observed in the combined dilution formulation (17.3?mg/ml fibrinogen, 167?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10) that was 167%(p?<?0.05) of the non-diluted FS containing cells (50?mg/ml fibrinogen, 250?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10). Inclusion of fibroblasts increased granulation tissue area within the wounds vs. FS alone (p?<?0.05) for each diluted formulation although no differences in this parameter was observed within each group (FS alone or with embedded cells). However, addition of the vulnerary growth factor PDGF-B (3??g; n?=?4) with the embedded RDFs in the combined dilution formulation increased granulation tissue area over 2-fold (p?<?0.01). Additionally, the presence of the RDFs promoted incorporation of the granulation tissue with and epithelial migration over the FS suggesting an active interaction between cells delivered to the wound by FS and the host repair cells. The findings suggest the progress of cutaneous defect repair can be enhanced by ex vivo cell delivery in Fibrin Sealant that is adjusted to balance hemostasis with promotion of wound healing processes.

AB  - Introduction: Burn depth, based on the hemodynamic alterations that occur following a thermal insult, can be assessed in a rapid, non-invasive, and nondestructive fashion using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR has the capability to determine the difference between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. Methods: Sixteen burn patients admitted to an adult regional burn center were studied and evaluated with the NIR point and imaging devices. Non-burned skin adjacent to the burn site was used as the control. NIR measurements were compared between superficial (8 wounds), full thickness (8 wounds) burn wounds and control sites. Results: NIR was able to easily detect an increase in oxyhemoglobin (68.3%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (4.8%, p?<?0.05%) and total hemoglobin (91.3%, p?<?0.05) which typically occurs with superficial burn injuries. Full thickness injuries experienced a substantial drop in oxyhemoglobin (88.8%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (79.1%, p?<?0.05) and total hemoglobin (77.5%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to control sites. Conclusions: These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy can successfully distinguish between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. The second phase of this study will involve determining the depth of indeterminant burn wounds and this preliminary data will also be presented. Acknowledgement: National Research Council of Canada

AB  - Introduction: Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each chromosome. Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the full length of the chromosome, up to 50?200 base pairs of the telomere are lost during each successive round of cell division. In adult human somatic cells, telomerase is not active resulting in progressive loss of telomere length and entry into replicative senescence as observed in cell culture. hTERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme which maintains telomere length. Transfection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by hTERT has been shown to reverse the senescent phenotype seen in aging HDFs in vitro. ERK (p44/42) is a MAP kinase which functions as a critical intermediary in the determination of cell growth and differentiation. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. ?Methods: In order to delineate some of the cellular mechanisms by which hTERT functions, we treated adenoviral hTERT (Ad-hTERT) transfected HDFs with TGFB1, and assayed phosphorylated ERK activity by Western blotting.?Results: Ad-hTERT treated HDFs demonstrated a 2?3 fold increase in phospho-ERK activity. In addition, our preliminary findings show that Ad-hTERT transfected HDFs have increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression by real-time rtPCR. ?Conclusions: Increased phosphor-ERK activity as well as increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression is seen in hTERT transfected HDF?s. Further studies will focus on defining other intermediary changes resulting from Ad-hTERT tranfection. Funding source: Geron Corporation

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem. p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression and attenuates proliferation of various cell types. Our in vitro rAd-p21 dose response studies of primary human dermal fibroblasts showed a 3?80 fold reduction of cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation at doses of 1???108?3???109?PN/mL, respectively. Further, rAd-p21 at 3???109 PN/mL showed a 2-fold less procollagen I (PIP) production when compared to control virus. These in vitro data demonstrate that rAd-p21 significantly attenuates fibroproliferation and procollagen production in the target cells. In vivo, a rat PVA sponge model was used. rAd-p21, at doses of 1???109, 1???1010 and 5???1010 PN was delivered into sponges that had previously been treated with a granulation tissue stimulator, rAd-PDGF-B. Results showed that sponges receiving rAd-PDGF-B alone had the highest % granulation fill (40?60% fill area). Sponges that were treated with rAd-PDGF-B for the first injection followed by rAd-p21 on a second injection showed a dose-dependent decrease in % granulation fill as rAd-p21 doses increased (p?<?0.001). On day 5 post-injection, IHC staining identified p21 protein expression only in sponges receiving rAd-p21. In addition, the quantitative measurement of cells labeled by BrdU or Ki67 demonstrated that rAd-p21 significantly attenuated cell proliferation when compared to rAd-PDGF alone in this model (p?<?0.01). In another in vivo experiment, a rabbit excessive scar model was used. rAd-p21, at a dose of 2???109?PN/wound was intradermally injected into the rabbit ear wounds that had previously been treated with PDGF-BB protein. Preliminary data showed that scar thickness in rAd-p21 treated wounds was significantly decreased in comparison to wounds treated with the control virus (p?<?0.05). These data suggest that rAd-p21 is effective in attenuating scars in the rabbit ear excessive scar model. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the further exploration of rAd-p21 as a useful therapeutic candidate for hyperproliferative diseases in patients.

AB  - Intro: Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation remains unclear, potentially involving mechanical strain, burns, or infection. We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.

AB  - Previous investigations have demonstrated that cutaneous healing in red Duroc pigs (RD) differs from healing in Yorkshire pigs (Y). Specifically, RD animals heal with the formation of hypercontracted, hyperpigmented scars, features which are not observed in Y animals. Further, this abnormal scarring may be genetically mediated, as demonstrated by the partial transmission of this phenotype to RD???Y offspring (F1). To further determine the degree of transmission of this phenotype, this study examined the effect of wound depth upon the healing response of F1 animals. Ten full thickness (FT) and ten deep dermal (DD, 1.8?mm) skin wounds (2?cm???2?cm) were created on the backs of juvenile female F1 animals (N?=?8) using previously published procedures. Biopsies (4?mm) were taken from FT and DD wounds on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Samples were used for histology and molecular analysis using RT-PCR. There were no detectable differences between the FT and DD wounds on the gross or histologic level. However on a molecular level, there were numerous differences between the FT and DD wounds. Several genes investigated demonstrated increased expression levels in the DD wounds as compared to the FT wounds. Further, DD wounds demonstrated a unique pattern of expression for several other genes that differed from that observed in either the F1 FT wounds or in any RD or Y wounds. Given that previous investigations have shown that FT and DD wounds are nearly identical within each of the RD and Y strains, this represents a novel finding. These results indicate that the healing phenotype of the F1 animals may be regulated both by genetics and by the wound size/depth, suggesting that human wound healing may be similarly influenced by genetics, wound depth and potentially, environmental factors.

AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - Bone marrow is an important supply for many progenitor cells, among them endothelial precursor cells. They have been already considered as potential therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic hindlimb. In this work we performed an unilateral chronic ischemic hindlimb model in 20 dogs, we were dissected and ligated the middle sacra artery and external right iliac artery preserving the internal iliac artery, after one week we removed de femoral artery performing a proximal and distal ligation and inserted into the gracilis muscle 3 Silastic tubes (0.8?mm diameter) in a middle circle form in order to created fibrocollagenous tunnels. Fifteen days later, we obtained bone marrow (30?mL) and mononuclear cells were separated; at the same time, all tubes were removed and bone marrow cells were transplanted into the fibrocollagenous tunnels, only in the third and fourth groups. During the 8 at 12 days we administered subcutaneously saline solution to the first and third groups and G-CSF to the second and fourth groups. Finally, after 30 days we performed contrasted angiographies from both limbs and was calculated mean angiographic score (MAS) from the number of vascular intersections, also was taken a biopsy from the central portion of right gracilis muscle for vascular assessment, as well as for vascular proliferating cells by immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated that white bone marrow cell transplantation enrichment by G-CSF administration stimulates angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb, twice than controls, and it is better than white bone marrow cell transplantation alone. White bone marrow cell is a potential therapy for ischemic hindlimb, because stem cells are growth factor provider, as well as an important source for endothelial precursors capable to form vessels de novo, mainly when this stem cells are deposited in an appropriate extracellular matrix, such as the fibrocollagenous tunnels in this model.

AB  - The inability to experiment in humans creates a great need to develop culture systems that mimic human tissues/organs. Skin is arguably the simplest human tissue and therefore provides an excellent prototype for tissue engineering. Moreover, skin is the body?s first line of defense. Currently available skin replacements have been classified into four categories: (i) those that are composed completely of epidermal cells; (ii) those consisting of dermal components derived from processing of cadaver skin or from collagen and other matrix molecules; (iii) those containing both dermal and epidermal components and (iv) those that contain dermal, epidermal and vascular components. All of these substitutes have drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need for skin replacements that: (a) are prepared with pertinent primary human cells but yet can be ready ?off? the shelf; (b) can be prepared rapidly; (c) contain stable structures in particular microvessels that can rapidly connect with the patient?s vasculature in this manner establish circulation in the ?graft? increasing the chances of survival; (d) can be tailored for specific wound impairments (e) are long lasting. We have developed a new generation human ?skin? that can fulfil these requirements and can potentially be used as a ?living bandage?. We start with three primary human cell types and a collagen matrix that self-assemble into a connective tissue containing a network of mature microvessels, is covered with a stratified epidermis, expresses biochemical markers, matrix molecules, and cytokines characteristic of normal human skin and matures in 10?15 days. Moreover, two additional cell types, pericytes and monocytes, differentiate in situ adjacent to and within microvessels, respectively providing stability to the micriovessels and the epidermis expresses keratins that are typical of mature skin and not those characteristically produced in response to injury such as keratins 6, 16, 17. This tissue can potentially be developed into a skin replacement for patients with impaired healing. In addition, this tissue responds normally to bological stimuli, providing a powerful vehicle to investigate mechanisms of skin development and regeneration, understand pathological processes, and test drugs and treatments for skin diseases

The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.
