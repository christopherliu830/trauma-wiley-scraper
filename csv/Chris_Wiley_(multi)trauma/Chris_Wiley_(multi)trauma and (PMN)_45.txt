AB  - Methods to reliably measure tissue oxygenation in situ are currently lacking. We have developed a vertically oriented, dorsal, bipedicle flap model that is easy to perform, reliably reproduces tissue ischemia, eliminates craniocaudal variation, and is amenable to studying therapeutic modalities. The effect of narrowing this flap on tissue oxygenation measured with Licox electrodes has previously been presented. In this study we utilize in situ EPR spectroscopy to demonstrate the oxygen gradient in the flap as a function of flap width and placement of a silicone sheet directly under the flap. The effect of wound healing over a 2 week period is demonstrated. Twenty four, 300?gm male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the bipedicle flap according to the following groups: 2.5?cm flap with silicone, 2.0?cm flap without silicone, 2.0?cm flap with silicone. Each group of 6 animals was injected with EMS char at 2?cm intervals along the flap and one injection in the control, non-ischemic tissue. A 4th group underwent 2.0?cm flaps with silicone and use of lithium phthalocyanin as the paramagnetic material. Wound measurements and EPR spectroscopy were performed on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. On day 14, after EPR measurements, the animals were sacrificed and their wounds excised. One flap and one control wound were preserved for histologic analysis, the other flap and control wounds were prepared for lactate measurements. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated a gradient of oxygen that was lowest in the center of the flap and greatest at either end. Changes in the oxygen gradient correlated with narrowing and placement of the intervening silicone sheet. This new technology has never been utilized in an animal model of impaired wound healing. Comparison of recently developed paramagnetic materials for optimal tissue oxygen and free radical measurements will be presented.

AB  - Keloids are scars that overgrow the original boundaries of the injury, involving aberrant functioning of the fibroblasts. We have found that during normal wound healing the ELR-negative CXC chemokines IP-9 (CXCL11) and IP-10 (CXCL10) act to limit fibroblast immigration. Our initial goal was to determine if keloid fibroblasts failed to respond to this ?stop? signal. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical studies on keloid fibroblasts show that these lesions express excessive amounts of IP-9 and CXCR3 receptor. The protein levels of CXCR3 receptor was also not dissimilar between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Though, the expression of the protein and the receptor seems to be normal, the fibroblasts derived from these abnormal lesions did not respond to IP-9 during EGF induced cell migration. We have extended these findings to determine whether other genes are differentially expressed by keloid fibroblasts. The immediate first gene that interest us was the mRNA levels of CXCR3 receptor (GPR9) wherein, we did not find any significant difference between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Further, we also found interestingly, that genes related to tumor progression are up regulated in keloid fibroblasts than the normal fibroblasts. The marker genes like calgranulin, BCL-2 associated anthogen 4 (BAG4), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Certain transcription factors like GATA-6 and SpiB are also increased. Apart, the classical growth factor and growth factor receptor related genes which includes, bone morphogenetic protein BMP-1, heparin binding EGF like growth factor, EGF like repeats discoidin1, IGFBP-5 and 3, EphB1&B2, tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, serine threonine kinase 6 along with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan brevican and versican and vitronectin are also up regulated. The newl identified genes will open new avenues in targeting keloid lesions by understanding the basic signaling mechanism of these specific proteins.

AB  - Calreticulin (CRT) is a major classic Ca-binding chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, CRT has been recognized to have widespread extracellular effects as well. In the current study we show that CRT increases both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of porcine and murine wound repair. Partial thickness wounds were created on the paravertebral area of pigs (n?=?4) and 0.1% and 0.5% CRT, and PDGF (positive control) applied for 4 consecutive days. In wounds harvested at 5 days, CRT induced a 28 and 22% greater extent of reepithelialization than PDGF and Tris/Ca buffer control, respectively (% healed?=?56/CRT; 40.5/PDGF; 44/control). In addition, CRT stimulated earlier granulation tissue formation in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative dermal depth, microns: 1615/CRT; 1250/PDGF; 1325/control). A similar granulation tissue inducing effect of CRT was also observed in a steroid-impaired pig model. As a diabetic model of wound repair, two 5?mm circular full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db mice; the wounds were splinted open with silicone rings and covered with occlusive dressing (n?=?24). After 5 days of treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 5% CRT, a dose-dependent 8-, 4.5-, and 2-fold increase in granulation tissue formation was observed (p?<?0.05). However, there was no apparent effect on wound closure. Tissue sections showed a highly cellular dermis in the CRT treated wounds. In addition, CRT (50?pg/ml) stimulated wound closure in a scratch plate assay using fibroblasts by 45%, in 48?hrs, compared to 2% for the control. Therefore, CRT may be a novel agent for wound healing by acting as a chemoattractant for cells involved in wound remodeling and in epithelial migration. Suppported by Calretex, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: We hypothesize that interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) blockade with IL-6r antibody will increase matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) production in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, MMP-3 protein levels were measured in fibroblasts cultured from normal skin and hypertrophic scar with and without IL-6 receptor blockade. Methods: Primary cell cultures of normal skin (NSF) and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HTS) were obtained from the same patient (n?=?5) and seeded into 6 well plates (40,000?cells/cm2) in complete media. Cells were treated with and without IL-6 receptor antibody and IgG (10?ng/ml) for 6 hours. Protein concentrations of MMP-3 are determined in equal volume of supernatants by ELISA. Statistical analysis was by unpaired t-test(*P?<?0.05). Results: Blocking IL-6 receptors with its antibody showed significant increase in MMP-3 protein concentration in HTS compared to NSF. MMP-3(ng/ml) MMP-3(ng/ml) NSF 1.6?±?0.13 HTS 0.7?±?0.37 NSF?+?IL-6r 0.3?±?0.15 HTS?+?IL-6r 2.3?±?0.5* NSF?+?IgG 0.26?±?0.16 HTS?+?IgG 0.75?±?0.14 Conclusion: IL-6 receptor mediated signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar formation and its blockade may reduce hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Biocompatible matrices, such as bovine collagen, have demonstrated usefulness in delivering gene therapy vectors that express growth factors to local environments for tissue repair. Unlike animal derived matrices, we have developed a new synthetic matrix consisting of a linear cyclodextrin-polyethyleneglycol co-polymer that is non-covalently cross-linked with di-adamantane-polyethyleneglycol via inclusion complex formation between adamantane and cyclodextrin (CD-Ada). We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments for biocompatibility and localized transgene expression using a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector containing either the reporter gene, GFP, or the therapeutic gene, PDGF-B. In vitro results demonstrated cell migration, adenoviral transduction, and gene expression with no visible signs of toxicity in human skin fibroblasts. Qualitative gene expression from the CD-Ada containing rAd was delayed by approximately two days when compared to collagen, but the level of expression was greater over a longer period of time. In vivo experiments demonstrated gene expression after local delivery to mouse skin using rAd-GFP in CD-Ada. Again, the expression was slightly delayed but duration of expression was comparable to collagen. Expression studies using rAd-PDGF-B, were performed in the rat polyvinyl alcohol sponge model and showed comparable quantitative DNA and RNA levels between CD-Ada and collagen (DNA: 4.1???1010 and 4.5???1010 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively; RNA: 7.0???108 and 3.2???108 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively). Additionally, we explored the use of plasmid DNA with the CD-Ada matrix and observed PDGF-B expression in vivo. Our results show that this new delivery system provides a safe, efficient, and adaptable medium for both viral and non-viral gene delivery.

AB  - Fibrin Sealant products such as TisseelR have been used over the last 25 years to reach hemostasis during surgery or to seal tissues. Moreover, there were many studies on the use of fibrin sealant in cell and bioactive substance delivery. Our In Vitro and In Vivo studies, over the last 2 years, have focused on the use of fibrin sealant to deliver human fibroblasts or keratinocytes to overcome the healing deficiency in chronic wounds. We have shown that some fibrin formulations supported a high fibroblast proliferation and other fibrin formulations supported a high proliferation of human keratinocytes. In this study, we examined the use of fibrin sealant in the co-delivery of both human ? derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study report examined the cell proliferation of these two cell types in various formulations of fibrin sealant. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mixed with various dilutions of the Sealer Protein solution and added to culture plates before adding the Thrombin solution to form fibrin clots containing both cell types. We found that a low to medium sealer protein concentration (1?34?mG/mL) and a very low thrombin concentration (1?U/mL) in the final fibrin clots provided for an optimal cell proliferation for both cell types within these fibrin clots. This profile of proliferation was different from that seen when keratinocytes alone or fibroblasts alone were incorporated in the fibrin clots. Morphologically, it was difficult to determine the cell type from examining cell morphology, thus, it was difficult to determine the cell distribution. In conclusion, we found that various modified formulations of fibrin sealant may be chosen when co- delivering fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, there seems to be a positive feedback between keratinocytes and fibroblasts when they were co ? introduced in the fibrin clots. This feedback could be carried by growth factors. Future studies will determine his signaling process.

AB  - Composition and structure determine the fate of biomaterials in the body, encouraging or discouraging acceptance, cellular infiltration, and degradation or incorporation into host tissue. Most biomaterials research has been focused on composition, while structure remains a relatively uninvestigated factor in biomaterial success. Naturally derived biomaterials may provide optimal structure for cellular repopulation in certain applications. Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix used in the clinical treatment of soft tissue injury, including pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. SIS consists primarily of collagen, although the presence of other proteins, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans has been reported. SEM was used to characterize the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Cryo-SEM was used to image mechanically isolated, oxidatively disinfected, lyophilized, sterilized, and rehydrated SIS. The fractured cross-sectional faces of intact intestine, oxidatively disinfected SIS, and lyophilized SIS were imaged with traditional SEM. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that SIS is a heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. There are differences in the structure of the mucosal and serosal surfaces. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse and delamination following lyophilization, much of the native structure is preserved. These changes are preserved following rehydration. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture-clearly facilitates host interaction on thecellular and subcellular levels.

AB  - Although electrical stimulation (ES) has been successful in the treatment of various types of wounds, the popularity of the treatment has waned due to a lack of optimal methods of administration. The goal of this study has been to develop and evaluate a method of delivering ES that is easy to use and suitable for delivery in a home-health environment.[0] Specifically, a novel bandage system developed to provide an electric field in a manner resembling the natural wound current was tested in vivo. In this study, a full-thickness wound model in New Zealand white rabbits was used to measure the effects of such a bandage system on healing of [0]skin defects. Different levels of current were evaluated initially, with 50 and 20??A selected for the focus of this study, along with a non-stimulated control. Using histomorphometry healing rates, cellularity, and blood vessels were quantified at one and two week time points. The study showed the ability of this ES bandage to speed the healing process. An increase in overall healing rate over non-stimulated wounds of 45%(p?=?0.04) was observed in wounds stimulated with 50??A of current for 1 week. In wounds treated for 2 weeks, contraction rate decreased as well as the ratio of contraction rate to epithelialization rate. The stimulated wounds also showed an increase in the amount of macrophages, with a 79% increase in number of macrophages in wounds stimulated with 20??A for 2 weeks and a 198% increase in macrophages in those stimulated with 50??A compared to non-stimulated wounds. The performance of the bandage in the animal model has led to a limited clinical study on pressure ulcer patients using the 50??A system.

AB  - Identifying molecular loci of impaired cutaneous healing in diabetes with an eye towards developing targeted therapy to ameliorate dysrepair continues to evolve as a promising area of study. By using an excisional wound model produced on the dorsum of female diabetic C57BL/KsJ db?+?/db+ mice as well as their normal (WT)  2)Adnull vector; 3)PBS. Postoperatively, wounds were examined & photographed on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 & 28. Also, tissue was harvested for histology & immunohistochemistry (PECAM), and snap frozen for protein & RNA analysis. A scoring system was used to grade re-epithelialization, granulation tissue thickness, matrix density, inflammation, vascular density, epithelial maturity. AAV-VEGF exerted minimal effect on repair in WT and HZ mice. However, pronounced neovascularization, thickened granulation tissue & increased matrix deposition was noted after VEGF treatment in the db/db mice compared to those that received PBS or adnull vector at all timepoints. While the induction of angiogenesis in VEGF treated db/db mice lagged behind the unimpaired mice by 5?7 days, a global improvement in wound healng was observed.

AB  - Stem cell-based tissue engineering provides a prospective strategy to bone tissue repair. Bone tissue repair begins at the recruitment and directional movement of stem cells, and ultimately achieved on the directional differentiation of stem cells. The migration and differentiation of stem cells are regulated by nucleoskeletal stiffness. Mechanical properties of lamin A/C contribute to the nucleoskeletal stiffness and consequently to the regulation of cell migration and differentiation. Nuclear lamin A/C determines cell migration through the regulation of nucleoskeletal stiffness and rigidity and involve in nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling. Moreover, lamin A/C is the essential core module regulating stem cell differentiation. The cells with higher migration ability tend to have enhanced differentiation potential, while the optimum amount of lamin A/C in migration and differentiation of MSCs is in conflict. This contrary phenomenon may be the result of mechanical microenvironment modulation.

AB  - Abstract Background Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protects the lung from sepsis-induced injury through activating Nrf2-regulated multiple phase 2 detoxification genes, including NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO1). Based on the positive effect of Sirtuin 6 on Nrf2, we aim to explore the potential role of SIRT6 in the mechanism of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Mouse models of sepsis were constructed by instilling intratracheal of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4?ml/kg). After 48-hour treatment, lung tissues were collected to measure the degree of lung injury. The SIRT6, siSIRT6, and siNrf2 plasmids were cotransfected into various concentrations of LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50??g/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1 was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results Lung tissues in the model group already had basic characteristics of ALI. Compared with the control model, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were much higher (P?<?0.01), the levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, and Nrf2-modulated detoxification factors were downregulated (P?<?0.01). SIRT6 overexpression decreased the apoptosis below to 10% (P?<?0.01), significantly increased the Nrf2 expression, effectively inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 releases, and enhanced NQO1 and HO1 levels (P?<?0.01). siNrf2 abolished the protective effects of SIRT6 overexpression, including increasing apoptosis and inhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes expressions (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Our study suggested SIRT6 positively regulated Nrf2 expression and activated Nrf2-regulated anti-inflammatory and antioxidative enzymes, which could effectively mitigate LPS-induced HUVECs inflammatory responses. This might reflect the mechanism of ALI induced by sepsis.
