AB  - Summary This chapter addresses common neurologic disorders related to specific bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It describes pathogens to which the elderly patient is more susceptible, along with specific differential diagnostic considerations in this patient population. In addition, the chapter discusses appropriate treatments and toxicities to which the elderly patient is more susceptible. An anatomopathologic approach is employed to facilitate syndrome recognition and differential diagnosis generation. The chapter talks about pathogen-specific immune responses because clinical manifestations of nervous system infections reflect complex interactions between specific pathogens and the immune system. Finally, it reviews immunosenescence (age-related changes in immune function) both generally and in the central nervous system (CNS) specifically.

AB  - Abstract ?? Introduction -? Models of sepsis -? Evidence for complement activation in sepsis -? Protective effects of C5a generated in limited amounts -? Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Fever is a fundamental response to infection and a hallmark of inflammatory disease, which has been conserved and shaped through millions of years of natural selection. Although fever is able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, the very nature of all the molecular thermosensors, the timing and the detailed mechanisms translating a physical trigger into a fundamental biological response are incompletely understood. Here we discuss the consequence of hyperthermic stress in dendritic cells (DCs), and how the sole physical input is sensed as an alert stimulus triggering a complex transition in a very narrow temporal window. Importantly, we review recent findings demonstrating the significant and specific changes discovered in gene expression and in the metabolic phenotype associated with hyperthermia in DCs. Furthermore, we discuss the results that support a model based on a thermally induced autocrine signalling, which rewires and sets a metabolism checkpoint linked to immune activation of dendritic cells. Importantly, in this context, we highlight the novel regulatory functions discovered for IGFBP-6 protein: induction of chemotaxis; capacity to increase oxidative burst and degranulation of neutrophils, ability to induce metabolic changes in DCs. Finally, we discuss the role of IGFBP-6 in autoimmune disease and how novel mechanistic insights could lead to exploit thermal stress-related mechanisms in the context of cancer therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic wounds often result from prolonged inflammation involving excessive polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity. Studies show that the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in fish oils generate bioactive lipid mediators that reduce inflammation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment in numerous inflammatory disease models. This study's purpose was to test the hypotheses that boosting plasma levels of EPA and DHA with oral supplementation would alter lipid mediator levels in acute wound microenvironments and reduce polymorphonuclear leukocyte levels. Eighteen individuals were randomized to 28 days of either EPA+DHA supplementation (Active Group) or placebo. After 28 days, the Active Group had significantly higher plasma levels of EPA (p<0.001) and DHA (p<0.001) than the Placebo Group and significantly lower wound fluid levels of two 15-lipoxygenase products of ?-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [p=0.033] and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid [p=0.006]), at 24 hours postwounding. The Active Group also had lower mean levels of myeloperoxidase, a leukocyte marker, at 12 hours and significantly more reepithelialization on Day 5 postwounding. We suggest that lipid mediator profiles can be manipulated by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid intake to create a wound microenvironment more conducive to healing.

AB  - Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) adversely affects more or less all immune competent cells. Nonspecific immunity is impaired, particularly adherence and chemotaxis of phagocytes, although the responsiveness of circulating cells may not be the same as that of noncirculating cells. PCM results in numerical and functional impairment in lymphocytes. PCM markedly affects IgG class antibodies which have the highest affinity when directed against T-dependent antigens. These impairments are interrelated, since cooperation between T-helper cell and B-cells is depressed, and the antigen presentation to T-helper cells by macrophages is deficient.
