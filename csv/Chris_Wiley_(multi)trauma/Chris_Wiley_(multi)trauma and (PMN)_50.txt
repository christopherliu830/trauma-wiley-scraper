AB  - Background:? Clinical and animal data indicate that gut-derived endotoxin and other luminal bacterial products are necessary cofactors for development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Although gut leakiness is clearly an important cause of endotoxemia in ALD, it cannot fully explain endotoxemia in all ALD subjects and thus other factors may be involved. One possible factor is a change in gut microbiota composition (dysbiosis). Thus, the aim of our study was to interrogate the gut bacterial microbiota in alcohol-fed rats to see if chronic alcohol consumption affects gut bacteria composition. Method:? Male Sprague?Dawley rats were given either alcohol or dextrose intragastrically by gavage twice daily for up to 10?weeks. A subgroup of rats was also given either a probiotic (lactobacillus GG) or a prebiotic (oats) by gavage. Ileal and colonic mucosal-attached microbiota composition were interrogated by Length Heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) fingerprinting. Results:? Bacterial microbiota composition in alcohol-fed rats is not different from dextrose-fed rats at weeks 4 and 6. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition in the colon is altered at 10?weeks of daily alcohol gavage. Both LGG and oats prevented alcohol-induced dysbiosis up to 10?weeks of alcohol treatment. Conclusion:? Daily alcohol consumption for 10?weeks alters colonic mucosa-associated bacterial microbiota composition in rats. Our data showed, for the first time, that daily alcohol consumption can affect colonic microbiome composition and suggest that dysbiosis may be an important mechanism of alcohol-induced endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to determine how dysbiotic microbiota contributes to development of ALD and whether therapeutic interventions targeted towards dysbiotic microbiota can prevent complications of alcoholism like ALD.

AB  - Summary The present study describes the prevalence of haematological and electrophoretic changes consistent with the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats without FIP living in six multicat environments with different prevalence of FIP and of other diseases. The results allow designing haematological and electrophoretic profiles typical of each group, most likely depending on the management and on the health status of the group rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, many cats from the colonies with open management and frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases other than FIP had one or more haematological and/or electrophoretical changes consistent with FIP, compared with the reference ranges. In the case of non-specific clinical signs such as fever or neurological signs because of diseases other than FIP, these cats would be erroneously considered as affected by FIP and euthanasized. The use of internal ranges designed on the basis of repeated samplings from non-symptomatic cats allows avoiding these misinterpretations. Results from cats with symptoms consistent with FIP living in the same colonies were also compared with both the reference ranges and the internal ones: such a comparison demonstrated that the use of internal ranges rarely affected the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP.

AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing cells that generate the major cell types of the central nervous system, namely neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, during embryonic development and in the adult brain. NSCs reside in a complex niche where they are exposed to a plethora of signals, including both soluble and physical signals such as compressive and shear stresses, but also discontinuities and differences in morphology of the extracellular environment, termed as topographical features. Different approaches that incorporate artificial micro- and nano-scale surface topographical features have been developed aiming to recapitulate the in vivo NSC niche discontinuities and features, particularly for in vitro studies. The present review article aims at reviewing the existing body of literature on the use of artificial micro- and nano-topographical features to control NSCs orientation and differentiation into neuronal and/or neuroglial lineage. The different approaches on the study of the underlying mechanism of the topography-guided NSC responses are additionally revised and discussed.

Abstract Aims: We investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. Material and Methods: Twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. We recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 (the ?induction phase?), and at Day 21, Day 25, Day 30 and Day 35 in the other half (the ?resolution phase?). RNA was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus2.0 microarrays. Paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. Gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. Results: The median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at Day 21 and 1 at Day 35. Differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. Leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. Conclusions: Transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis.
