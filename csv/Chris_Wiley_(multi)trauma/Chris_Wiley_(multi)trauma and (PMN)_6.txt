AB  - Background: The present study evaluated the efficacy of controlledrelease delivery of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) on clinical parameters and on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 levels in chronic periodontitis patients. Methods: Twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were screened for 6 months. Two interproximal sites were selected from mesial surfaces of anterior teeth with probing depths of 6 to 8 mm that bled on probing in each patient. There were at least 2 teeth between the selected sites. CHX chip was inserted into a randomly selected site following scaling and root planing (SRP+CHX), while the other selected site received only SRP in each patient. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), and papilla bleeding index (PBI) were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. GCF MMP-8 levels were analyzed at baseline; 2 and 10 days; and at 1, 3, and 6 months by immunofluorometric assay (IFMA). Results: At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean PD, CAL, PBI, and PI scores between SRP+CHX and SRP alone groups. At 1, 3, and 6 months, all clinical parameters in each group significantly decreased (P <0.0167) when compared to baseline. The reduction of PD and improvement in CAL were higher in the SRP+CHX group compared to SRP alone at 3 and 6 months. However, the differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. PBI and PI scores were not significantly different between SRP+CHX and SRP alone groups at any visit. GCF MMP-8 levels were similar in both groups at baseline. Intragroup analysis showed significant decreases in the GCF MMP-8 level for the SRP+CHX group between baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months (P <0.01). Intergroup analysis demonstrated significantly lower mean levels of GCF MMP-8 at 1 month in the SRP+CHX group compared to the SRP alone group (P <0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that CHX chip application following SRP is beneficial in improving periodontal parameters and reducing GCF MMP-8 levels for 6 months' duration. The use of a chairside MMP-8 dipstick periodontitis test might be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool when monitoring the course of CHX chip treatment. J Periodontol 2002;73:608-615.

AB  - Abstract Background Previous studies document the therapeutic potential of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) carrier for indications in the axial and appendicular skeleton. Nevertheless, the ACS does not comprise structural integrity to adequately support bone formation for onlay indications. The objective of this study was to evaluate local bone formation and osseointegration following surgical implantation of rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto a compression resistant matrix (CRM). Methods Routine, contralateral, critical-size, supraalveolar, peri-implant defects in five adult male Hound Labrador mongrel dogs received 0.8 mg rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto either the ACS (benchmark control) or a CRM (collagen/?-TCP/hydroxyapatite) followed by submerged wound closure for primary intention healing. The animals were euthanized at 8 weeks for histologic/histometric evaluation. Results Healing was uneventful albeit considerable initial swelling was observed for either treatment. Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed significantly increased bone area (20.0 ± 0.9 versus 12.3 ± 2.6 mm2, p = 0.03) and bone density (24.1 ± 1.4% versus 14.6 ± 2.0%, p = 0.04) compared with those receiving rhBMP-2/ACS. There were no significant differences between treatments for new bone height and osseointegration. Woven and lamellar trabecular bone lined with abundant osteoid was observed for all sites. Inconsistent cortex formation confirmed the immature nature of the newly formed bone. Seroma formation was observed for both treatments (80?100% of the animals/implants). Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed residual ceramic granules undergoing biodegradation, including accumulation of foamy macrophages. Conclusions rhBMP-2/CRM supports bone formation of clinically relevant geometry. Longer observation intervals as well as dose variations appear necessary to capture maturation of the newly formed bone, elimination of residual ceramic granules and resolution of seroma formation(s).

AB  - Abstract:? The cornea epithelium responds to injury by synthesizing several cytokines, growth factors, and tissue remodeling molecules. Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the inflammation that follows corneal epithelial injury and cytokine-mediated processes play a significant role in corneal epithelial wound healing. Poorly regulated corneal inflammatory reactions that occur after injury can retard healing. In turn, persistent corneal epithelial defects and inflammation may lead to ocular morbidity and permanent visual loss. Therefore, treatments with agents that enhance corneal reepithelialization and regulate the inflammatory response without the deleterious side effects of currently used agents, such as corticosteroids, would result in improved clinical outcome and would represent a major advance in the field. Evidence is mounting to support the idea that thymosin ?-4 (T?-4) has multiple, seemingly diverse, cellular functions. In the cornea, as in other tissues, T?-4 promotes cell migration and wound healing, has anti-inflammatory properties, and suppresses apoptosis. Prior studies from our laboratory have demonstrated the potent wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects of T?-4 in numerous models of corneal injury. Recently, we demonstrated that T?-4 suppresses the activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-?B) in TNF-α-stimulated cells. TNF-α initiates cell signaling pathways that converge on the activation of NF-?B, thus both are known mediators of the inflammatory process. These results have important clinical implications for the potential role of T?-4 as a corneal anti-inflammatory and wound-healing agent.
