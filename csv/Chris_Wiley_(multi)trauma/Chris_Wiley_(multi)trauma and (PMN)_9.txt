AB  - Summary The high mortality in neonatal sepsis has been related to both quantitative and qualitative differences in host protective immunity. Pretreatment strategies to prevent sepsis have received inadequate consideration, especially in the premature neonate, where outcomes from sepsis are so dismal. Aluminium salts-based adjuvants (alum) are used currently in many paediatric vaccines, but their use as an innate immune stimulant alone has not been well studied. We asked whether pretreatment with alum adjuvant alone could improve outcome and host innate immunity in neonatal mice given polymicrobial sepsis. Subcutaneous alum pretreatment improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis in both wild-type and T and B cell-deficient neonatal mice, but not in caspase-1/11 null mice. Moreover, alum increases peritoneal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis, and decreases bacterial colonization in the peritoneum. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from alum-pretreated neonates produce more neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and exhibit increased expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) after in-vitro stimulation with phorbol esters. In addition, alum pretreatment increases bone marrow and splenic haematopoietic stem cell expansion following sepsis. Pretreatment of neonatal mice with an alum-based adjuvant can stimulate multiple innate immune cell functions and improve survival. These novel findings suggest a therapeutic pathway for the use of existing alum-based adjuvants for preventing sepsis in premature infants.

AB  - Abstract Background: High levels of endotoxin in patients with cirrhosis are thought to be responsible for the activation of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF)-α-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways involved in haemodynamic alterations. Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) is a protein found in neutrophils with endotoxin-binding and neutralization capacity. It is not known whether defective BPI production or release is present in cirrhosis. Aims: We investigated the levels of BPI in cirrhotic patients and its relation to other endotoxin-binding proteins and inflammatory markers. Methods: Plasmatic levels of BPI, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, soluble CD14, TNF-α and BPI mRNA expression in neutrophils were determined in 130 patients and 30 healthy controls. The capacity of patients' plasma to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated TNF-α production by monocytes from healthy donors was assessed in vitro. Results: Patients with cirrhosis exhibited an increase in BPI mRNA and plasma level of BPI when compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Child C group displayed the highest frequency of patients with a high concentration of BPI. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and plasma levels of BPI (P<0.01). High levels of BPI in plasma were able to significantly reduce in vitro TNF-α release by monocytes after a challenge with LPS (8.54 ± 1.04 vs. 10.44 ± 0.85?pg/ml, P=0.028). Conclusion: BPI is increased in cirrhotic patients, especially in those with more severe liver disease. The amount of BPI in the plasma correlated with the TNF-α level and was able to reduce LPS-mediated TNF production by monocytes. BPI possibly plays a regulatory role by antagonizing the pro-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by TNF-α.

AB  - Summary The evidence base for diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal infections has become stronger in the last years with publication of a substantial number of new articles. This chapter covers three of the most important entities of musculoskeletal infection: septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), and osteomyelitis. It presents background, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of septic arthritis, PJI and osteomyelitis. The chapter also presents some case examples. In native joints, septic arthritis is most commonly caused by hematogenous seeding of microorganisms from a distant infection focus. PJI represents an important complication, associated with high morbidity, need for complex treatment and substantial healthcare costs. Osteitis describes infection affecting only cortical bone; osteomyelitis implies that the cortex and medulla are involved. Osteomyelitis is classified by the route of infection. In contrast to acute osteomyelitis, chronic osteomyelitis and osteosynthesis-associated infections are unlikely to be eradicated without surgical treatment.

AB  - Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers, EV have beneficial effects, as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium (EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells (EV release).

AB  - Printable electronics present a new era of wearable electronic technologies. Detailed technologies consisting of novel ink semiconductor materials, flexible substrates, and unique processing methods can be integrated to create flexible sensors. To detect various stimuli of the human body, as well as specific environments, unique electronic devices formed by ?ink-based semiconductors? onto flexible and/or stretchable substrates have become a major research trend in recent years. Materials such as inorganic, organic, and hybrid semiconductors with various structures (i.e., 1D, 2D and 3D) with printing capabilities have been considered for bio and medical applications. In this review, we report recent progress in materials and devices for future wearable sensor technologies.
