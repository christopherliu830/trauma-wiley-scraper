AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Background: Blunt thoracic trauma is a major concern in critically ill patients. Repeated lung diagnostic evaluations are needed in order to follow up the clinical situation and the results of the therapeutic strategies. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) compared with bedside radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) used as the gold standard in the evaluation of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Method: A total of 15 thoracic trauma patients were studied at intensive care unit (ICU) arrival (T1) and 48?h later (T2) with CT, CXR and LU. We evaluated the presence of pleural effusion (PE) and lung contusion (LC). For this purpose the lung parenchyma was divided into 12 regions so that we could compare 180 lung regions at T1 and T2, respectively. Results: Sensitivity of ultrasound was 0.94 for PE and 0.86 for LC while specificity 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. The likelihood ratio was 94 (?+) and 0.06 (??) for PE and 28.6 (?+) and 0.14 (??) for LC. Conclusions: Ultrasound provides a reliable noninvasive, bedside method for the assessment of chest trauma patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU.

AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - Summary The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The survey was supported by a grant from the Petplan Charitable Trust. Boehringer Ingelheim assisted with survey distribution. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract Objective? The study aimed to investigate the effect of varying pulse lengths of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and 2.5?hours of continuous pulse-delivered iNO on pulmonary gas exchange in anaesthetized horses. Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Six Standardbred horses. Methods? Horses received acepromazine, detomidine, guaifenesin, thiopentone and isoflurane in oxygen, were positioned in dorsal recumbency and were breathing spontaneously. iNO was on average pulsed during the first 20, 30, 43 or 73% of the inspiration in 15?minute steps. The pulse length that corresponded to the highest (peak) partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) in the individual horses was determined and delivered for a further 1.5?hours. Data measured or calculated included arterial and mixed venous partial pressures of O2 and CO2, heart rate, respiratory rate, expired minute ventilation, pulmonary and systemic arterial mean pressures, cardiac output and venous admixture. Data (mean ± SD) was analysed using anova with p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Although the pulse length of iNO that corresponded to peak PaO2 varied between horses, administration of all pulse lengths of iNO increased PaO2 compared to baseline. The shortest pulse lengths that resulted in the peak PaO2 were 30 and 43% of the inspiration. Administration of iNO increased PaO2 (12.6?±?4.1?kPa [95?±?31 mmHg] at baseline to a range of 23.0?±?8.4 to 25.3?±?9.0?kPa [173 to 190?mmHg]) and PaCO2 (8.5?±?1.2?kPa [64?±?9?mmHg] to 9.8?±?1.5?kPa [73?±?11?mmHg]) and decreased venous admixture from 32?±?6% to 25?±?6%. The increase in PaO2 and decrease in venous admixture was sustained for the entire 2.5?hours of iNO delivery. Conclusions? The improvement in arterial oxygenation during pulsed delivery of iNO was significant and sustained throughout 2.5?hours of anaesthesia. Clinical relevance? Pulsed iNO potentially could be used clinically to counteract hypoxemia in anaesthetized horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the relationship between body mass and thoracic dimensions on arterial oxygen tensions (PaO2) in anaesthetized horses and ponies positioned in dorsal recumbency. Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Thirty six client-owned horses and ponies, mean [±SD (range)] age 8.1?±?4.8 (1.5?20) years and mean body mass 467?±?115 (203?656) kg. Methods? Before general anaesthesia, food and water were withheld for 12 and 1?hours respectively. Body mass (kg), height at the withers (H), thoracic circumference (C), thoracic depth (length between dorsal spinous process and sternum; D), thoracic width (between point of shoulders; W), and thoracic diagonal length (point of shoulder to last rib; L) were measured. Pre-anaesthetic medication was with intravenous (IV) romifidine (0.1?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was induced with an IV ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1) and diazepam (0.05 mg?kg?1) combination and maintained with halothane in 1:1 oxygen:nitrous oxide (N2O) mixture. Animals were positioned in dorsal recumbency and allowed to breathe spontaneously. Nitrous oxide was discontinued after 10?minutes, and arterial blood samples obtained and analysed for gas tensions at 15, 30 and 60?minutes after connection to the anaesthetic breathing circuit. Data were analysed using anova and Pearson?s correlation co-efficient. Results? The height per unit body mass (H kg?1) and thoracic circumference per unit body mass (C kg?1) correlated strongly (r?=?0.85, p?<?0.001 and r?= 0.82, p?<?0.001 respectively) with arterial oxygen tensions (PaO2) at 15?minutes. Conclusions? There is a strong positive correlation between H kg?1 and C kg?1 and PaO2 after 15?minutes of anaesthesia in halothane-anaesthetized horses positioned in dorsal recumbency. Clinical relevance? Readily obtained linear measurements (height and thoracic circumference) and body mass may be used to predict the ability of horses to oxygenate during anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current recommendations for the care of the seriously injured polytraumatized small animal patient, including team organization and facility readiness; scene assessment and care; transport; and hospital assessment and care. Data sources: Original research articles, scientific reviews, book chapters, and clinical experience. Human data synthesis: The care of the seriously injured patient is demanding and requires adequate preparation, rapid access to organized resources and equipment, and skilled personnel. Second in urgency only to stabilization of the airway and breathing is shock. In many, surgical intervention to provide improved and continued stability is required. Evidence is provided by data published comparing survival for humans with high injury scores being cared for at level I trauma centers compared with small rural hospitals. Personal experience as a member of an emergency medical team in the care of multiple injured human patients in both level I trauma centers and small hospitals is also used in this review. Veterinary data synthesis: Publications reporting large clinical series of seriously injured dogs and cats are minimal. Experimental animal models of shock caused by blood loss and the study of various organ injuries and their management are numerous. These and 35 years of the author's experience in managing severely injured dogs and cats (estimated to be >750) is also used in this review for generation of guidelines. Conclusions: Guidelines for care of severe multiple injury patients are presented and are recommended to be used in clinical veterinary medical practice to improve outcome.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare, ventilation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (RM) to classical IPPV without PEEP on gas exchange during anaesthesia and early recovery. Study design? Prospective randomized study. Animals? Twenty-four warm-blood horses, weight mean 548?±?SD 49?kg undergoing surgery for colic. Methods? Premedication, induction and maintenance (isoflurane in oxygen) were identical in all horses. Group C (n?=?12) was ventilated using conventional IPPV, inspiratory pressure (PIP) 35?45?cmH2O; group RM (n?=?12) using similar IPPV with constant PEEP (10?cmH2O) and intermittent RMs (three consecutive breaths PIP 60, 80 then 60?cmH2O, held for 10?12?seconds). RMs were applied as required to maintain arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) at >400?mmHg (53.3?kPa). Physiological parameters were recorded intraoperatively. Arterial blood gases were measured intra- and postoperatively. Recovery times and quality of recovery were measured or scored. Results? Statistically significant findings were that horses in group RM had an overall higher PaO2 (432?±?101?mmHg) than those in group C (187?±?112?mmHg) at all time points including during the early recovery period. Recovery time to standing position was significantly shorter in group RM (49.6?±?20.7?minutes) than group C (70.7?±?24.9). Other measured parameters did not differ significantly. The median (range) of number of RMs required to maintain PaO2 above 400?mmHg per anaesthetic was 3 (1?8). Conclusion? Ventilation using IPPV with constant PEEP and RM improved arterial oxygenation lasting into the early recovery period in conjunction with faster recovery of similar quality. However this ventilation mode was not able to open up the lung completely and to keep it open without repeated recruitment. Clinical relevance? This mode of ventilation may provide a clinically practicable method of improving oxygenation in anaesthetized horses.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Patients with severe, multiple, traumatic injuries are challenging to manage in critical care. Early identification of injuries and optimal resuscitation is essential for favourable outcomes. Trauma-related haemorrhage can lead to the lethal triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis. Many trauma patients require urgent haemorrhage control and structural fixation through operative intervention. However, metabolic derangement and cardiovascular instability may delay surgery, resulting in an ongoing cycle of deterioration. Damage control surgery (DCS) may be used as a temporizing measure until the patient is stabilized in critical care. The aim of this case study is to discuss the complex issues faced in the critical care management of a severely injured patient. Design We conducted a patient case study, with analysis of care using published evidence. The key terms used to search for evidence were trauma, injury, damage control surgery, spinal fixation, critical/intensive care and nurse. Results We report the care of a trauma patient with complex, conflicting injuries requiring management of the lethal triad and DCS. The delay in subsequent definitive repair of spinal column fractures provided many challenges for critical care nurses including restricted patient mobilization, positioning and pressure ulcer prevention. A review of contemporary evidence relating to DCS reveals that whilst this technique is used increasingly in trauma, the research focuses on single system injuries. Conclusion Evidence and guidelines are required to support DCS for critical care patients with multiple, conflicting injuries including spinal fractures. For patients with delayed surgical intervention, rotational bed therapy may assist critical care nurses in meeting needs.
