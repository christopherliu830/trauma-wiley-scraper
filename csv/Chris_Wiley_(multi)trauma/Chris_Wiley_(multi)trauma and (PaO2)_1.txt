AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the effects of two fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (0.4 and 1) on lung aeration and gas exchange during general anaesthesia in cats. Study design? Randomized, blinded, controlled study. Animals? Thirty healthy, mixed breed, client owned female cats. Materials and methods? Cats were premedicated intramuscularly with acepromazine (0.03?mg?kg?1) and medetomidine (0.015?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (5?mg?kg?1) and, after orotracheal intubation, maintained with isoflurane carried by either 100% oxygen (G100, n?=?15) or an oxygen-air mixture with 40% oxygen (G40, n?=?15). All cats were placed in dorsal recumbency and breathed spontaneously throughout the entire procedure. Following surgery (ovariectomy), a spiral computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was performed, arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) tensions were measured and alveolar?arterial gradient of oxygen [P(A?a)O2] calculated. The CT images were analysed for lung aeration by the analysis of radiograph attenuations (Hounsfield units, HU), according to the following classification: hyperinflated area (?1000 to ?900 HU), normally aerated area (?900 to ?500?HU), poorly aerated area (?500 to ?100?HU) and non-aerated area (?100 to +100?HU). The groups were compared using one-way anova. Results? Compared to G100, the normally-aerated lung area was significantly greater and the poorly-aerated and non-aerated areas were significantly smaller in G40. PaCO2 was similar in both groups. PaO2 and P(A?a)O2 were significantly higher in G100. In both groups, pulmonary atelectasis developed preferentially in the caudal lung fields. Conclusion? In cats anaesthetised with isoflurane, the administration of an FiO2 of >0.9 significantly impaired lung aeration and gas exchange as compared to an FiO2 of 0.4. Clinical relevance? An FiO2 of 0.4 may better preserve lung aeration and gas exchange in anaesthetised spontaneously breathing cats but monitoring is essential to ensure oxygenation is adequate.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of death and dismal outcome among children and young adults. The morbidity and mortality differ but more aggressive monitoring and more designated neuro intensive care units have improved the results. Studies have demonstrated a connection between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and outcome after TBI, but few are prospective and none is from northern Europe. APOE has three alleles: ?2, ?3 and ?4. Methods: A total of 96 patients with Glasgow coma score (GCS) ≤8 were prospectively and consecutively included. APOE genotypes were all analyzed at the same laboratory from blood samples by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: All patients were assessed at 1 year with Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Barthel daily living index. The genotype was available in all patients. Twenty-six patients expressed APOE ?4 while 70 patients did not. Outcome demonstrated that patients with APOE ?4 had worse outcome vs. those lacking this allele. When subdividing patients into gender, males with APOE ?4 did worse, a difference not detected among female patients. Conclusions: APOE ?4 correlated to worse outcome in TBI patients. We also found that males with APOE ?4 had poor outcome while females did not. Thus, the results indicate that genetic polymorphism may influence outcome after TBI.

AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the impact of a change in body position on blood gases and arterial blood pressures in foals anesthetized with guaifenesin, ketamine, and xylazine. Study design? Prospective, randomized experimental study. Animals? Twelve Quarter Horse foals, age of 5.4?±0.9?months and weighing 222?±?48?kg. Methods? Foals were anesthetized with guaifenesin, ketamine, and xylazine for 40?minutes in lateral recumbency and then assigned to a change in lateral recumbency after hoisting (Group 1, n?=?6), or no change (Group 2, n?=?6). Oxygen 15?L?minute?1 was insufflated into the endotracheal tube throughout anesthesia. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (fR), inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pe?CO2) were measured every 5?minutes. Arterial pH and blood gases [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)] were measured at 10, 30, and 40?minutes after induction, and 5?minutes after hoisting. Alveolar dead space ventilation and PaO2/FiO2 were calculated. Two repeated measures models were used. All hypothesis tests were two-sided and significance level was α?=?0.05. All values are presented as least square means?±?SE. Results? Values at time-matched points from the two groups were not significantly different so they were combined. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen decreased significantly from 149?±?14.4?mmHg before hoisting to 92?±?11.6?mmHg after hoisting (p?=?0.0013). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio decreased from 275?±?30 to 175?±?24 (p?=?0.0055). End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased significantly from 48.7?±?1.6 to 44.5?±?1.2?mmHg (p?=?0.021). Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, blood pressures and heart rates measured 5?minutes after hoisting were not different from measurements obtained before hoisting. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Hoisting decreased PaO2 in anesthetized healthy foals. Administration of supplemental oxygen is recommended to counter the decrease in oxygenation and PaO2 measurement is necessary to detect early changes.

AB  - Summary Background Administration of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (PiNO) improves arterial oxygenation in spontaneously breathing anaesthetised healthy horses and in horses undergoing colic surgery. However, because hypoventilation commonly occurs, horses are often mechanically ventilated to prevent hypercarbia. Objectives To evaluate the effects of PiNO on arterial oxygenation during anaesthesia in mechanically ventilated healthy horses and horses undergoing colic surgery. Study design Prospective nonblinded clinical trial. Methods Fifty horses undergoing elective arthroscopy (Group A) and 30 horses undergoing colic surgery (Group C) in dorsal recumbency were included in the study. Every second horse in each group received PiNO (A-INO, C-INO), the others served as controls (A-CN, C-CN). All horses were mechanically ventilated and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. PiNO was mechanically delivered at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube as a pulse during the first part of each inspiration. Data were collected at the start (baseline, before PiNO) and at the end of inhalation anaesthesia. The Tukey method was used to compare baseline and end values for each parameter. Results Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) increased from (median [IQR]) 13.6 (9.3, 30.1) at baseline to 24.2 (18.6, 37.0) kPa at the end of anaesthesia in A-INO (P = 0.005) and from 7.7 (6.4, 8.5) to 15.5 (9.9, 26.9) kPa in C-INO (P = 0.007). Mean (95% CI) difference in F-shunt between baseline and end were ?6 (?10; ?1) and ?11 (?22; ?1) % in A-INO (P = 0.005) and C-INO (P = 0.04) respectively. There was no change in PaO2 or F-shunt from baseline to end of anaesthesia in A-CN or C-CN. Main limitations Cardiac output was not measured, thus O2 delivery could not be calculated. Conclusions The combination of mechanical ventilation and PiNO improved pulmonary gas exchange during anaesthesia by a simultaneous decrease in F-shunt and improved alveolar ventilation.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the systematic ACCEPT approach enables movements of ill and injured patients between or within hospitals. Centralisation of specialist services means more transfers for clinical reasons. Many of these transfers will be time critical, some will be intensive, and some will be both. The chapter provides an overview of the patient groups that typically will need to be transferred to specialist centres, some of their characteristics and associated specific clinical management. Some of these broad categories of patients includes: neurosurgery (traumatic brain injury, cerebral bleeds), trauma, burns, vascular surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, acute limb ischaemia), interventional radiology, cardiology (primary coronary intervention), nephrology (acute renal failure), obstetric, and level 3 transfers. However, early and effective communication between centres is essential to ensure that any specific treatments are administered before or during the transfer to optimise patient care.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

Single lung transplantation and fatal fat embolism acquired from the donor: management and literature review.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 133?138. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Fat embolism (FE) is a consequence of skeletal trauma that occurs in more than 90% of cases of severe trauma. However, most of these emboli are clinically insignificant. We report the case of a 59-yr-old man with massive progressive fibrosis who died from widespread FE after a single-lung transplantation (SLT). The lung donor was a 22-yr-old woman who died from traumatic cerebral injury. She had sustained a closed fracture of the tibia, fibula and pelvis. The PaO2/FiO2 before procurement was 452?mmHg. A left SLT using cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. In the immediate postoperative period, profound pulmonary edema in the transplanted lung developed, with overinflation of the native lung and systemic hypotension. Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) was suspected and nitric oxide (NO) and independent lung ventilation (ILV) initiated. Over the next 24?h the patient?s condition deteriorated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. The patient died 45?h after transplantation as cardiovascular and respiratory function continued to decline and massive thoracic bleeding secondary to coagulopathy appeared. Post-mortem examination revealed both massive FE in the non-transplanted donor lung and in the allograft lung. Only two previous cases of donor-acquired FE and PGD after lung transplantation (LT) have been reported. Occult pulmonary FE in a traumatized donor should be considered a cause of PGD.

AB  - Summary This paper describes the initial clinical experience of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) at the Fondazione Ca? Granda in Milan between January 2011 and May 2013. EVLP was considered if donor PaO2/FiO2 was below 300 mmHg or if lung function was doubtful. Donors with massive lung contusion, aspiration, purulent secretions, pneumonia, or sepsis were excluded. EVLP was run with a low-flow, open atrium and low hematocrit technique. Thirty-five lung transplants from brain death donors were performed, seven of which after EVLP. EVLP donors were older (54 ± 9 years vs. 40 ± 15 years, EVLP versus Standard, P < 0.05), had lower PaO2/FiO2 (264 ± 78 mmHg vs. 453 ± 119 mmHg, P < 0.05), and more chest X-ray abnormalities (P < 0.05). EVLP recipients were more often admitted to intensive care unit as urgent cases (57% vs. 18%, P = 0.05); lung allocation score at transplantation was higher (79 [40?84] vs. 39 [36?46], P < 0.05). After transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD72 grade 3, 32% vs. 28%, EVLP versus Standard, P = 1), mortality at 30 days (0% vs. 0%, P = 1), and overall survival (71% vs. 86%, EVLP versus Standard P = 0.27) were not different between groups. EVLP enabled a 20% increase in available donor organs and resulted in successful transplants with lungs that would have otherwise been rejected (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01967953).

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric critical care. The Transfusion Requirements in Pediatric Intensive Care Units study randomized to either transfusion threshold 9.5?g/dL or 7?g/dL using leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC). Deaths, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), adverse events, ventilator days, and nosocomial infections were not significantly different in the two groups. When split into subgroups of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and pediatric general surgery patients, the restrictive PRBC transfusion strategy showed no increase in MODS. PRBC transfusions appear to be independently linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critically ill pediatric patients. Pediatric intensivists have recognized that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children is different from ARDS in adults. Recurrent hypotension in a pediatric trauma patient occurs late and may be an ominous sign.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on intrapulmonary shunt, cardiac output and oxygen delivery in horses subjected to a 6 hour period of general anaesthesia. Study design Randomized, experimental, crossover study. Animals Ten healthy adult horses. Methods Following medetomidine, diazepam and ketamine administration, orotracheal intubation was performed and horses positioned in dorsal recumbency. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane carried in an oxygen and air mix (FiO2 0.5) combined with a medetomidine infusion. Horses were anaesthetized twice and either CPAP (8 cmH2O) or physiologic airway pressure (NO CPAP) was applied to the lungs for 6 hours; the order of treatments was randomly assigned. Following induction of anaesthesia, cardiovascular and respiratory variables (including arterial blood gas analysis) were recorded every 30 minutes, cardiac output was measured every 60 minutes using the lithium dilution technique and oxygen delivery calculated. If PaCO2 exceeded 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), controlled ventilation was initiated and horses excluded from further data collection. Groups were compared using a general linear model. Results Data from eight horses were analysed. PaO2 was 15?56 mmHg (2.00?7.45 kPa) higher (p < 0.001) and shunt fraction 6?14% lower (p < 0.001) in the CPAP group. No differences were seen for cardiac output and oxygen delivery. The lack of difference in oxygen delivery was attributed to lower haemoglobin levels in the CPAP group than in the NO CPAP group. Conclusions and clinical relevance CPAP of 8 cmH2O can be used in dorsally recumbent horses to decrease pulmonary shunt fraction without causing a decrease in cardiac output during longterm anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Case 1 A two-year old, 462?kg Standard bred horse was anesthetized for arthroscopy and castration. During anesthesia, hyperemia of the mucosal membranes and urticaria were noticed. During 5?hours of anesthesia subcutaneous edema of the eyelids and neck region developed. In the recovery box, the orotracheal (OT) tube was left in situ and secured in place with tape. Following initial attempts to stand, the horse became highly agitated and signs consistent with pulmonary edema developed subsequently. Arterial hypoxemia (PaO2: 3.7?kPa [28?mmHg]) and hypocapnia (PaCO2: 3.1?kPa [23?mmHg]) were confirmed. Oxygen and furosemide were administered. The horse was assisted to standing with a sling. Therapy continued with bilateral intra-nasal oxygen insufflation. Ancillary medical therapy included flunixin meglumine, penicillin, gentamycin and dimethylsulfoxide. Following 7?hours of treatment the arterial oxygen tensions began to increase towards normal values. Case 2 An 11-year old, 528?kg Paint horse was anesthetized for surgery of a submandibular mass. The 4-hour anesthetic period was unremarkable. The OT tube was left in situ for the recovery. During recovery, the horse was slightly agitated and stood after three attempts. Clinical signs consistent with pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia (PaO2: 5?kPa [37.5?mmHg]) subsequently developed following extubation. Respiratory signs resolved with medical therapy, including unilateral nasal oxygen insufflation, furosemide, flunixin meglumine and dimethylsulfoxide. The diagnosis of pulmonary edema in these horses was made by clinical signs and arterial blood-gas analysis. While pulmonary radiographs were not taken to confirm the diagnosis, the clinical signs following anesthesia support the diagnosis in both cases. The etiology of pulmonary edema was most likely multifactorial.

AB  - Summary Despite a worldwide need to expand the lung donor pool, approximately 75% of lung offers are not accepted for transplantation. We investigated the impact of liberalizing lung donor acceptance criteria during the last decade on the number of effective transplants and early and late outcomes in our center. All 514 consecutive lung transplants (LTx) performed between Jan 2000 and Oct 2011 were included. Donors were classified as matching standard criteria (SCD; n = 159) or extended criteria (ECD; n = 272) in case they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: age >55 years, PaO2/FiO2 at PEEP 5 cmH2O < 300 mmHg at time of offer, presence of abnormalities on chest X-ray, smoking history, presence of aspiration, presence of chest trauma, or donation after circulatory death. Outcome parameters were primary graft dysfunction (PGD) grade at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after LTx, time to extubation, stay in intensive care unit (ICU), early and late infection, acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and survival. Two hundred and seventy-two recipients (63.1%) received ECD lungs. PGD grade at T0 was similar between groups, while at T12 (<0.01), T24 (<0.01), and T48 (<0.05), PGD3 was observed more often in ECDs. ICU stay (P < 0.05) was longer in ECDs compared with SCDs. Time to extubation, respiratory infections, acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, BOS, and survival were not different between groups. Accepting ECDs contributed in increasing the number of lung transplants performed in our center. Although this lung donor strategy has an impact on early postoperative outcome, liberalizing criteria did not influence long-term outcome after LTx.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine physiologic responses to apnea-induced severe hypoxemia in anesthetized horses. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six university-owned horses with a median (range) body weight of 500 (220?510) kg and aged 13.5 (0.8?24.0) years scheduled for euthanasia. Methods Xylazine?midazolam?ketamine-anesthetized horses breathing room air spontaneously were instrumented with a facial artery catheter for pressure measurement and blood sampling, and were made apneic with atlanto-occipital intrathecal lidocaine (4 mg kg?1). Cardiopulmonary, biochemical and hematologic variables were recorded before (baseline) and every minute for 10 minutes after lidocaine injection. Results PaO2 values were: baseline, 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa); 1 minute, 28 mmHg (3.8 kPa); 2 minutes, 18 mmHg (2.4 kPa); 3 minutes, 15 mmHg (2.0 kPa), and 4?10 minutes, (8?11 mmHg (1.1?1.5 kPa). PaCO2 values were: baseline, 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa); 1 minute, 61 mmHg (8.1 kPa), and 2?10 minutes, 64?66 mmHg (8.5?8.8 kPa). Base excess values at baseline, 1 minute and 2?10 minutes were 5.3 mmol L?1, 6.5 mmol L?1 and 7.0?8.1 mmol L?1, respectively. Pulse rates at baseline, 1 minute and 2?7 minutes were 36, 53 and 54?85 beats minute?1, respectively. Asystole occurred at 8 minutes. Pulse pressures were 50 mmHg at baseline and 1 minute, and 39 mmHg, 31 mmHg, 22 mmHg, 17 mmHg and 1?9 mmHg at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?10 minutes, respectively. Lactate was 0.9 mmol L?1 at baseline, progressively increasing to 1.7?2.4 mmol L?1 at 7?10 minutes. Packed cell volume increased after 7 minutes of apnea. There were no other major changes. Conclusions and clinical relevance Apnea immediately exacerbated hypoxemia and hypercapnia and rapidly caused hemodynamic instability. Apnea in hypoxemic anesthetized horses is associated with a serious risk for progress to cardiovascular collapse.

AB  - Abstract There are several determinants governing arterial and mixed venous blood PO2 and PCO2. Ventilation-perfusion imbalance, increased intrapulmonary shunt, and diffusion limitation to oxygen encompass the pulmonary factors. Alternatively, inspired oxygen concentration, overall ventilation, cardiac output, and oxygen consumption (uptake) are contemplated as the four most influential nonpulmonary determinants. All three pulmonary factors plus oxygen uptake cannot be directly modulated, but all the other remaining nonpulmonary determinants are. Inspired oxygen concentration, the amount and pattern of total ventilation, and cardiac output may be, at least in part, relatively well clinically controlled. Arterial PO2 (PaO2) may fall if inspired PO2, overall ventilation, and/or cardiac output decrease, and/or oxygen consumption increases, even though the pulmonary factors remain unchanged. Conversely, if inspired oxygen fraction, ventilation, and/or cardiac output increase, and/or oxygen consumption decreases, PaO2 may improve regardless of the changes operated at the level of the pulmonary determinants. Several pathophysiologic features deserve to be underlined. First, the importance of understanding the role played by mixed venous PO2 as a vital nonpulmonary determinant governing PaO2. Second, the response to 100% oxygen breathing repeatedly exhibits a consistent amount of agreement in the main findings. Third, there is always an interactive interplay between pulmonary and nonpulmonary determinants of PaO2 and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) in any respiratory disease state following the use of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic approaches. All in all both PaO2 and PaCO2 become the end-point outcomes of the complex interaction of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors modulating pulmonary gas exchange. This needs to be unraveled to improve the understanding and management of most acute and chronic respiratory disease states. ? 2014 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 4:1455-1494, 2014.

AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Summary Ventilation-perfusion relationships were studied by the multiple inert gas elimination technique in seven horses while they were conscious and during inhalation anaesthesia with halothane. A generally good match between ventilation and perfusion was found in the conscious, standing horse. During anaesthesia a huge shunt developed, ie perfusion of completely unventilated lung regions, both in dorsal and left lateral recumbency and whether the horse was breathing spontaneously or mechanically ventilated. The shunt was significantly greater and the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) significantly lower in dorsal than in left lateral recumbency. Little or no perfusion of low V?A/Q? regions was observed during anaesthesia, whether ventilation was spontaneous or mechanical. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) did not significantly improve PaO2 or reduce the shunt. Selective mechanical ventilation of dependent lung regions with PEEP reduced the shunt markedly, an effect that was not achieved by conventional mechanical ventilation with general PEEP. The findings seem compatible with alveolar collapse during anaesthesia, causing shunt, whereas the absence of clearly low V?A/Q? regions questions the role of airway closure as the major disturbance of gas exchange.

Long-term outcome and management of hepatopulmonary syndrome in children.?Pediatr Transplantation 2010:14:276?282. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? We aim to report a single center experience of the management and long term outcome of HPS in pediatric liver transplant recipients. A retrospective review of children with HPS from 1990 to 2004. Inclusion criteria: liver disease or portal hypertension, hypoxemia (PaO2?<?70?mmHg or SaO2?<?95%) and intrapulmonary shunting documented by macroaggregated albumin scan ratio of >4% (classified mild group [<20%], moderate group [20?40%] and severe group [>40%]). Resolution of HPS post-liver transplant was defined as PaO2?>?70?mmHg or SaO2?>?95%. Eighteen children (six male [34%], median age at diagnosis of HPS 8.6 [1?15.5] yr) had HPS: biliary atresia (n?=?8), idiopathic biliary cirrhosis (n?=?4), progressive intrahepatic cholestasis (n?=?2), miscellaneous (n?=?4). The majority had mild shunting (n?=?8). Fourteen underwent transplantation with resolution of HPS in 13. Six developed complications: hepatic artery thrombosis (n?=?4), biliary (n?=?2). Four children died (28%), two pretransplant. There was a tendency towards shunt fraction worsening to a slower degree over time. One-yr survival rate post-transplant was 93%. Median PaO2 was significantly lower in non-survivors compared to survivors (43 vs. 55.2?mmHg, p?=?0.03). There was correlation between oxygen parameters pretransplant and time to HPS resolution post-transplant. HPS is reversible after transplant, but is associated with increasing mortality and morbidity.
