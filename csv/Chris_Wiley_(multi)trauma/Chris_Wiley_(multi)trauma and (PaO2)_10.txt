AB  - Aims and objectives.? We aimed to synthesise evidence from published literature on non-invasive ventilation to inform nurses involved in the clinical management of non-invasive ventilation in the emergency department. Background.? Non-invasive ventilation is a form of ventilatory support that does not require endotracheal intubation and is used in the early management of acute respiratory failure in emergency departments. Safe delivery of this intervention requires a skilled team, educated and experienced in appropriate patient selection, available devices and monitoring priorities. Design.? Systematic review. Method.? A multi-database search was performed to identify works published in the English language between 1998?2008. Search terms included: non-invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure and emergency department. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review were identified and systematically applied. Results.? Terminology used to describe aspects of non-invasive ventilation is ambiguous. Two international guidelines inform the delivery of this intervention, however, much research has been undertaken since these publications. Strong evidence exists for non-invasive ventilation for patients with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Non-invasive ventilation may be delivered with various interfaces and modes; little evidence is available for the superiority of individual interfaces or modes. Conclusions.? Early use of non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute respiratory failure may reduce mortality and morbidity. Though international guidelines exist, specific recommendations to guide the selection of modes, settings or interfaces for various aetiologies are lacking due to the absence of empirical evidence. Relevance to clinical practice.? Monitoring of non-invasive ventilation should focus on assessment of response to treatment, respiratory and haemodynamic stability, patient comfort and presence of air leaks. Complications are related to mask-fit and high air flows; serious complications are few and occur infrequently. The use of non-invasive ventilation has resource implications that must be considered to provide effective and safe management in the emergency department.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? Many trace elements play important roles in activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, by competing with other elements and metalloproteins for binding sites, by affecting the permeability of cell membranes and by other mechanisms. They play important roles in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. As such, trace elements are thought to be involved directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect trace elements (Se, Mn and Zn) intravenously administered on the period the COPD patients spend on mechanical ventilation. Methods:? In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial a set of 120 subjects (40 normal volunteers and 80 COPD) were recruited. Serum concentration levels of Se, Mn and Zn were determined for all enrolled subjects with Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. COPD patients received intravenous supplementation of the above trace elements and the period the patients spent on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results:? There was a significant reduction (P?=?0.013) in the period the patients with COPD spent on the mechanical ventilation when received intravenous supplementation (9.4?±?7.3?days) compared with the COPD patients who received placebo (17.8?±?7.6?days). Conclusions:? Trace element (Se, Mn and Zn) status is altered in critically ill patients with COPD. The supplementation achieved a reduction in the period those patients spent on the mechanical ventilation. A larger multi-centre trial is required to confirm this preventive effect and to explore its applicability to other critical care conditions.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Background Post-anaesthetic sedation is administered to horses to improve recovery quality from inhalant anaesthesia and reduce the risk of catastrophic injury. A single dose of dexmedetomidine for this purpose has not been evaluated clinically. Objectives To determine whether dexmedetomidine improves recovery quality from sevoflurane anaesthesia compared to a previously studied dose of romifidine. Study design Prospective, randomised, masked clinical trial. Methods Ninety-nine, adult, client-owned horses anaesthetised for elective procedures completed the trial. Anaesthetic protocol was standardised. Horses were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg bwt (D) or romifidine 20 mcg/kg bwt (R) intravenously at their first spontaneous breath in recovery. Recoveries were reviewed and independently assigned subjective visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (0-100 mm, worst to best) for overall quality and standing ataxia scores (1-4, none to severe) by two anaesthesiologists blinded to treatment group. Objective anaesthesia and recovery data were also recorded. Comparisons were made using the Chi-square, Wilcoxon rank sum, linear models or Welch-Satterthwaite two-sample t-test (P ≤ .05). Predictors of VAS score were analysed independent of treatment group. Results There were no significant differences between groups except end-tidal sevoflurane (FE?Sevo) concentration and post-induction extra ketamine dosing. Including FE?Sevo and additional ketamine in the analysis as covariates, VAS scores and time to standing were not significantly different between groups. Increased age, not receiving a nerve block, increased duration of hypotension, and having a nervous temperament were significant predictors of VAS score. Main limitations No universal recovery scale exists for inter-study comparisons. Conclusions After sevoflurane anaesthesia, sedation with dexmedetomidine or romifidine provides clinically similar recovery time and quality.

AB  - Abstract History A 10-year old Arabian mare had a slow-growing mass on the lower right mandible and required a large partial mandibulectomy. Physical examination No abnormalities were detected apart from the mass. Management A temporary tracheostomy was performed pre-operatively. Anesthesia was induced with xylazine followed by ketamine and diazepam. For 13 hours, anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions, with the exception of surgical preparation time. Intra-operatively, ventilation was delivered through the cuffed tracheotomy tube. Heart and respiratory rates, ECG, arterial pressures, inspired and expired gases, pulse oximetry values and body temperature were monitored. Dobutamine and whole blood were necessary, and romifidine was used to control recovery. Post-operatively, phenylbutazone and buprenorphine given systemically and bupivacaine administered through a wound soaker catheter were used to provide analgesia. Head-shaking from buprenorphine was controlled with acepromazine and detomidine once standing after 87 minutes in recovery. For 3 days after surgery, analgesia was provided with butorphanol, phenylbutazone and bupivacaine. The mare recovered well, appeared comfortable and started eating the following day with no signs of ileus. Follow-up Seven months later, the mare was doing well. Conclusions Sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were suitable for a long and invasive procedure.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Objective To test the application of a clinical definition of severe acute maternal morbidity. Design A one-year prospective descriptive multi-centre study. Setting Kalafong and Pretoria Academic hospitals, catering for the delivery of indigent women in the Pretoria Health Region. Methods A ?near-miss? describes a patient with an acute organ system dysfunction, which if not treated appropriately, could result in death. The case notes of women fitting this definition and all maternal deaths were analysed and compared. Outcome measure Determine the primary obstetric factors and the organ systems that failed. Identification of episodes of sub-standard care and missed opportunities. Results One hundred and forty-seven near misses and 30 maternal deaths were identified. The commonest reasons for a near-miss were: emergency hysterectomy in 42 women (29%); severe hypotension in 40 (27%); and pulmonary oedema in 24 (16%). The most common initiating obstetric conditions were hypertension in 38 women (26%); haemorrhage in 38 (26%); and abortion or puerperal sepsis in 29 (20%). The primary obstetric factors amongst the maternal deaths were: hypertension (33%); sepsis (27%); and maternal medical diseases (17%) in 10, 8 and 5 women respectively. Sub-standard care was identified in 82 cases. Breakdown in the health care administration was identified in 33, and patient-orientated missed opportunities on 34 occasions. Conclusions The definition of severe acute maternal morbidity identified nearly five times as many cases as maternal death. This definition allows for an effective audit system of maternal care because it is clinically based, the definition is robust and the cases identified reflect the pattern of maternal death.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study tested the accuracy of resting energy expenditure (REE) equations among patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass and developed/validated a more accurate cardio-specific equation (CSE). Materials and Methods: Prospective observational cohort of 240 adults (derivation data set, 170 patients; validation data set, 70 patients). REEs were calculated with 6 equations?Penn State 2003a, Penn State 2003b, Ireton-Jones, Swinamer, Faisy, and American College of Chest Physicians?and results were compared with indirect calorimetry (IC). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to develop the CSE. Agreement between measured and calculated REEs was assessed with Lin?s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), Bland-Altman plot, and regression analysis. Results: LCCCs present poor agreement between measured and calculated REEs: 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19?0.29), for the Faisy equation; 0.15 (95% CI, 0.1?0.19), Ireton-Jones; 0.31 (95% CI, 0.25?0.37), Swinamer; 0.17 (95% CI, 0.13?0.21), Penn State 2003a; 0.19 (95% CI, 0.14?0.23), Penn State 2003b; and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.07?0.15), American College of Chest Physicians. Based on the derivation data set, REEs are explained by the following equation: CSE = 616 ? 8 ? age in years + 13 ? weight in kilograms + 450 if on ventilator + 159 ? MV in liters + 145 if on inotropes. Based on the validation study results, the LCCC between IC and the CSE was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73?0.88). Conclusion: The CSE has adequate precision and could be used for REE estimation for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass if IC is unavailable.

AB  - Summary It has become increasingly obvious that factors such as communication, teamwork, and leadership have significant roles in patient safety. In healthcare, when communication breaks down patient safety is jeopardized, a reality that has been documented in a number of clinical settings, including general medicine, emergency departments, and surgery. Teamwork is the array of interconnected behaviors, cognitive processes, and attitudes that make coordinated and adaptive performance possible in complex environments such as clinical settings. This chapter provides some examples of breakdowns in communication within the context of veterinary anesthesia. Every method of communication is prone to error. Oral communications are often only partially recalled by the receiver. Written communications are time consuming so are often only partially completed. Electronic communications are often too brief. Forms should be backed up with verbal communications and vice versa. Standardizing communication and communication training should be encouraged.

AB  - Abstract Cardiac surgery strategies include surgeries performed on the beating heart, surgeries performed with brief circulatory arrest during venous inflow occlusion, surgeries performed with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and hybrid cardiac surgeries that combine image-guided interventional techniques with minimal-incision cardiac approaches. Many cardiac surgeries can be performed on a beating heart without circulatory or cardiac arrest. Venous inflow occlusion is a strategy that provides a brief period of circulatory arrest, allowing for open cardiac repairs that can be performed in a short period of time, generally less than 2 minutes. CPB is a strategy where the patient is connected to an extracorporeal system that provides flow of oxygenated blood to the patient allowing the heart to be stopped for surgical repair. Hybrid cardiac surgery is an emerging option for correction of congenital and acquired structural cardiac defects.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To record the electroencephalographic changes during castration in ponies anaesthetized with halothane and given intravenous (IV) lidocaine by infusion. The hypothesis tested was that in ponies, IV lidocaine is antinociceptive and would therefore obtund EEG changes during castration. Animals? Ten Welsh mountain ponies referred to the Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge for castration under general anaesthesia. Materials and methods? Following pre-anaesthetic medication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) anaesthesia was induced with IV guaiphenesin (60?mg?kg?1) and thiopental (9 mg?kg?1) and maintained with halothane at an end-tidal concentration (Fe?HAL) of 1.2%. A constant rate infusion of IV lidocaine (100??g?kg?1?minute?1) was administered throughout anaesthesia. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded continuously using subcutaneous needle electrodes. All animals were castrated using a closed technique. The raw EEG signal was analysed after completion of each investigation, and the mean values of EEG variables (median frequency, spectral edge frequency, total amplitude) recorded during a baseline period (before surgery began) and the removal of each testicle were compared using anova for repeated measures. Results? Spectral edge frequency (SEF) 95% decreased during removal of the second testicle compared with baseline recordings. No other significant EEG changes during castration were measured. Conclusions? Lidocaine obtunded the EEG changes identified during castration in a previous control study, providing indirect evidence that lidocaine administered peri-operatively was antinociceptive and contributed to anaesthesia during castration. Clinical relevance? The antinociceptive effect of lidocaine combined with its minimal cardiovascular effects indicate a potential use for systemic lidocaine in clinical anaesthetic techniques.

AB  - Abstract Acute deterioration of patients with cirrhosis manifests as multiple organ failure requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Precipitating events may be viral hepatitis, typically in Asia, and drug or alcoholic hepatitis and variceal hemorrhage in the West. Patients with cirrhosis in the intensive care unit have a high mortality, and each admission is associated with a mean charge of US $116,200. Prognosis is determined by the number of organs failing (sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score), the presence of infection, and the degree of liver dysfunction (Child-Turcotte-Pugh or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores). The most common organ failing is the kidney; sepsis is associated with further deterioration in liver function by compromise of the microcirculation. Care of these critically ill patients with impending multiple organ failure requires a team approach with expertise in both hepatology and critical care. Treatment is aimed at preventing further deterioration in liver function, reversing precipitating factors, and supporting failing organs. Liver transplantation is required in selected patients to improve survival and quality of life. Treatment is futile in some patients, but it is difficult to identify these patients a priori. Artificial and bioartificial liver support systems have thus far not demonstrated significant survival benefit in these patients. (HEPATOLOGY 2011)

AB  - Abstract Pulmonary artery catheterization has been a routine part of care for critically ill patients over the past 25?years. Primary hemodynamic data regarding cardiac output and pulmonary pressures can be utilized to make diagnoses and guide therapy. Tissue oxygen delivery and utilization allow inferences about the efficiency of the cardiopulmonary system and the impact of disease and medical therapies on tissue metabolism. Goals of high level invasive monitoring of cardiopulmonary function with pulmonary artery catheterization are organ salvage and minimizing complications associated with critical illness. Optimizing renal perfusion and minimizing pulmonary congestion with precise volume titration are common reasons for performing pulmonary artery catheterization in the intensive care unit. Despite being reassuring to clinicians that hemodynamic therapy is optimal, multiple data from well conducted clinical studies have not demonstrated outcome benefits to patients related to pulmonary artery catheterization. Less invasive techniques to obtain data regarding hemodynamic function are now entering the clinical arena and are being actively investigated.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.
