AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of colic can be expensive and may exceed the owners? financial limitations. This may result in premature euthanasia prior to treatment on rectifiable financial grounds rather than for welfare reasons. It is therefore important to ensure appropriate business model auditing to identify where costs may limit expected treatment options. Objectives This study investigated how the costs of treatment for equine colic at a single university referral hospital have changed over a 10-year period between 2003 and 2013. The aim was to analyse which costs have changed excessively or disproportionately between different treating services, consumables and professional fees, which may render treatment of colic financially prohibitive. Study design Retrospective study. Methods All charges billed against cases undergoing treatment for colic between 2003 and 2013 were accessed from hospital records. Horses were identified as having surgery or purely medical management. Charges were categorised by service (medicine, surgery, anaesthesia), type (consumable, livery, professional fee), and consumable type (e.g. NSAID, opiate, antibiotic, fluid therapy, lab fee, surgery consumables). Results There was a significant association between year and the frequency of medically and surgically treated colic (Chi-square test, P<0.001). Between 2003 and 2012, median total treatment costs increased in both medically (42%) and surgically treated (46%) cases. Costs attributable to consumables increased (surgical cases 28%, medical cases 14%), while those attributable to livery (surgical -19%, medical -21%) and professional fees decreased (surgical -22%, medical -8%). The greatest increase in consumable cost was attributable to fluids (surgical 94%, medical 182%). Conclusions This study demonstrates areas where the cost of colic treatment are disproportionately changing and thus highlights potential targets where business models may be optimised in the interest of patient survival. The substantial increase in costs attributable to fluids correlates with increasing emphasis on fluid therapy in the management of colic.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Osteoarthritis (OA) of the articular processes (APs) is recognised as a clinical condition in the equine cervical spine, but there is little information on the prevalence and distribution of OA in the APs of the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae. Objectives To determine the prevalence and distribution of OA in the APs of the equine cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae in relation to vertebral level, age and size of the horse and side of the neck. Study design A post mortem longitudinal randomised study of 53 horses. Hypotheses OA is more prevalent and more severe in the APs of the cervicothoracic junction, the prevalence and severity of OA increases with horse age and size, and OA is equally distributed on left and right sides. Methods The cervical (C1?C7) and cranial thoracic (T1?T7) vertebrae of 53 horses were removed at necropsy and boiled out. Based on the size (percentage) of the joint margin that was affected, OA of the 4 APs of each vertebra was graded on a scale of 0 (no osseous lesions) to 3 (severe osseous lesions). Based on these grades, a 3-factor ANOVA was used to test the random effects of horse, age (young, old) and size (small, large), and the fixed factors of side (left, right) and vertebral level (C1 to T7). Results OA lesions were most severe in the mid-cervical vertebrae (C3?C4) followed by the cervicothoracic curvature (C5?T1). Severity of OA increased with age and size of the horse but there was no difference between left and right sides. Conclusions OA is symmetrically present with higher severity in the mid-cervical and cervicothoracic regions and with higher prevalence in older and larger horses. These factors support bilateral injections in specific APs for clinical treatment of OA in the equine cervical spine.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypotension is the most common cardiovascular complication encountered during equine inhalational anaesthesia, for which a dobutamine intravenous constant rate infusion (DCRI) is often the sole treatment. There is limited literature available on the combined use of crystalloid boluses and inotropic agents during equine hypotensive episodes. Objectives To determine the cardiovascular effects of DCRI, alone and in combination with a crystalloid bolus (CB) during controlled ventilation in hypotensive, isoflurane anaesthetised horses. Study design Prospective, randomised, cross-over experimental design of 6 healthy Standardbred horses aged 5?13 years weighing 464?578?kg. Methods Horses were premedicated with intravenous acepromazine and xylazine. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous ketamine and diazepam. Isofluorane was used to maintain anaesthesia and achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60?mmHg?±?5%. Sixty minutes post induction (T0) when a stable end tidal isoflurane percentage and target MAP had been achieved for ≥15?min one of 2 treatments was given. Treatment A (TA) was a DCRI, commencing at 0.5??g/kg bwt/min and increasing in increments of 0.5?ug/kg bwt every 10?min as required to achieve a MAP of 80?mmHg?±?5% by 30?min following initiation of the DCRI. Treatment B (TB) was as for TA plus a 20?ml/kg bwt CB. Cardiac output, haemoglobin concentration, PaO2 and SaO2 were obtained at baseline (T0) and 30?min following initiation of the DCRI (T1). Data were analysed with a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (P<0.05 considered significant), with data presented as median?±?interquartile ranges. Results Treatment A was associated with a significant (P?=?0.03) increase in oxygen delivery index (DO2I) from baseline (T0 707.78?±?159.73?ml/ min/m2; T1 1260.26?±?184.56?ml/min/m2), while TB was not (P?=?0.09). Conclusions In an experimental model of isoflurane induced hypotension, DCRI results in increased DO2I, while the use of DCRI in combination with CB does not.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a common equine distal axonopathy associated with neurogenic atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscles (particularly the left) causing laryngeal paresis and poor performance. An objective, reliable method of assessing changes in structure that correlates with laryngeal muscle function in vivo is necessary to determine response to novel treatments, including functional electrical stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether laryngeal muscle and nerve morphology (determined by CT and histopathology) correlated with laryngeal function. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Resting (grades 1?4) and exercising (grades A?C) laryngeal function was graded in adult Thoroughbred horses. Standing CT of the larynx was performed to compare volume, cross-sectional area (XSA) and tissue density between left and right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (CAD) muscles in 22 horses. CAD muscles and recurrent laryngeal nerves were collected in a subgroup of 10 horses and analysed for fibrosis, fat infiltration and nerve fibre density (axons/?m2). Results Horses with grade C?RLN on exercising endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles and reduced nerve fibre density than horses with grades A or B. Horses with grade 4?RLN on resting endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles than horses with grades 1 or 2. Left CAD muscles had significantly more collagen than the right in horses with grade C?RLN. CT measurements of the CAD muscles were significantly associated with % collagen/fat and nerve fibre density (P<0.05). Conclusions Laryngeal CT results correlate with laryngeal function at rest and exercise in the horse and provide a noninvasive method of monitoring changes in CAD morphology in response to novel treatments. CAD CT appearance is dependent on % collagen and fat in the muscle and is associated with nerve fibre density.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little exists in the literature regarding the outcome of endoscopically-guided desmotomy of the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) where injury to the PAL was the only diagnosis. Objectives To report the return to previous level of exercise in horses treated with endoscopically guided PAL resection in which PAL injury was considered to be the primary condition. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Medical records of surgical cases at Donnington Grove Veterinary Surgery between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were cases that had undergone surgical transection of the palmar/plantar annular ligament under general anaesthesia and endoscopic guidance using a No. 12 scalpel blade where annular ligament injury was the only notable finding at surgery. Follow-up was obtained by a telephone questionnaire. Results Twenty-three horses were included in the study. Twenty horses were noted to have restriction to passage of the arthroscope within the digital flexor tendon sheath at the time of surgery. Following the initial 3-month post operative rest period 21 horses were sound. Three horses did not return to their previous level of activity due to unrelated lameness issues and 2 returned to a lower level of competition due to owner preference. Of the remaining 18 horses, 16 returned to their previous level of athletic performance. Two horses had recurrent or persistent lameness associated with the residual PAL desmopathy. Conclusions In this case series surgical treatment of primary PAL injury carries a good prognosis (89% return to previous level of exercise) in contrast to a previously reported study (<50% of horses were able to return to athletic function) [1].

AB  - Reasons for performing study Tumours of the thyroid gland are rare in the equine species. In literature varying clinical signs and diagnostic findings are described in single reports and case series. Reported clinical signs are related to upper airway compression or thyroidal metabolic activity. A considerable risk of laryngeal hemiplegia is described when horses were treated with hemithyroidectomy [1]. Objectives To review 11 horses referred with a unilateral thyroid neoplasia in order to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment and outcome. Histopathology was performed on all resected thyroid lobes. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Records from horses with histologically confirmed thyroid tumours treated with unilateral thyroid lobe resection were reviewed (2003?2013). Short-term outcome was defined for 2 weeks after surgery. Owners? questionnaire was performed for evaluation of long-term outcome defined as a minimum of 6 months. Results Affected horses were aged between 6 and 21 years. In contrast to literature the majority of tumours were adenocarcinomas (9/11), mainly found in mares (8/9). Histology revealed follicular and parafollicular (C-cell) mixed growth pattern of the carcinomas. Tumour size, growth rate and sonographic appearance did not correlate to histological characteristics. Ventral displacement of the thyroid lobe and close preparation along the thyroid capsule during surgical resection are inevitable to avoid damage to laryngeal nerves. Seroma formation was the only observed short-term complication. No long-term complications occurred. Conclusions Hemithyroidectomy is regarded the treatment of choice in horses with a unilateral thyroid lobe neoplasia with excellent long-term prognosis. High incidence of malignant tumours particularly in mares has to be considered. Tumour characteristics can only be derived from histopathology and immunhistochemistry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lack of ?gold standard? for pain assessment in horses. Objectives To assess different approaches of quantifying pain in horses. Castration was chosen as a pain model because of its wide clinical relevance. Study design Exploratory study. Methods 51 equine stallions undergoing castration under general anaesthesia were divided in 3 pain-relieving treatment groups: A) single perioperative administration of flunixin (n?=?19), B) additional subsequent flunixin administrations (n?=?21), D) like A but with intra-operative mepivacaine injections into the spermatic cord (n?=?11). All horses were assessed before and 5 times after surgery (up to 44?h) by means of a modified composite pain scale (CPS), a newly developed facial expression pain scale (FEPS), faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) and plasma cytokine profiles. The same parameters were measured in a control group C, undergoing general anaesthesia for different nonpainful procedures (n?=?6). Data were analysed with nonparametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Mann Whitney U). Results Time had an influence on CPS and FEPS scores in treatment groups A, B and D but not in C. Scores of groups A and B were higher compared to groups D and C at 4 (CPS, FEPS) and 8?h (CPS), whereas there was no difference between groups A and B nor between groups D and C. Only in group AB was there an increase of faecal GCMs 20?h after surgery. GCMs in group AB were higher compared with groups C and D at 32?h. No effects by time or treatment could be identified for the different plasma cytokines. Conclusions CPS and FEPS seem to be able to detect different levels of post castration pain differentiating from possible anaesthesia effect. Additional local anaesthesia of the spermatic cord was associated with lower post surgical pain scores when compared to perioperative flunixin application alone, whereas subsequent applications of flunixin had no obvious effect.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Equine sarcoids are locally aggressive fibroblastic cutaneous tumours, representing the third most common health problem in working horses. In developed countries they also have welfare and economic impact (e.g. prepurchase examination). No current treatment offers 100% success rate. It is now well established that Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoid tumours. In a number of human cancers, aberrant expression of microRNAs has been linked to the cancerous phenotype. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate essential biological and cellular processes. Currently there is much interest in their role as biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents for many diseases. Objectives In an attempt to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of sarcoids, we aim to identify specific microRNAs associated with equine sarcoids. Study design Differential expression of microRNAs was assessed in control equine fibroblasts (EqPalfs) and EqPalfs transformed with the BPV-1 genome (S6-2s). Methods Using a commercially available human microarray, 453 microRNAs were interrogated in RNA samples from both cell lines. Each cell line was analysed in triplicate. Results 219 individual microRNAs were differentially expressed in control (EqPalFs) versus BPV-transformed cells (S6-2s) (P<0.05). of these, 148 microRNAs (68%) were underexpressed in S6-2 cells relative to EqPalfs. Conclusions We have shown that BPV-1 transformed equine cell lines exhibit a different microRNA profile to control equine fibroblasts and the aberrant expression of microRNAs in S6-2 cells can be attributed to the presence of BPV-1 genomes. Our future work will focus on studying the expression profiles of a subset of microRNAs in a larger panel of cell lines and sarcoid tumours to help elucidate the significance of the deregulated expression.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationship between pelvic hindlimb lameness pointers remains unclear. Objectives To examine sacrum and tubera coxae (TC) based movement asymmetry across different lameness degrees, patterns and changes in pelvic rotation. Study design Parameter regression and rigid body model. Methods Vertical displacement of left and right tubera coxae (LTC, RTC) and sacrum was quantified experimentally in 107 horses with varying lameness degrees using inertial sensors. To investigate the theoretical relationship between pointers, a geometrical model of pelvis movement was created in Matlab. The model predicts TC movement based on experimentally derived pelvic rotation and computer-generated asymmetrical sacrum movement. Further, the effect of changes in pelvic rotation on TC-based lameness pointers was quantified. For both, experimental and model data, asymmetry measures corresponding to visual assessment strategies of veterinarians were calculated and contrasted. Results Experimental data showed that upward movement amplitudes for sacrum and TC were strongly correlated (r?≥?0.96). Regression showed that differences were greater between amplitudes of LTC/RTC than sacrum (slope 1.18; r2?=?0.94; P<0.001); however, for ratios the reverse held true (slope 0.86; r2?=?0.92; P<0.001). The model predicted experimentally determined tubera coxae asymmetry well. While the model data matched the experimental scaling relationship between amplitude ratios, it predicted a slightly shallower slope for amplitude differences. Perturbing the model with a different rotational range of movement, an offset in pelvic rotation and asymmetrical pelvic rotation affected observable TC-based asymmetry depending on the chosen assessment strategy. Conclusions Detecting lameness based on sacrum or comparative TC movement can give similar results. Using comparative TC movement for lameness detection would be susceptible to changes in pelvic rotation which a lame horse may adopt. Hence, assessment of multiple pelvis-based lameness pointers can help establishing nonobvious hindlimb lameness.

Some horses were included with owner informed consent and data from clinical cases were recorded as part of lameness investigations. Sources of funding:?S.D.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Epidemiological investigations suggest that soil macro- and micro-nutrients may be a trigger for the occurrence of equine grass sickness (EGS). However, there is limited information regarding relationships between exposure to geochemical elements and the occurrence of EGS. Objectives To determine whether the geographical distribution of EGS cases referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies was associated with the presence or absence of particular geochemical elements in the environment. Study design A retrospective time-matched case?control study. Methods 455 EGS geo-referenced cases were identified between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2006. Each case had 2 time-matched geo-referenced controls (n?=?910). For study purposes, cases or controls originating outwith Scotland were excluded. Environmental concentrations of a range of elements, most with known biological function, were collated from 2 geochemical point datasets and spatially extrapolated giving continuous cover across Scotland: the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) stream sediment dataset and the James Hutton Institute (JHI), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS). Data were analysed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Results Statistically significant associations were obtained between the distribution of EGS cases and (i) higher environmental levels of Ca, K, Mo, Na, Se and Ti, and (ii) lower environmental levels of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. This study identified no association between EGS cases and the environmental concentrations of Ba, Ga, Fe, Mg, Mn, P or Sr. Conclusions A number of statistically significant associations were identified between EGS cases and element concentrations in the spatially extrapolated stream sediment and soil data. This information will assist future studies on the aetiology of EGS, with further research suggested to focus on those identified significant associations with greatest biological plausibility such as reduced levels of Cu and Zn, and higher levels of K and Se.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colostrum acts as a source of immunomodulatory molecules for the neonate. Little information is available about the transfer of cytokines via colostrum in the foal. Objectives To investigate the transfer via colostrum of IL-4, IL-13, IL-8 and IFN-?. Study design Prospective observational study. Methods Jugular venous blood pre- (T0) and post suckling (T24) and colostrum were collected from 14 healthy foals and their dams. The cytokines? concentration was measured with an ELISA test. Serum IgG concentration was measured in foals at T24 with an immunoturbidimetric assay. Since data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests for statistical analysis were used. The Wilcoxon t test evaluated the difference in each cytokine concentration between T0 and T24. Spearman rank correlation tested the association between cytokines? concentration in T24 serum and in colostrum, between T24?T0 (?T) serum concentration and colostrum concentration, and between cytokines serum concentration at T24 and IgG concentration. Results All the foals had a complete transfer of passive immunity. A statistically significant difference was found between serum IL-4 concentration at T0 and at T24. The significant correlations found were: serum IL-4 concentration at T24 with IL-4 concentration in colostrum, serum IL-13 concentration at T24 with IgG serum concentration, and IL-4 concentration in colostrum with ?T serum IL-4 concentration. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that IL-4 is transferred via colostrum to the foal, as reported for TNF-α [1]. The presence of IL-8 in the foal's serum at T0 suggests an endogenous production. The IL-13 concentration is close to zero for the major part of serum and colostrum samples suggesting a subject-dependent immunologic response. The IFN-? is present both in colostrum and in T0 serum suggesting that foals are not deficient at birth.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of different formulations of omeprazole have not been published. Objectives To compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of 4 commercially available formulations of omeprazole to an existing reference formulation. Study design A single dose cross-over bioequivalence study. Methods Six adult Thoroughbred horses were used. Two generic buffered formulations (OG and AG), one commercial enteric coated formulation (GZ) and one compounded enteric coated formulation (BO) were compared to the reference buffered formulation (GG). Each formulation was administered at a total dose of 2?g (equivalent to 4?mg/kg bwt for a 500?kg horse) in a cross-over design. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300 and 360?min, the plasma was separated and frozen. Plasma omeprazole concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using PK Solver. Results The mean (± s.d.) area-under-the-curve (AUC0-t/0-inf_obs) (?g/ml*min), Cmax (?g) and Tmax (min) for each formulation was; OG ? 59.4?±?20.1, 0.37?±?0.12, 87.5?±?38.4; AG ? 77.3?±?53.7, 0.34?±?0.24, 170.0?±?62.0; GZ ? 102.9?±?51.1, 0.86?±?0.68, 67.5?±?29.6; BO ? 88.0?±?37.4, 0.59?±?0.39, 95.0?±?47.1; GG ? 57.5?±?35.3, 0.41?±?0.22, 57.5?±?19.9. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that differences are present between commercially available formulations of omeprazole. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating results of clinical studies from one formulation to another.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing. Ethical animal research:?Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not given but permission for post mortem examination was given by the Racing Authority. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?No competing interests have been declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A nonchemical method of restraint to facilitate neonatal foal handling and minimally invasive procedures would be highly useful. Objectives To investigate squeeze-induced somnolence for providing adequate restraint of healthy neonatal foals for the purpose of plasma administration. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Squeeze-induced somnolence of neonatal foals was performed by use of a soft rope restraint as previously described [1] to allow intravenous catheterisation and plasma administration. Physiological and clinical parameters were monitored pre-, during and post squeeze-induced somnolence. Results Squeeze-induced somnolence and plasma administration was performed on 14 foals within the first day of life without any adverse effects. Mean time to recumbency during squeeze restraint was 53?s, mean time to stand and mean time to nurse from dam following release of restraint were 46?s and 163?s, respectively. Over 50% of foals gave some reaction to subcutaneous injection of local anaesthetic but only one foal reacted strongly. The restraint technique was performed without any difficulty in 8/14 foals, 5/14 foals became less somnolent latterly in the procedure (around 17?18?min) and one foal never became fully somnolent. Conclusions Squeeze-induced somnolence provides adequate restraint for plasma administration, without the need for sedation, in the majority of neonatal foals. Squeeze-induced somnolence can be used to allow nonchemical restraint of neonatal foals for routine procedures. Further refinement of the technique is required to maximise its potential usefulness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Foals were included in the study with informed owner consent. Sources of funding:?Private anonymous donation. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Accumulations of mucus within the trachea are often found during endoscopic examinations of the airways of poorly performing racehorses, but the clinical importance of this finding is unknown. Objectives: To determine the effect of tracheal mucus, pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) and cytological indices of tracheal aspirate on racing performance in Thoroughbred horses assessed by race place and whether the horse was raced. Methods: Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea was performed, and a tracheal aspirate obtained monthly at Thistledown racetrack from April to December, 2002 and 2003. Horses received a score of 0?4 for the degree of PLH and 0?4 for the amount of mucus visible in the trachea. The tracheal aspirate was assessed for turbidity, and total and differential cell counts. Generalised estimating equations models were used as repeated measures models for each risk factor and the level of association assessed through the risk factor's P value in the model. Results: Moderate to severe tracheal mucus (2?4) was a risk factor for poor racing performance. There was no association between degree of PLH, cell counts or turbidity of tracheal wash fluid and racing performance. However, horses that raced had higher total neutrophil counts in tracheal wash aspirates than horses that did not race. Conclusions: Grades 2?4 tracheal mucus should be considered a potential cause of poor racing performance in Thoroughbred horses. Clinical relevance: Because moderate to severe tracheal mucus accumulation, and not increased tracheal neutrophils, was a risk factor for poor racing performance, functionally significant airway inflammation may best be confirmed by the presence of mucus rather than increased number of neutrophils in the trachea.

AB  - Abstract Objective Increased intrathoracic pressures during airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may compromise systemic venous return resulting in decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion. We sought to study the short-term effect of APRV on blood pressure (BP) and urine output (UO) in children with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients All patients with ALI/ARDS who were admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between 1/00 and 06/04, and who were ventilated with APRV (for at least 12?hr) for worsening oxygenation while on conventional ventilation (CV). Measurements and Results Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) score, admitting diagnosis, ventilator settings, gas exchange data, heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), blood pressure (BP), UO, and use of other therapies [sedatives, pressors, inotropes, and intravenous fluid (IVF)]. Eleven patients met our inclusion and exclusion criteria with a mean age of 6.2?±?4.8 years (range: 1?15 years), a weight of 35.5?±?29.5?kg (range: 12?90?kg), and a PRISM score of 18.4?±?9.6 (range: 2?36). Within 10?hrs of APRV, patients' mean airway pressure (Paw) increased from 16.1?±?6.6 to 21.1?±?5.5?cm of H2O (P?=?0.04). Despite a higher Paw there were no differences in HR, CVP, BP, UO, IVF and use of other therapies while on CV or APRV (P?>?0.10). Conclusion In children with ALI/ARDS, despite a higher Paw, APRV does not affect BP or UO. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2010; 45:48?54. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure in pregnancy. This chapter discusses the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of ARDS in pregnant patients. Ware and Matthay described the pathophysiology of ARDS. Alveolar and/or capillary endothelial injury is the predominant mechanism in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Tocolytic-induced pulmonary edema (TPE) is an important cause of ARDS. Risk factors for TPE are multiple gestation, infection, and corticosteroid therapy. Management of TPE includes stopping the drug, diuresis, and supportive care. The management of ARDS in pregnancy is complicated. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both maternal and fetal aspects of care. There are no formal studies on the use of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) in pregnancy, but the pregnant patient in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with baseline raised respiratory drive, fits the phenotype of the patient who might benefit from early use of HFOT.
