AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - Summary Several issues related to the risks, costs, and availability of allogeneic blood transfusions have fueled research into other blood substitutes. Artificial oxygen carriers increase the oxygen content of blood by providing additional chemically modified hemoglobin molecules or inert fluids capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen. Several such products have been developed and many have undergone extensive clinical investigation, demonstrating their efficacy in improving oxygen transportation and avoiding the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. Their clinical use, however, has been marred by the unresolved safety issues and significant numbers of complications. While further research is underway to improve the safety of artificial oxygen carriers, current products remain valuable assets as ?oxygen bridges? in the management of patients suffering from critically low hemoglobin levels at imminent risk of ischemia and death that cannot be transfused.

AB  - Summary Lung transplantation from donors with fulminant pulmonary arterial embolism as a cause of death remains controversial. An analysis was performed comparing preoperative characteristics and outcomes of 25 donors with a primary diagnosis of pulmonary arterial embolism to 1085 recipients of donor lungs without pulmonary arterial embolism. No early functional impairment of donor lungs with pulmonary embolism was detectable as depicted by the incidence of primary graft dysfunction immediately after surgery (P = 0.66), 24 (P = 0.79), 48 (P = 0.99) and 72 h (P = 0.99) after transplantation. Pulmonary function testing at 1 year (P = 0.003) and at last outpatient control (P < 0.05) showed superior results in the cohort receiving lungs from donors with pulmonary embolism. Incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) showed no difference within the first year after lung transplantation, however, 5 year-CLAD free survival was superior in recipients (70.4% vs. 55.1%, P = 0.006) of donor lungs with pulmonary embolism. Overall survival was similar in both groups. Lungs from donors with fulminant pulmonary embolism prior to brain death can safely be used for lung transplantation without impairing postoperative outcomes. Lung function testing shows favorable midterm results in recipients of donor lungs with pulmonary embolism.

AB  - While current donor selection with clinical findings is generally effective, the imprecise nature of the assessment forces clinicians to remain on the conservative side. A reliable biological marker would assist donor selection and would improve donor organ utilization. We collected biopsies from 169 donor lungs before implantation. Expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-? and IL-1? were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Seventeen cases died within 30 days after transplantation. No donor factor was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Univariate analysis of the 84 cases for development of the prediction model showed that IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1? were risk factors for mortality and IL-10 and IFN-? were protective factors. We analyzed the cytokine expression ratios of risk to protective cytokines. A stepwise logistic regression for 30-day mortality demonstrated that a model containing the ratio of IL-6/IL-10 was the most predictive (p = 0.0013). When applied to the remaining 85 cases for validation, the test of model fit was significant (p = 0.039). Using the cytokine ratio, we were able to define three risk groups with striking differences in survival (p = 0.0003). Multi-cytokine analysis of the donor lung graft with qRT-PCR shows significant promise as a strategy to biologically evaluate the donor lung prior to implantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of acute diffuse lung injury characterized by severe inflammation, increased pulmonary vascular permeability and a loss of aerated lung tissue. The effects of high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) include oxygen toxicity manifested by damage to the lung parenchyma in the acute phase of lung injury. There is still a high mortality rate among this group of patients, so clinically sensitive evidence-based interventions are paramount to maximize survival chances during critical care. Aims and objectives The aim of this article is to explore the current opinion concerning optimal mechanical ventilation support techniques for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria A literature search of clinical trials and observation studies, reviews, discussion papers, meta-analyses and clinical guidelines written in English up to 2015, derived from the databases of Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library databases and PubMed was conducted. Conclusions Low tidal volume, pressure limitation and prone positioning in severe ARDS patients appear to be of some benefit. More research is required and further development and use of standardized protocols is an important strategy for reducing practice variations across disciplines, as well as giving clear guidelines to nurses practising in critical care. There is also evidence that this syndrome is under-diagnosed and the utilization of lung protective ventilation is still variable. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses have underlying knowledge of both aetiology of ARDS and ventilation management, and that they monitor patients very closely. The adoption of a low tidal ventilation protocol, which is based on quality evidence guidelines, the value of rescue therapies and patient observation practices in the overall patient management, and the need to place emphasis on long-term patient outcomes, all these emerge as key factors for consideration and future research. However, there is also a need for more research that would explore the unique contribution of nurses in the management of this patient group, as it is difficult to discern this in the current literature.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with those syndromes whose primary symptomatology is characterized by acquired impairments in one or more cognitive domains. Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with the various disorders of consciousness, sleep, and conditions requiring neurointensive care support. The role of an intensive care unit is to maintain normal physiological homeostasis while actively treating the underlying cause of any physiological derangement. Neurological complications on the ICU are usually caused by metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, stroke or neuromuscular disorders but multiple complications are common. Sleep medicine is an evolving field with wide variability in knowledge of each individual sleep disorder. The chapter lists the most recent classification that is based on common complaints (insomnia or hypersomnias) as well as presumed aetiological basis (circadian rhythm disorders) or organ system from which problems arise (sleep-related breathing disorders). It also explains the issues involved in determining brain death. The diagnosis of brain death is necessary when withdrawal of artificial life support is considered and if the possibility of organ donation exists.

AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, some of asphyxiation classifications are looked at and the extent to which such categorisations are significant or meaningful for practical purposes are examined. Apart from straightforward drowning, medical conditions, injuries and intoxications may trigger the drowning episode, for instance by causing the victim to fall into the water from a boat or bank, or by rendering him or her unconscious or unable to swim. Injury caused by barotrauma occurs most frequently during diving but sometimes occurs during hyberbaric oxygen therapy, aviation, such as in commercial air flights, aircraft-pressure testing and altitude chamber training from sea level to altitude. The chapter discusses diving-related fatalities, with special attention to multidisciplinary investigation, the medicolegal autopsy and the interpretation of postmortem findings. The factors that govern the rate of decomposition in water and the time of appearance of signs of immersion are listed in the chapter.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major contributor to respiratory morbidity and mortality after oesophagectomy. Several pre-, intra- and post-operative factors are thought to predispose to its development in the post-oesophagectomy period. The aim of this study was to determine factors predisposing to ARDS in the post-oesophagectomy period. Methods:? A total of 112 patients who underwent elective oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer (gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia, 93; oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 16; oesophageal oat cell tumour, 1; oesophageal anaplastic carcinoma, 1; oesophageal colloid carcinoma, 1) between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 formed the study group in this retrospective study. The pre-, intra and post-operative data for these patients (male?:?female = 89:23, mean age 60.8 years) were collected from an oesophagectomy database and hospital medical records. Results:? The incidence of ARDS was 13%. The in-hospital mortality among ARDS cases was 20% and 1-year mortality was 40%. Various factors such as preoperative chronic respiratory disease (P-value = 0.000, odds ratio = 17.76), smoking pack-years (P-value = 0.045, odds ratio = 1.02), abnormal preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1?s (P-value = 0.009, odds ratio = 7.97), high percentage of oxygen in inspired air (P-value = 0.041, odds ratio = 1.24) and use of perioperative inotropes (P-value = 0.021, odds ratio = 4.26) were associated with ARDS. Conclusions:? Preoperative physiological status as indicated by a preoperative history of chronic respiratory disease and preoperative pulmonary function influenced the post-operative outcome in our patients. The use of perioperative inotropes suggests perioperative cardiorespiratory instability, and could also predispose to the development of ARDS in the post-operative period.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.
