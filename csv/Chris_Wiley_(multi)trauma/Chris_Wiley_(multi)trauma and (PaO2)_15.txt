AB  - Summary Basic blood work ? complete blood count and biochemical panel ? in combination with a urinalysis is often performed during the work-up of a respiratory patient and can help support the presence of an underlying respiratory tract disease. Pulse oximetry provides an estimate of hemoglobin saturation with oxygen and is inexpensive, non-invasive, and easy to perform. Radiography is often the key to creating an appropriate list of differential diagnoses for the respiratory case and for determining the type of sampling method that is most likely to achieve a final diagnosis. Airway fluoroscopy uses air as the contrast medium to evaluate dynamic changes in the luminal diameter of the airways during normal breathing and during cough. A transoral tracheal wash is appropriate for use in large and small dogs or in cats. Rhinoscopic examination includes evaluation of the caudal nasopharynx to visualize nasal openings at the choanae and inspection of the rostral nasal cavity.

AB  - Abstract Lung transplantation is an established life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. Unfortunately, greater success in lung transplantation is hindered by a shortage of lung donors and the relatively poor early-, mid-, and long-term outcomes associated with severe primary graft dysfunction. Ex vivo lung perfusion has emerged as a modern preservation technique that allows for a more accurate lung assessment and improvement in lung quality. This review outlines the: (i) rationale behind the method; (ii) techniques and protocols; (iii) Toronto ex vivo lung perfusion method; (iv) devices available; and (v) clinical experience worldwide. We also highlight the potential of ex vivo lung perfusion in leading a new era of lung preservation.

AB  - Summary In patients awaiting lung transplantation (LTX), adequate gas exchange may not be sufficiently achieved by mechanical ventilation alone if acute respiratory decompensation arises. We report on 20 patients with life-threatening hypercapnia who received extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2-R) by means of the interventional lung assist (ILA?, Novalung) as bridge to LTX. The most common underlying diagnoses were bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. The type of ILA was pumpless arteriovenous or pump-driven venovenous (ILA activve?, Novalung) in 10 patients each. ILA bridging was initiated in 15 invasively ventilated and five noninvasively ventilated patients, of whom one had to be intubated prior to LTX. Hypercapnia and acidosis were effectively corrected in all patients within the first 12 h of ILA therapy: PaCO2 declined from 109 (70?146) to 57 (45?64) mmHg, P < 0.0001; pH increased from 7.20 (7.06?7.28) to 7.39 (7.35?7.49), P < 0.0001. Four patients were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to progressive hypoxia or circulatory failure. Nineteen patients (95%) were successfully transplanted. Hospital and 1-year survival was 75 and 72%, respectively. Bridging to LTX with ECCO2-R delivered by arteriovenous pumpless or venovenous pump-driven ILA is feasible and associated with high transplantation and survival rates.

AB  - The growing demand for suitable lungs for transplantation drives the quest for alternative strategies to expand the donor pool. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of lung transplantation (LTx) with donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) and the impact of selective ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). From 2007 to 2013, 673 LTx were performed, with 62 (9.2%) of them using DCDDs (seven bridged cases). Cases bridged with mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal life support were excluded. From 55 DCDDs, 28 (51%) underwent EVLP. Outcomes for LTx using DCDDs and donation after neurological determination of death (DNDD) donors were similar, with 1 and 5-year survivals of 85% and 54% versus 86% and 62%, respectively (p?=?0.43). Although comparison of survival curves between DCDD?+?EVLP versus DCDD-no EVLP showed no significant difference, DCDD?+?EVLP cases presented shorter hospital stay (median 18 vs. 23 days, p?=?0.047) and a trend toward shorter length of mechanical ventilation (2 vs. 3 days, p?=?0.059). DCDDs represent a valuable source of lungs for transplantation, providing similar results to DNDDs. EVLP seems an important technique in the armamentarium to safely increase lung utilization from DCDDs; however, further studies are necessary to better define the role of EVLP in this context.

AB  - Background Nursing procedures that are routinely performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) are assumed to have minimal side effects. However, these procedures may sometimes cause physiological changes that negatively affect the patient. We hypothesized that physiological changes associated with routine nursing procedures in the ICU are common. Methods A clinical observational study of 16 critically ill patients in a nine-bed mixed university hospital ICU. All nursing procedures were observed, and physiological data were collected and subsequently analyzed. Minor physiological changes were defined as minimal changes in respiratory or circulatory variables, and major physiological changes were marked as hyper/hypotension, bradycardia/tachycardia, bradypnea/tachypnea, ventilatory distress, and peripheral blood oxygen desaturation. Results In the 16 patients, 668 procedures generated 158 major and 692 minor physiological changes during 187 observational hours. The most common procedure was patient position change, which also generated the majority of the physiological changes. The most common major physiological changes were blood oxygen desaturation, ventilatory distress, and hypotension, and the most common minor changes were arterial pressure alteration, coughing, and increase in respiratory rate. Conclusion In this pilot study, we examined physiological changes in connection with all regular routine nursing procedures in the ICU. We found that physiological changes were common and sometimes severe.

AB  - Organ donation after cardiac death (DCD) is increasing markedly, allowing more patients to benefit from transplantation. The time to cardiac death following withdrawal of life-supporting treatment varies widely and is an important determinant of whether organ donation occurs. A prospective multicenter study of potential DCD donors was undertaken to evaluate the time to death and identify associated factors. One hundred and ninety-one potential adult DCD donors at nine UK centers were studied. Treatment withdrawal comprised stopping ventilator support and inotropes. Demographics and physiological variables at the time of death were recorded. Following treatment withdrawal, all potential donors died, with median time to death of 36 min (range 5 min to 3.3 days). Eighty-three potential donors (43.5%) remained alive 1 h after treatment withdrawal, and 69 (36.1%) and 54 (28.3%) at 2 and 4 h, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that age, cause of death, ventilation mode, inotrope use, systolic blood pressure, FiO2 and arterial pH at treatment withdrawal were all associated with time to death. Multivariable analysis showed that younger age, higher FiO2 and mode of ventilation were independently associated with shorter time to death. This information may aid planning and resourcing of DCD organ recovery and help maximize DCD donor numbers.

AB  - The MDO (Mehrdraht Dortmund Oberfläche) oxygen electrode was used in a study of skeletal muscle oxygen pressure fields. presented as histograms, in critically ill patients artificially ventilated with gas mixtures of different oxygen concentrations. The histograms were compared with forearm blood flow measurements performed with strain gauge plethysmography. Local blood flow and permeability-surface area product (PS) were also studied by the simultaneous clearances of 133xenon and 51 Cr-EDTA. The histogram distribution type was normal, i.e. approximately Gaussian, at arterial oxygen pressure levels between 10 and 18 kPa. At arterial oxygen pressures outside this range the histogram distribution types were abnormal, i.e. they showed a nonsymmetrical distribution of oxygen pressure values, but their mean was approximately the same as in the normal histogram. However, there were significantly higher tissue oxygen pressure mean values in the patients (3.43 kPa) than in a group of healthy human volunteers (2.25 kPa). Mean forearm blood flow and the clearances of 133 xenon and 51 Cr-EDTA showed marked variations during the measurements both intraindividually and interindividually. Mean forearm blood now and mean clearances of133 xenon showed opposite trends compared with arterial oxygen pressures. Mean clearances of 51 Cr-EDTA and mean PS showed only minor variations at the different arterial oxygen pressure levels.

AB  - Abstract The majority of oral surgery patients do not require the input of a critical care department (CCD). However, oral surgeons working in secondary care may be involved in the management of such patients. This may be due to surgical complications or sequelae (predicted or otherwise) or for medical reasons. Oral Surgery trainees working within Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments are likely to be involved in managing patients whose presenting condition necessitates care within a CCD. This article gives an overview of the reasons for use of a CCD and some of its functions.

AB  - Abstract Background Knowledge about patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) is lacking. Aims To evaluate whether the pattern of ALF would be similar to previous studies and whether, despite potentially low transplantation rates, mortality would be comparable. Methods We obtained data from the ANZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database and the ANZ Liver Transplant Registry for 10 years commencing 2005 and analysed for patient outcomes. Results During the study period, 1?022?698 adults were admitted to intensive care units across ANZ, of which 723 had ALF. The estimated annual incidence of ALF over this period was 3.4/million people and increased over time (P = 0.001). ALF patients had high illness severity (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III 79.8 vs 50.1 in non-ALF patients; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be younger, female, pregnant and immunosuppressed. ALF was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 1.5 (1.26?1.79); P < 0.0001). At less than 23%, the use of liver transplantation was low, but the mortality of 39% was similar to previous studies. Conclusions ALF is a rare but increasing diagnosis in ANZ intensive care units. Low transplantation rates in ANZ for ALF do not appear to be associated with higher mortality rates than reported in the literature.
