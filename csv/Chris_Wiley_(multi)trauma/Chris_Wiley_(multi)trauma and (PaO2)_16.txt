AB  - Abstract Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with hemodynamic instability has exceedingly high mortality. We describe our experience using percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with massive PE (MPE) and submassive PE (SPE). Methods Thirty-six patients (16 males and 20 females; mean age, 51.4?±?6.6 years) with massive and submassive PE were treated with PMT. All patients exhibited acute symptoms and computed tomography evidence of large thrombus burden and evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or failure. An Aspirex? percutaneous aspiration device was used in all patients. Clinical outcomes, hemodynamic recovery, RV and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), blood gas changes, thrombus clearance, and complications were evaluated. Results Treatment of 36 patients resulted in complete thrombus clearance (≥90%) in 83.3% of the patients (n?=?30) and near-complete (50% to 90%) clearance in 13.8%. Measurements before and after treatment showed a decrease in mean PAP (53?±?5.8?mmHg versus 25.6?±?6.3?mmHg in MPE group [p?<?0.01] and 46?±?7.7 versus 22?±?3.6 in SPE group [p?<?0.01]). One patient died from refractory shock. No cardiovascular deaths or recurrent PE were documented during clinical follow-up but one patient demonstrated evidence of mild cor pulmonale. Conclusions This study demonstrates safety and effectiveness of percutaneous mechanical aspiration thrombectomy in patients with massive and submassive PE with a large thrombus burden. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12521 (J Card Surg 2015;30:324?332)

AB  - Summary Deer are prone to rumenal tympany, regurgitation, hypoxemia, hyperthermia, and capture myopathy. The treatment of acute capture myopathy is directed at symptomatic treatment for shock, correcting acid?base disturbances, maintaining normothermia, and oxygenation. In zoo and game-farmed situations, deer may be effectively handled in drop-floor or hydraulic squeeze chutes. Free-ranging deer may be captured with the use of net guns, drive nets, or clover traps. This chapter gives an overview of pharmacological agents that can be used for anesthesia of deer. Attention must be paid to hunting seasons and appropriate marking of wild captured animals, to avoid consumption of drug residues in meat. Neuroleptics can be extremely useful in the management of wild and semi-domesticated deer. These drugs will facilitate transport of deer and will decrease stress in acutely captured deer. Chemical immobilization can be induced with opioids or alpha-2 agonists combined with dissociatives.

AB  - Serial thermodilution and impedance cardiac output measurements in two critically ill patients are presented. Impedance cardiography failed to detect changes in cardiac output and provided values lower than those derived from thermodilution. Chest X-ray examination and changes in thoracic impedance suggested that these two patients had significantly increased extravascular lung water. This failure of impedance cardiography is attributed to aberrant electrical conduction though the lungs as a result of increased lung fluid that alters the impedance waveform. Although reliable when used in normal subjects, impedance cardiography appears not to provide accurate measurements in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract Brain-dead donors are frequently hypovolemic and hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. We studied a stroke volume-based fluid resuscitation and vasopressor weaning protocol prospectively on 64 hypotensive donors, with a recent control cohort of 30 hypotensive donors treated without a protocol. Stroke volume was measured every 30 minutes for 4 hours by pulse contour analysis or esophageal Doppler. A 500 mL saline fluid bolus was infused over 30 minutes and repeated if the stroke volume increased by 10%. No fluid was infused if the stroke volume did not increase by 10%. Vasopressors were weaned every 10 minutes if the mean arterial pressure was greater than 65 mm Hg. The protocol group received 1937 ± 906 mL fluid compared to 1323 ± 919 mL in the control group (P = .003). Mean time on vasopressors was decreased from 957.6 ± 586.2 to 176.3 ± 82.2 minutes (P<.001). Donors in the protocol group were more likely to donate four or more organs than donors in the control group (OR = 4.114, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.003-16.876). While more organs were transplanted per donor in the protocol group (3.39 ± 1.52) than in the control group (2.93 ± 1.44) (P = .268), the difference did not reach statistical significance. A goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol decreased organ ischemia and may increase organs transplanted.

AB  - Abstract There is abundant evidence that artificial ventilation can aggravate pre-existing lung disease, which may contribute to morbidity and mortality. This is especially true for patients with air leakages. This case report describes the use of a pumpless extracorporeal lung assist as a rescue therapy to provide time to heal during the mechanical ventilation of a 16-year-old with cystic fibrosis who could not be managed via conventional means.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis (UACDT) in the treatment of patients with massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). Method Twenty-two patients (13 males and nine females; age range, 38 to 71 years; mean age, 53.7 years) with massive or submassive PE were treated with UACDT with the EKOS EkoSonic? system. All patients exhibited acute symptoms, computed tomography (CT) evidence of large thrombus burden, and evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or failure. Clinical outcomes and complications, RV pressures, and thrombus clearance were evaluated. Results Treatment of 22 patients resulted in complete thrombus clearance (≥90%) in 77.2% of the patients, and near-complete (50% to 90%) clearance in 22.8%. The median tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) dose for all patients in our study was 21.0?mg (range 16 to 35?mg) and the median infusion time was 20.5?hours (range 12 to 28?hours). Measurements before and after treatment showed a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (67?±?14 to 34?±?11?mmHg [systolic], p?<?0.001). The RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.29?±?0.17 to 0.92?±?0.11 at follow-up (p?<?0.001). Modified Miller score was significantly reduced (from 28?±?4 to 13?±?5, p?<?0.001) in 21 of 22 (95%) patients who survived to discharge. There were only two minor access site bleeding complications, neither requiring transfusion. Conclusion This study demonstrates safety and effectiveness of UACDT in patients with acute PE with a large thrombus burden. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12354 (J Card Surg 2014;29:455?463)
