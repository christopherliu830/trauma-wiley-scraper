AB  - Summary Development of an anesthetic protocol for any ophthalmic patient involves not only appropriate anesthetic drug selection, but also a management plan to ensure an optimal postoperative outcome. This requires knowledge of the patient's physical status and the specific ophthalmic procedure to be performed. It also requires familiarity with ophthalmic physiology and the effects of current ophthalmic medications. Selection of an anesthetic protocol for ophthalmic surgery should include consideration of the effects on intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil size, globe position, tear production, and the potential for initiation of the oculocardiac reflex (OCR) during surgical manipulation of the globe. Pupil size as an indicator of anesthetic depth is not reliable. Topical ophthalmic preparations are concentrated medications that may cause systemic side-effects, especially when administered to very small patients. The electroretinogram (ERG) is a widely used electrodiagnostic test in veterinary ophthalmology, with the flash ERG (FERG) being most useful in detecting diffuse retinal disorders.

AB  - The aim of specific monitoring in neuroanaesthesia is to detect, as quickly as possible, intraoperative ischaemic insults so that the brain and the spinal cord may be protected from harmful and frequently inevitable events due to the type of surgery, patient positioning, haemodynamic changes or any intercurrent event. New monitors are being introduced into the operating theatre, but only a few are considered to be an absolute standard of care in neurosurgery, e.g. facial nerve monitoring for surgery of acoustic neuromas and recording of evoked potentials during repair of scoliosis. In the past decade, new monitoring devices have moved from the experimental stage to the operating theatre and although most are still in a phase of technological development and/or definition of their field of applicability they are being used as guides for clinical practice in those instances where cerebral well-being might be impaired. The metabolic consequences of hyperventilation, pharmacological electroencephalogram burst suppression, hypothermia, etc. can now be assessed in the operating theatre. Non-invasive monitoring is being rapidly integrated into our daily work because of its lack of secondary effects. Nevertheless, each new development is regarded as an addition rather than as a substitute for existing equipment. The perfect combination of monitors to provide essential information during an individual surgical procedure to influence a better patient outcome, is still uncertain and needs extensive clinical research.

AB  - Background To evaluate the landscape of early extubation, and identify factors associated with early extubation (≤ 24 h) after superior cavopulmonary connection (stage 2 operation) among children with single ventricle anatomy. Methods Patients undergoing stage 2 operation after Norwood operation from the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial public-use dataset were included. Elastic net regularized logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the factors associated with early extubation after stage 2 operation. Results In total, 390 patients from 15 North American centers qualified for inclusion. Of these, 42 patients (10.8%) were extubated in operating room, 151 patients (38.7%) were extubated outside the operating room within the first 24 h after stage 2 operation, and the remaining 197 patients (50.5%) required mechanical ventilation for > 24 h. In adjusted models, factors associated with early extubation after stage 2 operation were elective timing of stage 2 operation, lower incidence of post-Norwood complications, shorter CPB duration for stage 2 operation, and no cardiac catheterization after Stage 2 operation. We also performed multiple other alternative analyses to identify factors associated with early extubation that demonstrated same associations as the primary model. The mean hospital length of stay after Stage 2 operation was 20% shorter among patients with early extubation. Conclusions Data from this large multicenter study demonstrate that approximately one-half of the patients undergoing operation for superior cavopulmonary connection are extubated within 24 h after heart operation. Furthermore, early extubation is associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2010; 64: 113?125 Problem? The amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) syndrome is a catastrophic complication of pregnancy frequently associated with maternal death. The causes and mechanisms of disease responsible for this syndrome remain elusive. Method of study? We report two cases of maternal deaths attributed to AFE: (1) one woman presented with spontaneous labor at term, developed intrapartum fever, and after delivery had sudden cardiovascular collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to death; (2) another woman presented with preterm labor and foul-smelling amniotic fluid, underwent a Cesarean section for fetal distress, and also had postpartum cardiovascular collapse and DIC, leading to death. Results? Of major importance is that in both cases, the maternal plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α at the time of admission to the hospital and when patients had no clinical evidence of infection was in the lethal range (a lethal range is considered to be above 0.1?ng/mL). Conclusion? We propose that subclinical intraamniotic infection may be a cause of postpartum cardiovascular collapse and DIC and resemble AFE. Thus, some patients with the clinical diagnosis of AFE may have infection/systemic inflammation as a mechanism of disease. These observations have implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of disease of patients who develop cardiovascular collapse and DIC, frequently attributed to AFE. It may be possible to identify a subset of patients who have biochemical and immunological evidence of systemic inflammation at the time of admission, and before a catastrophic event occurs.

AB  - Background This study investigated the clinical efficiency of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer. Methods The clinical data of 83 patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2016 to February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. ERAS was applied to 38 patients (ERAS group), while 45 patients received conventional surgical treatment (control group). The operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS), postoperative duration of chest tube placement, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the groups. Results Surgeries were conducted successfully in all patients, and no mortality occurred during the perioperative period. The ERAS group had better VAS on the third postoperative day, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter length of hospital stay (P?<?0.05). No differences between the groups in terms of operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, VAS on the first postoperative day, or complication rate were found (P?>?0.05). Conclusions ERAS using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for NSCLC patients is safe and practicable, and could also reduce the length of hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Objective Thoracic epidural analgesia provides effective pain control after lung transplantation; however, the optimal timing of placement is controversial. We sought to compare pain control and pulmonary and epidural morbidity between patients receiving preoperative vs postoperative epidurals. Methods Institutional records were reviewed for patients undergoing a bilateral lung transplant via a bilateral anterior thoracotomy with transverse sternotomy incision between January 2014 and January 2017. Pain control was measured using visual analog scale pain scores (0-10). Pulmonary complications included a composite of pneumonia, prolonged intubation, and reintubation/tracheostomy. Results Among 103 patients, 72 (70%) had an epidural placed preoperatively and 31 (30%) had an epidural placed within 72 hours posttransplant. There were no differences in the rates of cardiopulmonary bypass (3% vs 0%, P = 0.59); however, patients with a preoperative epidural were less likely to be placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation intraoperatively (25% vs 52%, P = 0.01). Pain control was similar at 24 hours (1.2 vs 1.7, P = 0.05); however, patients with a preoperative epidural reported lower pain scores at 48 (1.2 vs 2.1, P = 0.02) and 72 hours posttransplant (0.8 vs 1.7, P = 0.02). There were no differences in primary graft dysfunction (42% vs 56%, P = 0.28), length of mechanical ventilation (19.5 vs 24 hours, P = 0.18), or adverse pulmonary events (33% vs 52%, P = 0.12). No adverse events including epidural hematoma, paralysis, or infection resulted from epidural placement. Conclusion Preoperative thoracic epidural placement provides improved analgesia without increased morbidity following lung transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Lung hyperinflation is a technique used by physiotherapists to mobilize and remove excess bronchial secretions, reinflate areas of pulmonary collapse and improve oxygenation. Hyperinflation may be delivered by the ventilator or manually, by use of a manual resuscitation circuit, depending upon the respiratory and cardiovascular status of the patient. The effects of manual hyperinflation, with respect to excess bronchial secretions and static lung compliance, have been well-established. There is, however, only limited evidence as to the efficacy of ventilator hyperinflation as a physiotherapy treatment technique. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on static pulmonary compliance and sputum clearance in stable intubated and ventilated patients. Method Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied. This was a double crossover study where all patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences over two days. The first sequence involved manual hyperinflation followed two hours later by ventilator hyperinflation and the order was reversed on the second day. In the second sequence, ventilator hyperinflation preceded manual hyperinflation. The variables of static pulmonary compliance and sputum wet weight were analysed by use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results There was no significant difference in sputum wet weight production between either technique or on either day of treatment. Static pulmonary compliance improved with both hyperinflation techniques (p < 0.05). Conclusions Hyperinflation as part of a physiotherapy treatment can be performed with equal benefit using either a manual resuscitation circuit or a ventilator. Both methods of hyperinflation improve static pulmonary compliance and clear similar volumes of pulmonary secretions. Copyright ? 2002 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study was undertaken to determine whether intensive care unit nurses possess adequate knowledge to implement the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system and to understand nurses? attitudes towards this scoring system. Design.? A questionnaire, which contained 20 multiple-choice questions to test knowledge of the scoring system and 27 statements with a five-points Likert type scale to assess attitude, was developed by researchers for this study. Methods.? The participants consisted of 102 intensive care unit nurses working in adult, emergency, or coronary intensive care units in a large teaching hospital (Veterans General Hospital) in Taiwan, where the APACHE II scoring system is used routinely by nurses. Results.? On the knowledge section of the questionnaire, 76% of the questions were answered correctly. However, more than 50% of the nurses were uncertain about how to score a patient's chronic history status, only 44.1% of the nurses knew that APACHE II total scores range from 0 to 71, and only 37.3% understood that the value for bicarbonate in venous samples could replace the arterial pH value. The results of the attitude questionnaire revealed that nurses believed APACHE II was useful mainly for statistical purposes by the administration rather than for patient care, but acknowledged that the scores could provide a reference for more aggressive treatment. Conclusions.? The questionnaire answers indicated that greater knowledge concerning the APACHE II is needed. Relevance to clinical practice.? Information and training concerning the proper use and purpose of APACHE II needs to be provided, especially for those intensive care unit nurses using this evaluation tool to score patients? conditions routinely.

AB  - Background Isocapnic hyperventilation (IHV) is a method that shortens time to extubation after inhalation anaesthesia using hyperventilation (HV) without lowering airway CO2. In a clinical trial on patients undergoing long-duration sevoflurane anaesthesia for major ear?nose?throat (ENT) surgery, we evaluated the utility of a technique for CO2 delivery (DCO2) to the inspiratory limb of a closed breathing circuit, during HV, to achieve isocapnia. Methods Fifteen adult ASA 1?3 patients were included. After end of surgery, mechanical HV was started by doubling baseline minute ventilation. Simultaneously, CO2 was delivered and dosed using a nomogram developed in a previous experimental study. Time to extubation and eye opening was recorded. Inspired (FICO2) and expired (FETCO2) CO2 and arterial CO2 levels were monitored during IHV. Cognition was tested pre-operatively and at 20, 40 and 60 min after surgery. Results A DCO2 of 285 ± 45 ml/min provided stable isocapnia during HV (13.5 ± 4.1 l/min). The corresponding FICO2 level was 3.0 ± 0.3%. Time from turning off the vaporizer (1.3 ± 0.1 MACage) to extubation (0.2 ± 0.1 MACage) was 11.3 ± 1.8 min after 342 ± 131 min of anaesthesia. PaCO2 and FETCO2 remained at normal levels during and after IHV. In 85% of the patients, post-operative cognition returned to pre-operative values within 60 min. Conclusions In this cohort of patients, a DCO2 nomogram for IHV was validated. The patients were safely extubated shortly after discontinuing long-term sevoflurane anaesthesia. Perioperatively, there were no adverse effects on arterial blood gases or post-operative cognition. This technique for IHV can potentially be used to decrease emergence time from inhalation anaesthesia.
