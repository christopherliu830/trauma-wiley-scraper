AB  - Background Post-arrest variables associated with long-term survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients remain unclear. This study was designed to identify pre- and intra-arrest factors associated with survival 3 months after CPR in ICU patients and to identify post-arrest factors associated with long-term survival in those who survived 24?h after CPR. Methods A total of 131 ICU patients undergoing CPR from January 2009 to June 2010 were included. Data were retrospectively analysed and categorized based on the Utstein template. Results The overall survival rate 3 months after CPR was 20.6%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 0.87 [0.83?0.93]; P?<?0.001), ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF, 5.55 [1.55?19.83]; P?=?0.032), and normoxia during CPR (4.45 [1.34?14.71]; P?=?0.045) were significant independent pre- and intra-arrest predictors of 3-month survival after CPR in ICU patients. Fifty-seven patients survived 24?h after CPR, and their 3-month survival rate was 47.4%. Early enteral nutrition (9.94 [1.96?50.43]; P?=?0.030) and normoxia after return of spontaneous circulation (10.75 [2.03?55.56]; P?=?0.030) were predictive of 3-month survival in patients who survived 24?h after CPR. Conclusions Normoxia during CPR and VT/VF were predictors of long-term survival after CPR in ICU patients. In patients surviving 24?h after CPR, initiation of enteral nutrition within 48?h and maintenance of normoxia were associated with a positive outcome.

AB  - Summary Anesthesia is a very complex, dynamic domain that is labor intensive, can be equipment intensive, and requires accuracy and attention to detail for a good outcome. Errors and unforeseen events occur with low frequency, catastrophic events usually cannot be predicted, and mistakes are not always reversible. Derangements of cardiovascular function occur commonly in most species under anesthesia. Treatment of hypotension should be aimed at the probable cause, but generally should start with a reduction in anesthetic depth and a fluid bolus. Cardiac dysrhythmias occur in >60% of human patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery, and seem as prevalent in animal patients. Treatment involves correcting any obvious physiologic abnormalities (low pH, hypercarbia, hypoxia, electrolyte derangements such as low K+) and administering antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., lidocaine or procainamide). When tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension are present, oxygen, IV fluids, IV antihistamines (diphenhydramine), and corticosteroids are indicated for treatment and occasionally epinephrine and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will be necessary.

AB  - Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by an infection in the urogenital tract (Table 1). In urosepsis, as in other types of sepsis, the severity of sepsis depends mostly upon the host response. Patients who are more likely to develop urosepsis include elderly patients; diabetics; immunosuppressed patients, such as transplant recipients; cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids; and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndromes. However, all patients can be affected by bacterial species capable of inducing inflammation within the urinary tract.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The critical care experience is particularly stressful for patients, which can result in a number of physiological and psychological consequences, including haemodynamic instability, increased pain, agitation and delirium, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation, length of stay and subsequent complications. Massage therapy encompasses different techniques to promote relaxation and to counter stress, therefore potentially affecting several patients' outcomes. Aims To systematically review evidence on the effects of massage on outcomes of adult critically ill patients. The outcome measures included pain, vital signs (VS), haemodynamic measurements, level of consciousness, sleep quality, muscle tension, anxiety, feelings of calm and relaxation, coping, arterial blood gases and serum biomarkers. Method This was a systematic review based on focused literature searches (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE-Ovid databases, Google Scholar). The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Eligibility criteria included published experimental and quasi-experimental studies reporting on the physiological and psychological outcomes of critically ill patients. Results Based on the selection criteria, 12 studies were included in the review. The main findings are as follows: 8 of 12 studies used randomized control designs with high internal validity, and there was a high level of evidence of favourable effects with respect to improvements in VS and a reduction in pain and anxiety. Outcomes that need to be more rigorously pursued include quality of sleep, analgesic and sedative dosages and level of consciousness. Conclusion The results suggest that massage interventions can have positive effects on critically ill patients' outcomes. However, there are several gaps in the literature, along with methodological limitations, that require further consideration in critical care settings. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this systematic review can inform implementation of massage interventions in critical care, which can be challenging as a result of several barriers.

AB  - Abstract Oxygen monitoring has been a topic of exhaustive study given its central role in the biochemistry of life. The ability to quantify the physiological distribution and real-time dynamics of oxygen from sub-cellular to macroscopic levels is required to fully understand the mechanisms associated with both normal physiology and disease states. This Review will present the most significant recent advances in the development of oxygen-sensing materials and techniques, including polarographic, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance, and optical approaches, that can be applied specifically for the real-time monitoring of oxygen dynamics in cellular and tissue environments. As some of the most exciting recent advances in synthetic methods and biomedical applications have been in the field of optical oxygen sensors, a major focus will be on the development of these toolkits.

AB  - The dynamics of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response are dependent on changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. Furthermore, the amplitude of the response is dependent on the baseline physiological state, defined by the haematocrit, oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume. As a result of this complex dependence, the accurate interpretation of BOLD data and robust intersubject comparisons when the baseline physiology is varied are difficult. The calibrated BOLD technique was developed to address these issues. However, the methodology is complex and its full promise has not yet been realised. In this review, the theoretical underpinnings of calibrated BOLD, and issues regarding this theory that are still to be resolved, are discussed. Important aspects of practical implementation are reviewed and reported applications of this methodology are presented. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
