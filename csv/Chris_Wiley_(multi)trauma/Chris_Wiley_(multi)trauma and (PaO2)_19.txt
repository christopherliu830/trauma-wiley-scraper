AB  - Abstract Objectives Our objective was to determine survival and variables associated with poor outcomes for patients requiring high frequency oscillatory ventilator (HFOV) support. We tested the ability of markers of oxygenation to predict outcome, specifically, the oxygenation index (OI), both prior to and after initiation of HFOV. We also aimed to examine the effect of immunocompromised condition (IC), and specifically stem cell transplant (SCT), on outcome. Design A retrospective, observational study was performed at two pediatric intensive care units (ICU) and included patients treated with HFOV over a 5 year time period. Oxygenation index and PF ratios were calculated for all patients prior to and at 24?h of HFOV support. Results Of the 134 patients meeting inclusion criteria, mortality was 42% with a higher rate of mortality (P?<?0.001) for both immunocompromised (66%) and SCT patients (83%). Survivors had improved markers of oxygenation at 24?h as compared to non-survivors (P?<?0.001). IC and SCT were the variables most closely associated with mortality. Survivors were placed on HFOV earlier than non-survivors. The OI at 24?h of HFOV support was the best predictor of mortality among markers of oxygenation. Conclusions In this cohort of patients, use of HFOV for pediatric respiratory failure demonstrated a mortality rate in keeping with published data. The presence of an immunocompromised condition was a risk factor for mortality in severe respiratory failure with SCT recipients having the lowest survival rate. The OI at 24?h was the best predictor of mortality, especially in immunocompromised and SCT patients.

AB  - Abstract Combining simultaneously lung and liver procurement in controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) using normothermic abdominal perfusion (NRP) for abdominal grafts and cooling and rapid recovery technique (RR) for the lungs increases the complexity of the procurement procedure and might injure the grafts. A total of 19 cDCDs from two centers using this combined procedure were evaluated, and 16 liver and 21 lung transplantations were performed. As controls, 34 donors after brain death (DBDs) were included (29 liver and 41 lung transplantations were performed). Two cDCD liver recipients developed primary nonfunction (12.5%). No cases of ischemic cholangiopathy were observed among cDCD recipients. The 1-year and 2-year liver recipients survival was 87.5% and 87.5% for the cDCD group, and 96% and 84.5% for the DBD group, respectively (P = .496). The 1-year and 2-year lung recipients survival was 84% and 84% for the cDCD group and 90% and 90% for the DBD group, respectively (P = .577). This is the largest experience ever reported in cDCD with the use of NRP combined with RR of the lungs. This combined method offers an outstanding recovery rate and liver and lung recipients survival comparable with those transplanted with DBDs. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review clinically relevant features of systemic oxygen delivery and consumption and the technique and use of venous oxygenation monitoring in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources Veterinary and human peer-reviewed medical literature including scientific reviews, clinical and laboratory research articles, and authors? clinical research experience. Summary Measurement of venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (venous oxygenation) provides insight into the balance between oxygen supply and tissue demand. In people, measurement of venous oxygen saturation can reveal decompensation that is missed by physical examination and other routinely monitored parameters. Therefore, measurement of mixed or central venous oxygenation measurement may help guide therapy and predict outcome of critically ill patients. In dogs, low central venous oxygen saturation has been associated with impaired cardiopulmonary function and poor outcome in several small studies of experimental shock or severe clinical illness, suggesting that monitoring this variable may assist the treatment of severe illness in this species as well. Conclusion Venous oxygenation reflects systemic oxygenation status and can be used to guide treatment and estimate prognosis in critically ill patients. Measurement of venous oxygenation in veterinary patients is feasible and is a potentially valuable tool in the management of patients with severe disease. This review is intended to increase the understanding and awareness of the potential role of venous oxygen measurement in veterinary patients.

AB  - Summary Pyloric stenosis (PS) is one of the most common surgical conditions affecting neonates and young infants. The definitive treatment for PS is surgical pyloromyotomy, either open or laparoscopic. However, surgical intervention should never be considered urgent or emergent. More importantly, emergent medical intervention may be required to correct intravascular volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances. Given advancements in surgical and perioperative care, morbidity and mortality from PS should be limited. However, either may occur related to poor preoperative resuscitation, anesthetic management difficulties, or postoperative complications. The following manuscript reviews the current evidence-based medicine regarding the perioperative care of infants with PS with focus on the preoperative assessment and correction of metabolic abnormalities, intraoperative care including airway management (particularly debate related to rapid sequence intubation), maintenance anesthetic techniques, and techniques for postoperative pain management. Additionally, reports of applications of regional anesthesia for either postoperative pain control or as an alternative to general anesthesia are discussed. Management recommendations are provided whenever possible.

AB  - Abstract Hypoxic hepatitis (HH), an acute liver injury also known as ?ischaemic hepatitis? or ?shock liver?, is frequently observed in intensive care units. HH is heralded by a massive but transient rise in serum aminotransferase activities caused by anoxic necrosis of centrilobular liver cells. Cardiac failure, respiratory failure and toxic-septic shock are the main underlying conditions accounting for more than 90% of cases, but HH may also occur in other circumstances. Until recently, liver ischaemia, i.e. a drop in hepatic blood flow, was considered the leading, and even the sole, hemodynamic mechanism responsible for HH, and it was generally held that a shock state was required. In reality, other hemodynamic mechanisms of hypoxia, such as passive congestion of the liver, arterial hypoxaemia and dysoxia, play an important role while a shock state is observed in only 50% of cases. Accordingly, ?ischaemic hepatitis? and ?shock liver? are misnomers. Therapy of HH depends primarily on the nature of the underlying condition. The prognosis is poor, with more than half of patients dying during the hospital stay.

AB  - Summary Septic shock is characterized by an inability of the host to maintain vascular integrity and fluid homeostasis, resulting in inadequate tissue oxygenation and circulatory failure. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) describes a generalized inflammatory response of the host to a variety of insults. SIRS is considered a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. Disruption of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is a well-recognized component of septic shock. The clinical spectrum of sepsis depends primarily on the host response to infection rather than the severity of the infection itself. The pregnant host may be different from the traditional septic shock host in ways other than the difference in microbiologic pathogens involved. Physiologic adaptations to pregnancy designed to promote favorable maternal and fetal outcome occur in almost every organ system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 50 percent of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare but important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity. Predicting the severity and outcome of AP in pediatric patients can be challenging because there are few validated severity scoring systems. Moreover, the etiology of pediatric AP in the Japanese population is different from that of Western populations. The performance of severity scores in pediatric AP with a high prevalence of severe cases is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of existing severity scoring systems when used for Japanese children at a tertiary care center. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of all children (≤18?years) treated for AP at between 2002 and 2012 at National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo. The modified Glasgow acute pancreatitis severity score (modified Glasgow), Ranson criteria (Ranson), Balthazar computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and pediatric acute pancreatitis severity (PAPS) score were assessed for their ability to distinguish severe pancreatitis from the milder forms. Results Thirty-three Japanese children with AP were identified. Among them, 37 episodes were analyzed for the performance of the scoring systems and 33 for the etiology. The most common etiology of AP was structural abnormality (n = 8). Sensitivity for the modified Glasgow, Ranson, PAPS, and CTSI was 42.9%, 52.4%, 81.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, while specificity was 81.3%, 81.3%, 37.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Conclusion We found PAPS to be the most reliable when used for discriminating the severe form of AP from the milder forms at a Japanese tertiary pediatric care center.
