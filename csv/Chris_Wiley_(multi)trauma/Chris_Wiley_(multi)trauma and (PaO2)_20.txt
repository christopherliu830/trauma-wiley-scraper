AB  - Machine perfusion (MP) has been used as the kidney preservation method in our center for over 10 years. The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a simple and novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) technique, nasopharyngeal oxygen with intermittent nose-close and abdomen-compression (NPO2-NC-AC) in an animal model. Design: Prospective piglet study. Setting: In an animal physiology laboratory of a medical university. Piglets: Six healthy piglets <14 days old. Interventions: Spontaneous breathing of the anesthetized piglets (n?=?6) was medically ceased until severe bradycardia (<20?beat/min). NPO2-NC-AC CPR trial was then initiated by delivering NPO2 at 1.0?1.5?L/kg/min and intermittently performing the NC-AC maneuver: (1) NC for inspiration, occluded nostrils for 1?sec; and (2) AC for expiration, released nostrils, and compressed the abdomen for 1?sec. NC-AC was repeated at a rate of 30/min for 5?min. This CPR trial was repeated three times in each piglet. Cardiopulmonary variables were monitored, recorded, and compared. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 18 CPR trials were performed. All of these acute life-threatening asphyxia events rapidly improved within 1?min of CPR. Cardiopulmonary variables recovered to the baseline levels and oxygenation continually increased. The intratracheal pressure (Ptr) values of positive end expiratory pressure and peak inspiratory pressure values were 4.3?±?0.8?cmH2O and 26.2?±?4.1?cmH2O, respectively. Chest wall movement was observed when the Ptr reached 17.5?±?3.1?cmH2O. All six piglets fully recovered after 63.8?±?7.2?min of experiment without additional support. Conclusions: NPO2-NC-AC is a simple and effective CPR technique for severe acute cardiopulmonary asphyxia in piglets. It may be clinically applicable for supportive or rescue use.

AB  - Abstract Inherent recipient factors, including pretransplant diagnosis, obesity and elevated pulmonary pressures, are established primary graft dysfunction (PGD) risks. We evaluated the relationship between preoperative lung injury biomarkers and PGD to gain further mechanistic insight in recipients. We performed a prospective cohort study of recipients in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group enrolled between 2002 and 2010. Our primary outcome was Grade 3 PGD on Day 2 or 3. We measured preoperative plasma levels of five biomarkers (CC-16, sRAGE, ICAM-1, IL-8 and Protein C) that were previously associated with PGD when measured at the postoperative time point. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Of 714 subjects, 130 (18%) developed PGD. Median CC-16 levels were elevated in subjects with PGD (10.1 vs. 6.0, p?<?0.001). CC-16 was associated with PGD in nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) subjects (OR for highest quartile of CC-16: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.37, 6.00, p?=?0.005) but not in subjects with IPF (OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.43, 4.45, p?=?0.59). After adjustment, preoperative CC-16 levels remained associated with PGD (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 7.30, p?=?0.013) in non-IPF subjects. Our study suggests the importance of preexisting airway epithelial injury in PGD. Markers of airway epithelial injury may be helpful in pretransplant risk stratification in specific recipients.

AB  - Summary Occupational health and safety in veterinary hospitals is a topic not always routinely considered but one that is of utmost importance. This chapter first gives an overview of common hazards and how to prevent them. Regular training, revision of safety procedures, plain old hand washing and common sense will help keep the workplace productive and healthy. The veterinary technician plays a very important role in the administration of medications. It is imperative that the veterinary technician has a full understanding of and the ability to relay information on; the indications for use, pharmacokinetics, contraindications, precautions, safety issues, adverse effects, drug interactions, and monitoring parameters of the medications they encounter in practice. Recognizing signs of pain and advocating pain management is a paramount element of patient care. It is well recognized that patients, both veterinary and human, suffer from longer hospital stays, greater complications, and increased mortality when pain is not controlled.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of BHT, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic stroke in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties. In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats. Methods? Sprague?Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion. mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15?min before and 15?min after, or orally once 30?min or 120?min after the onset of MCAO (50 or 200?mg/kg each). Key findings? Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion. mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury. Oral administration of mBHT 30?min after ischaemia also markedly reduced the infarct size after cerebral ischaemia. The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced hypothermia was abolished. In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3. However, mBHT did not inhibit N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Conclusions? Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke.

AB  - Common peripheral neuropathies do not usually cause diaphragmatic weakness and subsequent respiratory compromise. However, respiratory involvement is relatively common in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Experience in GBS has led to a standardized approach to manage respiratory problems in peripheral neuropathies. Diaphragmatic weakness is not common in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and extremely rare in multifocal motor neuropathy. The linkage has been described between certain subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease such as CMT2C and CMT4B1 and diaphragmatic weakness. A correlation usually has not been found between electrophysiologic findings and clinical respiratory signs or spirometric abnormalities in peripheral neuropathies except in amplitudes of evoked phrenic nerve responses. Careful and frequent assessment of respiratory function by a qualified team of healthcare professionals and physicians is essential. Criteria established for mechanical ventilation in GBS cases may be applied to other peripheral neuropathies with respiratory compromise as necessary.

AB  - Summary This study prospectively evaluates whether a previously established adverse outcome score (the Geneva prognostic score) predicts 3 and 12-month overall mortality among the patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) by a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Five hundred twenty-three consecutive patients who had CTPA for suspected PE were recruited prospectively from March 2003 to October 2004. The Geneva prognostic score was calculated for all patients. Twelve-month follow up was completed in all patients in December 2005. There were 105 patients diagnosed with PE. The mean score was 2.71 (standard deviation (SD) 1.25) for those patients who had died (n?=?7) and 1.14 (SD 1.19) for those patients who were alive (n?=?98) at 3-month follow up (P?<?0.001). The mean scores were 2.69 (SD 0.95) for those who had died (n?=?13) and 1.04 (SD 1.15) for those patients who were alive (n?=?92) at 12-month follow up (P?<?0.001). At 3-month follow up, among the 88 patients with a score of 2 or less, three patients (3.4%) died and among 17 patients with a score of greater than 2, four patients (23.5%) died (P?=?0.01). At 12-month follow up, five patients (5.7%) with a score of 2 or less died and eight patients (47.1%) with a score of three or more died (P?<?0.0001). The Geneva prognostic score stratifies patients with low and high risk for overall mortality at 3 and 12?months among patients diagnosed with PE by CTPA.
