AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the anesthetic management of a dog undergoing caudal vena cava (CVC) occlusion during adrenalectomy, and to discuss a reflex bradycardia that was observed during the procedure. Case Summary General anesthesia of a 10-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback for excision of an adrenal mass and associated CVC tumor thrombus was performed. The dog was premedicated with IV methadone and anesthesia was induced with IV alfaxalone and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. An IV remifentanil infusion was administered for intraoperative analgesia. Surgical removal of the thrombus necessitated temporary complete occlusion of the CVC. During CVC occlusion an acute paradoxical bradycardia occurred, which was successfully treated with IV atropine. The cardiovascular change resembled a Bezold?Jarisch or reverse Bainbridge reflex, and was believed to be mediated by cardiac mechanoreceptors following the sudden decrease in preload. Increased myocardial contractility subsequent to increased sympathetic nervous system activity may also have contributed. A decrease in urine output was observed following CVC occlusion but had returned to normal 2 hours following the end of anesthesia. Recovery from anesthesia was otherwise uneventful. New or unique information provided Although the mechanism is unclear, a paradoxical bradycardia may occur during complete CVC occlusion in the dog. Factors that increase sympathetic nervous system outflow, such as administration of dopamine, may have contributed to the occurrence of the reflex.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for most severe acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in specialized centers. Hemocompatibility of devices depends on the size and modification of blood contacting surfaces as well as blood flow rates. An interventional lung assist using arteriovenous perfusion of a low-resistance oxygenator without a blood pump (Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) or a miniaturized ECMO with reduced filling volume and a diagonal blood pump (Deltastream, Medos AG, Stolberg, Germany) could optimize hemocompatibility. The aim of the study was to compare hemocompatibility with conventional ECMO. Female pigs were connected to extracorporeal circulation for 24?h after lavage induced lung injury (eight per group). Activation of coagulation and immune system as well as blood cell damage was measured. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Plasmatic coagulation was slightly activated in all groups demonstrated by increased thrombin-anti-thrombin III-complex. No clinical signs of bleeding or thromboembolism occurred. Thrombelastography revealed decreased clotting capacities after miniaturized ECMO, probably due to significantly reduced platelet count. These resulted in reduced dosage of intravenous heparin. Scanning electron microscopy of oxygenator fibers showed significantly increased binding and shape change of platelets after interventional lung assist. In all groups, hemolysis remained negligible, indicated by low plasma hemoglobin concentration. Interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentration as well as leukocyte count remained unchanged. Both devices demonstrated adequate hemocompatibility for safe clinical application, although a missing blood pump did not increase hemocompatibility. Further studies seem necessary to analyze the influence of different blood pumps on platelet drop systematically.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To find out if the severity of acute pancreatitis or the surgical treatment of severe acute pancreatitis influences HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Design: Prospective open study. Setting: University hospital, Austria. Subjects: 9 consecutive patients with severe acute pancreatitis in need of operative treatment, 5 patients with mild acute pancreatitis, and 7 healthy volunteers. Interventions: Samples of 5 ml blood were taken daily into endotoxin free tubes at same time points. Surgical treatment for severe acute pancreatitis consisted of blunt necrosectomy, operative lavage, laparostomy, and open drainage. Main outcome measures: Correlation between HLA-DR and CD14 expression on peripheral blood monocytes on the one hand and the severity of acute pancreatitis and operative treatment of severe acute pancreatitis, on the other. Results: In patients with severe acute pancreatitis expression of HLA-DR and CD14 was significantly downregulated both before and after operation (p < 0.0001; ANOVA), compared with patients with mild acute pancreatitis or healthy controls. However the expression of the two cell surface markers was not affected either by the first operation, or by the reoperations. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in acute pancreatitis the expression of cell surface markers on peripheral blood monocytes is related to the severity of disease but is not influenced by operative treatment.

AB  - Abstract The optimal staffing model during the inter-hospital transfer of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is not known. We report the complications and outcomes of patients who were commenced on ECMO at a referring hospital by intensive care physicians and compare these findings with patients who had ECMO established at an ECMO center in Australia. This was a single center, retrospective observational study based on a prospectively collected ECMO database from Melbourne, Australia. Patients with severe cardiac and/or respiratory failure failing conventional supportive treatment between 2007?2013 were placed on ECMO via a physician-led model of ECMO retrieval, including two intensivists in a four person team, using percutaneous ECMO cannulation. Patients (198) underwent ECMO over the study period, of which 31% were retrieved. Veno-venous (VV)-ECMO and veno-arterial (VA)-ECMO accounted for 27 and 73% respectively. The VA-ECMO patients had more intra-transport interventions compared with VV-ECMO transported patients, but none resulting in serious morbidity or death. There was no overall difference in survival at 6 months between retrieved and ECMO center patients: VV-ECMO (75 vs. 70%, P?=?0.690) versus VA-ECMO (70 vs. 68%, P?=?1.000). An intensive care physician-led team was able to safely place all critically ill patients on ECMO and retrieve them to an ECMO center. This may be an appropriate staffing model for ECMO retrieval.

AB  - Summary In veterinary medicine, animals living at, or beyond, 75% of their life expectancy, are considered geriatric, but these geriatric patients will typically experience pain as any ?average aged? patient would. While physical changes associated with ageing may be common in the geriatric patient, some older animals may not exhibit these changes. Regardless of this sympathetic change, geriatric animals typically have other functional and anatomical changes within the central nervous system that may reduce their requirement for all analgesic drug classes. Therefore, required dosing of analgesics, including opioids, should be based on careful titration and close monitoring for response to treatment. The ageing cardiovascular changes should not be assumed in all geriatric patients as some are extremely fit and maintain an appropriate cardiac index for the reduced muscle mass and metabolic rate. Exercise tolerance is an important positive predictor of a successful anesthetic outcome.
