AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010; 32: 233?243 Summary Background? Hospital admissions for cirrhosis have been increasing in the United Kingdom, leading to increased pressure on intensive care (ICU) services. Outcome data for patients admitted to ICU are currently limited to transplant centre reports, with mortality rates exceeding 70%. These tertiary reports could fuel a negative bias when patients with cirrhosis are reviewed for ICU admission in secondary care. Aims? To determine whether disease severity and mortality rates in non-transplant general ICU are less severe than those reported by tertiary datasets. Methods? A prospective dual-centre non-transplant ICU study. Admissions were screened for cirrhosis and physiological and biochemical data were collected. Disease-specific and critical illness scoring systems were evaluated. Results? Cirrhosis was present in 137/4198 (3.3%) of ICU admissions. ICU and hospital mortality were 38% and 47%, respectively; median age 50 [43?59] years, 68% men, 72% alcoholic cirrhosis, median Child Pugh Score (CPS) 10 [8?11], Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 18 [12?24], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II) 16 [13?22]. Conclusions? Mortality rates and disease staging were notably lower than in the published literature, suggesting that patients have a more favourable outlook than previously considered. Transplant centre data should therefore be interpreted with caution when evaluating the merits of intensive care admission for patients in general secondary care ICUs.

AB  - Background Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF) is a recently described form of interstitial pneumonia associated with the presence of equine herpesvirus type 5 (EHV-5). Since 2007, several case reports from America, Europe and the United Kingdom have further characterised the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of this disease. Case reports Three Thoroughbred broodmares were diagnosed with EMPF. Diagnosis was based on lung histopathology and positive identification of EHV-5 using PCR DNA amplification. There was multiple organ involvement in all three cases, including identification of EHV-5 in hepatic tissue in one case. Two of the three horses died. Treatment with acyclovir was unsuccessful in one horse and one horse survived without antiviral or corticosteroid treatment. Conclusion This case series is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report of EMPF in Australia and adds to the clinical description of the disease.

AB  - Summary In contrast with the extensive and uniform documentation dealing with the short-term outcome of the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities and of pulmonary embolism (PE), sparse and conflicting results are available concerning the long-term clinical course of these diseases. The natural history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the risk of death, which often complicates the evolution of patients with severe or misclassified PE; the risk of recurrent events, which is particularly common in patients with DVT involving the proximal vein system with or without contemporary manifestations of PE; the risk of long-term sequelae, namely the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT, and the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in those presenting with PE; the risk of subsequent overt cancer, which is particularly frequent in the first months following an episode of unprovoked VTE; and the risk of arterial cardiovascular events, which is more common in the first year after the thrombotic episode but persists, although to a lesser extent, for longer periods of time. In this chapter, factors than can help predict the development of these complications in patients with VTE are extensively analysed.

AB  - Abstract Aim To assess the effects of probiotics on serum ghrelin levels and protection for lungs in children with acute lung injury (ALI). Methods This study was performed as a double-blind, randomized, and controlled trial in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The eligible children with ALI were assigned to either probiotic treatment or an identical placebo for 10 days. Serum ghrelin, SP-A(surfactant protein-A), TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations were assessed at baseline and at the end of trial. Meanwhile, pulmonary function test and echocardiography were examined, then VPEF (volume to peak tidal expiratory flow), TPEF/TE (the ratio of time taken to reach peak expiratory flow to total expiratory time), MAP (mean arterial pressure), and PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) were recorded. Results Eighty participants fulfilled the study requirements with 40 children for each group. The groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. Serum SP-A, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the probiotic group were 212.6?±?52.9?ng/mL, 401.9?±?56.4?pg/mL, and 245.1?±?55.1?pg/mL on day 10, respectively, significantly lower levels compared to the control group where the same parameters were 248.2?±?57?ng/mL, 449.4?±?60.1?pg/mL, and 308.3?±?92.2?pg/mL (P?<?0.01). However, ghrelin concentrations were elevated in the intervention group (P?<?0.05). On measurement of pulmonary function, the probiotic group demonstrated a VPEF of 26.1?±?4.2?mL and TPEF/TE of 29.1?±?4.7%, which were higher than the control group (24.7?±?4.3?mL and 26.9?±?4.7%, respectively) (P?<?0.05). MAP and PAP also improved in the probiotic group (P?<?0.05). Furthermore, ghrelin, SP-A, TNF-α, IL-6, and PAP were negatively correlated. Positive correlations were found between ghrelin, TPEF/TE, and MAP. There were no probiotic-associated adverse events during the observation. Conclusion Probiotics administrated to children with ALI alleviates the inflammation of lungs, improves pulmonary function and circulation by ghrelin.

AB  - Summary Background The recently introduced TOSCA monitor (Linde Medical Sensors AG, Basel, Switzerland) combines pulse oximetry (SpO2) and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) monitoring in a single ear sensor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate accuracy of the TOSCA monitor to estimate SaO2 and PaCO2 in anaesthetized children. Methods With approval of the hospital ethical committee and after obtaining informed parental consent, the TOSCA sensor was attached to one ear lobe of anaesthetized children in whom arterial access was established for cardiac catheterization or invasive blood pressure monitoring. SpO and PtcCO2 as well as SpO and PECO2 values from the anaesthesia monitoring (AS5; Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) were compared with SaO2 and PaCO2 values from arterial blood gas analysis. Corresponding data were compared using Bland Altman bias analysis. Results A total of 111 blood samples were taken from 60 children (median age: 4.41 years; 0.35?16.13 years). SaO2 values ranged from 63 to 100% (median: 98.7%), PaCO2 ranged from 3.8 to 7.3?kPa (median: 4.6?kPa). Mean difference (±2 sd) between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was ?0.035?kPa (±0.74?kPa), between PaCO2 and PECO2 0.002?kPa (0.73?kPa), respectively (1?kPa?=?7.3?mmHg). Bias and precision between SaO2 and SpO was ?0.63% (±2.77%) and 0.13% (±4.52%) between SaO2 and SpO. Conclusions In anaesthetized children, the TOSCA ear sensor allows estimation of SaO2 and PaCO2, comparable in accuracy to endtidal capnometry and finger pulse oximetry. This makes the TOSCA monitor a helpful add-on to respiratory monitoring in anaesthetized children, in situations, in which endtidal capnometry is unreliable or difficult to establish.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Febrile neutropenia is a frequently encountered complication when caring for cancer patients and can lead to intensive care admission, with high mortality rates in those patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Although hospital survival in this population has improved, long term outcomes of critically ill neutropenic cancer patients have not been well defined. Objectives To evaluate short- and long-term outcomes of neutropenic cancer patients admitted to intensive care, according to requirement for invasive ventilation. Additionally, we aimed to determine predictors of poor clinical outcomes in this group. Methods A retrospective cohort study of neutropenic cancer patients admitted to our ICU from 2008-2016. Results We included 192 cancer patients of whom 100 (52.1%) required IMV. Overall ICU mortality was 29.7% and 12-month post-ICU mortality was 61.5%. Patients requiring IMV had significantly higher short- and long-term mortality (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis determined three variables to be predictors of mortality at ICU discharge in the whole cohort: IMV (OR 13.52), renal replacement therapy (RRT, OR 2.37) and higher APACHE II scores (OR 1.1 for each unit increase). These variables were identical in the subgroup requiring invasive ventilation, with RRT (OR 2.76) and APACHE II scores (OR 1.1 for each unit increase) predicting short-term mortality. Conclusions Neutropenic cancer patients admitted to ICU have lower short-term mortality than previously reported in cohort studies, however their mortality rises significantly following discharge from ICU. Those patients who require IMV are at significantly increased risk of both short- and long-term mortality. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), manifested by intricate etiology and pathophysiology, demands careful clinical surveillance due to its high mortality and imminent life support measures. NMR based metabolomics provides an approach for ARDS which culminates from a wide spectrum of illness thereby confounding early manifestation and prognosis predictors. 1H NMR with its manifold applications in critical disease settings can unravel the biomarker of ARDS thus holding potent implications by providing surrogate endpoints of clinical utility. NMR metabolomics which is the current apogee platform of omics trilogy is contributing towards the possible panacea of ARDS by subsequent validation of biomarker credential on larger datasets. In the present review, the physiological derangements that jeopardize the whole metabolic functioning in ARDS are exploited and the biomarkers involved in progression are addressed and substantiated. The following sections of the review also outline the clinical spectrum of ARDS from the standpoint of NMR based metabolomics which is an emerging element of systems biology. ARDS is the main premise of intensivists textbook, which has been thoroughly reviewed along with its incidence, progressive stages of severity, new proposed diagnostic definition, and the preventive measures and the current pitfalls of clinical management. The advent of new therapies, the need for biomarkers, the methodology and the contemporary promising approaches needed to improve survival and address heterogeneity have also been evaluated. The review has been stepwise illustrated with potent biometrics employed to selectively pool out differential metabolites as diagnostic markers and outcome predictors. The following sections have been drafted with an objective to better understand ARDS mechanisms with predictive and precise biomarkers detected so far on the basis of underlying physiological parameters having close proximity to diseased phenotype. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in conducting more studies to help resolve the complex heterogeneity of ARDS with biomarkers of clinical utility and relevance.
