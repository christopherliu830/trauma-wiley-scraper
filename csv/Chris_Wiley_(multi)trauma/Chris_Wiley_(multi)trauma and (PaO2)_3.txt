AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in infants and children with acute lung injury (ALI), and to investigate associations between BNP levels and clinical outcome. Design Prospective observational study. Subjects After informed consent, plasma was collected from 48 pediatric patients on day 1 of ALI. Methodology Plasma BNP levels were measured by immunoassay on day 1 of ALI in 48 pediatric patients. Associations between BNP levels and outcome were determined. Results The mean PaO2/FiO2 at the onset of ALI was 155 (±74) and BNP values ranged from 5 to 2,060?pg/ml with a mean of 109 (±311). BNP levels were inversely correlated with ventilator-free days (Spearman rho ?0.30, P?=?0.04), and positively correlated with exhaled tidal volume (Spearman rho 0.44, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were higher in patients receiving inotropic support (n?=?12) than patients not receiving inotropic support (n?=?33, P?=?0.02). BNP levels were correlated with PRISM III scores (Spearman rho 0.55, P?<?0.001) and PELOD scores (Spearman rho 0.4, P?=?0.006). Mortality for the cohort was 15%. BNP levels were higher in non-survivors (n?=?7) than survivors (n?=?41, P?=?0.055). Conclusions BNP levels are elevated in children with ALI/ARDS early in the disease course, and increased levels are associated with worse clinical outcome.

AB  - Summary Circulatory and respiratory effects of five h of constant 1.06 per cent alveolar halothane in oxygen were identified in eight healthy horses, which breathed spontaneously, were otherwise unmedicated and positioned in sternal recumbency. Only a few important significant (P<0.05) changes occurred with time. Total peripheral resistance was about 15 per cent lower after two hours of constant dose halothane than after 30 mins of constant dose (P<0.05) and accounted for the significant 10 per cent reduction in mean carotid arterial blood pressure. By 5 h, the reduction in resistance and arterial blood pressure was 20 and 25 per cent respectively. Heart rate increased progressively with time and the increase became significant at 5 h (15 per cent increase). However, the heart rate change was not large enough to alter cardiac output. There were no major time-related changes in PaO2 or PaCO2. Three of four horses recovered from anaesthesia had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels and clinical signs of severe post anaesthetic myopathy.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Aims: This review explored the evidence relating to prone positioning in ventilated patients diagnosed with respiratory failure, including acute lung injury (ALI) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Background: Mortality rates for ventilated patients with ALI or ARDS are high, and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the position these patients are nursed in may influence clinical outcomes. However, there are no guidelines to inform nursing practice in positioning these patients. Method: Medline, Scopus, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for original research reports or systematic reviews of evidence between 2000 and 2009. Reference lists of retrieved papers were hand searched and included studies were analysed using the Critical Appraisal and Skills Programme framework. A narrative data synthesis considered the strengths and limitations of studies, and findings were collated and interpreted. Results: Application of the search strategy identified a systematic review, currently underway, which has not yet reported and 14 relevant studies eligible for inclusion in this review. Analysis showed considerable variation in study design, but suggests that PaO2/FiO2 ratio, incidence of VAP and mortality may be positively affected by prone positioning. Conclusions: Evidence of the clinical benefits associated with prone positioning is inconclusive and provides little guidance for nursing practice. There is a need for further research into the clinical outcomes of prone positioning, and greater understanding of the practicalities of prone positioning critically ill patients is required. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses have a central role to play in the continual assessment and management of this patient group, including the position they are nursed in, not only to ensure the best clinical outcomes but also to provide care and comfort to the patient and their family. It is therefore important that their nursing practice and interventions are informed by the best available evidence.

AB  - Background? Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complex rescue therapy used to provide cardiac and/or respiratory support for critically ill patients who have failed maximal conventional medical management. ECMO is based on a modified cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, and can provide cardiopulmonary support for up-to several months. It can be used in a veno venous configuration for isolated respiratory failure, (VV-ECMO), or in a veno arterial configuration (VA-ECMO) where support is necessary for cardiac +/- respiratory failure. The ECMO circuit consists of five main components: large bore cannulae (access cannulae) for drainage of the venous system, and return cannulae to either the venous ( in VV-ECMO) or arterial (in VA ECMO) system. An oxygenator, with a vast surface area of hollow filaments, allows addition of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide; a centrifugal blood pump allows propulsion of blood through the circuit at upto 10 L/minute; a control module and a thermoregulatory unit, which allows for exact temperature control of the extra corporeal blood. Methods? The first successful use of ECMO for ARDS in adults occurred in 1972, and its use has become more commonplace over the last 30 years, supported by the improvement in design and biocompatibility of the equipment, which has reduced the morbidity associated with this modality. Whilst the use of ECMO in neonatal population has been supported by numerous studies, the evidence upon which ECMO was integrated into adult practice was substantially less robust. Results? Recent data, including the CESAR study (Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Respiratory failure)has added a degree of evidence to the role of ECMO in such a patient population. The CESAR study analysed 180 patients, and confirmed that ECMO was associated with an improved rate of survival. More recently, ECMO has been utilized in numerous situations within the critical care area, including support in high-risk percutaneous interventions in cardiac catheter lab; the operating room, emergency department, as well in specialized inter-hospital retrieval services. The increased understanding of the risk:benefit profile of ECMO, along with a reduction in morbidity associated with its use will doubtless lead to a substantial rise in the utilisation of this modality. As with all extra-corporeal circuits, ECMO opposes the basic premises of the mammalian inflammation and coagulation cascade where blood comes into foreign circulation, both these cascades are activated. Anti-coagulation is readily dealt with through use of agents such as heparin, but the inflammatory excess, whilst less macroscopically obvious, continues un-abated. Platelet consumption and neutrophil activation occur rapidly, and the clinician is faced with balancing the need of anticoagulation for the circuit, against haemostasis in an acutely bleeding patient. Alterations in pharmacokinetics may result in inadequate levels of disease modifying therapeutics, such as antibiotics, hence paradoxically delaying recovery from conditions such as pneumonia. Key elements of nutrition and the innate immune system may similarly be affected. Summary? This presentation will discuss the basic features of ECMO to the non-specialist, and review the clinical conundrum faced by the team treating these most complex cases.

AB  - Abstract Several articles have discussed the weaning process for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; however, there is no published report to outline a standardized approach for weaning a patient from venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This complex process requires an organized approach and a thorough understanding of ventilator management and ECMO physiology. The purpose of this article is to describe the venovenous ECMO weaning protocol used at our institution as well as provide a review of the literature.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the influence of direct current shock application in anaesthetized horses with atrial fibrillation (AF) and to study the effects of cardioversion to sinus rhythm (SR). Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Eight horses successfully treated for AF (transvenous electrical cardioversion after amiodarone pre-treatment). Methods? Cardioversion catheters and a pacing catheter were placed under sedation [detomidine 10??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)]. After additional sedation (5?10??g?kg?1 detomidine, 0.1?mg?kg?1 methadone IV), anaesthesia was induced with ketamine, 2.2?mg?kg?1 and midazolam, 0.06?mg?kg?1 (IV) in a sling and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Flunixin meglumine, 1.1?mg?kg?1, was administered IV. Shocks were delivered as biphasic truncated exponential waves, synchronized with the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. Monitoring included pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, capnography, inhalational anaesthetic agent concentration, arterial blood pressure, LiDCO and PulseCO cardiac index (CI) and arterial blood gases. Values before and after the first unsuccessful shock and before and after cardioversion to SR were compared. Results? Values before the first shock were comparable to reported values in healthy, isoflurane anaesthetized horses. Reliable CI measurements could not be obtained using the PulseCO technique. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was required in most horses (bradypnea and/or PaCO2 >8?kPa, 60?mmHg), while dobutamine was administered in two horses (0.3?0.5??g?kg?1?minute?1). After the 1st unsuccessful shock application, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) was decreased (p?=?0.025), other recorded values were not influenced (CI measurements not available for this analysis). SR was associated with increases in CI (p?=?0.039) and stroke index (p?=?0.002) and a decrease in SAP (p?=?0.030). Conclusions and clinical relevance? Despite the presence of AF, cardiovascular function was well maintained during anaesthesia and was not affected by shock application. Cardiac index and stroke index increased and SAP decreased after cardioversion.

AB  - Summary Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is currently used for both standard and extended-criteria donor (ECD) lungs. To enlarge the donor pool, we might have to extend the threshold for ECD donation. The purpose of this study was to estimate how many additional ECD lungs could be recruited by EVLP. We reviewed all multi-organ donors (MODs) from our collaborative donor hospitals (January 2010?June 2015). All unused lung donors were categorized using registered donor data and evaluated by two independent investigators to identify which lungs could be transplanted after EVLP. 584 MODs were registered at our transplant center. 268 (45.9%) were declined as lung donor at the moment of registration, and 316 (54.1%) were considered as a donor for lung transplantation. In the latter, lungs from 220 (37.7%) donors were transplanted and 96 donors (16.4%) were not. We identified 78 of 364 declined donors (21.4%) whose lungs could potentially become transplantable after EVLP. With this retrospective database analysis of unused lung donors, we identified a large potential for EVLP to further increase the donor pool in transplant centers where the majority of donor lungs are already extended.

AB  - Background: The prone position is known to increase oxygen uptake in patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Methods: In this clinical study from 1995?96, 14 ARDS patients with severe respiratory failure were treated for at least 1 h in the prone position. Responders, defined as having more than 10% increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio from baseline after 1 h, were treated at least 6 h in the prone position. Results: 11 patients responded during the first period of the prone position (primary responders). Two of the 3 non-responders were turned prone a second time with increase in the PaO2FiO2 ratio (secondary responders). Mean PaO2FiO2 ratio (mean±SEM) in the supine position was 11.7±0.8 kPa, increasing to 16.6±1.8 kPa and 18.0±1.4 kPa after 1 and 6 h respectively (P=0.009). Mean time spent in the prone position was 69 h (range 3?256 h), and mean ventilatory time was 17 d (3?52 d). The mortality in this subgroup of our patients with ARDS was 42%, compared to 58% in 19 patients not turned prone in the same period. Conclusions: The prone position together with PEEP appears to improve ventilation-perfusion matching. The prone position is simple, effective and readily available and could be used early in most patients with ARDS.

Horses were ventilated and dobutamine was administered when hypoventilation [arterial partial pressure of CO2?>?8.00?kPa (60?mmHg)] and hypotension [arterial pressure 70?mmHg] occurred respectively. During anaesthesia, horses were randomly allocated to receive a CRI of dexmedetomidine (1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1) (D) or saline (S). Monitoring included end-tidal isoflurane concentration, cardiopulmonary parameters, and need for dobutamine and additional ketamine. All horses received 0.875??g?kg?1 dexmedetomidine IV for the recovery period. Age and weight of the horses, duration of anaesthesia, additional ketamine and dobutamine, cardiopulmonary data (anova), recovery scores (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test), duration of recovery (t-test) and attempts to stand (Mann?Whitney test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results  Heart rate and arterial partial pressure of oxygen were significantly lower in group D compared to group S. An interaction between treatment and time was present for cardiac index, oxygen delivery index and systemic vascular resistance. End-tidal isoflurane concentration and heart rate significantly increased over time. Packed cell volume, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen content, stroke volume index and systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased over time. Recovery scores were significantly better in group D, with fewer attempts to stand and significantly longer times to sternal position and first attempt to stand. Conclusions and clinical relevance  A dexmedetomidine CRI produced limited cardiopulmonary effects, but significantly improved recovery quality.

AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Summary Two or three different solutions may be used to preserve thoracic and abdominal organs during a single procurement. The aim of this prospective, multi-center, noncomparative study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Celsior? (study solution, solution S) as a flushing and cold storage solution for both thoracic and abdominal organs. Between August 1999 and July 2000, 72 consecutive multiple-organ procurements were performed using solution S as the sole solution for flushing out and cold-storing thoracic and abdominal grafts. Two hundred and sixty-four grafts were implanted into 245 recipients (131 kidneys, 9 kidney?pancreases, 69 livers, 34 hearts and 6 heart?lungs). The mean cold ischemia time was 21?h for kidneys (26%>24?h); 11?h 26?min for pancreases, 9?h 16?min for livers (23%>12?h), and 2?h 58?min for hearts and lungs. No cardiac failure or arrhythmia occurred on graft reperfusion. Fourteen percent of kidney recipients had delayed graft function. The mean serum creatinin level at 3 months was 123?±?41??mol/l. All pancreas recipients were insulin-free at 3?months. Primary graft nonfunction occurred in one liver recipient. Complete hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in six liver recipients during the first month; four of these patients had a risk factor for thrombosis. All but three of the heart recipients were in sinus rhythm on day 1, and 65% were extubated on day 1. Inotropic drugs were necessary during the first 72?h in 25% of heart recipients. Twelve-month patient and graft survival rates were, respectively, 100% and 96% (kidney), 100% and 89% (pancreas), 88% and 83% (liver), 77.5% (heart) and 67% (heart?lung). These results suggest that Celsior?, a ready-to-use solution, is safe and effective for multiple organ procurement and preservation.

AB  - Abstract The clinical translation of promising basic biomedical findings, whether derived from reductionist studies in academic laboratories or as the product of extensive high-throughput and high-content screens in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, has reached a period of stagnation in which ever higher research and development costs are yielding ever fewer new drugs. Systems biology and computational modeling have been touted as potential avenues by which to break through this logjam. However, few mechanistic computational approaches are used in a manner that is fully cognizant of the inherent clinical realities in which the drugs developed through this ostensibly rational process will be ultimately used. This article presents a translational systems biology approach to inflammation. This approach is based on the use of mechanistic computational modeling centered on inherent clinical applicability, namely that a unified suite of models can be applied to generate in silico clinical trials, individualized computational models as tools for personalized medicine, and rational drug and device design based on disease mechanism.

AB  - Background and objectives:? Surveillance cultures may improve the prediction of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and empirical antibiotic selection. This study examined the utility and patient safety of blind, non-protected, low-volume mini-bronchial lavage (BM-BAL) surveillance cultures in predicting VAP. Methodology:? A prospective, cohort study was performed in a large general intensive care unit. BM-BALs were collected within 12?h of admission then thrice weekly. Each BM-BAL was screened by Gram staining for intracellular organisms and then quantitatively cultured. VAP was diagnosed using the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score. The concordance for isolates from the BM-BAL was assessed against concurrently collected endotracheal aspirates (EA). Results:? Four hundred and twelve patients requiring a minimum of 48?h of mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Fifty patients developed 58 episodes of VAP. Concordant pathogens were found in 85% of BM-BAL specimens collected 2?days prior to VAP onset. Their antibiograms were stable over the preceding 4?days. The isolation of pathogens with colony counts ≥104?cfu/mL from BM-BAL performed 2?days prior to the clinical onset of VAP had a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 50%, positive predictive value of 31% and a negative predictive value of 93% for predicting the development of VAP. BM-BAL WCC, quantification of bacterial growth and the percentage of intracellular organisms were not helpful in predicting VAP diagnosis. Conclusions:? BM-BAL surveillance cultures are well tolerated and useful in predicting the pathogens and their antibiograms causing VAP. Diagnostic specimen collection at the time of VAP onset is still required as surveillance cultures may be negative even one day prior to VAP onset.

AB  - This study examined the performance of two subjective pain scoring systems for evaluating equine postoperative pain, and investigated differences in pain scoring tendencies of veterinarians and grooms. Fifteen horses were included in the study. Group 1 (n?=?8) had chronic lameness and was admitted for elective arthroscopy under general anaesthesia, on one or two femoropatellar, femorotibial or tibiotarsal joint or digital flexor tendons. The anaesthetic protocol for each horse was similar but not standardized. Multi-modal peri-operative analgesia comprised: romifidine (100?µg?kg?1 IV); flunixin (1.1?mg?kg?1 IV); ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV); morphine (0.12?mg?kg?1 IV); phenylbutazone (4?mg?kg?1 IV/PO). Group 2 (n?=?7) included pain free controls. At 6?hours post-recovery from anaesthesia (PR) (group 1) or at 20.00?hours (group 2 with one limb bandaged), horses were filmed undisturbed in their stables for 90?seconds (dynamic behaviour, DB); thereafter, the surgery site and pharynx of each horse were palpated (and filmed) in a standardized manner (interactive behaviour, IB). Two observer groups, seven veterinarians and eight grooms, watched video footage of each horse and assigned pain scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) and a numerical rating scale (NRS). Observers assigned a pain score (VAS and NRS) for DB and IB separately and overall. Statistical analysis (Minitab 13.0, Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann?Whitney U-tests) investigated differences in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 horses, compared pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms, and examined differences in the performance of VAS and NRS techniques. There were significant differences in the pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms to groups 1 and 2 horses. When using DB or IB separately (but not combined) to score perceived pain, grooms assigned higher scores to group 1 than group 2 (U?=?81.5, p?<?0.05; U?=?82.0, p?<?0.05) using the VAS. There was no difference in NRS scores attributed by grooms to groups 1 and 2. Using DB and IB separately or combined, there was no difference in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 by veterinarians using either VAS or NRS scoring systems. Using separate VAS scores for DB (W?=?32.5, p?<?0.05) and IB (W?=?26.5, p?<?0.05) and using combined (DB?+?IB) VAS scores, grooms awarded higher pain scores (W?=?27.0, p?<?0.05) than veterinarians to group 1. Using the NRS, vets and grooms did not score pain differently for group 1. For group 2, grooms scored pain significantly higher than vets when using the VAS to score IB separately (W?=?21.0, p?<?0.05); no other differences between grooms and veterinarians in pain scoring of group 2 (NRS or VAS, DB and IB separately or combined) were identified. The performance of subjective pain scoring systems for assessment of equine postoperative pain varies according to the scale used, the behaviour evaluated (dynamic or interactive) and the observer group. While data suggest that grooms distinguished post-surgery horses from controls more successfully than vets and assigned higher pain scores to these horses, the specific behavioral criteria on which scores were assigned requires future investigation and identification.
