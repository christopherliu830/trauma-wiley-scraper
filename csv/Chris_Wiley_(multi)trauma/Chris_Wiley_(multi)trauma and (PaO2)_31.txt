AB  - Abstract Maximal inspiratory pressure (PIMAX), the maximum negative pressure generated during temporary occlusion of the airway, is commonly used to measure inspiratory muscle strength in mechanically ventilated infants and children. There are, however, no guidelines as to how the PIMAX measurement should be made. We compared the maximum inspiratory pressure generated during airway occlusion (PIMAXOCC) to that when a unidirectional valve (PIMAXUNI), which allowed expiration, but not inspiration was used. Twenty-two mechanically ventilated children (mean (SD) age 4.8 (4.5) years) were studied. Three sets of end expiratory occlusions were performed for each method in random order. The expired volume during PIMAXUNI was assessed and related to the functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using a helium dilution technique. The mean (SD) PIMAXUNI (45.5 (15.2) cmH2O) was significantly greater than mean (SD) PIMAXOCC (30.9 (9.0) cmH2O) (P?<?0.0001). The mean (SD) expired volume during PIMAXUNI, was 98 ml (62.3), a mean reduction in FRC of 33.1% (SD 13.9). There were no significant differences between techniques in the baseline respiratory drive, the number of efforts required and the time to reach PIMAX. Regardless of technique, PIMAX was reached in 10 inspiratory efforts or 15 sec of airway occlusion. A unidirectional valve allowing expiration, but not inspiration yields greater PIMAX values in children. Occlusions should be maintained for 12 sec or eight breaths (99% CI of mean). Pediatr.

AB  - Abstract? Aim: To determine survival, factors determining survival and evaluate quality of life (QOL) after 1 year, in patients who had prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay after cardiac surgery. Methods: In the year 2001, 804 patients underwent various cardiac procedures utilising cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Eighty-nine consecutive patients requiring ICU stay of ≥5 days constituted the study group, majority of these suffered from multiorgan failure (>2 organ systems). Survival was determined in the study group after 1 year. Patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course were matched to the survivors in the study group with respect to age, gender, type of surgery, risk scores, and duration of follow-up and constituted the control group. The, Short Form Health Survey was used to assess QOL at the end of 1 year in these patients. QOL was compared between the study group and the control group and to that of general population. Results: Seventy percent of the patients in the study group suffered from failure of at least three organ systems. Mean ICU stay was 13 ± 3 days (median nine, maximum 53). At the end of 1 year the mortality in the study group was 34%. The independent predictors of mortality were: preoperative cardiac support, lower ejection fraction, higher Parsonnet score, higher Euroscore, pulmonary complications, renal failure necessitating hemofiltration, CNS complications, and failure of three or more organ systems. The QOL was lower in the study group than the control group in all eight dimensions measured (significant in five p < 0.05): Physical function, Role physical, Vitality, Mental health, General health, and Bodily pain. Conclusion: One year mortality in patients with prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery remains high. Identification of risk factors will help to reduce the mortality with help of regular follow up. The QOL remains low in all dimensions especially those measuring physical aspects and pain.

AB  - Summary The unquestioned success of liver transplantation over the past three decades has made it the primary therapy for end-stage liver disease of a variety of causes and unresectable early stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Improvements in technique, immunosuppression, selection and post-transplant management have produced 1-year patient survival rates close to 90%. This early success has shifted focus of the field to understanding better causes of late graft loss and to defining interventions to extend survival. To this end, we review donor and recipient factors predisposing to graft failure and important causes of late liver loss, including death with a functioning graft due to cardiovascular disease, disease recurrence in the liver, and recurrent and de novo malignancy. Understanding these causes of late graft failure will permit better screening and intervention to mitigate risk.

AB  - Summary Use of piggyback technique (PB) and elimination of venovenous bypass (VVB) have been advocated in adult liver transplantation (LT). However, individual contribution of these two modifications on clinical outcomes has not been fully investigated. We performed a retrospective review of 426 LTs within a 3-year period, when three different surgical techniques were employed per the surgeons? preference: retrohepatic caval resection with VVB (RCR?+?VVB) in 104 patients, PB with VVB (PB?+?VVB) in 148, and PB without VVB (PB-Only) in 174. The primary outcomes were intraoperative blood transfusion and the patient and graft survivals. Demographic profiles were similar, except younger recipient age in RCR?+?VVB and fewer number of grafts with cold ischemic time over 16?h in PB-Only. PB-Only required lesser intraoperative red blood cells (P?=?0.006), fresh frozen plasma (P?=?0.005), and cell saver return (P?=?0.007); had less incidence of acute renal failure (P?=?0.001), better patient survival (P?=?0.039), and graft survival (P?=?0.003). The benefits of PB?+?VVB were only found in shortened total surgical time (P?=?0.0001) and warm ischemic time (P?=?0.0001), and less incidence of acute renal failure (P?=?0.001) than RCR?+?VVB. PB-Only method seemed to provide the best clinical outcome. The benefit of PB was not fully achieved when it was used with VVB.

AB  - Abstract? Background and aim: A debate over alternative therapeutic strategies for multivessel coronary disease is currently ongoing. We aimed at analyzing the results of myocardial revascularization with arterial conduits. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 10,752 patients undergoing isolated coronary bypass surgery within our hospital's group. Average follow-up was 37.2 months. Through propensity-matching, we generated three groups (3584 patients each) on the basis of the revascularization strategy: use of one mammary artery plus venous grafts, use of two mammary arteries plus venous graft, and total arterial revascularization. Results: Overall operative mortality was 2.8%. Patient-related factors (renal failure, advanced age, recent myocardial infarction, depressed LVEF, diabetes) were identified as predictors of mortality (logistic regression). Although mortality was not statistically different among groups, patients receiving more than one arterial conduit displayed in the long-term better freedom from cardiac death and from adverse cardiac events (repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction, recurrent angina) (Kaplan?Meier analysis). Use of only one arterial conduit, diabetes and depressed LVEF predicted cardiac mortality, and adverse events (Cox regression). No differences in any endpoint emerged among patients receiving two arterial conduit plus venous grafts or total arterial revascularization. Conclusions: These data strongly support the practice of using two arterial conduits rather than one. The operative and late results of coronary surgery with arterial conduits are optimal and should serve as a current benchmark for the comparison with state-of-the-art percutaneous interventions.
