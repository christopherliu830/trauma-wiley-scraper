AB  - Abstract Background:? Most surgeons routinely place intraperitoneal drains at the time of pancreatic resection but this practice has recently been challenged. Objective:? Evaluate the outcome when pancreatic resection is performed without operatively placed intraperitoneal drains. Methods:? In all, 226 consecutive patients underwent pancreatic resection. In 179 patients drains were routinely placed at the time of surgery and in 47 no drains were placed. Outcomes for these two cohorts were recorded in a prospective database and compared using the ?2- /Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and Wilcoxon's test for continuous variables. Results:? Demographic, surgical and pathological details were similar between the two cohorts. Elimination of routine intraperitoneal drainage did not increase the frequency or severity of serious complications. However, when all grades of complications were considered, the number of patients that experienced any complication (65% vs. 47%, P= 0.020) and the median complication severity grade (1 vs. 0, P= 0.027) were increased in the group that had drains placed at the time of surgery. Eliminating intra-operative drains was associated with decreased delayed gastric emptying (24% vs. 9%, P= 0.020) and a trend towards decreased wound infection (12% vs. 2%, P= 0.054). The readmission rate (9% vs. 17% P= 0.007) and number of patients requiring post-operative percutaneous drains (2% vs. 11%, P= 0.001) was higher in patients who did not have operatively placed drains but there was no difference in the re-operation rate (4% vs. 0%, P= 0.210). Conclusion:? Abandoning the practice of routine intraperitoneal drainage after pancreatic resection may not increase the incidence or severity of severe post-operative complications.

AB  - SUMMARY The clinical determination of the intravascular volume can be extremely difficult in critically ill and injured patients as well as those undergoing major surgery. This is problematic as fluid loading is considered the first step in the resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients. Yet, multiple studies have demonstrated that only about 50% of hemodynamically unstable patients in the ICU and operating room respond to a fluid challenge. Cardiac filling pressures including the central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure have traditionally been used to guide fluid management. However, studies performed over the last 30 years have demonstrated that cardiac filling pressures are unable to predict fluid responsiveness. Over the last decade a number of studies have been reported that have used heart?lung interactions during mechanical ventilation to assess fluid responsiveness. Specifically, the pulse pressure variation derived from analysis of the arterial waveform, the stroke volume variation derived from pulse contour analysis and the variation of the amplitude of the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform have been shown to be highly predictive of fluid responsiveness. While the left ventricular end-diastolic area as determined by transesophageal echocardiography is a more accurate measure of preload than either the central venous pressure or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, it does not predict fluid responsiveness as well as the dynamic indices. This paper reviews the evolution and accuracy of methods for assessing fluid responsiveness in patients in the ICU and operating room.

AB  - Abstract Background Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that APOE ε2- and ε4-carriers have similar patterns of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation suggesting that we need to look beyond the BOLD signal to link APOE's effect on the brain to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-risk. Methods We evaluated APOE-related differences in BOLD activation in response to a memory task, cerebrovascular reactivity using a CO2-inhalation challenge (CO2-CVR), and the potential contribution of CO2-CVR to the BOLD signal. Results APOE ε4-carriers had the highest task-related hippocampal BOLD signal relative to non-carriers. The largest differences in CO2-CVR were between ε2- and ε4-carriers, with the latter having the lowest values. Genotype differences in CO2-CVR accounted for ?70% of hippocampal BOLD differences between groups. Conclusion Because CO2-CVR gauges vascular health, the differential effect of APOE in young adults may reflect a vascular contribution to the vulnerability of ε4-carriers to late-life pathology. Studies confirming our findings are warranted.

AB  - Summary This chapter highlights the important clinical fetal considerations encountered when caring for complicated pregnancies. To achieve that objective, it reviews: current techniques for assessing fetal well-being; fetal assessment in the intensive care unit (ICU); fetal considerations in several maternal medical and surgical conditions; the contemporary management of the gravida who is brain-dead or in a persistent vegetative state; and the role of perimortem cesarean delivery in contemporary obstetrics. Fetal tachycardia is defined as a baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of 160?bpm or greater lasting 10?min or longer. The baseline FHR abnormality can be associated with prematurity, maternal pyrexia, or chorioamnionitis. Fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) is defined as fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency. Perimortem cesarean delivery has been described as an attempt to preserve the life of the unborn child when the pregnant woman dies.
