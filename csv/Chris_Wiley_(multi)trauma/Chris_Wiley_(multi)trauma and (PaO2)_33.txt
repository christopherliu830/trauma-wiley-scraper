AB  - Summary This chapter highlights the important clinical fetal considerations encountered when caring for complicated pregnancies. To achieve that objective, it reviews: current techniques for assessing fetal well-being; fetal assessment in the intensive care unit (ICU); fetal considerations in several maternal medical and surgical conditions; the contemporary management of the gravida who is brain-dead or in a persistent vegetative state; and the role of perimortem cesarean delivery in contemporary obstetrics. Fetal tachycardia is defined as a baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of 160?bpm or greater lasting 10?min or longer. The baseline FHR abnormality can be associated with prematurity, maternal pyrexia, or chorioamnionitis. Fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) is defined as fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency. Perimortem cesarean delivery has been described as an attempt to preserve the life of the unborn child when the pregnant woman dies.

AB  - Summary Managing the airway and optimizing ventilation for children with congenital heart disease can be particularly challenging tasks. Even though many patients require prolonged periods of tracheal intubation, evidence of laryngeal and tracheal injury is very low, and the use of cuffed endotracheal tubes does not appear to increase this risk. In addition, cuffed endotracheal tubes provide a significant advantage by allowing the anesthesiologist to optimize ventilation as pulmonary compliance changes without losing tidal volume from a large air leak around the endotracheal tube. Also, the nasotracheal route of intubation may provide added security of the endotracheal tube, especially with the use of transesophageal echocardiography. The pediatric anesthesia provider must be skilled in alternative methods of intubation when dealing with children who have a difficult airway and associated congenital heart disease. Many thoracic surgical procedures are more effectively performed with lung isolation and a variety of specialized endotracheal tubes or bronchial blockers are available. Because most devices are not useful in smaller children, the pediatric anesthesia specialist must be familiar and skilled in placing a variety of these devices. The final portion of this chapter focuses on pulmonary management of children with congenital heart disease who have unique cardiopulmonary interactions. Congenital heart lesions that are preload dependent for cardiac output such as cavopulmonary shunts and restrictive physiology of the right ventricle, show hemodynamic improvement from the negative intrathoracic pressure developed during spontaneous ventilation. However, children with left ventricular failure generally have improvement in cardiac output from positive intrathoracic pressure and PEEP.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To investigate and synthesize the evidence on the incidence and consequences of unplanned extubation (UE) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and on risk factors for UE. Background: ICU patients generally spend considerable time being intubated via the endotracheal route. Non-planned endotracheal tube removal, either deliberate or accidental, may pose significant safety risks for them. As UE is among the most studied critical incidents in the ICU, evaluation and summary of existing findings could provide important implications for clinical practice. Search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria: Observational studies published between 1990 and 2012 in English-language journals indexed by Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies on UE of critically ill adults. Thirty-three articles were considered eligible for inclusion. Conclusions: UE incidence varies considerably among reports, with self-extubation representing the majority of cases. Agitation, especially when combined with inadequate sedation, and decreased patient surveillance are the major risk factors for UE. Inexperienced personnel and improper tube fixation may also be important, while physical restraint use remains controversial. UE can be followed by serious complications, mainly aspiration, laryngeal oedema and increased risk for pneumonia. Need for re-intubation is a major determinant of patient outcomes. Implementation of educational or quality improvement programs is expected to advance personnel's knowledge about risk factors for UE, promote skills on safe, standardized procedures for patient care and increase compliance with them. Relevance to clinical practice: Identifying risk factors for UE and minimizing UE incidence through appropriate preventive strategies are prerequisites for improving nursing care quality and patient safety in the ICU.

AB  - Background The original equine sepsis score provided a method of identifying foals with sepsis. New variables associated with sepsis have been evaluated, but the sepsis score has not been updated. Objectives To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 2 updated sepsis scores and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in regard to detecting sepsis in foals. Animals Two-hundred and seventy-three ill foals and 25 healthy control foals. Methods Historical, physical examination, and clinicopathologic findings were used to calculate the original sepsis score and 2 updated sepsis scores. SIRS criteria were also evaluated. Sepsis scores and positive SIRS scores were statistically compared to foals with sepsis. Results One-hundred and twenty-six foals were septic and 147 sick-nonseptic. The original and updated sepsis scores were significantly higher in septic foals as compared to sick-nonseptic and healthy foals. The sensitivity and specificity of the updated sepsis scores to predict sepsis were not significantly better than those of the original sepsis score. One-hundred and twenty-seven of 273 (46.5%) foals met the original SIRS criteria and 88/273 (32%) foals met the equine neonatal SIRS criteria. The original SIRS criteria had similar sensitivity and specificity for predicting sepsis as did the 3 sepsis scores in our study. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The updated sepsis scores did not provide improved ability in predicting sepsis. Fulfilling the original SIRS criteria provided similar sensitivity and specificity in predicting sepsis as the modified sepsis score and might serve as a diagnostic aid in identifying foals at risk for sepsis.

AB  - Summary The role of the phagocytic function of monocytes and neutrophils in sepsis has been poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the impact of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Thirty-one patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and neutrophils was evaluated during 24?h after admission and the results were correlated to the expression of CD64 on neutrophils and monocytes, CD14 antigen on monocytes, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the patients' survival. A reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils during the first 24?h after admission was a negative predictor for survival. Increased expression of CD64 antigen on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes was favourably correlated to the patients' survival. In multivariate analysis the phagocytic activity of PMNs was the only independent predictor factor for survival. Patients with PMN phagocytic activity <37% had lower expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and worse outcome, while those with phagocytic activity >37% had higher expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and better outcome. Reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils may represent a state of neutrophil inactivation similar to that previously described for monocytes during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

AB  - SUMMARY Today?s aging population has resulted in an increase in the number of major orthopedic surgical interventions in the elderly. High perioperative blood losses, together with a reduced tolerance to anemia, raise the likelihood of transfusion in this patient subgroup. The expected cost explosion in the transfusion system (cost-intensive quality management, imbalance between the number of donors and recipients) as well as the remaining transfusion-related risks of hemolysis, infection and immunosuppression demonstrate the high socioeconomical importance of developing institutional transfusion programs. This article summarizes (i) the pathophysiology of anemia compensation; (ii) the decision-making process for transfusion in healthy patients and patients with cardiovascular disease; and (iii) current pre- and intraoperative techniques aimed at reducing allogeneic transfusion in orthopedic patients.

AB  - Background Transpulmonary pressure is a key factor for protective ventilation. This requires measurements of oesophageal pressure that is rarely used clinically. A simple method may be found, if it could be shown that tidal and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) inflation of the lungs with the same volume increases transpulmonary pressure equally. The aim of the present study was to compare tidal and PEEP inflation of the respiratory system. Methods A total of 12 patients with acute respiratory failure were subjected to PEEP trials of 0-4-8-12-16?cmH2O. Changes in end-expiratory lung volume (?EELV) following a PEEP step were determined from cumulative differences in inspiratory-expiratory tidal volumes. Oesophageal pressure was measured with a balloon catheter. Results Following a PEEP increase from 0 to 16?cmH2O end-expiratory oesophageal pressure did not increase (0.5?±?4.0?cmH2O). Average increase in EELV following a PEEP step of 4?cmH2O was 230?±?132?ml. The increase in EELV was related to the change in PEEP divided by lung elastance (El) derived from oesophageal pressure as ?PEEP/El. There was a good correlation between transpulmonary pressure by oesophageal pressure and transpulmonary pressure based on El determined as ?PEEP/?EELV, r2?=?0.80, y?=?0.96x, mean bias ?0.4?±?3.0?cmH2O with limits of agreement from 5.4 to ?6.2?cmH2O (2 standard deviations). Conclusion PEEP inflation of the respiratory system is extremely slow, and allows the chest wall complex, especially the abdomen, to yield and adapt to intrusion of the diaphragm. As a consequence a change in transpulmonary pressure is equal to the change in PEEP and transpulmonary pressure can be determined without oesophageal pressure measurements.

AB  - Abstract Despite the rise in the number of adult lung transplantations performed, rates of pediatric lung transplantation remain low. Lung transplantation is an accepted therapy for pediatric end-stage lung disease; however, it is limited by a shortage of donor organs. EVLP has emerged as a platform for assessment and preservation of donor lung function. EVLP has been adopted in adult lung transplantation and has successfully led to increased adult lung transplantations and donor lung utilization. We discuss the future implications of EVLP utilization, specifically, its potential evolving role in overcoming donor shortages in smaller children and adolescents to improve the quality and outcomes of lung transplantation in pediatric patients.
