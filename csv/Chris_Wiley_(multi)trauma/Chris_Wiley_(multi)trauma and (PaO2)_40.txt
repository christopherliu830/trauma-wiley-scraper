AB  - After reading recent correspondence regarding a failure of an Ohmeda Tec 5 generation vaporiser (Fernando  56:1009?10), I was left with the impression that they described a relatively freak event which was unlikely to be repeated. However, a recent event in our hospital revealed it was relatively easy to overfill this generation of vaporisers without any tilting at all. In fact, several of our vaporisers were overfilled on the same evening. This overfilling may be achieved simply by loosening the filler from the bottle and filling with the vaporiser turned on, manoeuvres that have been used to speed the filling process. Despite our staff being familiar with the current recommendations of the AAGBI [1] regarding checking anaesthetic equipment, the overfilling was only noticed when an oversupply of vapour (6.5% when dialled to 1.5%) triggered an alarm on the anaesthetic agent monitor. Fortunately, this incident had no adverse effect on our patient. However, if the faulty vaporiser had been in one of our anaesthetic induction rooms without volatile agent monitoring, and the patient had been less fit, this may not have been the case. This event highlighted the fact that no-one in our department was aware that these later generation vaporisers could be overfilled, with some convinced by their previous experience that it was impossible. We believe it likely that a similar belief is common around the country. This lack of awareness had contributed to a less diligent checking of the vaporisers and reduced emphasis on training those who filled them. A similar problem with overfilling has been described with older models and led to a Safety Action Bulletin from the Department of Health in 1992 [2]. There were also interesting discussions in the Canadian press around the same time [3, 4]. Our incident has taught us an old lesson.

AB  - Dr McBrien et al. describe three interesting cases of electromechanical dissociation (EMD) resistant to epinephrine treatment (McBrien et al. Anaesthesia 2001; 56: 1085?9). In these cases, an?α adrenergic agonist (methoxamine) proved to be lifesaving. However, to ?consider an α agonist for any case of cardiac arrest secondary to electromechanical dissociation which is unresponsive to epinephrine? may not be appropriate. These cases involved a specific situation where the likely cause of hypotension was a fall in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This occurred as a result of proven type 1 hypersensitivity in two cases and direct action of methylmethacrylate cement in the other. Clearly in this case, an α agonist is a logical choice. The Advanced Life Support guidelines are designed to cover a wide range of differing conditions for use by practitioners of differing experience who may or may not be aware of the originating event. Indeed, hypotension causing EMD may be as a result of cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax or hypovolaemia. It is unlikely that the use of α agonists would be helpful in these situations. It would seem prudent to continue to use epinephrine as the first line treatment for an EMD cardiac arrest and to advise using an α agonist in cases of hypotension where reduced SVR is suspected as the cause when epinephrine may not be effective in restoring the blood pressure. However, as methoxamine has now been withdrawn from clinical use, other α agonists such as metaraminol or phenylephrine may be more readily available.

AB  - We were interested in recent correspondence relating to reflux of gastric contents into the drain tube of the Pro-Seal laryngeal mask airway (Dalgleish  56: 1010). As part of a trial comparing performance of the Pro-Seal with the classic laryngeal mask airway we inserted a gastric tube into the drain tube of 30 Pro-Seal laryngeal mask airways in elective surgery patients. All patients were starved for 6 h for solids and 3 h for fluids. In all cases, fibre-optic examination of the drain tube and the oesophagus below was undertaken before passage of the gastric tube. On no occasion was gastric content seen in the drain tube or in the upper oesophagus. Gastric fluid was aspirated in 29 of 30 cases with a median volume of 22?ml and a range of 0?85?ml. In none of the cases was there any suggestion of clinical regurgitation or aspiration. In a recent case in our intensive care unit, a Pro-Seal was being used to allow endoscopic guidance during a percutaneous tracheostomy. The patient had been nasogastrically fed and the stomach was aspirated before the procedure. During dilation of the trachea, some nasogastric feed was vented a considerable distance out of the drain tube. Since the endoscope was at the glottic opening during this episode of regurgitation, it was possible to confirm, under direct vision, that there was no laryngeal or tracheal soiling. Large studies and meta-analysis has suggested that the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents when using a classic laryngeal mask airway is approximately 0.05?0.009% [1, 2]. A recent editorial on mechanical ventilation via the laryngeal mask airway rather speculatively suggested that aspiration of gastric contents might occur in up to 360 patients per year in the UK [3] and implied that such practice could not be considered entirely safe. The choice of whether to use a laryngeal mask airway when artificially ventilating a patient varies considerably in UK practice [4]. If elective cases may have significant volumes of gastric fluid, and there is some doubt as to whether ventilation via the classic laryngeal mask airway is safe, then the Pro-Seal is likely to be a valuable addition to the airway armamentarium. Laryngeal seal pressure is increased by approximately 50% [5] and the drain tube allows easy and reliable access to the stomach [5]. In addition, the drain tube might be expected to vent gas leaking into the oesophagus reducing gastric dilation, although this is untested. Should regurgitation occur, the drain tube may allow venting of regurgitated material and its appearance in the drain tube may act as an early warning. However, these potential advantages have not been rigorously examined and it is therefore too early to be sure of the role of the Pro-Seal in anaesthetic practice. What evidence is there that the Pro-Seal allows a greater margin of safety in the event of regurgitation? At present there is little; we are aware of three cases in which regurgitated matter has appeared in the drain tube without laryngeal or tracheal soiling (A. Brain, Personal communication). Drs Dalgleish and Dolgner's report brings the total to four, but is the first to be published. In addition, a study in cadavers [6] supports the contention. A study, at present only presented at a meeting, of the use of the Pro-Seal for laparoscopic cholecystectomy showed no more gastric distension than with a tracheal tube (Maltby JR, Beriault MT, Watson NC, Liepert DJ, Fick GH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: LMA-Proseal vs. tracheal intubation. Poster presentation. Canadian Anaesthesiologist's Congress 2001, Halifax, Canada). If we wait for a controlled study between the two devices to give us the answer, it will be a long wait. If the incidence of aspiration during anaesthesia while ventilating through the classic laryngeal mask is 1 in 11?000 cases, as has recently been suggested [3] and this?number can be halved by using the Pro-Seal, this would reduce the number of such cases in the UK by 180 per year. Conducting a trial to detect such a reduction, however, would require approximately 1.3 million patients in each group.
