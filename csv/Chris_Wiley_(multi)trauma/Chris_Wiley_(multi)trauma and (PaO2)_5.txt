AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the cardiopulmonary effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine for management of isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses. Study design Prospective randomized clinical study. Animals Fourteen isoflurane-anesthetized horses undergoing digital palmar neurectomy. Methods Ephedrine (EPH group; 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) or phenylephrine (PHE group; 0.002 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) was administered to all horses when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was <60 mmHg. The infusions were ended when the target MAP was achieved, corresponding to a 50% increase over the pre-infusion MAP (baseline). The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow the collection of blood for pH and blood-gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded at baseline and at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after achieving the target MAP. Results In both groups, the MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased significantly at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The EPH group had a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) and systemic oxygen delivery index at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05) and compared to the PHE group (p < 0.05). The PHE group had significantly higher SVR and no decrease in oxygen extraction compared with the EPH group at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion (p < 0.05). No significant differences in ventilatory parameters were observed between groups after the infusion. Conclusions Ephedrine increased the MAP by increasing CI and SVR. Phenylephrine increased MAP by increasing SVR but cardiac index decreased. Ephedrine resulted in better tissue oxygenation than phenylephrine. Clinical relevance Ephedrine would be preferable to phenylephrine to treat isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses since it increases blood flow and pressure.

AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Summary A 4-week-old Thoroughbred filly foal with a history of sepsis was evaluated for right hindlimb lameness. Bilateral femoropatellar and femorotibial joint effusions were detected. Ultrasonography and radiography of the right stifle revealed signs of joint collapse and periarticular swelling. Computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the bone density of the medial femoral condyle of the right hindlimb and lateral femoral condyle of the left hindlimb. Euthanasia was recommended based on the severity of the lesions. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed extensive separation of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex from the subchondral bone of the femoral condyles. The histological features suggest an ischaemic aetiology; comparisons are made with lesions of osteochondrosis and avascular necrosis of bone.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare pulmonary function and gas exchange in ponies during maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane or by a total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) technique. Study design Experimental, cross?over study. Animals Six healthy ponies weighing mean 286 (range 233?388) ± SD 61 kg, age 13 (9?16) ± 3 years. Methods The ponies were anaesthetized twice, a minimum of two weeks apart. Following sedation with romifidine [80 ?g kg?1 intravenously (IV)], anaesthesia was induced IV with midazolam (0.06 mg kg?1) and ketamine (2.5 mg kg?1), then maintained either with inhaled isoflurane (Fe?Iso = 1.1 vol%) (T-ISO) or an IV infusion of romifidine (120 ?g kg?1 hour?1), midazolam (0.09 mg kg?1 hour?1 IV) and ketamine (3.3 mg kg?1 hour?1) (T-TIVA). Ponies were placed in lateral recumbency. Breathing was spontaneous and Fi?O2 60%. After an instrumentation/stabilisation period of 30 minutes, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken simultaneously every 10 minutes for 60 minutes and analysed immediately. Oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) and venous admixture were calculated. Tidal volume (TV), minute volume (MV), respiratory rate (fR), packed cell volume (PCV), arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded. Data were analysed with mixed model anova (α = 0.05). Treatments were compared overall and at two selected time points (T30 and T60) using Bonferroni correction. Results Arterial and mixed venous partial pressures of O2 and CO2, and TV were significantly lower and MV and fR were higher in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Venous admixture did not differ between treatments. O2ER was significantly higher in T-TIVA. Mean arterial pressure was higher and HR was lower in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Conclusions and clinical relevance Whilst arterial CO2 was within an acceptable range during both protocols, the impairment of oxygenation was more pronounced with the T-TIVA evidenced by lower arterial and venous oxygen partial pressures.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the anaesthetic, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects of intramuscular (IM) medetomidine and ketamine administered alone or combined with morphine or tramadol, for orchiectomy in cats. Study design Randomised, blinded, prospective clinical study. Animals Thirty client-owned cats. Materials and methods Cats (n = 10 in each group) received a combination of medetomidine (60 ?gkg?1) and ketamine (10 mg kg?1) alone (MedK); combined with morphine (0.2 mg kg?1) (MedKM), or combined with tramadol (2 mg kg?1) (MedKT) IM. Time of induction, surgical and recovery events were recorded, and physiological parameters measured and recorded. Analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a composite scoring system and the von Frey mechanical threshold device, every hour from three to eight hours post-drug administration injection. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal?Wallis or Chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Results Median (IQR) induction and recovery times (minutes) were not significantly (p = 0.125) different between groups: 5.6 (2.7?8.0), 7.4 (5.1?9.6) and 8.0 (5.8?14.9) for induction and 128.5 (95.1?142.8), 166.4 (123.1?210.0) and 142.9 (123.4?180.2) for recovery, with MedK, MedKT and MedKM, respectively. Two cats (MedKM) required alfaxalone for endotracheal intubation. In all groups, three or four cats required additional isoflurane for surgery. Arterial oxygen tension overall (mean ± SD: 66 ± 2 mmHg) was low. Surgery resulted in increased systolic arterial blood pressure (p < 0.001), haemoglobin saturation (p < 0.001), respiratory (p = 0.003) and heart rates (p = 0.002). Pain scores did not differ significantly between groups. Von Frey responses decreased over time; changes over time varied by treatment (p < 0.001), MedK returning to baseline values more rapidly than MedKM and MedKT. No cat required rescue analgesics. Conclusion and clinical relevance All three protocols can provide adequate anaesthesia and analgesia for orchiectomy in cats. However, rescue intervention to maintain surgical anaesthesia may be required in some cats. Oxygen supplementation is advised.

AB  - Summary Objective To compare the requirement for endotracheal ventilation in preterm infants treated with heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) with those treated with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for the primary treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Study Design Randomized, controlled, prospective, single-center pilot study. Infants (gestational age [GA] <35 weeks, birth weight [BW] >1,000?g) with RDS were randomly assigned to receive HHHFNC (38 infants) delivered by Vapotherm? device (Precision Flow? or 2000i, Vapotherm Inc., Stevensville, MD), at flows between 1.0 and 5.0?L/min, or NIPPV (38 infants) delivered by the SLE 2000 or 5000. Surfactant was administered as rescue therapy. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat. Results Infant's characteristics ([mean?±?SD] GA 31.8?±?2.3 vs. 32.0?±?2.3 weeks) and cardio-respiratory status at study entry (FiO2 0.25?±?0.05 vs. 0.26?±?0.07; SpO2 90?±?6% vs. 87?±?12; PCO2 54.4?±?10.4 vs. 52.6?±?8.0?mmHg) were comparable for the HHHFNC and NIPPV groups. There was no significant difference in the need for endotracheal ventilation (28.9% vs. 34.2%) between HHHFNC and NIPPV groups. One infant failed HHHFNC and succeeded on NIPPV. The rate of neonatal morbidities (pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intra-ventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and nasal trauma) was comparable in both groups. Duration of nasal support was longer with HHHFNC compared with NIPPV (5.4?±?4.0 vs. 2.6?±?1.9 days, P?=?0.006) but the duration of endotracheal ventilation, time to full feeds, and length of stay were comparable. Conclusions Our pilot study suggests that HHHFNC maybe as effective as NIPPV in preventing endotracheal ventilation in the primary treatment of RDS in premature infants (<35 weeks GA and BW >1,000?g).

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of sufentanil long acting (SLA) in sevoflurane-anaesthetized dogs. Study Design? Randomized prospective study. Animals? Forty female dogs (beagles) aged 1?2?years, weighing 11.97?±?1.40?kg. Materials and methods? The dogs were divided into five groups of eight. Two control groups were used: group A received intramuscular (IM), SLA (50??g?kg?1) alone, while group B received the SLA vehicle followed by sevoflurane anaesthesia for 90?minutes. In the other groups, SLA (50??g?kg?1 IM) was given immediately before (group C0), 15?minutes before (group D15) or 30?minutes (group E30) before induction [with intravenous (IV) thiopental] of sevoflurane anaesthesia lasting for 90?minutes. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate (fr), arterial oxygen haemoglobin saturation and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (Fe?SEVO) were measured every 10?minutes during anaesthesia and at 2, 4 and 24?hours after induction (not Fe?SEVO). Acid?base and blood gas analyses were performed. Results? Sufentanil LA reduced heart rate and increased arterial CO2 tensions during anaesthesia. Respiratory depression was least in group E30 compared with groups C0 and D15. Bradycardia was present for at least 24?hours. Respiratory rate was least in group B although arterial O2 and CO2 tension values were acceptable up to 24?hours after anaesthesia. Conclusions? Pre-anaesthetic medication with SLA moderately aggravated the cardiopulmonary effects of sevoflurane. Clinical relevance? In spite of a moderate depressant effect on cardiorespiratory parameters, SLA may be of use as pre-anaesthetic medication before sevoflurane anaesthesia in dogs. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may occasionally be necessary.
