AB  - Summary This review addresses the physiological background and the current status of evidence regarding ventilator-induced lung injury and lung protective strategies. Lung protective ventilatory strategies have been shown to reduce mortality from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We review the latest knowledge on the progression of lung injury by mechanical ventilation and correlate the findings of experimental work with results from clinical studies. We describe the experimental and clinical evidence of the effect of lung protective ventilatory strategies and open lung strategies on the progression of lung injury and current controversies surrounding these subjects. We describe a rational strategy, the open lung strategy, to accomplish an open lung, which may further prevent injury caused by mechanical ventilation. Finally, the clinician is offered directions on lung protective ventilation in the early phase of ARDS which can be applied on the intensive care unit.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess if positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, without hemodynamic impairment in horses during anesthesia. Design Prospective, randomized study. Animals Thirteen isoflurane-anesthetized healthy horses. Methods After 60 minutes of anesthesia with spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation was initiated with an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 10?20 mL kg?1 and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Constant PEEP of 5 cmH2O was continued (control group; n = 6) or titrated (PEEP group; n = 7) by increasing and decreasing PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH2O at 15-minute intervals. The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow collection of blood for pH and blood gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary assessment was recorded before PEEP titration and after 15 minutes at each PEEP value. Results In the PEEP group, static compliance (range) (Cst 278?463 mL cmH2O?1) was significantly higher and the shunt fraction ( 7?20%) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [P(A-a)O2 95?325 mmHg] were significantly lower than in the control group [Cst of 246?290 mL cmH2O?1, of 16?19%, P(A-a)O2 of 253?310 mmHg; p < 0.05]. CO (mean ± SEM) was lower in the PEEP group (23 ± 2 L minute?1) at 20 cmH2O PEEP than in the control group (26 ± 4 L minute?1, p < 0.05), with no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or central venous pressure. Conclusions PEEP titration significantly improved gas exchange and lung compliance, with a small decrease in CO at the highest PEEP level. Clinical relevance Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during inhalation anesthesia can be treated using PEEP titration from 5 to 20 cmH2O, without clinically important hemodynamic effects in healthy horses.

AB  - Summary Thoracic surgery addresses the operative repair of the chest wall and organs within the chest cavity (principally the lungs and oesophagus) exclusive of the heart and great vessels. Common surgical conditions include chest trauma, chest wall deformities and tumours, pleural effusion and empyema, pneumothorax, gastro-oesophageal reflux and oesophageal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and mediastinal tumours. Minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS) or open thoracotomy may be employed to access and/or remove the pathology. Surgery is very effective in managing the majority of these conditions and patients with malignant tumours may receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as an adjuvant or definitive therapy depending on tumour staging.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the physiological variables, arterial blood gas values, induction of anesthesia quality, and recovery quality using the combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone in dogs. Animals Ten healthy adult Beagle dogs weighing 8.3 ± 3.1 kg. Methods Rectal temperature (T), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and arterial blood gases were measured and recorded prior to intravenous (IV) administration of butorphanol, prior to administration of both midazolam and alfaxalone IV 10 minutes later, then every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. M-mode echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) indices were measured before and 5 minutes after administration of alfaxalone. Qualitative scores for induction of anesthesia and recovery were allocated, duration of anesthesia and recovery were calculated, and adverse events were recorded. Results Scores for induction and recovery quality were excellent. No significant adverse events were observed. Mean ± SD time from induction to extubation and to standing (full recovery) was 29 ± 6 and 36 ± 8 minutes, respectively. There were statistically significant changes in PR, fR and MAP after drug administration. Transient hypercarbia developed after alfaxalone injection. The echocardiographic LV indices were reduced after alfaxalone injection, although those changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions and clinical relevance The combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone provided excellent quality of induction of anesthesia and exerted minimal cardiopulmonary effects in healthy dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the effects of MK-467 on sedation quality, and cardiopulmonary and pharmacokinetic variables in horses sedated intravenously (IV) with romifidine. Study design Experimental, randomized, crossover design. Animals Seven healthy mares. Methods Romifidine (80 ?g kg?1; R) and MK-467 (200 ?g kg?1; MK) were administered IV alone and in combination (R + MK). Levels of sedation and borborygmi were scored. Heart rate (HR), direct arterial blood pressure (ABP) and respiratory rate (fR) were recorded. Arterial and venous blood gas analyses were performed and venous plasma drug concentrations were measured. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linear mixed modelling for repeated measures, contrasts of least square means by Bonferroni correction tests, one-way anova for repeated measures with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests and paired Student's t-tests were used to compare results within and between treatments as appropriate. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results After R, ABP increased and HR and fR decreased significantly. After R + MK, HR, fR, systolic and mean ABP decreased. MK alone increased both HR and fR. After R, ABP was significantly higher than after R + MK. HR and fR were significantly higher after MK than after R and R + MK. Areas under the curve for sedation time were similar after R and R + MK. Intestinal activity decreased markedly after R and less after R + MK. Volume of distribution and clearance of romifidine were significantly higher and area under the concentration time curve extrapolated to infinity significantly lower after R + MK than after R. Conclusions Combined romifidine and MK-467 prevented the cardiovascular changes commonly seen with romifidine but did not affect sedation quality. Clinical relevance Combined IV romifidine and MK-467 can be used to attenuate the cardiovascular effects of romifidine, such as in horses with colic or undergoing general anaesthesia.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of propofol required to prevent purposeful movement in response to a standardized stimulus in goats. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Animals Eight healthy goats (four does, four wethers). Methods Anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg kg?1 propofol intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of propofol at 0.6 mg kg?1 minute?1 was initiated immediately to maintain anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing system delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial propofol infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before responses to noxious stimulation provided by clamping the proximal part of the claw with a Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds were tested. In the presence or absence of purposeful movements of the extremities, the infusion rate was increased or reduced by 0.1 mg kg?1 minute?1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw clamping was repeated. The propofol MIR for each goat was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Basic cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored, recorded and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. The quality of recovery from anaesthesia was assessed and scored. Results The median MIR of propofol was 0.45 mg kg?1 minute?1 (range: 0.45?0.55 mg kg?1 minute?1). Induction and recovery were free of adverse behaviour. No statistically significant cardiopulmonary changes in comparison with baseline were observed, but clinically relevant hypoxaemia at 2 minutes after induction of anaesthesia was consistently observed. Chewing during anaesthesia was observed in three goats. Median times to extubation and standing were 3 minutes (range: 2?6 minutes) and 10 minutes (range: 7?21 minutes), respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance Propofol induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia minimally compromise cardiopulmonary function when oxygen is supplemented in goats.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Summary A 16-year-old mare was presented as an emergency to the Equine Hospital of the Veterinary School of Lyon, with a 1-month history of respiratory distress. On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.
