AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the effects of a constant rate infusion (CRI) of romifidine on the requirement of isoflurane, cardiovascular performance and recovery in anaesthetized horses undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Study design? Randomized blinded prospective clinical trial. Animals? Thirty horses scheduled for routine arthroscopy. Methods? After premedication (acepromazine 0.02 mg?kg?1, romifidine 80??g?kg?1, methadone 0.1 mg?kg?1) and induction (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1 ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Horses were assigned randomly to receive a CRI of saline (group S) or 40??g?kg?1?hour?1 romifidine (group R). The influences of time and treatment on anaesthetic and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated using an analysis of variance. Body weight (t-test), duration of anaesthesia (t-test) and recovery score (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results? All but one horse were positioned in the dorsal recumbent position and ventilated from the start of anaesthesia. End tidal isoflurane concentrations were similar in both groups at similar time points and over the whole anaesthetic period. Cardiac output was significantly lower in horses of the R group, but there were no significant differences between groups in cardiac index, body weight or age. All other cardiovascular parameters were similar in both groups. Quality of recovery did not differ significantly between groups, but more horses in group R stood without ataxia at the first attempt. One horse from group S had a problematic recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance? No inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect or side effects were observed by using a 40??g?kg?1?hour?1 romifidine CRI in isoflurane anaesthetized horses under clinical conditions. Cardiovascular performance remained acceptable. Further studies are needed to identify the effective dose of romifidine that will induce an inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect in anaesthetized horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test whether partial pressure of CO2 in expired gas (P?CO2) predicts the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2) in apneic chickens during air sac insufflation anesthesia at three different ventilation states. Secondary objective: To determine the P?CO2 at which apnea occurs during air sac insufflation anesthesia. Study design Randomized cross-over study. Animals Twenty-three healthy male white leghorn chickens. Methods Chickens were anesthetized via mask with isoflurane in oxygen and an air sac cannula was placed in the right abdominal air sac. Delivery of isoflurane in O2 was transferred from the mask to the air sac cannula. The birds were maintained at a surgical plane of anesthesia and apnea was induced by adjusting gas flow; the P?CO2 at apnea was recorded. The birds were then paralyzed and gas flow was adjusted to achieve three different P?CO2s in random order: 43 mmHg (5.6 kPa) [hypoventilation]; 33 mmHg (4.3 kPa) [normoventilation]; and 23 mmHg (3.0 kPa) [hyperventilation]. After maintaining the target expired isoflurane concentration (EIso; 1.85 or 1.90%) and P?CO2 for 15 minutes, arterial blood gas analysis was performed to determine the PaCO2. The chickens were euthanized at the end of the experiment. Results Based on Bland-Altman comparisons, P?CO2 was not strongly associated with PaCO2 during the three ventilation states. The P?CO2 at which apnea occurred varied {median (minimum, maximum): 35 (30, 48) mmHg [4.6 (3.9, 6.2) kPa]}. Conclusions Measured P?CO2 cannot be used in a simple linear fashion to predict PaCO2 in birds during air sac insufflation anesthesia. The P?CO2 at which apnea occurs during air sac insufflation anesthesia is not predictable. Clinical relevance Arterial blood gases should be used to monitor CO2 during air sac insufflation anesthesia to verify appropriate patient ventilation.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the incidence of canine post-anesthetic aspiration pneumonia (AP) and to identify anesthetic agents, procedures and management factors associated with the development of AP. Study design Multicenter, randomized, case-controlled retrospective study. Animals Two hundred and forty dogs affected with AP and 488 unaffected control dogs. Methods Electronic medical record databases at six Veterinary colleges were searched for dogs, coded for anesthesia or sedation and pneumonia from January 1999 to December 2009. The resultant 2158 records were hand-searched to determine eligibility for inclusion. Diagnosis of AP was made radiographically. Two unaffected control dogs were randomly selected for each affected dog, from a list of dogs that underwent sedation or anesthesia in the same time period and did not develop aspiration pneumonia. Fifty-seven factors were then evaluated for association with aspiration pneumonia. Data analysis was performed using univariate Chi-square or student t-tests, then multivariate logistic regression. Results Incidence of post-anesthetic AP was 0.17%, from 140,711 cases anesthetized or sedated over the 10 year period. Two anesthesia-related events were significantly associated with development of AP: regurgitation and administration of hydromorphone at induction. Administration of anticholinergics was not associated with AP. Procedures associated with increased odds of aspiration pneumonia included laparotomy, upper airway surgery, neurosurgery, thoracotomy and endoscopy. Orthopedic surgery, ophthalmologic surgery, dental procedures, MRI, CT, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, tracheoscopy and neutering were not associated with development of AP. Three patient factors were associated with the development of AP: megaesophagus, and a history of pre-existing respiratory or neurologic disease. Sixty-nine% of dogs with two or more of the above independent predictive variables developed AP. Conclusion and clinical relevance Most anesthetic agents and procedures were not associated with the development of AP. We need to devise and evaluate strategies to protect at risk patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess whether the initiation of vasopressor infusions via peripheral venous catheters (PVC) compared to central venous catheters (CVC) in ED patients with early septic shock was associated with differences in processes of care and outcomes. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the ARISE trial. We compared participants who had a vasopressor infusion first commenced via a PVC versus a CVC. The primary outcome was 90 day mortality. Results We studied 937 participants. Of these, 389 (42%) had early vasopressor infusion commenced via a PVC and 548 (58%) via a CVC. Trial participants who received a vasopressor infusion via a PVC were more severely ill, with higher median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (17 [13?23] versus 16 [12?21], P = 0.003), and higher median (IQR) lactate (mmol/L) (3.6 [1.9?5.8] versus 2.5 [1.5?4.5], P?<?0.001). After adjusting for baseline covariates, the estimated odds ratio for mortality for PVC-treated patients was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.95?1.67, P = 0.11). Trial participants who had vasopressors commenced via PVC had a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of antimicrobials (55 [32?96] versus 71.5 [39?119] min, P?<?0.001) and a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of vasopressors (2.4 [1.3?3.9] versus 4.9 [3.5?6.6] h, P?<?0.001). Conclusion The practice of commencing a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was common in the ARISE trial and more frequent in trial participants with higher severity of illness. Commencement of a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was associated with some improvements in processes of care and, after adjustment, was not associated with an increased risk of death.

AB  - Abstract Background One-lung ventilation is a challenging airway technique in the pediatric population. Multiple airway devices can be employed, but there is no consensus as to the most reliable and physiologically advantageous method. This report is a review of the methods of one-lung ventilation in children in our practice, as well as an analysis of the impact of airway device type, patient age, and duration of lung separation on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. Methods The records of all pediatric patients undergoing procedures requiring one-lung ventilation in a single center over an 18-month period were reviewed. Demographics, time required to achieve lung separation (anesthesia ready-time), and duration of one-lung ventilation were collected. Data from arterial blood gas analysis and ventilator parameters were collected at three time points: 15 minutes prior to one-lung ventilation (pre?OLV), 15 minutes after initiation of one-lung ventilation (during OLV), and 15 minutes after one-lung ventilation was ended (post?OLV). Standard equations for calculating compliance, the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient were used. Results Forty-six patients were identified with a mean age of 9.3 (inner quartile range 3-15) years. All patients had significant changes in pulmonary function when comparing pre?OLV with during OLV and when comparing during OLV with post?OLV. There were no significant changes from pre? to post?OLV. On further analysis, there were more pronounced changes in compliance and gas exchange in older patients (P = 0.003; 95% CI: ?0.62 to ?0.14). There was also a significant decrease in post?OLV compliance with a longer duration of OLV (P = 0.018; 95% CI: ?0.02 to <?0.01). Airway device type did not have significant impact on the parameters examined. Conclusion Our report demonstrates significant changes in lung function during one-lung ventilation. One particular device does not seem to be superior. Though pre?OLV measures of pulmonary function correlate closely with post?OLV, older age and a prolonged duration of one-lung ventilation did impact compliance.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor frequently used to improve cardiac output (CO) in man. As the use of enoximone has not been reported in horses, the effects of this inodilator were examined in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies. Study design? Prospective, randomised, experimental study. Animals? Six healthy ponies, weighing 286 (212?367)?±?52?kg, aged 5.0?±?1.6?years (4?6.5). Methods? After sedation with romifidine [80??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)], general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1 IV) and ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen (Et Iso 1.7%). The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia (PaCO2 4.66?6.00?kPa). Each pony was anaesthetized twice with an interval of 3?weeks; receiving enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E) or saline (S) 90?minutes post-induction. Heart rate (HR), arterial (AP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured before treatment, every 5?minutes between T0 (treatment) and T30 and then every 10?minutes until T120. Cardiac output measurements (lithium dilution technique) and blood gas analysis (arterial and central venous samples) were performed before T0 and at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), venous admixture (Q?s/Q?t) and oxygen delivery (?O2) were calculated. Results? Enoximone induced significant increases in HR, CO, SV, Q?s/Q?t and ?O2 and a significant decrease in RAP. No significant differences were detected for AP, SVR and blood gases. No cardiac arrhythmias or other side effects were observed. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The present results suggest that in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies, enoximone has beneficial effects on CO and SV without producing significant changes in blood pressure. Despite an increase in Q?s/Q?t, ?O2 to the tissues was improved.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of two different constant rate infusions (CRI) of dexmedetomidine (1 and 1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1) in experimental ponies. Animals? Six healthy ponies (mean 306?±?SD 71?kg, 7.0?± 1.6?years). Study design? Prospective, randomized, experimental study. Methods? After premedication with intravenous (IV) dexmedetomidine (3.5??g?kg?1), anaesthesia was induced (T0) with ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV) and midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1 IV) and maintained with isoflurane (Fe?ISO 1.50%) in 55% oxygen for 150?minutes. Normocapnia was maintained using artificial ventilation. Three ponies received dexmedetomidine CRIs of 1 and 1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1 from T30 to T60 and T90 to T120 respectively. In the other three ponies, the order of the doses was reversed. Continuous monitoring included pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, anaesthetic gas monitoring, arterial and central venous pressures. Cardiac ouput (LiDCO technique) was measured and arterial and venous bloods taken every 15?minutes. Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), arterial and venous oxygen content (CaO2, CvO2) and oxygen delivery (?O2) were calculated. Analysis of variance with separate models for each CRI rate was used to detect differences between values obtained at the end of the CRI and their respective baseline values. A mixed model with these differences as response variable, pony as random effect and treatment and period as fixed effects was applied to find differences between the two CRIs (α?=?0.05 for all analyses). Results? Heart rate (HR), CI, CaO2, CvO2 and ?O2 decreased significantly, while significant increases were found in SVR, systolic arterial pressure and right atrial pressure with both infusion rates. No differences were found between the two dexmedetomidine CRI rates. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Although significant, cardiopulmonary effects of the dexmedetomidine CRIs in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies were small, without differences between the two dose rates.

Randomized ?blinded? prospective clinical study. Animals? Thirty calves (mean 4.7?±?SD 2.5?weeks old) undergoing umbilical surgery. Methods? After premedication with xylazine (0.1?mg?kg?1, IM), anaesthesia was induced with ketamine (4?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane in O2 administered through a circle breathing system. The calves were assigned randomly to receive a bolus of 2?mg?kg?1 lidocaine IV after induction of anaesthesia, followed by CRI of 50??g?kg?1?minute?1 (group L, n?=?15) or a bolus and CRI of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl, group S, n?=?15). End-tidal isoflurane was adjusted to achieve adequate depth of anaesthesia. Heart rate, direct arterial blood pressure and body temperature were measured intraoperatively. Groups were compared by t- tests, anova or Mann?Whitney rank sum test as appropriate. Results? The end-tidal concentration of isoflurane (median, IQR) was significantly lower in group L [1.0% (0.94?1.1)] compared to group S [1.2% (1.1?1.5)], indicating a 16.7% reduction in anaesthetic requirement during lidocaine CRI. Cardiopulmonary parameters and recovery times did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Lidocaine CRI may be used as a supplement to inhalation anaesthesia during umbilical surgery in calves in countries where such a protocol would be within the legal requirements for veterinary use in food animals. This study did not show any measurable benefit to the calves other than a reduction in isoflurane requirement.

AB  - Abstract History? Ten dogs weighing 36 (21.4?75)?kg [median (min?max)] and aged 3 (1?9)?years scheduled for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it. Physical Examination? Patients were classified as ASA I or II based on physical examination and basic hematology and biochemistry. Management? Each dog was managed using combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks and procedural sedation with an intravenous infusion of propofol (0.07?0.15?mg?kg?1?minute?1) and dexmedetomidine (1??g?kg?1?hour?1). None of the patients required conversion to general anesthesia as a result of response to surgical stimulation. The level of sedation was considered adequate in all patients and was characterized by occasional head lifting, thoracic limb stretching, yawning, lingual movements and swallowing. The eye position ranged from central to partial ventromedial rotation and was accompanied by spontaneous blinking. Intra-operative cardiovascular and ventilatory variables were considered within acceptable limits. Muscle relaxation at the surgical field was adequate and surgical conditions were indistinguishable from those produced by general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, no additional analgesics were considered necessary. The quality of the recoveries was considered excellent in all cases. Follow up? No additional pain relief was required in any of the dogs within the 10?hours following blockade. All dogs ate 5.5 (3.5?12)?hours after recovery. Ambulation occurred at 4 (2?6)?hours. No evidence of esophagitis or aspiration pneumonitis has been reported during a period of 1?year after the procedures in any of the dogs. Conclusion? When combined with femoral and sciatic nerve blocks, procedural sedation has the potential of being an alternative to general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it in the dog.

While the routine application of recruitments would benefit from the availability of dedicated large animal ventilators their impact on ventilation and perfusion in the horse is not yet well documented nor completely understood. Case history A healthy 533 kg experimental horse underwent general anaesthesia in lateral recumbency. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation a stepwise alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed. Management Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen using a large animal circle system. Mechanical ventilation was applied in pressure ventilation mode and an alveolar recruitment maneuver performed employing a sequence of ascending and descending positive end expiratory pressures. Next to the standard monitoring, which included spirometry, additionally three non-invasive monitoring techniques were used: electrical impedance tomography (EIT), volumetric capnography and respiratory ultrasonic plethysmography. The functional images continuously delivered by EIT initially showed markedly reduced ventilation in the dependent lung and allowed on-line monitoring of the dynamic changes in the distribution of ventilation during the recruitment maneuver. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of compliance, dead space fraction, tidal volumes and changes in end expiratory lung volume were possible without technical difficulties. Follow up The horse made an unremarkable recovery. Conclusion The novel non-invasive monitoring technologies used in this study provided unprecedented insights into the physiology of lung collapse and recruitment. The synergic information of these techniques holds promise to be useful when developing and evaluating new ventilatory strategies in horses.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate an infusion of propofol for anesthesia in comparison to tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia, evaluating physiological variables and recovery in squirrel monkeys. Study design Prospective non-blinded randomized study. Animals Eight healthy squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), aged 3 years and weighing 0.340?0.695 kg. Methods Premedication was intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg) and meperidine (4 mg). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg kg?1 minute?1) and maintained with propofol starting at 0.4 mg kg?1 minute?1 (PRO, n = 4) or IV tiletamine-zolazepam (5 mg kg?1) and maintained with supplementary doses of TZ (TZ, n = 4). Cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and lactate concentration were measured at the end of anesthesia. Quality and times of recovery were determined. Repeatedly measured data for significant differences were tested between groups with t-test and within groups by anova. Results Median time for induction of anesthesia in PRO was 180 seconds. Mean maintenance infusion rate of propofol was 0.43 ± 0.05 mg kg?1 minute?1, varying during the 1 hour period. One monkey died after administration of TZ; others required 1, 4, or 8 supplemental doses. Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between groups, but hypotension was recorded. Recovery times to ventral recumbency in PRO (32 ± 17 minutes) and TZ (84 ± 11 minutes) and normal ambulation in PRO (58 ± 22 minutes) and TZ (358 ± 109minutes) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Recovery quality was superior in PRO, with less ataxia and fewer unsuccessful attempts to stand. Lactate concentration was not different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between protocols, aside from the higher incidence of hypotension in PRO, indicating that further studies with a larger number of animals are required. Compared to tiletamine-zolazepam, propofol anesthesia provided faster and superior anesthetic recovery in these animals.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the respective effects of propofol and emulsified isoflurane administered alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine on the quality of induction of anesthesia, physiological variables and recovery in dogs. Study design Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals Thirty-six adult mixed-breed dogs. Methods Animals were randomly assigned to one of four induction protocols: propofol alone (group P); emulsified isoflurane alone (group EI); both propofol and dexmedetomidine (group PD), or both emulsified isoflurane and dexmedetomidine (group EID). Pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), non-invasive arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline, before induction, immediately after intubation (time 0), and at 5 minute intervals until the dog began to swallow and the trachea was extubated. The quality of induction and recovery, and degree of ataxia were scored by a single investigator unaware of group assignment. The durations of anesthesia and recovery, and the incidence of adverse events were recorded. Results There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. Systolic arterial pressure was lower in EID compared with P at 5 minutes. PR and fR were lower in PD and EID compared with P after induction. The PaCO2 at 5 minutes was higher than at baseline in group P. Ataxia score was lower in EID than in P. Time from induction to extubation and time from extubation to sternal recumbency were lower in EID compared with PD. Conclusions and clinical relevance There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. In PD and EID, but not in P, PR and fR were decreased after induction. The EID combination resulted in smooth and rapid induction and recovery and thus may be useful clinically for induction of anesthesia.
