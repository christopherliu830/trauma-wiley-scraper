AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the effects of intravenous (IV) magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) as a bolus followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) on anaesthetic requirements, neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, haemostasis and postoperative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design? Blinded randomized clinical trial. Animals? Sixteen female dogs. Methods? After intramuscular premedication with acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) and morphine (0.3?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.2?mg?kg?1) and propofol (2?mg?kg?1) intravenously and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen in all dogs. Dogs were randomly assigned to two groups, M and C. Group M received MgSO4 (50?mg?kg?1 over 15?minutes, followed by a 15?mg?kg?1?hour?1 CRI). Group C received an equivalent bolus and CRI of lactated Ringer?s solution. In addition, all dogs received lactated Ringer?s solution (10?mL?kg?1 over 15?minutes followed by 10?mL?kg?1?hour?1). End-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide tensions, cardio-respiratory variables, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured at different time points. Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed pre- and post-anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was evaluated using the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Data were analysed with repeated measures anova and Mann?Whitney U tests (p?<?0.05). Results? No statistically significant differences between groups were found in any of the measured variables. However, the alpha angle and maximal amplitude recorded by TEG in group M were significantly increased post-anaesthesia, but remained within the reference interval. One dog in Group M and two in Group C received rescue analgesia during recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance? As used in this study, MgSO4 failed to decrease isoflurane requirements, postoperative pain and stress hormone concentrations; however, it did not produce any cardio-respiratory or major haemostatic side effects. Administration of intravenous MgSO4 together with an opioid during ovariohysterectomy in dogs does not seem to provide any clinical advantage.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the potential of an intravenous (IV) sevoflurane formulation for maintenance of general anesthesia in dogs. Study design Prospective crossover design. Animals Six healthy, mature, mixed-breed dogs, four males and two females, weighing 11.7 ± 3.4 kg. Methods Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol IV for instrumentation. Baseline measurements were recorded before administration of either sevoflurane in oxygen (Sevo-Inh) or lipid-emulsified sevoflurane 8% v/v in 30% Intralipid IV (Sevo-E), 0.5 mL kg?1 over 5 minutes followed by an infusion at 0.1?0.3 mL kg?1 minute?1. Dogs were breathing spontaneously. The ?up-and-down? technique was used to determine the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane. Over 120 minutes, a tail clamp was applied every 15 minutes and sevoflurane administration was adjusted depending on the response. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration and variables were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes: heart rate (HR), systemic arterial pressure (sAP), respiratory rate (fR), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), arterial pH and blood gases, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Results There were no significant differences between treatments for HR, sAP, fR, SaO2, and biochemical variables (p > 0.05). pH and were significantly decreased, and PaCO2 increased from baseline in Sevo-E (p < 0.05). MAC was significantly lower for Sevo-E than for Sevo-Inh, although the required dose of sevoflurane (g hour?1) to maintain general anesthesia was not significantly different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Administration of 8% v/v sevoflurane lipid emulsion IV was effective in maintaining general anesthesia in dogs, but resulted in moderate cardiopulmonary depression, metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The amount of sevoflurane (g hour?1) required to maintain general anesthesia was significantly lower for inhaled than for IV sevoflurane.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. We sought to identify risk factors for PGD using the United Network for Organ Sharing/International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (UNOS/ISHLT) Registry. Methods:? A total of 6984 lung transplants between 1994 and 2002 were available for analysis. Potential risk factors were tested for association with PGD and multivariable logistic regression was applied to adjust for confounding. Results:? The overall incidence of PGD was 10.7% (95% CI 9.9?11.4). In multivariable analyses, factors independently associated with PGD were donor age >45?yr (p?<?0.001); donor head trauma (p?=?0.03); recipient body mass index >25?kg/m2 (p?=?0.005); recipient female gender (p?=?0.001); use of Eurocollins preservation solution (p?=?0.001); single lung transplant (p?=?0.005); increased ischemic time (p?<?0.001); and elevated recipient pulmonary artery systolic pressure at transplant (p?<?0.001). Recipient transplant diagnosis was strongly associated with PGD, with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension (p?<?0.001 for both), and idiopathic (p?<?0.001) or secondary pulmonary fibrosis (p?=?0.011) as significant and independent risk factors for PGD. Conclusions:? Risk factors for PGD in the UNOS/ISHLT registry are consistent with prior smaller studies. Recipient, donor, and therapy variables are independently associated with PGD, as defined in a large registry.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary effects of alfaxalone with propofol when used for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) during ovariohysterectomy in dogs. Study design? A prospective non-blinded randomized clinical study. Animals? Fourteen healthy female crossbred bitches, aged 0.5?5?years and weight 16?42?kg. Methods? Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.01?mg?kg?1 and morphine 0.4?mg?kg?1. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with either propofol or alfaxalone to effect for tracheal intubation followed by an infusion of the same agent. Dogs breathed spontaneously via a ?circle? circuit, with oxygen supplementation. Cardiopulmonary parameters (respiratory and heart rates, end-tidal carbon dioxide, tidal volume, and invasive blood pressures) were measured continuously and recorded at intervals related to the surgical procedure. Arterial blood samples were analysed for blood gas values. Quality of induction and recovery, and recovery times were determined. Non-parametric data were tested for significant differences between groups using the Mann?Whitney U-test and repeatedly measured data (normally distributed) for significant differences between and within groups by anova. Results? Both propofol and alphaxalone injection and subsequent infusions resulted in smooth, rapid induction and satisfactory maintenance of anaesthesia. Doses for induction (mean?±?SD) were 5.8?±?0.30 and 1.9?±?0.07?mg?kg?1 and for the CRIs, 0.37?±?0.09 and 0.11?±?0.01?mg?kg?1 per minute for propofol and alfaxalone respectively. Median (IQR) recovery times were to sternal 45 (33?69) and 60 (46?61) and to standing 74 (69?76) and 90 (85?107) for propofol and alphaxalone respectively. Recovery quality was good. Cardiopulmonary effects did not differ between groups. Hypoventilation occurred in both groups. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Following premedication with acepromazine and morphine, both propofol and alphaxalone produce good quality anaesthesia adequate for ovariohysterectomy. Hypoventilation occurs suggesting a need for ventilatory support during prolonged infusion periods with either anaesthetic agent.

AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - Anemon I is a new monitoring system that can be used to evaluate autonomic nervous system reactivity in real time by showing a simple, easily interpretated quantitative index (0?200), the Anemon Index (AI) (Junke et al. 2000). This study used the AI to evaluate the quality of analgesia during sevoflurane and fentanyl anaesthesia in pigs. Six healthy pigs, weighing 24.76?±?3.40?kg, were induced to anaesthesia with 5% sevoflurane (SEVO) in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. After endotracheal intubation SEVO was given at 1 MAC (2.66%) in 3?L?minute?1 oxygen. Fentanyl was infused IV at 50?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for the first 30?minutes of anaesthesia, discontinued for 30?minutes, and then infused at 100?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for another 30?minutes. Three mechanical noxious stimuli (needle prick, pin-prick and pressure on the abdomen) were applied for 15?seconds at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. The AI, ECG, invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), SpO2 by pulse oximetry, tidal volume, Fe?sevo, Fe?CO2 and respiratory rate were recorded before induction (baseline), after induction, after intubation and extubation, and before and during noxious stimulation at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. Recovery times were recorded. Statistically significant differences were determined by anova. Spearman rank-correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between AI and hemodynamic variables. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered significant. A significant (p?<?0.01) decrease in AI was recorded after anaesthetic induction, from 82.3?±?21.1 to 52.7?±?20.3. After intubation, AI increased slightly, but not significantly, to 71.7?±?27.1. A significant (p?<?0.05) increase of AI occurred after extubation. Nociceptive stimuli did not have any measurable effect either on AI or on recorded cardiovascular variables. There was no movement, respiratory changes, or any other visible response to noxious stimulation. The AI did not change significantly with the different doses of fentanyl. Respiratory depression and apnoea were seen in all animals during the fentanyl infusion; therefore, pigs received intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl resulted in a significant (p?<?0.001) decrease in MAP. Heart rate did not change significantly. There was no correlation between AI and cardiovascular variables (HR and MAP). Endotracheal intubation caused an increase and extubation a greater significant increase in the AI. This suggests that intubation and extubation may represent stressful events during general anaesthesia, although further studies are needed to validate the use of the AI in pigs. Sevoflurane anesthetic induction may not prevent the sympathetic stimulus caused by endotracheal intubation in pigs, as indicated by the increased AI values.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS; Jöbsis 1977) has been used in humans to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rsO2), decreases of which can be indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). This study investigated changes in rsO2, the redox status of cytochrome a/a3, and the cerebral total hemoglobin content using NIRS during different sedative and anaesthetic techniques in dogs. Eighty four foxhounds and 32 beagles aged 12.9?±?13.4 (6.3?94.4) (±SD (range)) months and weighing 24.8?±?6.6 (2.7?43) kg were divided randomly into four groups. Group AM received 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-methadone/fenpipramid (l-Polamivet) IV, group DM 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV, and group MM 40?µg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV. Group P was anaesthetized (7?mg?kg?1) and maintained (0.3?mg?kg?1?minute?1) with propofol. Thirty minutes after sedation groups AM, DM and MM received 8?µg?kg?1 naloxone IV, and at 35?minutes group MM received 200?µg?kg?1 atipamezole IV. NRIS was monitored continuously (recording interval, 1?second). Blood gases were analysed before and every 5?minutes after sedation or induction, and at 2 and 7?minutes post-naloxone injection or end of propofol infusion. Descriptive and comparative statistics (global: Kruskal?Wallis test, level of significance α?=?0.05, group comparison: Mann?Whitney test, α?=?0.0083), and Spearman's correlation were determined using the statistical software SPSS. Before drug administration rsO2 was 65?±?7% (n?=?109). One minute after drug administration significant differences between groups were found (Table 1). There was a significant increase of about 8% in rsO2 over time in the p group, whereas groups AM, DM and MM showed a significant decrease with the greatest reduction of 20% in group MM. One minute after naloxone IV pre-induction values were rapidly attained in groups AM (65.2?±?6%, n?=?31) and DM (65.4?±?5.4%, n?=?24) while in group MM (52.1?±?10.8%, n?=?27) pre-induction values of rsO2 were not reached until 1?minute after atipamezole IV (62.9?±?7.4%). Periodic breathing (MM) was mirrored by variations of rsO2. There were no significant changes or intergroup differences in the redox state of cytochrome a/a3 or of total cerebral hemoglobin content indicating cerebral blood volume (Wyatt et al. 1990). The 20% decrease in rsO2 in group MM is in the range regarded as indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply in humans (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). The effects of naloxone and atipamezole and the correlation with blood gas analysis demonstrate an influence of respiratory depression on the vascular cerebral O2 status whereas the lack of cytochrome a/a3 reduction indicates an undisturbed cellular O2 supply (Jöbsis 1977). In spite of some limitations in terms of applicability (Alef 2002). NIRS seems to enable the influence of clinical routines on cerebral oxygenation to be monitored although further validation of NIRS in the dog and the cat is required.

AB  - An economical anaesthetic technique of short duration that can be administered to piglets in the field is desirable for humanitarian reasons, for castration, tail docking or other brief procedures. Using the principles of anaesthetic uptake and distribution, an inhaler was developed to vaporize and administer isoflurane to piglets. The inhaler design consisted of a mask, vaporization chamber and a rebreathing bag. A stopcock provided access for injection of liquid isoflurane onto a wick contained in the vaporization chamber. Inspiratory and expiratory flow of air over the wick enhanced anaesthetic vaporization. The amount of liquid isoflurane required for induction and 2?3?minutes of surgical anaesthesia was calculated using the square root of time model proposed by Lowe & Ernst (1981) for liquid injection, closed circuit anaesthesia in people. Calculations were based on an assumed MAC of 1.4% and the achievement of a target alveolar concentration of 1.3 MAC to provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. The appropriate isoflurane concentrations in the mask, inhaler, rebreathing bag and the piglet's FRC and tissues were calculated. Original calculations were based on metabolic size (BW0.75) and then converted to weight (kg). Based on the piglet's scale weight, the total microliters of liquid isoflurane required were formulated into a table for field use. Isoflurane was injected into the inhaler stopcock followed by oxygen to fill the rebreathing bag and initiate vaporization. After the mask was placed over the piglet's nose a slide switch was activated to allow gases to move in and out of the inhaler and rebreathing bag. Fifty-seven male piglets weighing (mean?±?SD 3.0?±?0.7?kg) and aged 7.7?±?1.0?days were randomly selected to receive anaesthesia prior to castration. Remaining littermates served as controls for assessing morbidity or mortality. The time to induction, recovery and total anaesthetic time were measured. The Pe?CO2 was measured at the piglet's nostril immediately after the mask was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Data were analysed in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure. Inductions were rapid, 47?±?9?seconds, generally with minimal or no resistance. The duration of surgery was 1?2?minutes. Anaesthesia was adequate and recovery was rapid, 122?±?44?seconds. Total time from start to standing was 260?±?51?seconds. The Pe?CO2 was 5.2?±?1.1?kPa (39.4?±?8.4?mm?Hg). There was no morbidity or mortality associated with either group of piglets. After piglets were standing and mobile, they were returned to the sow and other littermates, where they immediately started nursing and were indistinguishable from littermates except by determination of ear notch number. This technique provides safe, rapid anaesthesia and recovery that is appropriate for use by veterinarians for brief field procedures.

AB  - A central eyeball position is often required during sedation or anaesthesia to facilitate examination of the eye. However, use of neuromuscular blockade to produce a central eye position may result in depressed ventilation. This study evaluated the eyeball position, muscle relaxation and changes in ventilation during general anaesthesia after the IV administration of 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium. With client consent, 12 dogs of different breeds, body mass 27.2?±?11.8?kg, aged 5.6?±?2.8?years (mean?±?SD) were anaesthetized for ocular examination. Pre-anaesthetic medication was 0.01?mg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.2?mg?kg?1 butorphanol IV. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect and maintained with 10?mg?kg?1?hour?1 propofol by infusion. The dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency, their trachea intubated and connected to a circle breathing system (FiO2?=?1.0). All dogs breathed spontaneously. The superficial peroneal nerve of the right hind leg was stimulated every 15?seconds with a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation pattern and neuromuscular function was assessed with an acceleromyograph (TOF-Guard). Adequacy of ventilation was measured with the Ventrak 1550. After 10?minutes of anaesthesia to allow stabilisation of baseline values, 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium was administered IV. Minute volume (Vm), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), Pe?CO2 and maximal depression of T1 and TOF ratio were measured. Data were analysed using a paired t-test. The changes in the eyeball position were recorded. A total of 100?±?33?seconds after the injection of rocuronium, T1 was maximally depressed to 62?±?21% and the TOF ratio to 42?±?18% of baseline values. Both variables returned to baseline after 366?±?132?seconds (T1) and 478?±?111?seconds (TOF). There was no significant reduction in Vm (2.32?±?1.1?L?minute?1), Vt (124.1?±?69.3?mL) and RR (10?±?3.8?breaths?minute?1) and no increase in Pe?CO2 (6.5?±?2.1?kPa (48.8?±?16.1?mm?Hg)) throughout the procedure. The eyeball rotated to a central position 35?±?7?seconds after rocuronium IV and remained there for a minimum of 20?±?7?minutes in all dogs. We conclude that rocuronium at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1 can be administered to dogs IV with minimal changes in ventilatory variables. The eyeball is fixed in a central position for at least 20?minutes, which greatly facilitates clinical examination.

AB  - Abstract Background Rat bite fever is a zoonotic disease that has been described in laboratory personnel as well as the general population. Methods A 24-year-old male pet shop employee contracted the disease through a minor superficial finger wound on a contaminated rat cage. The disease progressed from a flu-like illness to endocarditis involving first the aortic valve and then the mitral valve and septum. Despite aggressive therapy including two surgical procedures, the patient died from sepsis and multi-organ system failure 59 days after initial injury. Results This is the first reported case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a pet shop work setting. Conclusions Zoonotic infections may present a significant hazard to workers handling animals. Education on hazards of animal contact and other preventive measures are needed in small places of business like pet shops. Am. J. Ind. Med. 45:357?360, 2004. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may potentiate the opioid induced reduction in volatile anaesthetic requirements (Gomez de Segura et al. 1998). This study determined the reduction in the MAC of isoflurane (ISO) produced by ketoprofen (KETO) in dogs anaesthetized with fentanyl (FENT) and ISO. Six healthy female crossbred dogs, weighing 13.5?±?1.3 (mean?±?SD) kg and aged 3.0?±?0.9?years were studied. Approval of the study was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. Anaesthesia was induced in all dogs via a facemask with 5% ISO in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. The dogs' trachea were intubated and lungs were ventilated to maintain normocapnia (Pe?CO2 4.7?6?kPa, 35?45?mm?Hg). A heating pad was used to maintain body temperature. The animals were anaesthetized four times at one week intervals with the following anaesthetic and analgesic protocols randomly administered. Study 1, MAC (ISO); Isoflurane MAC. Study 2, MAC (ISO?+?FENT); dogs anaesthetized with ISO received a loading dose of 30?µg?kg?1 FENT IV over 20?minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2?µg?kg?1?minute?1 FENT. Study 3, MAC (ISO?+?FENT?+?KETO1); as study 2 plus 1?mg?kg?1 KETO. Study 4, MAC (ISO?+?FENT?+?KETO2); as study 2 plus 2?mg?kg?1 KETO. The MAC was determined in duplicate by applying a standard electrical stimulus (50?V, 50?H2 over 60?seconds via two needles placed SC over the tarsus). The stimulus was applied 15?minutes after every step change in anesthetic concentration. The Wilcoxon test was applied to data to determine significant differences among MAC measurements. Fentanyl significantly decreased MAC (ISO) from 1.27%?±?0.02% to 0.73%?±?0.08%, a reduction of 42% (p?<?0.05). Ketoprofen 1?mg?kg?1 further decreased the MAC value (although not statistically significantly) with a reduction of 47% from MAC (ISO) (0.67%?±?0.13%) and 8% from MAC (ISO?+?FENT). When KETO 2?mg?kg?1 was given, the reduction in MAC was 50% compared to MAC (ISO) (0.63%?±?0.08%; p?<?0.05) and 14% compared to MAC (ISO?+?FENT) p?<?0.05. Administration of KETO further reduces MAC (ISO) compared to levels observed with FENT alone. The observed reduction may have clinical advantages.

AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) produced by mivacurium in the cat. Mivacurium is a short acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase and is expected to have a predictable effect of short duration (Maehr et al. 1991; Gyermek et al. 1999). Thirteen cats (seven females, six males) aged 2?14?years, body mass 3.5?5.9?kg, undergoing corneal surgery were anaesthetized with propofol (3?6?mg?kg?1 IV) after pre-anesthetic medication IM with an opioid alone or in combination with acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) or medetomidine (0.01?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (13 cats) or halothane (1 cat) in oxygen (33%) and nitrous oxide (66%) with mechanical ventilation. Cats were monitored using an ECG, side-stream capnography, and a Doppler flow sensor which was positioned on the pedal artery to estimate systolic blood pressure. The peroneal nerve was stimulated with a train-of-four (TOF) and Double Burst (DBS) pattern using a peripheral nerve stimulator, to assess the degree of NMB. Mivacurium IV (0.1?mg?kg?1) was administered over 10?seconds. The TOF stimulation was applied every 12?seconds until no twitch was apparent (onset time) and continued until the TOF ratio was considered to be 1. Response to DBS stimulation was then assessed until the ratio was 1. The same procedure was followed after recovery of a DBS ratio of 1, if administration of a further dose of mivacurium (0.05?mg?kg?1) was required. Times of onset of NMB, return of the 1st and 4th twitches, TOF and DBS ratio of 1, were recorded, and descriptive analyses performed. The effects of mivacurium on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SAP) and variations in onset and recovery time of NMB between the first bolus and the subsequent doses were determined using a paired Student t-test. The HR and SAP did not change significantly after administration of mivacurium. The onset time was significantly shorter (p?<?0.0001) after administration of the second dose of mivacurium (48?±?8?seconds) compared to the initial dose (107?±?17?seconds). The time to return of the first twitch (11?minutes 12?seconds?±?3?minutes 26?seconds) and to DBS 1 (16?minutes 41?seconds?±?4?minutes 21?seconds) were longer after the first dose than after subsequent doses (8?minutes 56?seconds ±?2?minutes 2?seconds and 18?minutes 28?seconds ±?7?minutes 19?seconds, respectively). However, a second dose of mivacurium was administered in only three cats. Reversal of NMB was never required. Mivacurium is a short acting muscle relaxant in the cat, without apparent cumulative effect after repeated dosing. The time to complete recovery in 97.5% of patients after a single bolus is estimated to be 25?minutes (mean?±?2 SD).

AB  - Alpha2 agonists have a significant role in epidural anaesthetic techniques. However, there are few reports regarding epidural administration of these drugs especially in small animals (Greene et al. 1995; Keegan et al. 1995; Vesal et al. 1996). This study compared the haemodynamic effects of xylazine and medetomidine after epidural injection in dogs. Six dogs (four females and two males) weighing 27.5?±?3.39?kg, aged 5.6?±?1.42?years were studied on two separate occasions one month apart. Dogs were sedated with 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam IM and 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM. After 20?minutes, a lumbosacral epidural injection of 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine was administered (group X). One month later, following the same sedation, 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine was administered epidurally (group M). Haemodynamic variables (ECG and indirect blood pressure (Doppler)), respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded before (baseline) and then every 5?minutes after the epidural injection, up to 60?minutes. Differences between groups were compared by a paired t-test. Within group changes were compared to basal values by anova. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both groups showed significant reductions in heart rate (106.3?±?7.7 beats?minute?1 baseline versus 67.7?±?7.6 (group M); 91?±?3.8 baseline versus 52.3?±?9 (group X)) and mean arterial blood pressure (113.1?±?12.3?mm?Hg baseline versus 87?±?11 (group M); 118?±?7 baseline versus 91?±?14 (group X)). There were no differences between groups in these variables. After epidural injection, first degree atrioventricular block was recorded significantly more often in group X (50% against 33%) but second degree block was significantly more frequent in group M (66% against 33%). Also 50% of dogs in group X and 66% in group M showed sinus arrest. Respiratory rate decreased significantly in both groups following the epidural injection (20.66?±?0.66?minute?1 baseline versus 16.33?±?4.77 (group M); 37.66?±?0.56 baseline versus 16.33?±?1.81 group X), but no differences between groups were observed. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in group X (38.16?±?0.21) with respect to the basal measurement (39.30?±?0.14?°C). In group M, there was no significant reduction in temperature, however, no statistical difference in rectal temperature was found between groups. This study shows that 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine and 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine produce similar, significant cardiovascular and respiratory changes following lumbosacral epidural administration in dogs.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare two methods of measuring physiological dead space/tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) and alveolar dead space (VdALV). Measurements were obtained by automated single breath CO2 analysis (Ventrak 1550/Capnoguard 1265 (V VdALV: 56.1?64.3?mL) did not differ significantly from those calculated arithmetically (Vd/Vt: 0.62?0.63; VdALV: 54.09?66.31?mL). The mean differences and standard deviation in Vd/Vt was 0.63?±?0.00 and in VdALV 58.98?±?4.28?mL for the two measurement techniques. Our data indicate that V&C can be used for accurate noninvasive online Vd/Vt and VdALV measurements in anaesthetized ventilated dogs.

AB  - This study evaluated the influences of carprofen and the experience of the surgeon on post-castration pain in lambs and young sheep castrated in the field. A total of 201, 1?6-week-old lambs with a mean body mass of 11.0?±?2.4?kg (mean?±?SD) were castrated after local application of 4?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively lambs were given either 20?mg carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. A further 34 sheep, aged 6?months, with a mean body mass of 36.0?±?4.5?kg were castrated after local application of 7?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively sheep received 2?mg?kg?1 carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. Lidocaine was injected SC in front of, behind and into each spermatic cord. All surgery was performed using the same Burdizzo clamp (jaw 45?mm wide, handles 225?mm) either by students or experienced veterinary surgeons. Pain was assessed preoperatively and at 24, 48 and 72?hours after castration by two independent observers unaware of the treatment group. Observers scored pain using a visual analog scale (100?mm) after applying gentle pressure onto the scrotal region (Thornton  20% versus 13%, p?=?0.0062 at 48?hours; 16% versus 10%, p?=?0.0088 at 72?hours) and significantly more swelling (18% versus 8%, p?=?0.0189) of the scrotal region than those castrated by veterinary surgeons. Young sheep receiving carprofen preoperatively had significantly lower pain scores (12?mm versus 25?mm, p?=?0.037) 24?hours after surgery compared to sheep receiving saline. No scrotal swelling was obvious in sheep. Juvenile sheep but not lambs, receiving carprofen preoperatively showed reduced pain scores up to 24?hours after surgery. Carprofen reduced swelling of the scrotum in lambs. Lambs castrated by experienced surgeons scored lower VAS scores at all times and showed less swelling of the scrotal region.
