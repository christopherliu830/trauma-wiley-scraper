AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: In order to evaluate its potential as an adjunct to inhalant anaesthesia in horses, the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl must first be determined. Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its metabolite, N-[1-(2-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)maloanilinic acid (PMA), after i.v. administration of a single dose to horses that were awake in Treatment 1 and anaesthetised with isoflurane in Treatment 2. Methods: A balanced crossover design was used (n = 4/group). During Treatment 1, horses received a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) and during Treatment 2, they were anaesthetised with isoflurane and maintained at 1.2 ? minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration. After a 30 min equilibration period, a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) was administered to each horse. Plasma fentanyl and PMA concentrations were measured at various time points using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Anaesthesia with isoflurane significantly decreased mean fentanyl clearance (P < 0.05). The fentanyl elimination half-life, in awake and anaesthetised horses, was 1 h and volume of distribution at steady state was 0.37 and 0.26 l/kg bwt, respectively. Anaesthesia with isoflurane also significantly decreased PMA apparent clearance and volume of distribution. The elimination half-life of PMA was 2 and 1.5 h in awake and anaesthetised horses, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and PMA in horses were substantially altered in horses anaesthetised with isoflurane. These pharmacokinetic parameters provide information necessary for determination of suitable fentanyl loading and infusion doses in awake and isoflurane-anaesthetised horses.

AB  - This study evaluated the influences of carprofen and the experience of the surgeon on post-castration pain in lambs and young sheep castrated in the field. A total of 201, 1?6-week-old lambs with a mean body mass of 11.0?±?2.4?kg (mean?±?SD) were castrated after local application of 4?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively lambs were given either 20?mg carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. A further 34 sheep, aged 6?months, with a mean body mass of 36.0?±?4.5?kg were castrated after local application of 7?mL lidocaine (2%). Preoperatively sheep received 2?mg?kg?1 carprofen SC or an equal volume of saline in a randomized order. Lidocaine was injected SC in front of, behind and into each spermatic cord. All surgery was performed using the same Burdizzo clamp (jaw 45?mm wide, handles 225?mm) either by students or experienced veterinary surgeons. Pain was assessed preoperatively and at 24, 48 and 72?hours after castration by two independent observers unaware of the treatment group. Observers scored pain using a visual analog scale (100?mm) after applying gentle pressure onto the scrotal region (Thornton  20% versus 13%, p?=?0.0062 at 48?hours; 16% versus 10%, p?=?0.0088 at 72?hours) and significantly more swelling (18% versus 8%, p?=?0.0189) of the scrotal region than those castrated by veterinary surgeons. Young sheep receiving carprofen preoperatively had significantly lower pain scores (12?mm versus 25?mm, p?=?0.037) 24?hours after surgery compared to sheep receiving saline. No scrotal swelling was obvious in sheep. Juvenile sheep but not lambs, receiving carprofen preoperatively showed reduced pain scores up to 24?hours after surgery. Carprofen reduced swelling of the scrotum in lambs. Lambs castrated by experienced surgeons scored lower VAS scores at all times and showed less swelling of the scrotal region.

AB  - Acepromazine, a phenothiazine tranquilizer, causes hypotension in standing horses (Parry et al. 1982). However, a retrospective study (Taylor & Young 1993) showed that acepromazine pre-anesthetic medication did not affect arterial blood pressure (MAP) in anaesthetized horses. This study examined the effects of acepromazine on MAP during romifidine?ketamine?halothane anaesthesia in horses anaesthetized for various surgical procedures. Forty-four horses were allocated by block randomization to groups A and B. Group A received acepromazine 0.05?mg?kg?1 IM 30?minutes before induction of anaesthesia, group B did not. All horses received romifidine 0.1?mg?kg?1 IV 5?minutes before anaesthesia was induced with diazepam 0.05?mg?kg?1 and 2.2?mg?kg?1 ketamine IV. The horses' trachea were intubated and horses breathed 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide plus halothane (concentration adjusted as required clinically) from a circle breathing system. Nitrous oxide was discontinued after 10?minutes and analgesics, flunixin 1.1?mg?kg?1 and either morphine 0.1?mg?kg?1 or butorphanol 0.05?mg?kg?1 (matched for horses undergoing the same procedure) administered IV. The facial or dorsal metatarsal artery was catheterized for direct measurement of MAP (every 10?min) and withdrawal of blood for gas analysis (every 30?min). The electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored continuously with a 10?seconds printout obtained every 10?minutes. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was instigated if PaCO2 exceeded 9.3?kPa (70?mm?Hg). Dobutamine was infused (1.0?5.0?kg?1minute?1) if MAP?<?58?mm?Hg and was continued until MAP?>?70?mm?Hg. Mean age, weight and duration of anaesthesia were compared between the groups using a t-test for independent samples. Gender distribution and numbers of horses requiring IPPV or dobutamine were compared between groups using a chi-squared test (with Yates correction). To compare MAP over time, the area under the curve (MAPAUC) was calculated and compared between groups using a t-test. Horses receiving dobutamine were excluded from MAPAUC and MAP comparisons. The ECG printouts were examined for arrhythmias. There were no significant differences between groups (p?>?0.05). Group A contained three stallions, 10 geldings and nine mares, aged 6.3?years (range 0.75?18). Group B comprised eight stallions, 11 geldings and three mares aged 7.3(1?16)?years. Duration of anaesthesia was group A 97 (50?140)?minutes, group B 99 (50?160)?minutes. Eight horses in group A and three in group B required IPPV. Nine horses in group A and four in group B received dobutamine. Mean arterial pressure ranged from 60 to 128?mm?Hg in group A and 58?96?mm?Hg in group B. Mean MAPAUC was 5941?mm?Hg?minute?1 in group A, in B 6000?mm?Hg?minute?1. Atrial pre-mature complexes were recorded from one horse in group B. No other arrhythmias were detected. Although MAP was lower in the acepromazine group, this appeared unlikely to cause a clinical problem. The incidence of arrhythmias was too low to determine the influence of acepromazine in this study.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACP), a member of the phenothiazine family, has antioxidant properties and interacts with reactive oxygen species produced by stimulated neutrophils (Serteyn et al. 1999). We found that ACP reduced the differentiation of monocytes induced by an overnight incubation with a crude Chlamydia pneumoniae extract (Serteyn et al. 2001). The same model was used to test the effects of phenothiazines on the TNF-α release by activated monocytes. A crude Chlamydia pneumoniae extract was obtained by mechanical disruption and centrifugation (1?minute, 1500?r.p.m.) of 78?hours infected McCoy cells. Monocytes (THP1 cell line; 2???106 cells by assay) were incubated overnight with 30?µL of Chlamydia pneumoniae crude extract (equivalent to an endotoxin charge of 3.5?pg) in the presence or absence of phenothiazines (from 10?6 to 10?4 M) (Mouithys-Mickalad et al. 2001). For estimation of TNF-α release, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged (to eliminate the undifferentiated monocytes) and used for TNF-α measurements (n?=?6) (Quantikine HS human TNF-α, R&D Systems, UK). Acepromazine was compared to other phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine) or to structural analogues of phenothiazines (phenoxazine, thioxanthen-9-one and methylene blue). For each assay, cytotoxicity was evaluated by microscopic examination and blue trypan exclusion method. Mean values of TNF-α were compared by a Student t-test (p?<?0.05). TNF-α release by Chlamydia-treated THP1 was significantly decreased by ACP in a dose-dependent manner, 378?±?30, 209?±?38 and 189?±?35?ng?mL?1 for 10?6, 10?5 and 10?4 M compared to the control values 385?±?9?ng?mL?1. Similar inhibitions of TNF-α release were obtained with trifluoperazine (313?±?25 and 265?±?14?ng?mL?1 at 10?6 and 10?5 M) and chlorpromazine (323?±?29 and 227?±?13?ng?mL?1 at 10?6 and 10?5 M), but at 10?4 M, these two drugs were cytotoxic. The other structurally parent compounds increased significantly the TNF-α production: 630?±?46 and 468?±?60?ng?mL?1 for thioxanthen-9-one and 547?±?17 and 331?±?111?ng?mL?1 for methylene blue at 10?5 and 10?6 (M). At 10?4 M, the two compounds were cytotoxic. Phenoxazine increased the TNF-α production, slightly at 10?6 and 10?5 M (444?±?39 and 424?±?16?ng?mL?1, respectively) and significantly at 10?4 M (959?±?30?ng?mL?1). Further studies are needed to verify if the inhibition of TNF-α release by some phenothiazines could be linked to a reduction of the signal transduction, especially the NF-?B pathway. These results could be interesting for the anaesthesia or treatment of animals suffering from a systemic inflammatory reaction.

AB  - Studies evaluating the effects of dobutamine in horses do not consistently report increases in cardiac output despite increases in arterial blood pressure. The concurrent administration of the α2 agonist clonidine, in people, inhibited the chronotropic effects of dobutamine and increased left ventricular stroke work (Zimpfer et al. 1982). Our study was performed to determine if pre-medication with an α2 agonist affects the response to dobutamine in anaesthetized horses. Eleven horses were anaesthetized on four separate occasions for one of four randomly assigned treatments; (I) no xylazine, no dobutamine (II) xylazine, no dobutamine (III) no xylazine, dobutamine, and (IV) xylazine, dobutamine. Horses received 0.02?mg?kg?1 of butorphanol IV 10?minutes prior to anesthetic induction. Two?minutes prior to induction, groups II and IV received 0.5?mg?kg?1 of IV xylazine. Anaesthesia was induced with 6?7?mg?kg?1 of thiopental and maintained with halothane. End-tidal halothane concentrations were maintained between 1.1 and 1.2% in groups I and III, and 0.9?1.0% for groups II and IV. Heart rate, cardiac output, right atrial pressure, and systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial pressure were recorded 30?minutes after beginning halothane anaesthesia (T10). Cardiac output was estimated using Lithium dilution (Linton et al. 2000). Baseline measurements were repeated twice, at 5-minute intervals (T5 and T0). At time 0 (T0), an IV infusion of either saline (100?mL?hour?1) or dobutamine (0.001?mg?kg?1?minute?1) was started and data recorded at 5-minute intervals for 30?minutes (T5 ? T30). Stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were calculated. Data were analysed using repeated measures anova (p?<?0.01 significant) and Newman?Keuls for multiple comparisons. Cardiac output and stroke volume increased over time in groups III and IV. Cardiac index was higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T10 until completion of the study. Estimates of cardiac index at T30 for groups I?IV were 45?±?9, 46?±?11, 71?±?11, and 78?±?19?mL?kg?1?minute?1, respectively (mean?±?SD). Stroke index was higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T15 to T30. Values for stroke index at T30 for groups I?IV were 0.98?±?0.19, 1.11?±?0.18, 1.46?±?0.21, 1.74?±?0.33?mL?kg?1. Heart rate decreased from T10?T30 in groups I and II. Heart rate was greater in groups I and III than in groups II and IV at T5 and T0. Values for heart rate at T0 for groups I?IV were 48?±?5, 42?±?5, 50?±?4, 43?±?4 beats?minute?1. Systolic arterial pressure, DAP and MAP were higher in groups III and IV than in groups I and II from T5 to T30. There were no differences in SVR between groups. Dobutamine at 0.001?mg?kg?1?minute?1 increased cardiac output, blood pressure, and stroke volume. Premedication with xylazine at 0.5?mg?kg?1 did not appear to affect the response to dobutamine.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the efficacy and cardiopulmonary effects of propofol and fentanyl, with propofol and midazolam for total intravenous anaesthesia. Study design? Prospective, randomized, crossover experimental study. Animals? Six goats; three does and three wethers. Methods  Goats received either fentanyl 0.02?mg kg?1 (treatment FP) or midazolam 0.3 mg kg?1 (treatment MP) intravenously. One minute later anaesthesia was induced with propofol, then maintained by constant rate infusion of propofol 12.0?mg kg?1?hour?1 and fentanyl 0.02?mg?kg?1 hour?1 (treatment FP) or propofol 12.0?mg?kg?1 hour?1 and midazolam 0.3?mg??kg?1?hour?1 (treatment MP) for 90?minutes. Response to noxious stimulus was tested every 10?minutes and propofol dose adjusted to prevent purposeful movement. Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured continuously, and arterial blood-gas analysis performed intermittently. Recovery was timed and quality scored. Results are presented as median (IQR). Results? Differences in the propofol induction dose [4.00 (3.96?4.01) and 3.97 (3.91?4.00) mg?kg?1 for treatments FP and MP, respectively] were not significant. Quality of induction in both groups was smooth. The median propofol dose for maintenance was less (p?=?0.004) with treatment FP (12.0?mg?kg?1?hour?1) than MP (18.0?mg?kg?1?hour?1). Cardiopulmonary function was well maintained with both treatments. Recovery times in minutes from the end of anaesthetic infusion for treatments FP and MP respectively were; to extubation 3.0 (3.0?3.0) and 4.5 (3.3?5.0); to sternal position, 4.5 (3.3?5.0) and 5.0 (5.0?6.5) and to standing 13.0 (10.3?15.0) and 15.0 (11.3?17.3). Quality of recovery was acceptable in both groups, but abnormal behavioural signs were observed after treatment FP. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl or propofol and midazolam, at the doses studied, in spontaneously-breathing, oxygen-supplemented goats is practicable. Recovery from the fentanyl-propofol combination is not always smooth.

AB  - Background Tetrastarch can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) in humans with sepsis, but less likely to result in tissue edema than lactated Ringer's solution (LRS). Objectives Compare effects of volume replacement (VR) with LRS and 6% tetrastarch solution (TS) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) and markers of AKI in hemorrhaged dogs. Animals Six healthy English Pointer dogs (19.7?35.3 kg). Methods Prospective crossover study. Animals underwent anesthesia without hemorrhage (Control). Two weeks later, dogs hemorrhaged under anesthesia on 2 occasions (8-week washout intervals) and randomly received VR with LRS or TS at 3 : 1 or 1 : 1 of shed blood, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained until 4 hour after VR for EVLW measurements derived from transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine concentrations in plasma and urine were measured until 72 hour after VR. Results The EVLW index (mL/kg) was lower at 1 hour after TS (10.0 ± 1.9) in comparison with controls (11.9 ± 3.4, P = 0.04), and at 4 hour after TS (9.7 ± 1.9) in comparison with LRS (11.8 ± 2.7, P = 0.03). Arterial oxygen partial pressure-to-inspired oxygen fraction ratio did not differ among treatments from 0.5 to 4 hour after VR. Urine NGAL/creatinine ratio did not differ among treatments and remained below threshold for AKI (120,000 pg/mg). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Although TS causes less EVLW accumulation than LRS, neither fluid produced evidence of lung edema (impaired oxygenation). Both fluids appear not to cause AKI when used for VR after hemorrhage in healthy nonseptic dogs.

AB  - Summary Background Medetomidine suppresses cardiovascular function and reduces gastrointestinal motility in horses mainly through peripheral α2-adrenoceptors. Vatinoxan, a peripheral α2-antagonist, has been shown experimentally to alleviate the adverse effects of some α2-agonists in horses. However, vatinoxan has not been investigated during constant-rate infusion (CRI) of medetomidine in standing horses. Objectives To evaluate effects of vatinoxan on cardiovascular function, gastrointestinal motility and on sedation level during CRI of medetomidine. Study design Experimental, randomised, blinded, cross-over study. Methods Six healthy horses were given medetomidine hydrochloride, 7 ?g/kg i.v., without (MED) and with (MED+V) vatinoxan hydrochloride, 140 ?g/kg i.v., followed by CRI of medetomidine at 3.5 ?g/kg/h for 60 min. Cardiorespiratory variables were recorded and borborygmi and sedation levels were scored for 120 min. Plasma drug concentrations were measured. The data were analysed using repeated measures ANCOVA and paired t-tests as appropriate. Results Initially heart rate (HR) was significantly lower and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) significantly higher with MED compared with MED+V. For example at 10 min HR (mean ± s.d.) was 26 ± 2 and 31 ± 5 beats/minute (P = 0.04) and MAP 129 ± 15 and 103 ± 13 mmHg (P<0.001) respectively. At 10 min, cardiac index was lower (P = 0.02) and systemic vascular resistance higher (P = 0.001) with MED than with MED+V. Borborygmi were reduced after MED; this effect was attenuated by vatinoxan (P<0.001). All horses were sedated with medetomidine, but the mean sedation scores were reduced with MED+V until 20 min (6.8 ± 0.8 and 4.5 ± 1.5 with MED and MED+V, respectively, at 10 min, P = 0.001). Plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was significantly lower in the presence of vatinoxan (P = 0.01). Main limitations Experimental study with healthy, unstimulated animals. Conclusions Vatinoxan administered i.v. with a loading dose of medetomidine improved cardiovascular function and gastrointestinal motility during medetomidine CRI in healthy horses. Sedation was slightly yet significantly reduced during the first 20 min.. The Summary is available in Portuguese ? see Supporting Information

Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) hyoscine premedication on physiologic variables following IV administration of medetomidine in horses. Study design Randomized, crossover experimental study. Animals Eight healthy crossbred horses weighing 330 ± 39 kg and aged 7 ± 4 years. Methods Baseline measurements of heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), respiratory rate, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), percentage of patients with second degree atrioventricular (2oAV) block, mean arterial pressure (MAP), pH, and arterial partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen (PaO2) were obtained 5 minutes before administration of IV hyoscine (0.14 mg kg?1; group HIV), IM hyoscine (0.3 mg kg?1; group HIM), or an equal volume of physiologic saline IV (group C). Five minutes later, medetomidine (7.5 ?g kg?1) was administered IV and measurements were recorded at various time points for 130 minutes. Results Medetomidine induced bradycardia, 2oAV blocks and increased SVR immediately after administration, without significant changes in CI or MAP in C. Hyoscine administration induced tachycardia and hypertension, and decreased the percentage of 2oAV blocks induced by medetomidine. Peak HR and MAP were higher in HIV than HIM at 88 ± 18 beats minute?1 and 241 ± 37 mmHg versus 65 ± 16 beats minute?1 and 192 ± 38 mmHg, respectively. CI was increased significantly in HIV (p ≤ 0.05). Respiratory rate decreased significantly in all groups during the recording period. pH, PaCO2 and PaO2 were not significantly changed by administration of medetomidine with or without hyoscine. Conclusion and clinical relevance Hyoscine administered IV or IM before medetomidine in horses resulted in tachycardia and hypertension under the conditions of this study. The significance of these changes, and responses to other dose rates, requires further investigation.

AB  - Summary In the first edition of this journal, Barbara Weaver wrote a review titled ?Equine Anaesthesia?, stating that, at that time, it was quickly becoming accepted practice that many horses were being anaesthetised ?by essentially similar procedures, i.e. premedication, induction and then maintenance by controlled inhalation?. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first edition of this journal, this review covers the development of understanding and practice of inhalational anaesthesia and controlled ventilation in horses over the last 50 years. We review how the perceived benefits of halothane led to its widespread use, but subsequently better understanding of halothane's effects led to changes in equine anaesthetic practice and the utilisation of different inhalation agents (e.g. isoflurane and sevoflurane). We discuss how more recently, better understanding of the effects of the ?newer? inhalation agents? effects has led to yet more changes in equine anaesthetic practice, and while, further new inhalation agents are unlikely to appear in the near future, further enhancements to anaesthetic practice may still lead to improved outcomes. We review advances in our understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the equine lung as well of the effects of anaesthesia on lung function and how these predispose to some of the common problems of gas exchange and ventilation during anaesthesia. We identify the aims of optimal mechanical ventilation for anaesthetic management and whether the various methods of ventilatory support during equine anaesthesia achieve them. We also highlight that further developments in equipment and optimal ventilator modes are likely in the near future.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.
