AB  - Summary The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are effective statistical tools for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for binary-class medical data. However, many real-world biomedical problems involve more than two categories. The Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) and Hypervolume Under the ROC Manifold (HUM) measures are extensions for the AUC under three-class and multiple-class models. Inference methods for such measures have been proposed recently. We develop a method of constructing a linear combination of markers for which the VUS or HUM of the combined markers is maximized. Asymptotic validity of the estimator is justified by extending the results for maximum rank correlation estimation that are well known in econometrics. A bootstrap resampling method is then applied to estimate the sampling variability. Simulations and examples are provided to demonstrate our methods.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract Objective The present study aimed to describe and examine similarities and differences in the current service provision and resuscitation protocols of the ambulance services participating in the Aus-ROC Australian and New Zealand out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Epistry. Understanding these similarities and differences is important in identifying ambulance service factors that might explain regional variation in survival of OHCA in the Aus-ROC Epistry. Methods A structured questionnaire was completed by each of the ambulance services participating in the Aus-ROC Epistry. These ambulance services were SA Ambulance Service, Ambulance Victoria, St John Ambulance Western Australia, Queensland Ambulance Service, St John Ambulance NT, St John New Zealand and Wellington Free Ambulance. The survey aimed to describe ambulance service and dispatch characteristics, resuscitation protocols and details of cardiac arrest registries. Results We observed similarities between services with respect to the treatment of OHCA and dispatch systems. Differences between services were observed in the serviced population; the proportion of paramedics with basic life support, advanced life support or intensive care training skills; the number of OHCA cases attended; guidelines related to withholding or terminating resuscitation attempts; and the variables that might be used to define ?attempted resuscitation?. All seven participating ambulance services were noted to have existing OHCA registries. Conclusion There is marked variation between ambulance services currently participating in the Aus-ROC Australian and New Zealand OHCA Epistry with respect to workforce characteristics and key variable definitions. This variation between ambulance services might account for a proportion of the regional variation in survival of OHCA.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Background:? The aims of this cohort study were to assess the survival of trauma patients treated in a general intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, injury severity score (ISS), age, sex and severe head injury as predictors of 30-day mortality. Methods:? Three hundred and twenty-five adult patients admitted during 1998?2003 were evaluated retrospectively with update of survival data in January 2005. Kaplan?Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to study survival and to assess predictors of mortality, respectively. Results:? The 30-day mortality was 16.9%, ICU mortality 13.8% and hospital mortality 17.8%. Long-term survival (observation time, 1?7 years) was 77.8%. After 3.5 years, mortality was the same as for the background population. Severe head injury was the main cause of death and increased the risk of 30-day mortality 2.4-fold. In addition, SAPS II and an age above 50 years proved to be significant predictors of mortality in a multivariate analysis. Sex was not associated with mortality, and ISS and the maximum SOFA score were significant predictors in univariate analyses only. Conclusion:? Reduced long-term survival was observed up to 3.5 years after acute injury. The 30-day mortality was strongly related to severe head injury, SAPS II and an age above 50 years. These variables may be useful as predictors of mortality, and may contribute to risk adjustment of this subset of trauma patients when treatment results from different centres are compared.

AB  - Abstract The Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-C) was developed to respond to the need of Chinese-speaking individuals. The DTS is a validated self-rating scale used in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The DTS-C is translated from DTS through a two-stage translation. Subjects were drawn from a sample of 210 survivors of the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi Earthquake. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.97) and test?retest reliability (r = 0.88). Concurrent validity was obtained against the clinical diagnostic interview, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 at DTS-C score of 44. It showed that the sensitivity was 0.9, specificity 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 4.74, and negative likelihood ratio 0.12. The recommended stratum-specific likelihood ratios were 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05?0.20) for the score range 0?39, 4 (2.22?7.23) for the score range of 40?59, and 6.14 (3.42?11.02) for the scores above 60. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, the factor structures closely resembled the DSM-IV grouping of PTSD symptoms. The psychometric strength of DTS-C is reliable for its future use, particularly for screening for subjects with possible diagnosis of PTSD.

AB  - Background: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is suggested to reflect the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and the main objective of the present study was to determine whether ScvO2 is associated with outcome in haemodynamically stabilized trauma patients. Methods: Haemodynamically unstable trauma patients receiving a central venous line within 1?h of admission were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate and ScvO2 were recorded at inclusion and every 6?h for 36?h or until lactate was <2.0?mmol/l and ScvO2 was >75% in two consecutive measurements. Patients with a MAP of ≥70?mmHg were considered to be haemodynamically stabilized. The outcome measure was complications defined as infections, delta sequential organ failure assessment score of >0, and mortality. Results: Fifty patients with a median new injury severity score of 27 (17?34) were analysed. Complications occurred in 33 patients. An association between ScvO2 following resuscitation to MAP ≥70?mmHg and complications was detected with an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% confidence interval; 0.89?0.99). This association was also significant when adjusted for injury severity. The result implies that a low ScvO2 value is associated with more complications. The optimal cut-off for ScvO2 to discriminate between patients who did or did not develop complications was found to be 66.5% (56?86%). Conclusions: These data suggest that low ScvO2 in haemodynamically stabilized patients is associated with a poor outcome and that ScvO2 represents a potential endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Data about the predictive value of quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is lacking. This study aimed to determine if specific apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds could be determined that correlate with outcome in moderate-severe TBI. METHODS This retrospective observational study investigated patients with moderate-severe TBI. MRIs obtained post-injury days 1-13 were analyzed. MRIs were obtained on a 1.5T scanner; 20-23 contiguous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sections with a spin-echo echo planar imaging DWI 256?256 reconstructed matrix; field of view 24?24 cm; slice thickness/gap of 5/1.5 or 5/2.5 mm. The ADC value of each brain tissue voxel was determined. The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated and correlated with outcome. A good outcome was defined as discharge to home or a rehabilitation facility. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were analyzed. Thirty-five patients (46%) had a good outcome. The timing of MRI scans did not differ between groups, but the mean age did (42±18 years vs. 56±19 years, p<.01, good vs. poor outcome). Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher percentage of brain volume with ADC < 400?10-6 mm2/second (.85±.67% vs. .60±.29%, poor vs. good outcome, p<.05). Using a ROC curve analysis and Youden's index, an ADC <400?10-6 mm2/second in ≥.49% of brain was 85% sensitive and 46% specific for poor outcome (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative MRI offers additional prognostic information in acute TBI. A whole brain tissue ADC threshold of <400?10-6 mm2/second in ≥.49% of brain may be a novel prognostic biomarker.
