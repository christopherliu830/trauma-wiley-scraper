AB  - Abstract:? Background:?Although there are two major scoring systems for the clinical diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the validity of these systems for leukemia-associated DIC remains to be confirmed. Methods:?By analyzing 125 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, we investigated clinical and laboratory features of leukemia-associated DIC, and determined the validity of the two established criteria. Results:?A total of 36 patients (29%) were diagnosed with DIC according to expert opinion, a method regarded as the de facto gold standard. Leukemia-associated DIC is characterized by rare manifestation of organ failure because of thrombosis and no relevance of the platelet count for the diagnosis. The results of receiver operating characteristics analysis favored fibrin degradation product (FDP) rather than D-dimer as the fibrin-related marker test. Although prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, and serum FDP levels were significantly different for patients with and without DIC, multivariate analysis identified FDP levels to be the only factor associated with DIC diagnosis. The cut-off level of 15??g/mL for FDP was found to be the most effective to differentiate DIC from non-DIC, resulting in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. The diagnostic results for our patients produced with this FDP-based system were at least comparable with or superior to those obtained with the two currently available scoring systems. Conclusions:?Our findings suggest that an FDP-based criterion may be applicable for the diagnosis of leukemia-associated DIC. Although it appears to be simple and practicable enough for clinical use, prospective validation of this criterion is needed.

AB  - Objectives This study set out to identify significant lesion features of chronic total occlusion (CTO) that predict successful retrograde recanalization via epicardial collateral channels (CCs). Background Epicardial CCs remain essential in retrograde percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of CTO. However, the unpredictability of success and occurrence of complications limit the application of epicardial CCs for retrograde PCI technique for CTO. Methods 103 retro-recanalization cases were analyzed using epicardial CCs with successful recanalization as an end point. Clinical and angiography data were collected. Results The total success rate was 76.3%. Independent predictors associated with technical success included CCs tortuosity, side branch at CCs tortuosity, inadequate CCs Size and inadequate CCs exit location. Assigning a score of one for each variable, four levels of difficulty were obtained and formed the EPI-CTO score (Epicardial CTO). This score had significant predictive value for the likelihood of successful recanalization (AUC: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.89-0.98). Coronary and CCs perforation occurred in 6 and 10 cases respectively. Four cases including two coronary and two CCs perforations had tamponade that needed pericardiocentesis. Conclusions Using epicardial CCs for retrograde approach of CTO PCI is effective. Complication rate was acceptable. We found four independent predictors relative to procedure success.

AB  - Abstract Two-phase mental health screening methods, in which an abridged mental health measure is used to establish who should receive a more comprehensive assessment, may be more efficient and acceptable to respondents than a stand-alone complete questionnaire. Such two-phase methods are in use in US armed forces post-deployment mental health screening. This study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of abridged instruments (used in the first phase) compared to the full instruments (the second phase), and whether false negative cases resulting from the use of abridged tests were detected by another test, among a UK military screening sample. Data from a group of UK Armed Forces personnel (n?=?1464) who had completed full questionnaires assessing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD Checklist ? Civilian Version, PCL-C) and alcohol misuse (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, AUDIT) were used. An abridged version of the PCL-C performed well in discriminating potential PTSD cases (as measured by the full instrument); AUDIT showed less discriminatory power, particularly due to poor specificity. Many cases missed by one abridged test would have been detected by an alternative test. Thus two-phase screening designs reduce the resource burden of a project without substantial loss of sensitivity for PTSD, but are less effective in discriminating potential cases of alcohol misuse.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To provide contemporary Australian data on the public's training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and awareness of hands-only CPR. Methods A cross-sectional telephone survey in April 2016 of adult residents of the Australian state of Victoria was conducted. Primary outcomes were rates of CPR training and awareness of hands-only CPR. Results Of the 404 adults surveyed (mean age 55 ± 17 years, 59% female, 73% metropolitan residents), 274 (68%) had undergone CPR training. Only 50% (n = 201) had heard of hands-only CPR, with most citing first-aid courses (41%) and media (36%) as sources of information. Of those who had undergone training, the majority had received training more than 5 years previously (52%) and only 28% had received training or refreshed training in the past 12 months. Most received training in a formal first-aid class (43%), and received training as a requirement for work (67%). The most common reasons for not having training were: they had never thought about it (59%), did not have time (25%) and did not know where to learn (15%). Compared to standard CPR, a greater proportion of respondents were willing to provide hands-only CPR for strangers (67% vs 86%, P < 0.001). Conclusion From an Australian perspective, there is still room for improvement in CPR training rates and awareness of hands-only CPR. Further promotion of hands-only CPR and self-instruction (e.g. DVD kits or online) may see further improvements in CPR training and bystander CPR rates.

AB  - Background To date there are no biomarkers with proven reliability as a measure of disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of our study is to assess the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a measure of disease activity and progression in ALS. Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ALS, 25 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and 21 with other neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated. CSF NFL levels were assayed by two-site solid-phase sandwich ELISA. In patients with ALS, neurological status was assessed by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) and the Medical Research Council scale, and the progression of the disease was evaluated using the ?diagnostic delay? and the ?progression rate?. Results Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were higher in ALS cases than in controls (P < 0.0001). Using receiver operating curve analysis, an optimal NFL cut-off of 1981 ng/l discriminated between patients with ALS and neurological controls, with a sensitivity of 78.4% and specificity of 72.5%. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed the association between CSF NFL levels and the presence of ALS (age and sex adjusted odds ratio for ALS 8.9; 95% CI 3.1?25.8; P < 0.0001). In ALS, CSF NFL negatively correlated with the diagnostic delay (P < 0.0001) and the ALSFRS-r (P = 0.014) and positively with the progression rate (P < 0.0001). Conclusions High CSF NFL levels were found in patients with ALS, reflecting the burden of neurodegeneration. The significant relation between CSF NFL levels and disease progression suggests that NFL may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in ALS.

AB  - Objective: To assess the usefulness of computed tomography arthrography of the stifle in diagnosing meniscal tears in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Dogs were included if they had evidence of cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency or persistent or recurrent lameness following surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. Dogs were sedated for a computed tomography scan of the affected stifle, orientated in the dorsal plane. A survey computed tomography scan was followed by a computed tomography arthrogram. A stifle arthrotomy was performed, and the surgical findings were recorded. The computed tomography scans were reviewed by three blinded reviewers, and the results were compared to the surgical findings. Results: Twenty-one computed tomography arthrograms from 20 dogs were included. At surgery, damage to the medial meniscus was identified in 14 stifles. Initial interpretation of computed tomography arthrography images was 57 to 64 per cent sensitive and 71 to 100 per cent specific for diagnosing medial meniscal injuries. Interpretation of the images on retrospective analysis was 71 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, with an accuracy of 0·857. Clinical Significance: The accuracy of stifle computed tomography arthrography for the diagnosis of tears to the medial meniscus was found to be good. It is a minimally invasive and repeatable technique, which does not require general anaesthesia or specialist training to obtain the images. The ability to reliably diagnose meniscal injury without the need for surgery may be advantageous, particularly in dogs which had previously had surgery for cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.
