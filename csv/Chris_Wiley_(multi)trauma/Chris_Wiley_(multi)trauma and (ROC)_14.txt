AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium. (VUB/14-272-2).

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypoglycin A (HG) appears to cause atypical myopathy (AM), but to our knowledge, detection of HG in affected and unaffected horses and concurrently in plants that they were exposed to has not previously been reported. Objectives To investigate HG in samples from horses exposed to Acer pseudoplatanus (European sycamore maple) and in such plant material, at the time of clinical cases of AM in the herd. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Blood was collected from 2 horses with AM and 22 clinically healthy co-grazing horses in 2 Swedish farms within one week of onset of signs (May 2014) and one month later, after horses were moved to other pastures. Ten healthy control horses from unaffected farms were sampled once. Samaras, seedlings, flowers and leaves from Acer pseudoplatanus and from Acer platanoides L (Norway maple) were collected from affected pastures. Hypoglycin A was analysed using chemical derivatisation with dansyl chloride (DNS) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Hypoglycin A was detected as derivatised compound HG-DNS [M+H]+ with selected reaction monitoring. Results Hypoglycin A was detected in the horses affected with AM, and also in 20 out of 22 co-grazing horses. One month later, a surviving case horse and 9/20 co-grazing horses were still positive for HG. Controls from other farms were negative for HG. Hypoglycin A was detected in plant material from Acer pseudoplatanus, but not from Acer platanoides L. Conclusions Horses grazing in pastures with HG-containing Acer pseudoplatanus were positive for HG in blood, and some showed severe signs of myopathy. Ethical animal research:?Ethical consent for blood sampling was granted (C113/11) and horse owners gave their informed consent to inclusion of horses in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The morphology of the dorsal (DCB) and ventral (VCB) nasal conchal bullae, including their cellulae, drainage and histology, are poorly described. The recent recognition that these bullae can become infected, causing chronic unilateral nasal discharge has stimulated interest in these structures. A more complete understanding of their anatomy would be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of their disorders. Objectives To document the structure, drainage and histology of the equine DCB and VCB. Study design Descriptive. Methods Fourteen fresh cadaveric horse heads, were transected sagittally midline and dissected to expose the nasal conchal bullae. The dimensions of each bulla, the number of drainage apertures, the number of cellulae and orientation of the septae were recorded. Representative samples were collected for histopathology. Results The mean lengths of the DCB and VCB were 77.7?mm (range 48?105?mm) and 57.1?mm (range 34?86?mm) respectively; equivalent to 13.8% and 10.2% of skull length, respectively. The mean widths of the DCB and VCB were 28.5?mm (range 21?35?mm) and 28.2?mm (range 13?41?mm) respectively; equivalent to 5.1% and 5% of skull length respectively. The median number of drainage apertures from the DCB and VCB were 2 and 1 respectively. The median number of cellulae within the DCB and VCB were 3 and 2, respectively. No communications were identified between the DCB and VCB and the adjacent paranasal sinuses. Histology revealed that the bullae consisted of ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium supported by a glandular submucosa often overlying turbinate bone and, variably, hyaline cartilage. Conclusions The morphology of the equine nasal conchal bullae is quite variable. The DCB is generally a more complex structure than the VCB, containing more septae, cellulae and drainage apertures. This more detailed description of DCB and VCB anatomy will hopefully facilitate successful treatment of their disorders.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Training and rehabilitation techniques which improve core muscle strength are beneficial for improvement of dynamic stability of the equine vertebral column. The Equiband? system, consisting of resistance bands attached to a customised saddle pad, is suggested to provide constant proprioceptive feedback during motion to encourage recruitment of abdominal and hindquarter musculature. Objectives To quantify the effect of the Equiband? system on back kinematics and movement symmetry. Study design Longitudinal intervention study. Methods Quantitative analysis of back movement and gait symmetry before/after a 4-week exercise programme. Inertial sensor data was collected from 7 horses at Weeks 0 and 4 of a fixed exercise protocol. Analysis with and without the Equiband? system was completed at trot in hand on a hard surface, and for both reins on the lunge on a soft surface. Six back kinematic and 3 movement symmetry parameters were calculated according to published methods. Movement symmetry values were side-corrected to allow comparison between reins on the lunge. A mixed model (P<0.05) evaluated the effects of the Equiband? system over time, and trotting direction on back kinematic and movement symmetry parameters. Results The Equiband? system significantly reduced (all P<0.02) roll, pitch and mediolateral displacement in the cranial-mid thoracic region. Across all horses, back displacement and range of motion values were significantly greater (P<0.01) on the lunge than in a straight line, movement symmetry was consistent with having corrected all horses to be left-sided. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest the Equiband? system may aid dynamic stabilisation of the vertebral column.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horses run on curves during training and competition, and are often trotted in circles to assist lameness diagnosis. The effects of moving on a curve on tendon strain in the distal limb are not known. Objectives To investigate the effect of curve running on the tendons and ligaments of the equine distal limb. Study design Controlled experimental study. Methods Cadaver forelimbs from 6 Thoroughbred horses were loaded on a forceplate using a hydraulic ram. Limbs were loaded to 17?33?N/kg on a flat surface and with medial and lateral wooden wedges under the hoof to simulate curve running with the limb being on the inside and outside of a curve, respectively. Tendon length was measured for the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons (SDFT and DDFT), accessory ligament of the DDFT (ALDDFT), the suspensory ligament body (SL) and the medial and lateral suspensory ligament branches (SBM and SBL) using motion capture. A mixed effects model was used for data analysis. Results Under most loading conditions SL was under most strain and DDFT least. For a medial 15° wedge SDFT was under 0.4% greater load than SL (P?=?0.04). SBM was under 0.48% greater strain than SBL with a lateral 20° wedge (P?=?0.01), and SBL was under 1.37% greater strain than SBM with a medial 20° wedge (P<0.01). Conclusions Curve running leads to increasing and asymmetrical strain on the suspensory ligament branches. This difference is unlikely to be sufficient to cause injury, but may assist lameness diagnosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diffusion of local anaesthetic solution after a mid-pastern ring block has not been investigated. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following injection of radiodense contrast medium as performed for a mid-pastern ring block. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. One and a half ml radiodense contrast medium was injected over the medial or lateral palmar digital nerve at the level of the proximal aspect of the ungular cartilages. A dorsal ring block was performed on the ipsilateral side, 1.5?cm proximal to the palpable palmar aspect of the proximal eminence of the middle phalanx, using 2 or 5?ml contrast medium. Both forelimbs were injected on 2 days (48 injections). Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately, 10 and 20?min after injections. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After dorsal injections the contrast medium was distributed in a diffuse patch over the ipsilateral half of the proximal phalanx (PP), extending proximally over the half of the length of PP in all limbs (greatest proximal extension: 89.0% of the length of PP [from distal] after 2?ml, 94.2% after 5?ml). There was significant proximal diffusion in the first 10?min after injection and significant dorsal diffusion between all time points (P<0.01). There was significant positive association between injected volume and the proximal extension of the dorsal contrast patch (P?=?0.01). The median dorsal diffusion was to the dorsal midline of PP; 5?ml contrast medium resulted in significantly greater dorsal diffusion than 2?ml (P<0.01). The dorsal and the palmar contrast patches did not merge. Conclusions Diffusion to the proximal aspect of P1 occurred even after injection of only 2?ml contrast medium. Fetlock region pain may be influenced by a mid-pastern ring block. Ethical animal research:?Written consent had been obtained from a representative of the horses' owner prior to starting the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The measurement of immunoglobulins is important in foals, as individuals with evidence of failure of passive transfer are at increased risk of infection and death during the first month of life. Objectives To identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal's IgG concentration as applied in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalised foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. Study design Prospective study including 46 foals <7 days old, divided into 4 groups based on age and health status. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated manually. Significance was set at P<0.05. Methods Several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: serum and plasma total protein, albumin and protein spectrum including gamma globulin concentration (GGC) measured by chemistry analyser, total protein by refractometer, glutaraldehyde coagulation test and a semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay (SNAP). IBM SPSS Statistics 20A was used. A one-way ANOVA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining significant differences among tests and between groups. Correlations between the turbidimetric immunoassay and the screening tests were calculated using linear regression with a 95% CI. Results Group differences were not found. The most accurate alternative test was the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyser (R 0.83) and GGC (R 0.84) with sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 100% and 95 and 93% respectively. A total serum protein of ≥49?g/l and a GGC of ≥6?g/l corresponded with an IgG concentration of ≥8?g/l. Conclusions According to this study, the most reliable alternative test suitable in a clinical setting for the determination of IgG concentration was measuring total serum protein by a chemistry analyser in combination with serum GGC.

AB  - Reasons for performing study When managing strangles in horses, it is crucial to detect chronic infection with Streptococcus equi (SE), i.e. silent carriers. Objectives Evaluate diagnostics for SE carriers over time in a farm. Study design Longitudinal observational study. Methods Sixty-three Icelandic horses isolated on an island were studied 4 to 26 months after remission of acute strangles, including repeated clinical examination and collection of blood, nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL), and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples. Twenty-two horses were treated with penicillin locally and systemically. Serology for S.?equi was examined by iELISA [1]. Nasopharyngeal lavage and GPL samples were investigated for S.?equi and S.?zooepidemicus by real-time PCR [2]. Results Thirty-three per cent were SE carriers after 15 months, despite repeated penicillin treatment. In 16/18 carriers, GPL samples were PCR-positive, but not NPL samples, whereas the opposite was true in 2 horses. Several carriers with persistent aerocystitis were not detected by 3 consecutive NPL samples. Five of 18 carriers were seronegative (27.8%) at 15 months. Following conservative treatment, 7 of these 18 carriers were still carriers at 20 months, 8 were negative, and 3 were lost for sampling. Only GPL samples were positive at this point, and only 1/7 carriers were seropositive. Conclusions To detect chronic carriers of strangles, RT-PCR analysis from both GPL and NPL samples may be necessary. Serological screening at individual level often misses individual carriers in long-term cases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary treatment for their working equids in Morocco. There is no information available regarding cultural, religious or educational barriers to obtaining treatment or about the typical workload of these animals which may predispose them to colic. Objectives To characterise the typical workload and feeding regimens of working equids in Morocco; to characterise the ability of owners to recognise the clinical signs and causes of colic; and to identify specific barriers to the veterinary treatment of colic. Study design Questionnaire-based survey. Methods A standardised, structured questionnaire was administered, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, to the owners of working equids presenting their animals to 2 centres run by SPANA (The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad). Participation was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Results All of the 102 participants that completed questionnaire were male. Ninety-eight owners used their animals for pulling carts, with 12% of animals working 7 days per week. 14% of animals were offered water by their owner once per day and 2% every other day. 25% of animals were loose and allowed free to feed unsupervised when not working. 29% of owners were not able to name any cause of colic and 25% did not recognise any clinical signs; only 12% associated colic with gastrointestinal pain. 83% of owners would not seek veterinary treatment due to financial constraints if free treatment at SPANA centres were not available. Conclusions Colic remains a common problem amongst working equids in Morocco. Improved knowledge of management factors associated with colic and how to recognise abdominal pain may reduce the incidence of colic and improve prognosis. The findings presented can be used to inform and develop owner education programmes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee. Owner informed consent was obtained before sampling. Sources of funding:?The Equine Grass Sickness Fund and The University of Reading. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Rasping of sharp enamel points (SEPs) is the most common procedure performed at routine dental examinations; however, there is little evidence to prove the true clinical significance of SEPs [1]. Maxillary SEPs are thought to cause buccal ulceration and pain on external palpation of the cheeks. Mandibular SEPs are thought to cause lingual ulceration. Objectives To examine associations between the presence of SEPs on the cheek teeth rows and the presence of pain on palpation of the cheeks and buccal and/or lingual ulceration. Study design Retrospective clinical case series. Methods Clinical records of routine dental examination performed by 8 veterinary surgeons in a single first opinion practice were examined. Presence of SEPs, buccal and/or lingual ulceration and pain on palpation of the cheeks (externally) were recorded. Chi squared tests were used to examine whether horses exhibiting pain on palpation or oral ulceration were significantly more likely to have SEPs present. Results Prevalence of buccal SEPs was 84.8% and prevalence of lingual SEPs was 84.3%. Five hundred and forty-eight horses (6.0%) had signs of pain on palpation. Prevalence of buccal ulceration was 5.9%. In contrast, only 0.2% of horses had visible lingual ulceration. Buccal ulceration and pain on palpation were significantly associated with presence of buccal SEPs (P<0.001 for both). Lingual ulceration was not significantly associated with lingual SEPs (P<0.0001). Conclusions Buccal SEPs are common and often result in pain and buccal ulceration. Routine rasping would appear to be justified. Lingual SEPs are common but rarely cause lingual ulceration. The value of routine rasping of lingual SEPs is therefore questionable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lameness negatively affects the welfare of horses; it often coexists with thoracolumbar pain. The mechanisms linking the two are not well understood. Objectives To document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on left and right reins; to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fourteen non-lame horses were trotted in straight lines and lunged on a 10?m diameter circle on left and right reins and inertial sensor data collected at landmarks: withers, 13th (T13) and 18th thoracic vertebrae, 3rd lumbar vertebra, tubera sacrale, left and right tubera coxae. Data were processed using published methods [1]; pitch and roll, dorsoventral and lateral motion and symmetry within each stride were assessed. Results Dorsoventral motion during one stride had a sinusoidal pattern with 2 oscillations. The greatest amplitude and symmetry (119?±?4?mm, 96?±?1% in straight lines vs. 127?±?5?mm, 94?±?1% in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater rotation around the transverse axis (>1.3°, P?=?0.002) and movement in a lateral direction (>16?mm P?=?0.002), greater dorsoventral amplitude and asymmetry; however, the latter differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between reins. The difference in the left and right hindlimb stance phases and the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar were significantly associated. Greater circle-induced upward movement of a tuber coxae during the contralateral hindlimb stance was associated with greater circle-induced asymmetry of the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar (P?=?0.04). Conclusions Moving on a circle induces measurable changes in thoracolumbar movement compared with moving in straight lines, associated with alterations in the hindlimb gait.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is common in equids, with a high risk of re-injury associated with changes in tendon stiffness. In vivo measurement of limb stiffness has been shown to correlate with tendon stiffness after injury [1] but requires kinematic analysis which is impractical in a clinical setting. We have developed a simple system for measuring limb stiffness statically, which could be used as a tool for monitoring SDFT healing. Objectives To validate a goniometric measurement of limb stiffness. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Initially, forelimb stiffness indices were determined at the walk for 6 equids using a validated kinematic analysis [1]. Limb stiffness indices were then calculated using portable floor scales to record ground reaction force (GRF), and an electrogoniometer to record metacarpophalangeal joint angle. Goniometric limb stiffness indices were subsequently measured in 11 horses ranging from 2 to 20 years of age, with no clinical evidence of SDFT injury. Strength and significance of correlation and agreement between the measurement methods was assessed and association between limb stiffness, limb (left vs. right), weight and age of horse and were calculated. Results There were strong positive correlations between GRF and joint angle (R2?=?0.98) and between the static and kinematic methods (R?=?0.78, P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between limb stiffness and weight (R2?=?0.85, P<0.01), but no association with age or limb. Conclusions This study validated the measurement of limb stiffness in a clinical setting. The positive correlation of limb stiffness and weight supports the theory of an optimised limb spring [2] for energy-efficient cursorial locomotion which may, in turn, provide a clinically-relevant measure of running efficiency and therefore the quality of tendon healing post injury.
