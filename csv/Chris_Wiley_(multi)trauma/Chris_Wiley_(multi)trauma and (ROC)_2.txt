AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the combination of conformation characteristics of the pelvic limbs of Labrador Retrievers that best discriminates between limb at risk to develop cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) disease and limbs at low risk using radiographs, computerized tomography (CT) images, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Study Design: Cross-sectional clinical study. Animals: Twelve clinically normal and 9 unilaterally CCL-deficient Labrador Retrievers. Methods: The pelvic limbs of normal dogs were considered as non-predisposed to CCL disease and the contralateral limbs of CCL-deficient dogs as predisposed. Conformation variables, obtained from femur and tibial radiographs, pelvic limb CT images and DEXA studies, of predisposed pelvic limbs were compared with the conformation variables from pelvic limbs of the low-risk group. An ROC curve analysis was used to assess the discriminating properties of conformation variables for several combinations. Results: We determined that a combination of tibial plateau angle (TPA) and femoral anteversion angle (FAA) measured on radiographs was optimal for discriminating predisposed and non-predisposed limbs for CCL disease in Labrador Retrievers. Conclusions: Assessing predisposition to CCL disease with a combination of conformational measurements is better than using univariate parameters. In the future, TPA and FAA may be used to screen dogs suspected of being susceptible to CCL disease.

AB  - Abstract Background Liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess pathological features (eg inflammation grades) for hepatitis B virus-infected patients although it is invasive and traumatic; meanwhile, several gene profiles of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have been separately described in relatively small hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected samples. We aimed to analyse correlations among inflammation grades, gene expressions and clinical parameters (serum alanine amino transaminase, aspartate amino transaminase and HBV-DNA) in large-scale CHB samples and to predict inflammation grades by using clinical parameters and/or gene expressions. Methods We analysed gene expressions with three clinical parameters in 122 CHB samples by an improved regression model. Principal component analysis and machine-learning methods including Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour and support vector machine were used for analysis and further diagnosis models. Six normal samples were conducted to validate the predictive model. Results Significant genes related to clinical parameters were found enriching in the immune system, interferon-stimulated, regulation of cytokine production, anti-apoptosis, and etc. A panel of these genes with clinical parameters can effectively predict binary classifications of inflammation grade (area under the ROC curve [AUC]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.93), validated by normal samples. A panel with only clinical parameters was also valuable (AUC: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86), indicating that liquid biopsy method for detecting the pathology of CHB is possible. Conclusions This is the first study to systematically elucidate the relationships among gene expressions, clinical parameters and pathological inflammation grades in CHB, and to build models predicting inflammation grades by gene expressions and/or clinical parameters as well.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Background Subdural hygromas are often found bilaterally in spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). They frequently progress to chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs), and if the hematomas are formed, it is difficult to consider SIH as an underlying cause. Whether SIH is underlying or not among the patients presenting bilateral subdural fluid collections (hygromas or CSDHs) is clinically important because the treatment strategy should be different between them. Objectives We designed a retrospective case-control study to figure out differential clinical features of the patients presenting bilateral symptomatic subdural fluid collections owing to SIH. Methods Sixty-two patients with bilateral symptomatic subdural fluid collections were enrolled, and their data on general demographics, clinical courses, radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes were collected. The patients were divided into ?SIH? and ?Non-SIH? groups, and a simple logistic regression analysis was performed to clarify the differences between the groups. The consequent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were performed with the significant predictors. Results Eight patients (13%) were diagnosed with SIH. Young age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.831, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.743-0.929, P = .0012), no underlying disease (OR = 0.062, 95% CI: 0.007-0.544, P = .0121), radiological features of brain sagging (OR = 10.36, 95% CI: 0.912-93.411, P = .0017), pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR = 15.6, 95% CI: 2.088-116.52, P = .0074), and small amount of fluid collections (OR = 0.719, 95% CI: 0.579-0.893, P = .0029) were significantly associated with SIH group. ROC curve analyses were performed in parameters of age and amount of fluid collection and the cut-off values for each parameter were ≤55 years old and ≤22.08 mm, respectively. Patients diagnosed with SIH underwent epidural blood patches and showed good results, except 1 patient who underwent burr-hole trephinations. Conclusion Bilateral subdural fluid collections due to underlying SIH is associated with young age (≤55 years old), no underlying diseases, smaller amount of fluid collections (≤22.08 mm of depth), and radiological findings of brain sagging or pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhages.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine perceptibility and acceptability thresholds for color differences in light and dark skin-colored maxillofacial elastomers. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 pairs of light specimens (mimicking white, Asian, and Hispanic skin) and 15 pairs of dark specimens (mimicking African-American skin) were made using skin-colored maxillofacial silicone elastomers, combined with opacifiers and pigments. Color match/mismatch and acceptable/unacceptable mismatch of each pair of specimens were visually evaluated by 45 evaluators under controlled conditions of a viewing booth. Color differences were calculated using CIELAB and CIEDE2000 formulae. After calculating the model parameters, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were analyzed. Repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test were used in a statistical analysis (α= 0.05) Results: CIELAB/CIEDE2000 perceptibility and acceptability thresholds for light specimens were 1.1/0.7 and 3.0/2.1, respectively. Corresponding values for dark specimens were 1.6/1.2 and 4.4/3.1, respectively. Differences in primary specimen color and type of threshold were found to be significant (p < 0.001). Only the primary specimen color effect was found to be significant in AUC comparisons. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, both main effects of threshold type (perceptibility and acceptability) and primary color (light and dark) on 50:50% color-difference thresholds of colored maxillofacial elastomers were found significant for both color-difference formulae used (CIELAB, CIEDE2000). In addition, significant interaction between the two main effects was found, indicating a stronger effect of skin type on acceptability than perceptibility thresholds. Primary specimen color (light vs. dark) was found to be the only significant main effect on the AUC of ROC curves constructed from logistic regression.

Prognostic models for mortality and disease recurrence were developed with multivariate binary logistic regression. Results The proposed prognostic model for tumor recurrence risk after surgery in percentage (AUROC?=?0.774, 95%CI?=?0.611?0.937) is: Risk in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??4.360?+?(0.015???tumor diameter in cm)?+?(0.010???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(1.077???distant metastases, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0)?+?(?0.026???Ki-67-positive cells in %)?+?(?1.086???upper abdominal pain, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0). The proposed prognostic model for observed 3-year survival probability after surgery in % (AUROC?=?0.932, 95%CI?=?0.857?0.999) is: Survival probability in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??12.492?+?(0.054???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(0.112???minimal distance of the resection margin from the tumor in mm)?+?(?1.574???number of positive lymph nodes)?+?(2.292???histological tumor infiltration, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0) Conclusions The platelet count was identified as a relevant risk factor.

AB  - Five cases of oral malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in patients who had previously received radiotherapy in the head or neck region were included in this study. There were 3 men and 2 women. Four patients had been irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the other for a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) involving the tongue and mouth floor. The MFH developed 2.5?11 years after the initial radiotherapy. Two cases of MFH occurred in the maxilla, two in the mandible, and the remaining one in the tongue, floor of mouth and mandible. Clinically, the oral post-radiation MFH presented as tender, reddish, elastic, lobulated masses with surface ulceration. Radiographic examination of the involved jaws revealed a poorly defined radiolucent lesion without any periosteal or endosteal reaction. The prognosis of these tumors was very poor. Although aggressive multimodality treatment had been applied, 3 of 5 patients eventually died of the disease, with a mean survival time of 17 months after establishing the diagnosis of MFH. In order to ensure the early diagnosis and treatment of this radiation-induced second malignancy, close oral follow-up is mandatory for patients who have received radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies.

AB  - Background Race and ethnicity data are often absent from administrative and health insurance databases. Indirect estimation methods to assign probability scores for race and ethnicity to insurance records may help identify occupational health inequities. Methods We compared race and ethnicity estimates from the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) formula to self-reported race and ethnicity from 1132 workers. Results The accuracy of the BISG using gender stratified regression models adjusted for worker age and industry were excellent for White and Latino males and Latino females, good for Black and Asian Pacific Islander males and White and Asian Pacific Islander females. American Indian/Alaskan Native and those who indicated they were ?Other? or ?More than one race? were poorly identified. Conclusion The BISG estimation method was accurate for White, Black, Latino, and Asian Pacific Islanders in a sample of workers. Using the BISG in administrative datasets will expand research into occupational health disparities.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine if differences exist between paediatric intensive care nurses and allied health professionals in empathy, secondary trauma, burnout, pain exposure and pain ratings of self and others. Early and late career differences were also examined. Background Nurses are routinely exposed to patient pain expression. This work context may make them vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as desensitization to patient pain or a compromise in personal well-being. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Data were collected from a convenience sample of paediatric intensive care nurses (n = 27) and allied health professionals (n = 24), from September 2014?June 2015, at a Canadian health centre. Both groups completed one demographic and three behavioural scales. Participants underwent fMRI while rating the pain of infant and adult patients in a series of video clips. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric methods. fMRI results are reported in a second paper. Results Nurses were significantly more likely to be exposed to pain at work than allied health professionals and scored significantly higher on dimensions of empathy, secondary trauma and burnout. Nurses scored their own pain and the pain of infant and adult patients, higher than allied health participants. Less experienced nurses had higher secondary trauma and burnout scores than more experienced nurses. Conclusions Paediatric intensive care work demands, such as patient pain exposure, may be associated with nurse's higher report of empathy and pain in self and others, but also with higher levels of secondary trauma and burnout, when compared with allied health professionals.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare cardiac risk stratification using a 0 and 2?h point-of-care (POC) cardiac troponin (cTn), 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers against the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn reference standard. Methods A prospective observational study of ED patients presenting with chest pain was performed. Patients were risk stratified and treated as per the Heart Foundation of Australia/Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (HF-A/CS-ANZ) guidelines using the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn (T6). Patients were further stratified using a 0 and 2?h POC cTn (T2) plus 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers (cTn, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin) (M2). The T6, T2 and M2 strategies were compared using the 30-day major adverse cardiac events as the primary outcome. Results Seven hundred and four patients (median age 54 years, male 62.1%) were enrolled. Using the T6 reference standard, 2%, 61% and 37% were stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The 30-day event rates were 0%, 3.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The T2 strategy stratified 1.5%, 57% and 41% as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 4.2% and 24.8%, respectively. The M2 strategy resulted in significantly different risk distribution with 1%, 40% and 59% stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 3.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Conclusion Using a 2?h POC cTn-only biomarker strategy with the HF-A/CS-ANZ guidelines accurately identified a population at intermediate risk of 30-day events in whom further objective testing might be accelerated, allowing subsequent early discharge of the majority of this cohort. Within 2?h of presentation a high risk population could be identified in whom early management, including admission, was required.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Clinically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used in treatment of many diseases, but the local oxidative stress (OS) of lesion severely limits the survival of BMSCs, which reduces the efficacy of BMSCs transplantation. Therefore, enhancing the anti-OS stress ability of BMSCs is a key breakthrough point. Preconditioning is a common protective mechanism for cells or body. Here, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OS preconditioning on the anti-OS ability of BMSCs and its mechanism. Fortunately, OS preconditioning can increase the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, NQO1, and heme oxygenase 1 through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway, thereby decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, relieved the damage of ROS to mitochondria, DNA and cell membrane, enhanced the anti-OS ability of BMSCs, and promoted the survival of BMSCs under OS.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the postoperative analgesic effects of intravenous (IV) lidocaine, meloxicam, and their combination in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Animals Twenty-seven dogs aged (mean ± SD) 16.1 ± 7.5 months and weighing 22.4 ± 17.9 kg scheduled for ovariohysterectomy. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Dogs (n = 9 in each group) were allocated to receive just prior to and during surgery one of the following regimens: M group, 0.2 mg kg?1 IV meloxicam then a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of lactated Ringer's at 10 mL kg?1 hour?1; L group, a bolus of lidocaine (1 mg kg?1 IV) then a CRI of lidocaine at 0.025 mg kg?1 minute?1; and M + L group, both the above meloxicam and lidocaine treatments. Pain and sedation were scored, and venous samples taken for serum cortisol and glucose measurement before and at intervals for 12 hours after anaesthesia. Pain scores were assessed using a multi-parameter subjective scoring scale (cumulative scale 0?21) by three observers. The protocol stated that dogs with a total score exceeding 9 or a sub-score above 3 in any one category would receive rescue analgesia. Sedation was scored on a scale of 0?4. Results There were no significant differences in subjective pain scores, serum cortisol, and glucose concentrations between the three groups. The highest pain score at any time was 5, and no dog required rescue analgesia. None of the three regimens caused any observable side effects during or after anaesthesia. At 1 and 2 hours after extubation dogs in group L were significantly more sedated than in the other two groups. Conclusions and Clinical relevance This study suggests that, with the scoring system used, IV lidocaine and meloxicam provide similar and adequate post-operative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - Because of the inconsistent results of periodontal and prosthetic therapy, periodontists may choose to treat maxillary molar furcation involvements (FI) with poor root morphology utilizing a root resection technique (RRT). In addition, poor root morphology of the remaining root following RRT is usually considered a high risk factor for long-term periodontal and prosthetic success. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the differences in the clinical periodontal parameters between molar abutments with and without molar root separation and/or resection (RSR) before and after periodontal and prosthetic therapy, using a crown and sleevecoping telescopic denture (CSCTD). A total of 85 molars (47 maxillary and 38 mandibular) were treated in 25 subjects. There were 33 abutments without root separation/resection and 52 abutments with RSR. Forty-three CSCTD were placed, 23 in the maxillary arch and 20 in the mandibular arch. The mean observation period was 6.7 ±1.9 years (range, to 13 years). The plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and alveolar bone change were recorded. The differences in these parameters before and after periodontal and prosthetic therapy between the advanced furcationinvolved molars with and without RSR were evaluated. The results revealed a remarkable improvement in the periodontal parameters in advanced Class II and Class III FI in molars with RSR as compared to those without RSR. It was, therefore, concluded that molar abutments with RSR in conjunction with a specifically designed telescopic device provide a modified approach for treating molars with advanced Class II and III FI.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Identifying older emergency department (ED) patients with clinical features associated with adverse postdischarge outcomes may lead to improved clinical reasoning and better targeting for preventative interventions. Previous studies have used single-country samples to identify limited sets of determinants for a limited number of proxy outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify and compare geriatric syndromes that influence the probability of postdischarge outcomes among older ED patients from a multinational context. Methods A multinational prospective cohort study of ED patients aged 75 years or older was conducted. A total of 13 ED sites from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Iceland, India, and Sweden participated. Patients who were expected to die within 24 hours or did not speak the native language were excluded. Of the 2,475 patients approached for inclusion, 2,282 (92.2%) were enrolled. Patients were assessed at ED admission with the interRAI ED Contact Assessment, a geriatric ED assessment. Outcomes were examined for patients admitted to a hospital ward (62.9%, n = 1,436) or discharged to a community setting (34.0%, n = 775) after an ED visit. Overall, 3% of patients were lost to follow-up. Hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge to higher level of care was recorded for patients admitted to a hospital ward. Any ED or hospital use within 28 days of discharge was recorded for patients discharged to a community setting. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to describe determinants using standard and multilevel logistic regression. Results A multi-country model including living alone (OR = 1.78, p ≤ 0.01), informal caregiver distress (OR = 1.69, p = 0.02), deficits in ambulation (OR = 1.94, p ≤ 0.01), poor self-report (OR = 1.84, p ≤ 0.01), and traumatic injury (OR = 2.18, p ≤ 0.01) best described older patients at risk of longer hospital lengths of stay. A model including recent ED visits (OR = 2.10, p ≤ 0.01), baseline functional impairment (OR = 1.68, p ≤ 0.01), and anhedonia (OR = 1.73, p ≤ 0.01) best described older patients at risk of proximate repeat hospital use. A sufficiently accurate and generalizable model to describe the risk of discharge to higher levels of care among admitted patients was not achieved. Conclusions Despite markedly different health care systems, the probability of long hospital lengths of stay and repeat hospital use among older ED patients is detectable at the multinational level with moderate accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential utility of incorporating common geriatric clinical features in routine clinical examination and disposition planning for older patients in EDs.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess differences in the gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells between patients with early recurrent thrombosis vs. patients without recurrent events after withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (uDVT), to identify novel predictors of recurrence. Methods In the discovery population (N = 32), a microarray RNA assay followed by RT-PCR confirmation were performed. In the validation population (N = 44) a multiple RT-PCR-based strategy was applied to assess genes differentially expressed in the discovery population. Results The sex-adjusted Linear Model for Microarray Data analysis showed 102 genes differentially expressed (P < 0.01) in the discovery population. Nineteen of them underwent further confirmation in the validation population. The gene encoding for Acyl-CoA Synthetase Family Member 2 (ACSF2) was underexpressed in recurrent DVT patients in both, the discovery (P = 0.007) and validation populations (P = 0.004). In the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the areas under the curve of ACSF2 expression were 0.77 and 0.80, respectively. Conclusions For the first time an association between ACSF2 expression and the risk of recurrent DVT is suggested. Should this association be confirmed in larger prospective studies, ACSF2 could become useful for the selection of patients requiring extended anticoagulant therapy.
