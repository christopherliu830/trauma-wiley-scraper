AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slowly progressive joint disease. Joint distraction can be a treatment of choice in case of severe OA. Prediction of failure will facilitate implementation of joint distraction in clinical practice. Patients with severe ankle OA, who underwent joint distraction were included. Survival analysis was performed over 12 years (n?=?25 after 12 years). Regression analyses were used to predict failures and clinical benefit at 2 years after joint distraction (n?=?111). Survival analysis showed that 44% of the patients failed, 17% within 2 years and 37% within 5 years after joint distraction (n?=?48 after 5 years). Survival analysis in subgroups showed that the percentage failure was only different in women (30% after 2 years) versus men (after 11 years still no 30% failure). In the multivariate analyses female gender was predictive for failure 2 years after joint distraction. Gender and functional disability at baseline predicted more pain. Functional disability and pain at baseline were associated with more functional disability. Joint distraction shows a long-term clinical beneficial outcome. However, failure rate is considerable over the years. Female patients have a higher chance of failure during follow-up. Unfortunately, not all potential predictors could be investigated and other clinically significant predictors were not found. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The unprecedented expansion of US prisons during the final quarter of the twentieth century has produced many contradictions. Prisoners' families, stifled by sclerotic legal channels, are organizing to demand political remedies to the growing use of prisons as catch-all solutions for social problems. One such group, Mothers Reclaiming Our Children, developed in the midst of crisis-riven 1990s Los Angeles. The group has negotiated maternal, race, and class ideologies and practices ? effectively tearing down the veil between reproductive and productive labor ? in order to elaborate and pursue its political work. The project has not been easy: crisis is internally as well as externally central to the group's formation. In charting the group's development, the article examines, historically and ethnographically, the ways in which organizing is constrained by recognition. It concludes that non-reified recognition is produced when critical renovations of subjectivity, via collective assessments of structures, methods, and purpose, emerge as action in the discursive-material interstices of structure and agency.

AB  - Prospective evaluation of youths with early psychotic-like experiences can enrich our knowledge of clinical, biobehavioral and environmental risk and protective factors associated with the development of psychotic disorders. We aimed to investigate the predictors of persistence or worsening of psychosis spectrum features among US youth through the first large systematic study to evaluate subclinical symptoms in the community. Based on Time 1 screen of 9,498 youth (age 8-21) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, a subsample of participants was enrolled based on the presence (N=249) or absence (N=254) of baseline psychosis spectrum symptoms, prior participation in neuroimaging, and current neuroimaging eligibility. They were invited to participate in a Time 2 assessment two years on average following Time 1. Participants were administered the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, conducted blind to initial screen status, along with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire and other clinical measures, computerized neurocognitive testing, and neuroimaging. Clinical and demographic predictors of symptom persistence were examined using logistic regression. At Time 2, psychosis spectrum features persisted or worsened in 51.4% of youths. Symptom persistence was predicted by higher severity of subclinical psychosis, lower global functioning, and prior psychiatric medication at baseline. Youths classified as having psychosis spectrum symptoms at baseline but not at follow-up nonetheless exhibited comparatively higher symptom levels and lower functioning at both baseline and follow-up than typically developing youths. In addition, psychosis spectrum features emerged in a small number of young people who previously had not reported significant symptoms but who had exhibited early clinical warning signs. Together, our findings indicate that varying courses of psychosis spectrum symptoms are evident early in US youth, supporting the importance of investigating psychosis risk as a dynamic developmental process. Neurocognition, brain structure and function, and genomics may be integrated with clinical data to provide early indices of symptom persistence and worsening in youths at risk for psychosis.
