AB  - Abstract This review discusses how the measurement of proteins in blood and its components via quantitative proteomics analyses can inform health status. Various external and internal factors such as environmental conditions, genetic background, nutrition, diet, and lifestyle, chronic pathological conditions, disease state, or therapeutic intervention will be investigated and their effects on the protein profile will be shown. The resulting changes to ones? health and how this protein expression information can be used in early screening/diagnostic applications, drug discovery, precision treatment, patient management, and monitoring overall health status will also be presented.

AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Introduction? In Wellington Hospital, CABG is being performed by various techniques like OPCAB, On-pump cardioplegic arrest, fibrillatory arrest and On-pump beating heart. Aim? This study was undertaken to compare morbidity and mortality between On- pump CABG and OPCAB on basis of Euroscore. Material and Method? From January 2003 till December 2004, data were collected according to Australasian society of Cardiothoracic surgery data set. Euroscores were calculated and patients were divided into 3 groups. Results of OPCAB and On-pump CABG were compared on basis of Euroscore group. In this period we performed 350 On-pump CABG and 254 OPCAB. Results? OPCAB group had less number of grafts per patients. Even for triple vessel disease numbers of grafts were lower in OPCAB group. OPCAB group had more patients with total arterial revascularization. There were 10 deaths in On-pump group and 1 in OPCAB group. In the low and moderate risk group there was no significant difference in hospital stay, ventilation hours and ICU stay. However inotropic requirement and requirements of blood products were less in OPCAB group. There was no statistically significant difference between Incidence of new renal failure or arrhythmia in two groups. 2 patients in each group had blocked graft in immediate postop period and required revascularization. There were only 5 patients in the high-risk group in OPCAB making intergroup comparisons difficult. Conclusion? OPCAB does not offer any significant advantage in terms of mortality and morbidity over On-pump CABG. To evaluate the effects of number of grafts and total arterial revascularization, it needs a long-term follow-up.
