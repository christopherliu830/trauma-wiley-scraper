AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Introduction? In Wellington Hospital, CABG is being performed by various techniques like OPCAB, On-pump cardioplegic arrest, fibrillatory arrest and On-pump beating heart. Aim? This study was undertaken to compare morbidity and mortality between On- pump CABG and OPCAB on basis of Euroscore. Material and Method? From January 2003 till December 2004, data were collected according to Australasian society of Cardiothoracic surgery data set. Euroscores were calculated and patients were divided into 3 groups. Results of OPCAB and On-pump CABG were compared on basis of Euroscore group. In this period we performed 350 On-pump CABG and 254 OPCAB. Results? OPCAB group had less number of grafts per patients. Even for triple vessel disease numbers of grafts were lower in OPCAB group. OPCAB group had more patients with total arterial revascularization. There were 10 deaths in On-pump group and 1 in OPCAB group. In the low and moderate risk group there was no significant difference in hospital stay, ventilation hours and ICU stay. However inotropic requirement and requirements of blood products were less in OPCAB group. There was no statistically significant difference between Incidence of new renal failure or arrhythmia in two groups. 2 patients in each group had blocked graft in immediate postop period and required revascularization. There were only 5 patients in the high-risk group in OPCAB making intergroup comparisons difficult. Conclusion? OPCAB does not offer any significant advantage in terms of mortality and morbidity over On-pump CABG. To evaluate the effects of number of grafts and total arterial revascularization, it needs a long-term follow-up.

AB  - Charles Hufnagel began the era of artificial heart valve implantation in 1952, before the existence of technology that allowed the heart to be arrested. Hufnagel implanted a Lucite tube and ball in the descending aorta with clamps that facilitated rapid insertion without arresting the heart. Although valves in the descending aorta were somewhat successful in the management of aortic insufficiency, only a device placed in the appropriate anatomical or orthotopic position could help patients with valvular stenosis. This presentation will review the development of mechanical heart, emphasizing changes in valve design resulting from our greater understanding of blood hemodynamics, the mechanical forces imposed on valve components, and the interaction of artificial materials with components of circulating blood. The evolution from polymer to metal and finally the dominance of pyrolitic carbon as the material of choice will be explored. Similarities and differences between the four bileaflet valves that have received FDA approval and the two valves with CE mark approval that have not yet received FDA approval will be discussed.

AB  - At the end of the 20th century several inventors had suggested methods for catheter based implantation of cardiac valves. In September of 2000 Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer made transcatheter valve delivery a reality with the implantation of a stent mounted biological valve in the pulmonary position. Dr. Alain Cribier followed in 2002 with the first successful transcatheter implantation of a valve into the more challenging aortic position. Cardiac surgeons and industry seemed to show little interest in percutaneous valve delivery until January of 2004 when Edwards Life Science invested over $125 million in acquiring PVT, the company building the valves implanted by Dr. Cribier and Medtronic revealed the company?s support for Dr. Bonhoeffer?s efforts. A number of challenges have been identified and significant progress has been made in addressing some of these challenges. This presentation will describe the challenges associated with pulmonic and aortic transcatheter valve delivery. The progress that has been made in overcoming these challenges as well as the efforts being made to overcome the remaining challenges will be discussed.

AB  - Not infrequently, a patient status has changed and the surgeon is not informed. This not only leads to frustration but potentially bad outcomes. Devising a protocol for when to call the surgeon is fraught with difficulties. Frequently they are so complicated that individuals were unable to remember them thus the protocols are not applied. High turnover of junior staff means that large protocol books are not read. The below three rules are designed to fulfil the role of protocols. They are compulsory flags for when the surgeon is to be called. They are not guides to management nor comments on adequacy of management. Their intent is to flag a change in status of the patient. The compulsory nature of the flags reduces the decision making and stress for the resident staff as to whether or not they should be calling the boss. The surgeon is to be called when 1 The patient is to receive blood or blood products 2 The inotropes dose is doubled from admission 3 A vasoconstrictor is started

AB  - Purpose? The management algorithm for the complex aorta in the high-risk patient continues to evolve, especially given increasing applicability of endovascular solutions to these cases. We present three examples of aortic pathology managed in a staged fashion utilising hybrid open/endovascular techniques, as alternatives to classic aortic procedures. Methodology? Hybrid open/endovascular procedures were employed in three select cases. All patients underwent an open aortic ?debranching? procedure, in which some of the cervical/thoracic/abdominal aortic branches were relocated, to permit subsequent insertion of an endoluminal prosthesis while preserving end-organ perfusion. The stent-graft was inserted as a separate procedure. Results? All patients were males aged over seventy-five years. Two patients presented with saccular aneurysms of the mid-distal aortic arch, whereas the third patient had a Crawford type I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm associated with chronic dissection. The left common carotid/subclavian arteries were relocated in all three patients, as were the major abdominal visceral vessels in the patient with thoracoabdominal disease. Endoluminal stent-grafts were placed into the relevant portion of the aorta in all patients. Stent-graft placement was successful in all cases, with radiologically confirmed exclusion of the relevant aortic pathology. There was no mortality and no significant morbidity. Conclusion? Patients considered to be at high risk for thoracic/thoracoabdominal open aortic surgery may be suitable for an endovascular management strategy, although an accompanying surgical debranching procedure may be required to facilitate the subsequent appropriate placement of a stent-graft.

AB  - An adverse outcome represents the sumation of many different errors. These errors may be equipment related, process related, personnel related etc. When the summation of these errors reaches a critical point an adverse outcome occurs. After a personal analysis of adverse outcomes the below 5 rules were instigated. The author believes that a large number of adverse medical outcomes could be avoided by the adherence of these rules. Such a system of rules removes the reluctance of many junior staff to contact their seniors, instead it acts as a compulsory communication protocol between the senior and junior staff. These rules form part of the resident staff orientation. They are displayed in the nurses office on the ward and each resident is given a laminated credit card size version to clip to their hospital ID. The rules are: 1 All referrals outside the service must be approved by a Registrar or Consultant 2 Ensure patients have a management plan 3 Ensure adequate patient records are maintained (objective, no personal conclusions, not inflamatory) 4 Instructions from those above in the chain of command cannot be countermanded by those below without discussion with those issuing the instructions 5 If you don?t know ? ask, you should never feel out of your depth

AB  - Background? Surgical angioplasty of left main coronary artery (LMCA) in critical left main stenosis has been described as an alternative to CABG to restore antegrade coronary perfusion. We review our experience with onlay saphenous vein patch augmentation for ostial and short segment proximal left main stenosis in selected patients. Methods? All data were compiled prospectively and medical records reviewed. Follow up information obtained form cardiologists and local doctors through telephonic questionnaires. Results? Between May 1997 and August 2005, 14 left coronary ostioplasties (9 posterior and 5 anterior approaches) were performed in 13 patients. One patient had to be taken off the study group because of failed posterior ostioplasty that was identified on table. Another patient who had previous CABG and persistent angina despite patent grafts, had symptomatic relief following left main ostioplasty. No peri-operative mortality or myocardial infarction. All patients were followed up for an average period of 5 years. One patient had kinked anterior onlay patch and underwent ostioplasty by posterior approach subsequently. One patient died two years postoperatively due to stroke. All others were leading active symptom free lives. 4 (3 posterior and 1 anterior) follow up coronary angiograms showed widely patent LMCAs. Conclusion? Left coronary ostioplasty is a safe procedure, which promises excellent results.Eventhough it is considered as an alternative to CABG, in certain situations may be needed as an adjunct to patent grafts to achieve total revascularization. The anterior approach may be technically easier, but there is a definite risk of kinking of onlay patch.

AB  - Purpose? Patients undergoing heart valve replacement are usually given a choice of valve type, mechanical or tissue. Each of these broad valve types has basic advantages and disadvantages which are discussed with the patient pre-operatively, allowing them to make their decision. Post-operatively patients have a variety of experiences, related to the valve itself, complications of the operation, and other co-morbidities. The aim of this study was to determine patient satisfaction with the type of valve they chose, and whether they would have changed their mind given their experience. Methodology? A one page postal survey with multiple choice questions was sent to 350 patients identified on the hospital database who had undergone cardiac valve replacement. The data obtained was compared to database information and analysed. Results? Patients reported a variety of experiences following their discharge from hospital, from thrombo-embolic events, arrhythmias, bruising and bleeding and ongoing warfarin dosing difficulties. Very few patients (<0.5%) stated that given their experience would have chosen a different type of valve. Also few patients (<5%) who received biological valve replacements ended up requiring warfarin long term. Conclusions? Despite many patients having significant problems post-operatively, very few regret their choice of valve type.

AB  - Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a form of mediastinitis caused by odontogenic infection or deep cervical infections, which spreads to the mediastinum via the cervical facial planes. Criteria adopted for the diagnosis of Descending Necrotizing mediastinitis are clinical manifestations of severe infection, demonstration of characteristic roentgenographic features, documentation of the necrotizing mediastinal infection and establishment of oropharyngeal or cervical infection with the development of the necrotizing mediastinal process. Most of the published reports in literature are single case report. The largest series published is of 17 patients over 15 years. Despite the increased use of CT scan as a diagnostic aid and the improvement in antibiotics, mortality in patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis remains high, reported between 25?40% in the literature. We have treated two patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis at our institution. The primary oropharyngeal infection was Ludwig?s angina in one and odontogenic abscess in other. Both patients underwent mediastinal drainage, one through midsternotomy and other through right thoracotomy in addition of cervical infection drainage. The outcome was favorable in both the patients. Delay of diagnosis and inappropriate drainage of the mediastinum are the main cause of mortality in this life threatening condition. The various surgical approaches have been reported for mediastinal drainage to treat Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. We report our experience of patients with Descending necrotizing mediastinitis and discuss the surgical management of this highly fatal condition.

AB  - Purpose? Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiothoracic surgery, occurring in more than 30% of patients undergoing CABG. Postoperative AF results in thromboembolic events, haemodynamic compromise and an increase in length and cost of hospitalisation. Any intervention that reduces the incidence of postoperative AF should result in fewer complications in addition to being of important economic benefit. Increased consumption of oily fish or Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements substantially lowers the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction both in primary and secondary prevention trials, through a reduction in fatal arrhythmias. Omega-3 PUFAs may also play a role in the treatment of AF as shown by cell culture research, animal models and a recent prospective observation study in 5000 elderly adults. With respect to postoperative AF, a recent Italian randomized controlled study in 160 patients showed that Omega-3 PUFA administration during hospitalisation in patients undergoing CABG reduced the incidence of postoperative AF by 54% and led to a shorter hospital stay. Methodology? We have undertaken a randomized, placebo controlled, prospective trial of Omega-3 PUFAs in patients undergoing CABG to examine its effect on the incidence of AF within 30 days and variations in length of hospital stay. We have also developed a clinically relevant measurement of the concentrations of the PUFA arachidonic acid and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Results? We are presenting interim results of the first 80 patients enrolled in the trial.

AB  - Intensive care medicine is at the intersection of medical, surgical and engineering sciences. While the lion?s share of attention in medical research focuses on magic bullets, these have largely failed to deliver in intensive care. Specifically, significant improvements have come from improving what might be regarded as the ?bread and butter? of clinical practice. Improvements the management of sedation, ventilation, glycaemic control, sepsis, shock and renal support have resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes. Simple measures such as switching off sedation on morning rounds can reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care stay by 32 to 35%1. Reduction of tidal volumes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 12 to 6?ml per kilogram has reduced mortality from 39.8% to 31% in a landmark study of 861 patients2. This is consistent with findings from smaller clinical trials and animal data linking shear forces in the lung, produced by mechanical ventilation, with biological injury. A recent study of 1548 mainly cardiothoracic surgical patients found that intensive insulin therapy reduced intensive care mortality from 8.0% with conventional treatment to 4.6%, with the greatest reduction in death due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus3. Bloodstream infections, acute renal failure, red-cell transfusions, and critical-illness polyneuropathy were also all reduced by over 40%. Early goal directed therapy reduced in-hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5% in a cohort of 263 patients admitted to an emergency department in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock4. Significant benefits resulted from early resuscitation of shocked patients using predefined protocols. Summary? Targeted protocolised therapies across a wide range of intensive care conditions have resulted in the greatest outcome benefits for critically ill patients.
