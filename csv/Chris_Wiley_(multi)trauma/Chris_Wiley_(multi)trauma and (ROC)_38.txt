AB  - Flying a commercial aircraft is sometimes referred to as being 95% sheer boredom and 5% sheer terror. The safety record of modern airliners is dramatic. In 2006 there was one fatal accident for every 2.6 million departures. To put this in perspective: there were 65 departures every 60 seconds during that year; and one fatal accident every 28 days. While progress continues to be made on both the technical and human issues involved with aircraft design and operation, recent accidents, such as Swissair 111, have shown how rapidly a situation can progress from uncertainly to alarm to critical. In the last 10 years the number of airlines in the world flying western-built jets has increased by 46% (674 to 990), the number of flights has increased by 49%, the number of fatal accidents (hull losses) has decreased by 36% and the number of ?near-misses? has increased by 85%. These statistics suggest that major gains have been made in the area of human factors training given that the aircraft designs achieved a very high level of reliability some time ago. Human factors training in aviation is now focused on the management of ?threats? and ?errors?. This presentation will review this training philosophy and consider parallels for the medical environment.

AB  - The Second Global Patient Challenge, ?Safe Surgery Saves Lives? initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) will promote standardised, evidence-based approaches to improving patient safety, in part through measures to reduce certain common errors. From harmless slips (using salt instead of sugar) to disastrous and costly failures (a wrong drug leading to the death of a patient, wrong co-ordinates in a navigational computer leading to the Erebus airline disaster, or the simultaneous use of empirical and metric systems of measurement in an international collaboration leading to the loss of a Mars probe), error shadows every human endeavour, in part because error is closely linked to creativity and success. Our team has developed realistic scenarios using a high-fidelity human-patient simulator, in which participants must cope with multiple demands at times of high stress and distraction. In this ?error environment? anaesthetists are likely to fail in various ways, which may be predicted from the fundamental theories of the genesis of human error, thus allowing us to better study these otherwise rare events. In the next phase of our research we plan to include surgeons as active subjects, and to focus on the functioning of the team rather than the individual. This will further elucidate the factors which contribute to positive and negative aspects of human performance and will inform intiatives (such as that of the WHO) to improve patient safety in the operating room.

AB  - Objective? We developed a technique for mitral valve surgery through an ultra small (5?cm) right lateral thoracotomy without aortic cross clamp. This study reports our combined ST. Thomas and Vanderbilt Heart Institutes five years experience with this technique. Methods? Six hundred and twenty five (316 M /309 F; aged 22?75 mean of 62 years) underwent ultra minimally invasive mitral valve surgery between August 2000 and June 2006. Through a 5 centimeter right lateral thoracotomy along the 4th intercostal space access to the pericardium and the left atrium was gained. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted through femoral cannulation. Under cold fibrillatory arrest (28°C) without aortic cross clamp, mitral valve repair (n?=?196) or replacement (n?=?380), in addition to mitral valve procedure we performed tricuspid valve repair (n?=?69), ASD/PFO closure (n?=?201) and Maze (n?=?156). Mean pre operative New York Heart Association function class was 2.2?±?0.9. Twenty eight patients had ejection fraction less than 20%. Results? Thirty-day mortality was 1.28% (n?=?8), Operating time, bypass time operating averaged 189?±?52, 113?±?35 minutes, respectively. Three patients had conversion to sternotomy. Fifteen patients (2.4%) underwent reexploration for bleeding. Average length of hospital stay from surgery to discharge was 6.85?±?3 days. Ten patients (1.6%) had neurological events. Renal failure required hemodialysis in 5 patients (0.81%). Long term follow-up results are awaited. Conclusions? This study demonstrate that this simplified technique of ultra minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is reproducible and provides the least invasive operative approach with low mortality and morbidity with good cosmetic results.

AB  - Purpose? In the light of improvement in results of surgery for acute infective endocarditis(IE),we analysed our surgical outcomes and risk factors associated with mortality in patients operated for acute IE in the past decade. Methodology? A retrospective study of 85 consecutive patients (54 males, 31 females, Mean age 50.4?±?18.9 years) who underwent surgery for IE between January 1997 to December 2006 was performed. The preoperative profiles,intraoperative findings and the postoperative outcomes were analysed. Results? Native valve endocarditis (NVE) was present in 78/85 patients and prosthetic valve endocarditis(PVE) in 7/85 patients. The aortic, mitral, tricuspid and multiple valves were involved in 30, 28, 15 and 9 pateints respectively. Seven out of 12 intravenous drug abusers had tricuspid valve involvement.The commonest organism was Staphylococcus aureus. The indications for surgery were heart failure (75.2%), failure of medical management (15.2%), abcess (9.4%) and embolism (8.2%). 65 patients underwent valve replacements (55 prosthetic valves, 6 homografts and 2 Ross procedures). 20 patients underwent valve repairs/vegetectomies, of which 5 were mitral repairs. There were 16 in-hospital deaths (18.8% overall). The mortality was 16.6% in NVE compared to 42.8% in PVE (p?<?0.05). PVE, ventilation greater than 24 hours, acute renal failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction were associated with increased mortality (p?<?0.05). 4 patients required reoperation for recurrent endocarditis during 1 year follow-up. Conclusion? Operation for active IE carries acceptable mortality rate for this aggressive disease. Prolonged ventilation, renal failure and severe LV dysfunction are associated with increased risk of mortality.

AB  - Purpose? This systematic review aims to assess the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation(RFA) for pulmonary malignancies. Methodology? Searches for relevant literature on RFA for lung tumours prior to Nov 2006 were performed in six electronic databases. Application of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality assessment and data extraction were independently performed for all retrieved studies. Results were synthesized through tabulation and combined with a narrative review. Results? Sixteen relevant studies on lung RFA with more than 10 patients that reported rates of morbidity, mortality, complete tumour ablation, local recurrence or survival were identified for this review. All included studies were level 4 evidence case series with median follow-up periods ranging from 9?24 months. The overall post-procedural morbidity rates ranged from 15?76% and mortality rates ranged from 0?5%. The most common complications were pneumothoraces occurring at 9?61 % of procedures. The rates of complete tumour necrosis achieved by RFA ranged from 38?98% while the rates of local recurrence from previously ablated lesions ranged from 2?38%. The overall median progression free interval ranged from 13 to 26 months. The overall median survival from the time of lung RFA, ranged from 8.6?33 months, with 1, 2 and 3 year survival of 71?85%, 55?65% and 38?46%, respectively. Conclusion? The available evidence for radiofrequency ablation of primary and metastatic lung tumours is very limited. Surgical resection should remain the standard of care when feasible. Radiofrequency ablation, however, is safe and appears to have a promising role in the treatment of unresectable lung tumours.

AB  - CPAP was first used for over 70 years ago and confers benefit to patients through a number of different mechanisms: ?? Reduction in left ventricular afterload ?? Reduction in work of breathing ?? Improved work sharing of fatiguing muscle groups ?? Maintenance of lung volumes with improved ventilation perfusion matching and improvement in oxygen ?? Prevention of upper airway obstruction ?? Reduced stress and ?biological? injury In a study of prophylactic CPAP following major abdominal surgery, those randomised to CPAP had a lower intubation rate (1% vs 10%, Relative risk [RR], 0.099, 95% CI, 0.01?0.76, p?=?0.005) and had a lower occurrence rate of pneumonia (2% vs 10%, RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04?0.88, p?=?0.02), infection (3% vs 10%, RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.07?0.94, p?=?0.03), and sepsis (2% vs 9%, RR, 0.22, 95% CI, 0.04?0.99, p?=?0.03) than did patients treated with oxygen alone1. The benefit of CPAP, largely through a reduction in the need for intubation and ventilation, are now clearly established in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. A recent meta-analysis showed CPAP reduces mortality (RR, 0.59, 95% CI 0.38?0.90, p?=?0.15) and the need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.44, CI, 0.29?0.66, p?=?0.0003)2. Summary?? The perioperative cardiac surgical patient will frequently have impaired left ventricular function, pulmonary oedema, or atelectasis, all of which may be improved with the application of CPAP. Hence CPAP is likely to confer significant benefits through reduction in intubation, ventilation associated pneumonia, and mortality in the immediate post operative period.

AB  - Purpose? To evaluate our surgical results for ischaemic Ventricular Septal Rupture and suggest practice guidelines. Methodology? A retrospective review of data from patient records from 1992 to 2006 for presentation, surgical approaches, recurrence and mortality and analyzed for future management guidelines. Results? We had 36 patients with a mean age of 70.44(+/? 6.34). 14 patients (38.9%) had an inferior/ posterior defect, 28 were in shock (22 on IABP). Severe LV and RV dysfunction were present in 18 and 20 patients respectively. Repair involved patches after infarctectomy (17) or infarct exclusion (18), using either continuous or interrupted suture. Concomitant CABG was performed in 15. 11 patients had residual shunts, 2 requiring device closure and one surgery. Prolonged ICU and hospital stay was the norm. Early mortality was 52.78% (inferior defects ? 85.71%, anterior defects ? 31.82%). On Univariate analysis Inferior VSD (OR 7.7; 95% CI 1.7, 33.3), Moderate to severe RV impairment (OR 5.0; 95% CI 0.92, 33.3), Pre op shock (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.6, 33.3), Early presentation post MI and infarctectomy during repair (3.8; 95% CI 0.9, 15.4), predicted mortality. For subgroup of anterior VSD, only pre-op shock (OR11.1; 95% CI 1.0, 100) predicted a poor outcome. On multivariate analysis, Inferior defects and shock at presentation were the dominant predictors for early death. Repair without cardioplegia (OR5.2; 95% CI 0.48, 56.09) was the only risk factor for recurrence. Conclusions? Acute ischaemic VSD is a grim surgical disease with high mortality. Inferior defects should be offered surgery only in exceptional circumstances due to uniformly poor outcome.

AB  - Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a form of mediastinitis caused by odontogenic infection or deep cervical infections, which spreads to the mediastinum via the cervical facial planes. Criteria adopted for the diagnosis of Descending Necrotizing mediastinitis are clinical manifestations of severe infection, demonstration of characteristic roentgenographic features, documentation of the necrotizing mediastinal infection and establishment of oropharyngeal or cervical infection with the development of the necrotizing mediastinal process. Most of the published reports in literature are single case report. The largest series published is of 17 patients over 15 years. Despite the increased use of CT scan as a diagnostic aid and the improvement in antibiotics, mortality in patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis remains high, reported between 25?40% in the literature. We have treated two patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis at our institution. The primary oropharyngeal infection was Ludwig?s angina in one and odontogenic abscess in other. Both patients underwent mediastinal drainage, one through midsternotomy and other through right thoracotomy in addition of cervical infection drainage. The outcome was favorable in both the patients. Delay of diagnosis and inappropriate drainage of the mediastinum are the main cause of mortality in this life threatening condition. The various surgical approaches have been reported for mediastinal drainage to treat Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. We report our experience of patients with Descending necrotizing mediastinitis and discuss the surgical management of this highly fatal condition.

AB  - Purpose? Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiothoracic surgery, occurring in more than 30% of patients undergoing CABG. Postoperative AF results in thromboembolic events, haemodynamic compromise and an increase in length and cost of hospitalisation. Any intervention that reduces the incidence of postoperative AF should result in fewer complications in addition to being of important economic benefit. Increased consumption of oily fish or Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements substantially lowers the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction both in primary and secondary prevention trials, through a reduction in fatal arrhythmias. Omega-3 PUFAs may also play a role in the treatment of AF as shown by cell culture research, animal models and a recent prospective observation study in 5000 elderly adults. With respect to postoperative AF, a recent Italian randomized controlled study in 160 patients showed that Omega-3 PUFA administration during hospitalisation in patients undergoing CABG reduced the incidence of postoperative AF by 54% and led to a shorter hospital stay. Methodology? We have undertaken a randomized, placebo controlled, prospective trial of Omega-3 PUFAs in patients undergoing CABG to examine its effect on the incidence of AF within 30 days and variations in length of hospital stay. We have also developed a clinically relevant measurement of the concentrations of the PUFA arachidonic acid and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Results? We are presenting interim results of the first 80 patients enrolled in the trial.

AB  - Intensive care medicine is at the intersection of medical, surgical and engineering sciences. While the lion?s share of attention in medical research focuses on magic bullets, these have largely failed to deliver in intensive care. Specifically, significant improvements have come from improving what might be regarded as the ?bread and butter? of clinical practice. Improvements the management of sedation, ventilation, glycaemic control, sepsis, shock and renal support have resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes. Simple measures such as switching off sedation on morning rounds can reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care stay by 32 to 35%1. Reduction of tidal volumes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 12 to 6?ml per kilogram has reduced mortality from 39.8% to 31% in a landmark study of 861 patients2. This is consistent with findings from smaller clinical trials and animal data linking shear forces in the lung, produced by mechanical ventilation, with biological injury. A recent study of 1548 mainly cardiothoracic surgical patients found that intensive insulin therapy reduced intensive care mortality from 8.0% with conventional treatment to 4.6%, with the greatest reduction in death due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus3. Bloodstream infections, acute renal failure, red-cell transfusions, and critical-illness polyneuropathy were also all reduced by over 40%. Early goal directed therapy reduced in-hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5% in a cohort of 263 patients admitted to an emergency department in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock4. Significant benefits resulted from early resuscitation of shocked patients using predefined protocols. Summary? Targeted protocolised therapies across a wide range of intensive care conditions have resulted in the greatest outcome benefits for critically ill patients.

AB  - Purpose? Proximal anastomotic devices have been developed to produce predictable results that eliminate surgical technique as a variable with respect to the anastomosis, improve graft patency and lower the incidence of stroke. One criticism of current devices is foreign material contact at the anastomosis which is thought to stimulate intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. In co-operation with AllVascular Restorative Vascular Solutions, an anastomotic device for use in vein graft-aortic anastomosis, the Universal Anastomotic Stent (UAS), was developed to eliminate foreign body contact with blood. Methodology? The design concept for the UAS was based on the Venous Valve Transfer stent developed by AllVascular. This stent is designed to transfer a functional venous valve to a vein with valve incompetence as a treatment of venous valve insufficiency. The UAS prototype developed from this stent underwent pre-clinical testing in sheep for design review. Results? Animal trials established that an external nitinol expanding stent can be used to create an arterial anastomosis. Loading a vein graft onto the UAS proved difficult in the absence of a crimping tool. A design concept for a dedicated loading tool has been developed and an animal model for future testing was finalised. Conclusions? The UAS, compared to existing anastomotic devices, has the advantage of maintaining intima-intima contact at the anastomosis, which may reduce the inflammatory response. External stenting may limit compliance mismatch at the anastomosis and reduce intimal hyperplasia. Further animal testing is required to establish if this novel anastomotic device will be suitable for human use.

AB  - Background? Coronary revascularization surgery does not traditionally employ angiography to assess procedural success. Early graft failure is reported up to 30% in one year (JAMA Nov 2005) may relate to technical errors or conduit problems. We hypothesize that intra-operative assessment of graft by angiography identifies graft defects and may improve the long term graft survival. Methods? We have developed one of the first hybrid operation room in the USA. In one year period 203 consecutive patients (age:63+/?16, M/F:126/39) underwent coronary revascularization with angiography before decannulation. Results? Of 436 grafts, 72 angiographic defects were detected in 69 grafts (17% of total grafts). There were 11% conduit defects, 3% anastomotic defects, and 3% target vessel error. Of 72 defects, 25/72 defects required minor revision, 47/72 required either surgical or percutaneous intervention. Intra-operative angiography added an average 20+/?12 minutes to the surgery and 112+/?56 ml contrast. Renal function at 24hours and 48 hours after procedure did not vary significantly between patients who did vs. those did not have revisions. There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross clamp time, and length of hospital stay for patients who underwent revision compared to those who did not. Renal function, bleeding complication, transfusion were similar in patients with percutaneous vs. surgical revision. Conclusions? Intraoperative graft angiography performed at the time of CABG identifies graft defects, allowing for immediate surgical or percutaneous revision. Long-term study is in progress to assess whether intra-operative completion angiography decreases the rate of early graft failure.

AB  - Introduction? Post-operative strokes occur in a small percentage of adult cardiac surgical patients and have devastating consequences for these patients. There is evidence to suggest that Cerebral Arterial Gas Embolism (CAGE) is an important aetiological factor in most of these cases. Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the administration of 100% oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. It is accepted as the definitive treatment for CAGE related to SCUBA diving accidents. The similarities between this and the pathophysiology of post cardiac-surgical strokes due to iatrogenic CAGE suggest that beneficial effects from HBOT may accrue to these patients. Purpose? The purpose of this study is to review the experience of treating post cardiac-surgical stroke patients in our local hyperbaric oxygen facility, including their presentation, delay before treatment and outcomes. The current evidence base is reviewed. Method? A retrospective case series analysis was conducted. Results? Over a 10 year period, patients with post cardiac-surgical strokes and who presented within the first 48 hours were referred for HBOT, of whom 12 were treated. The neurological outcomes were excellent in all but one case who died. A review of the literature provides a rational basis for the potential benefits of HBOT in this scenario, but at present there is only limited clinical data to support its use. Conclusion? The postulated mechanisms for the development of post cardiac-surgical strokes provide a sound theoretical basis for the suggestion that the use of HBOT is associated with improved outcomes. However there is no prospective data to support such a claim. Such a trial would be problematic and until more evidence is available, HBOT should be considered on a case by case basis.

AB  - Lymphatics of the heart have not generated any broad or sustained interests among clinicians. Few publications on cardiac lymphatics are available, anatomy not routinely known and the true role of cardiac lymphatics remains doubtful. One important anatomical concept needing clarification is that of the lymphatic nature of conduction tissue. Sino-atrial node lymphatic collector is incorporated into Aortic Fat Pad and as such is the most frequently damaged lymphatic vessel during cardiac surgery. Thus, preservation of Aortic Fat Pad and its lymphatic collector should reduce the incidence of new atrial fibrillation in patients post cardiac surgery, an observation reported in the literature recently.
