AB  - Despite a stringent donor selection, human islet isolation remains frustratingly unpredictable. In this study, we measured acute insulin response to arginine (AIRarg), an in vivo surrogate measure of islet mass, in 29 human deceased donors before organ donation, and correlated values with the outcome of islet isolation. Thirteen isolations (45%) met the threshold for clinical islet transplantation. Among all measured donor characteristics, the only discriminating variable between successful or unsuccessful isolations was donor AIRarg (p < 0.01). Using a threshold of 55 ?IU/mL (ROC curve AUC: 72%), isolation was successful in 12/19 donors with high AIRarg and in 1/10 donors with low AIRarg (p < 0.001). The negative and positive predictive values were 90 and 63%, respectively. If used to select donors in the entire cohort, AIRarg would have increased our success rate by 40% and avoided 56% of unsuccessful isolations while missing only 8% of successful preparations. Our results suggest that donor AIRarg is markedly superior to body mass index (BMI) and other criteria currently used to predict isolation outcome. If routinely performed in deceased donors, this simple test could significantly reduce the failure rate of human islet isolation.

AB  - Introduction Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) and thromboelastography (TEG?) are increasingly used in the perioperative and emergency assessment of bleeding tendencies. The diagnostic value of ROTEM and TEG for von Willebrand disease (VWD) remains to be established. Aim To investigate whether ROTEM and TEG can discriminate patients with VWD from healthy controls. Methods Rotational thromboelastometry and TEG whole blood coagulation profiles were compared between VWD patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 89). Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated, including sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Prolonged TEG R-time had a positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of 0.84 and 0.68 respectively. TEG clotting index (CI) had a PPV of 1.00 and an NPV of 0.60. Both R-time and CI had a high specificity and accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, with an ROC area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.99 respectively. In multivariate analysis, low FVIII levels, but not von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen or activity, determined hypocoagulable TEG R (R2 = 0.35) and CI levels (R2 = 0.51). The ROTEM coagulation profiles of VWD patients did not differ from healthy controls. Conclusions Thromboelastography R and CI accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, partly through the detection of low FVIII levels. The test's performance may be improved through adjustment of the test thresholds to a local reference population. Both intrinsic pathway-activated (INTEM) and tissue factor pathway-activated (EXTEM) ROTEM were of limited diagnostic value in VWD.

AB  - Background Middle turbinate edema could be a characteristic feature of aeroallergen sensitization. In this study we sought to determine the diagnostic characteristics of middle turbinate edema as a marker of inhalant allergy. Methods A cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed on patients who had undergone nasal endoscopy and allergy testing. Allergy status was determined by positive serology or epicutaneous testing. Endoscopy was reviewed by blinded assessors for middle turbinate head edema. Appearance was graded as either normal, focal, multifocal, diffuse, or polypoid edema. Receiver-operator (ROC) analysis, likelihood ratio (LR), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were determined. Results One hundred eighty-seven patients representing 304 nasal cavities were assessed (42% female, age 39.74 ± 14.7 years, 57% allergic). Diffuse edema (PPV 91.7%/LR = 8) and polypoid edema (PPV 88.9%/LR = 6.2) demonstrated the strongest association with inhalant allergy. Multifocal edema was used as a cut-off to represent inhalant allergy from ROC analysis, which demonstrated 94.7% specificity and 23.4% sensitivity. The PPV for multifocal was 85.1% and LR = 4.4. Conclusion Middle turbinate edema is a useful nasal endoscopic feature to predict presence of inhalant allergy and, although not sensitive, has excellent PPV.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal tissue regeneration is often required following trauma, where substantial bone or cartilage loss may be encountered and is a significant driver for the development of biomaterials with a defined 3D structural network. Solvent blending is a process that avoids complications associated with conventional thermal or mechanical polymer blending or synthesis, opening up large areas of chemical and physical space, while potentially simplifying regulatory pathways towards in vivo application. Here ternary mixtures of natural and synthetic polymers were solvent blended and evaluated as potential bone tissue engineering matrices for osteoregeneration by the assessment of growth and differentiation of STRO-1+ skeletal stem cells. Several of the blend materials were found to be excellent supports for human bone marrow-derived STRO-1+ skeletal cells and fetal skeletal cells, with the optimized blend exhibiting in vivo osteogenic potential, suggesting that these polymer blends could act as suitable matrices for bioengineering of hard tissues.

AB  - Abstract Although intra-dialytic hypertension (IDH) has been noted in clinical settings for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed IDH incidence in our center and the correlation between postdialysis volume state and IDH. One hundred thirty-one maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were enrolled in our study, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and echocardiography (ECG) were recorded. In addition, demographic data were collected, and laboratory examinations were conducted. The patients were grouped into four groups according to the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between predialysis and postdialysis. The incidence of IDH was 10.7%. The proportion of extracellular water to total body weight (ECW/TW), as evaluated by BIA, was significantly higher in the IDH group than in the other three groups both in pre-and post-dialysis. In particular, postdialysis SBP was highest in the highest tertile interval of ECW/TW. In addition, among the four groups, left ventricular volume (LVV) was highest in the IDH group. Binary logistic analyses revealed that predialysis SBP, postdialysis ECW/TW and LVV were independent risk factors of intradialytic hypertension. When predicting IDH, the AUC of the ROC curve was higher for ECW/TW combined with LVV (0.752, 95% CI 0.613?0.896) than for either LVV or ECW/TW alone. Our study further showed that post-dialysis volume expansion is an important factor for the development of IDH.

Hypothesis We proposed the hypothesis that the practical utility of cardiac troponin levels for prediction of mortality and poor outcome in ICH patients. Methods A total of 1004 patients with ICH were retrospectively reviewed and qualified for further analysis from June 2012 to December 2015. The patients were divided into different groups based on measurements of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at the time of admission and the following day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed to determine the independent prognostic value of the cTnI for patients in-hospital mortality and poor outcomes, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of cTnI, ICH score, and combination of them. Results Serum cTnI level was an independent predictor in-hospital mortality (positive vs negative, HR (hazard ratios) = 3.44, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.66-7.13, P <?.001) and poor outcomes in patients with ICH (positive vs negative, HR = 6.69, 95% CI 4.25-10.52, P <?.001). Addition of cTnI to ICH score significantly improved the prognostic discrimination for both in-hospital mortality and poor outcomes. Conclusion Serum cTnI levels may be valuable as predictor for in hospital mortality and poor outcomes and may be useful in the risk stratification of ICH during hospitalization.

AB  - Abstract Aim Accurate prediction of which high-risk individuals will go on to develop psychosis would assist early intervention and prevention paradigms. We sought to review investigations of prospective psychosis prediction based on markers and variables examined in longitudinal familial high-risk (FHR) studies. Methods We performed literature searches in MedLine, PubMed and PsycINFO for articles assessing performance characteristics of predictive clinical tests in FHR studies of psychosis. Studies were included if they reported on one or more predictive variables in subjects at FHR for psychosis. We complemented this search strategy with references drawn from articles, reviews, book chapters and monographs. Results Across generations of FHR projects, predictive studies have investigated behavioural, cognitive, psychometric, clinical, neuroimaging and other markers. Recent analyses have incorporated multivariate and multi-domain approaches to risk ascertainment, with generally modest results. Conclusions Although a broad range of risk factors has been identified, no individual marker or combination of markers can at this time enable accurate prospective prediction of emerging psychosis for individuals at FHR. We outline the complex and multi-level nature of psychotic illness, the myriad of factors influencing its development, and methodological hurdles to accurate and reliable prediction. Prospects and challenges for future generations of FHR studies are discussed in the context of early detection and intervention strategies.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains controversial because the risk for uncontrolled postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) must be balanced against the potential morbidity associated with prolonged and possibly unnecessary drainage. This study investigated the utility of the level of serum amylase on the night of surgery [postoperative day (PoD) 0 serum amylase] to predict POPF. Methods A total of 185 patients who underwent PD were studied. Occurrences of POPF were graded using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase associated with clinically significant POPF (ISGPF Grades B and C) in a test cohort (n = 45). The accuracy of this threshold value was then tested in a validation cohort (n = 140). Results Overall, 43 (23.2%) patients developed clinically significant POPF. The threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase for the identification of clinically significant POPF was ≥130?IU/l (P = 0.003). Serum amylase of <130?IU/l had a negative predictive value of 88.8% for clinically significant POPF (P < 0.001). Serum amylase of ≥130?IU/l on PoD?0 and a soft pancreatic parenchyma were independent risk factors for clinically significant POPF. Conclusions Postoperative day 0 serum amylase of <130?IU/l allows for the early and accurate categorization of patients at least risk for clinically significant POPF and may identify patients suitable for early drain removal.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p <?0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432?6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A 95% CI 1.012?1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208?mg/mL versus 172?mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p >0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Introduction? Post-operative survival after surgery for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is influenced by factors such as stage of disease and co-morbidities. We sought to assess the performance of 2 models in predicting 1 year survival after resected NSCLC. Methods? The Colinet Simplified Co-Morbidity Score (SCS) (1) and a prognostic model by Birim (2) were retrospectively applied to a cohort of patients with surgically resected NSCLC. End-point was 1 year survival obtained from clinical follow-up and data-linkage with the Cancer Council of Victoria. Results? 216 patients were treated from Feb 1999 to Dec 2005. 52 patients were excluded due to missing data, leaving 164 patients for analysis. Mean patient age was 66.4?±?10.3. Pathological stage was 1 in 61%, 2 in19% and 3 in 17%. Observed 1 year survival was 78.7%. SCS was predictive of 1 year survival: mean SCS 9.24 for survivors and 11.03 for non-survivors (p?=?0.001 by t-test). Patient?s with low SCS (0-9) had a higher 1-year survival than those with high SCS (>9); 87.2% vs 69.2% (p?=?0.005 by chi-square test). SCS discriminated fairly for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.66). The predicted survival using the Birim model (74.2%) was similar to the observed survival (p?=?0.43). The model predicted survival well in both low (predicted 83% vs observed 88%, p?=?0.51) and high (66 vs 70%, p?=?0.74) risk groups. Birim model discriminated well for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.70). Conclusion? SCS and the Birim model can both be used to estimate 1-year survival. They may aid the clinician in deciding who should be considered for surgical resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a model estimating the probability of a patient aged 80 years or older having functional limitations 2 months and 12 months after being hospitalized. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four teaching hospitals in the US. PARTICIPANTS: Enrolled patients were nonelective hospital admissions aged 80 years or older who stayed in hospital at least 48 hours. The 804 patients who survived and completed an interview at 2 months and the 450 who completed an interview at 12 months were from the 1266 patients in the Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project (HELP) (76% and 47% of survivors, respectively). Median age of the 2-month survivors was 84.7 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Patient function 2 and 12 months after enrollment was defined by the number of dependencies in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to predict functional status. Predictors included demographic characteristics, disease category, geriatric conditions, severity of physiologic imbalance, current quality of life, and exercise capacity and ADLs 2 weeks before study admission. RESULTS: Before admission, 39% of patients were functionally independent in ADLs. Of patients who survived and were interviewed at 2 months, 32% were functionally independent, and at 12 months, 36% were independent. Among patients with no baseline dependencies, 42% had developed one or more limitations 2 months later, and 41% had limitations 12 months later. The patient's ability to perform activities of daily living at baseline was the most important predictor of functional status at both 2 and 12 months. In a multivariable predictive model, independent predictors of poorer functional status at 2 months included: worse baseline functional status and quality of life; depth of coma, if any; lower serum albumin level; presence of dementia, depression, or incontinence; being bedridden; medical record documentation of need for nursing home; and older age. Model performance, assessed using Somers' D, was 0.61 for 2 months and 0.57 for 12 months (Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area = 0.81 and .79, respectively.) Bootstrap validation of the month 2 model also yielded a Somers' D = 0.60. The models were well calibrated over the entire risk range. The ROC area for prediction of the loss of independence was 0.76 for 2 months and 0.68 for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Many older patients are functionally impaired at the time of hospitalization, and many develop new functional limitations. A limited amount of readily available clinical information can yield satisfactory predictions of functional status 2 months after hospitalization. Models like this may prove to be useful in clinical care. This work illuminates a potential method for risk adjustment in research studies and for monitoring quality of care.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Summary Congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients may have obstetric complications during their pregnancies. This study aimed to evaluate thromboelastography (TEG) as a potential tool for assessing the tendency for obstetric complications in those patients in a non-pregnant state. A total of 22 female subjects with congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia were recruited. Nine subjects had histories of obstetric complications and the other 13 subjects had at least one uneventful pregnancy without obstetric complications as yet. Detailed clinical investigation and phenotype/genotype detection were carried out, and both kaolin-activated TEG and functional fibrinogen TEG (FF-TEG) were applied in all subjects. Significant differences were identified in all TEG parameters except for R and angle between these two groups (P < 0.05) by covariance analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of discrimination between these two groups of patients was performed for TEG parameters. Significantly high odds ratio (OR) of obstetric complications occurrence were demonstrated in K ≥ 3.8 min, maximum amplitude (MA) ≤ 54.2 mm, comprehensive index (CI) ≤ ?3 (11.67, 95% CI 1.527?89.121, P < 0.05 in all), and MA-CFF ≤ 12.1 mm (20.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.967?203.322, P = 0.002). Moreover, MA-CFF had better prognostic performance, with a corresponding area under the receiver operating curve of 0.923 (range 0.815?1.031, P = 0.001). This study suggests that (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients with values outside of the cut-off values of TEG assays under non-pregnant state may have a higher risk of obstetric complications occurring when they are pregnant. No parameters under non-pregnant state in clinical laboratory have ever been reported to be risk factors for obstetric complication occurrence in (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients. This study explored such parameters in TEG assays and found that parameters of TEG assays under non-pregnant status might predict the occurrence of obstetric complications, which could provide physicians with important information about whether fibrinogen replacement therapy is required, so as to prevent the occurrence of obstetric complications, especially for patients who are asymptomatic in daily life.

AB  - Summary Introduction Multidimensional optical scatter of sphered erythrocytes can identify and enumerate hyperchromic erythrocytes, which might be used for hereditary spherocytosis (HS) screening. The flow cytometric eosin-5?-maleimide test (EMA) is highly sensitive and specific for HS as a confirmatory method. The aims of this study were to assess the utility of hyperchromic erythrocytes in HS screening and to evaluate the EMA test performed on CELL-DYN Sapphire analyser compared with the reference method. Methods Blood from 740 paediatric patients presenting at our institution was analysed in reticulocyte mode of the CELL-DYN Sapphire haematology analyser (Abbott Diagnostics) to obtain hyperchromic erythrocyte counts. The EMA test was performed using a flow cytometer as a reference, as well as CELL-DYN Sapphire as an investigational method. Results Hyperchromic erythrocytes were the highest in patients with HS (median 11.5%; range 5.1?29.2%). Patients with autoimmune haemolytic disease had significantly less hyperchromic erythrocytes (median 4.9%; range 0.0?18.3%). Hyperchromic erythrocytes showed a high area under the ROC curve: 0.972. At 4.9% cut-off, hyperchromic erythrocytes detected HS with 96.4% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. The EMA test on CELL-DYN Sapphire correlated strongly with the reference test and had identical diagnostic power. Stability studies with blood from HS patients showed a significant decrease in hyperchromic erythrocytes after 6 h storage. Conclusions Measurement of hyperchromic erythrocytes is highly sensitive and specific for detecting HS and can be used for rapid and inexpensive screening. If required, the EMA test can be performed on CELL-DYN Sapphire or a standard flow cytometer for confirmation of HS.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of computed tomography (CT) based radiomic features of primary tumors to predict pathological nodal involvement in clinically node-negative (N0) peripheral lung adenocarcinomas. Methods A total of 187 patients with clinical N0 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas who underwent preoperative CT scan and subsequently received systematic lymph node dissection were retrospectively reviewed. 219 quantitative 3D radiomic features of primary lung tumor were extracted; meanwhile, nine radiological semantic features were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to explore the role of these features in predicting pathological nodal involvement. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were compared between multivariate logistic regression models. Results A total of 153 patients had pathological N0 status and 34 had pathological lymph node metastasis. On univariate analysis, fissure attachment and 17 radiomic features were significantly associated with pathological nodal involvement. Multivariate analysis revealed that semantic features of pleural retraction (P = 0.048) and fissure attachment (P = 0.023) were significant predictors of pathological nodal involvement (AUC = 0.659); and the radiomic feature F185 (Histogram SD Layer 1) (P = 0.0001) was an independent prognostic factor of pathological nodal involvement (AUC = 0.73). A logistic regression model produced from combining radiomic feature and semantic feature showed the highest AUC of 0.758 (95% CI: 0.685?0.831), and the AUC value computed by fivefold cross-validation method was 0.737 (95% CI: 0.73?0.744). Conclusions Features derived on primary lung tumor described by semantic and radiomic could provide information of pathological nodal involvement in clinical N0 peripheral lung adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Gastric ulceration is an important cause of morbidity in horses. Currently, gastroscopy is the only reliable antemortem method for definitive diagnosis; however, it is unsuitable as a screening test because it is expensive, invasive and time-consuming. Sucrose permeability testing represents a simple, economical, non-invasive alternative to gastroscopy for screening purposes, and the feasibility of this approach in the horse has been reported [1]. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose as a screening test for gastric ulceration. Study design Cross-sectional design. Methods One hundred and one adult horses with and without naturally occurring gastric ulcers were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose for detection of gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min after administration of 1?g/kg bwt of sucrose via nasogastric intubation was assessed with ROC curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Sucrose concentration in blood was compared with gastroscopy as the gold standard; and sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were calculated across a range of sucrose concentrations. Cut-off values were selected manually to optimise sensitivity. Results The prevalence of gastric ulcers was 83%. The AUC?±?95% CI for blood sucrose concentration when used to distinguish between horses with and without gastric ulcers at 45 and 90?min was 0.592 (0.441?0.744) and 0.615 (0.469?0.761) respectively. Sucrose concentrations of 4.70??mol/l at 45?min; and 4.57??mol/l at 90?min were selected as optimal cut-offs. Using these cut-offs, Se ranged from 64.4% to 77%; and Sp ranged from 42.9% to 50%. Conclusions Blood sucrose is neither a sensitive nor specific test for detecting gastric ulcers in adult horses with naturally occurring ulcers.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - Abstract Two new screening scales for psychological distress, the K6 and K10, have been developed using the item response theory and shown to outperform existing screeners in English. We developed their Japanese versions using the standard backtranslaton method and included them in the World Mental Health Survey Japan (WMH-J), which is a psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted in seven communities across Japan with 2436 participants. The WMH-J used the WMH Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess the 30-day Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ? Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Performance of the two screening scales in detecting DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders, as assessed by the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), was excellent, with values as high as 0.94 (95% confidence interval = 0.88 to 0.99) for K6 and 0.94 (0.88 to 0.995) for K10. Stratum-specific likelihood ratios (SSLRs), which express screening test characteristics and can be used to produce individual-level predicted probabilities of being a case from screening scale scores and pretest probabilities in other samples, were strikingly similar between the Japanese and the original versions. The Japanese versions of the K6 and K10 thus demonstrated screening performances essentially equivalent to those of the original English versions. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
