AB  - Abstract Background Longitudinal studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) have documented environmental factors as predictors of trajectories of higher, versus lower, symptoms, among them experiences of childhood physical abuse. Although it is now well-accepted that genes and environments jointly shape the risk of PTS, no published studies have investigated genes, or gene-by-environment interactions (GxEs), as predictors of PTS trajectories. The purpose of this study was to fill this gap. Methods and Materials We examined associations between variants of the retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) gene and trajectory membership among a sample of predominantly non-Hispanic Black urban adults (N = 473). The RORA gene was selected based on its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the first PTSD genome wide association study. Additionally, we explored GxEs between RORA variants and childhood physical abuse history. Results We found that the minor allele of the RORA SNP rs893290 was a significant predictor of membership in a trajectory of consistently high PTS, relatively to a trajectory of consistently low PTS. Additionally, the GxE of rs893290 with childhood physical abuse was significant. Decomposition of the interaction showed that minor allele frequency was more strongly associated with membership in consistently high or decreasing PTS trajectories, relative to a consistently low PTS trajectory, among participants with higher levels of childhood physical abuse. Conclusion The results of the study provide preliminary evidence that variation in the RORA gene is associated with membership in trajectories of higher PTS and that these associations are stronger among persons exposed to childhood physical abuse. Replication and analysis of functional data are needed to further our understanding of how RORA relates to PTS trajectories.

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.

AB  - The first New South Wales APS State conference was held on May 23?25 2003 in Newcastle. The conference was sponsored by the APS, together with the University of Newcastle's School of Behavioural Sciences and School of Education, and was attended by over 125 delegates. The theme of the conference was Psychology at the Coalface. This theme was chosen to emphasise that the conference would have a practical focus. The conference aimed to promote quality psychological practice and to foster learning and growth by bringing together members who work in a diverse range of employment settings and specialisations. The conference was held at the Newcastle City Hall. The first day of the conference was devoted to optional full-day and half-day pre-conference workshops. The conference proper began on Friday evening with a keynote address by Professor Matt Sanders, University of Queensland. Over the following two days, keynote addresses were presented by Professor Beryl Hesketh, University of Sydney and Professor Mike Startup, University of Newcastle. The program included presentation of oral papers, symposia and posters. The Saturday night conference dinner featured ?Tim the Yowie Man? the world's only Cryptonaturalist, speaking on unusual phenomena in the natural world from Big Foot to the Loch Ness monster. The conference was an opportunity for delegates to present up to the minute research on relevant community topics. Speakers provided an exciting and informative program covering a wide range of issues from personality disorders and autism, to schizophrenia and problem gambling.
