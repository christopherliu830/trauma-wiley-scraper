AB  - Abstract It has been a decade since the world's rhinologic community gathered in the United States for RhinoWorld. The American Rhinologic Society (ARS), International Rhinologic Society (IRS), and International Society of Inflammation and Allergy of the Nose (ISIAN) have joined together to host this international gathering of clinicians and scientists. Herein, you will find the abstracts that will be presented orally during RhinoWorld on June 5-9, 2019, in Chicago, IL. This IFAR supplement serves as an informational centerpiece for cutting edge discovery and innovation, and commentary and debate, for clinicians and researchers worldwide with interest in the fields of rhinology, cranial base, otolaryngic allergy, and associated disorders. Many thanks to the nearly 50 members of the RhinoWorld Program Committee and its co-chairs Robert Kern, MD, Rakesh Chandra, MD, and Kevin Welch, MD. This IFAR supplement is organized such that the Top 10 Clinical Abstracts (as determined by the RhinoWorld Program Committee) and the Top 10 Basic/Translational Science Abstracts (as determined by the RhinoWorld Program Committee) are presented first followed by all abstracts in alphabetical order by title. Some abstracts required post-submission editing for length. IFAR and Wiley have published this as an open access document online so that it is available all around the globe. We sincerely hope you find this publication meaningful in your practice and research. For more cutting edge information, please visit the IFAR website at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20426984 and follow us on Twitter @IFAR_Journal.

AB  - Abstract Background Syncope is a common problem but can have any of a broad range of underlying causes. Initial evaluation of the patient in the emergency department often does not identify a specific cause, and the cornerstone of management is reliable risk stratification with clinical decision rules. Objectives The primary objective is to validate the utility and safety of the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) as a clinical decision rule when assessing patients who present with syncope to Australian emergency departments. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the economic benefits of diverting patients with syncope at low risk of serious adverse events from admission to hospital. Methods and analysis Prospective, observational study. Patients aged 18 years or more who present to the emergency department (ED) after syncope in the preceding 24 hours and have returned to their baseline state will be enrolled. Patients will be contacted by telephone to determine whether they have experienced any adverse events within 30 days of their initial presentation to the ED. The CSRS will be applied retrospectively to determine the relationship between whether patients were admitted to hospital or discharged home and the reporting of serious adverse events for each CSRS risk level. We will also undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis from the health care perspective. Ethics approval Prince Charles Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, HREC/17/QPCH/48). Dissemination of results Outcomes will be disseminated by Queensland Health and the funding body via social media, presented at local and national emergency medicine conferences, and published in international emergency medicine and health economics journals. Clinical trials registration Not applicable.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective was to provide a literature review on perceptibility and acceptability thresholds in dentistry and corresponding recommendations. Overview A literature review on visual thresholds included findings on the judgments of the color and appearance of tooth-, gingiva- and skin-colored restorative dental materials. Discrepancies in study design contributed to inconsistencies in the research findings of some studies. These differences are related to (a) number of observers and inclusion criteria, (b) specimen number and size, (c) color measurement instrument and the setup and formulas used, (d) psychophysical experiment, (e) data processing (fitting method), and (f) % perceptibility or % acceptability values. A straightforward, consistent and practical model for the clinical and research application and interpretation of visual thresholds and recommended protocols for threshold research were provided. Conclusions Visual thresholds are of paramount importance as a quality control tool and guide the evaluation and selection of dental materials and their clinical performance. Although clinical shade matching conditions and method are rarely controlled, research on visual thresholds, especially when aiming to set standards for the profession, must be carefully planned and executed. Clinical Significance Perceptibility and acceptability thresholds define visual match or mismatch of color, translucency, and whiteness in dentistry. Clinical and research findings cannot be fully interpreted in terms of real-life relevance without comparison with perceptibility and acceptability tolerances.
