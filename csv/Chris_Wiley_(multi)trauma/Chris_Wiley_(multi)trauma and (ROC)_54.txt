AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to report changes in muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) and other cardiovascular variables during central apnea occurring during a relaxed wakefulness. We describe a 47-year-old man with a five-year history of apnea. Polysomnographic recording showed repeated central apnea, without an obstructive peripheral component, during sleep or relaxed wakefulness. Neuromuscular disease was excluded by EMG investigation. During relaxed wake, MSA was evaluated by a microneurographic recording from the left peroneal nerve in association with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), thoracoabdominal respiration and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Microneurographic polygraphic recording was performed during normal respiration (5 minutes) and during repeated apnea episodes (4 consecutive episodes with mean duration of 26.2?s; range 18?45). During normal respiration, MSA was 39.5 burst/min and 64.7 bursts/100 heartbeats, the heart rate was 61.1 beat/min. During the apnea episodes, both MSA (29% and 27%: 50.9 burst/min e 82.1 bursts/100 heartbeats respectively; mean values) and HR (1%: 61.9 beat/min; mean values) increased. The maximum MSA and HR increase was reached at the end of apnea and was followed by a BP increase. Spontaneous SSR were absent during apnea episodes whereas sporadic responses were recorded after the apnea episodes when the breathing acts were wide and prolonged. In conclusion, central apnea caused an increase in MSA and minor increase in HR leading to a BP increase following the apnea episode.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.
