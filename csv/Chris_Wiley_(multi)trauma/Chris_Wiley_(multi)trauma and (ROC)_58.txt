AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - Pregnancy in one of the most frequent physiological conditions associated with CTS. During 2000, the Italian CTS study group (participants: T.Carboni-San Benedetto del Tronto, S.Massi-San Giovanni Valdarno; M.Mondelli-Siena, A.Morini-Trento, D.Murasecco-Perugia, L.Padua-Roma, M.Romano-Palermo) studied the incidence of CTS in pregnancy in women enrolled in 7 Italian centers. CTS was diagnosed clinically in 62% and neurophysiologically in 43% of women. During 2001, 12 and 15 month follow-up evaluation was performed. The aims were to evaluate: 1) evolution of CTS after delivery and lactation; 2) predictive value of electrodiagnostic assessment and clinical picture at the time of the first diagnosis. An extensive and complete description of the study design was previously reported. Evolution was assessed on the following CTS severity measurements: SYMPT, FUNCT, PAIN, Hi-Ob and neurophysiologic class. Overall, at follow up, 20 of 37 women (54%) who presented clinical CTS at first evaluation had clinical CTS. All patient-oriented measurements showed significant improvement of CTS. Conversely, neurophysiologic findings did not differ between baseline and follow-up. Although CTS severity measurements improved at follow-up, more than half of women with CTS symptoms during pregnancy complained of CTS symptoms one year after delivery. Moreover, the onset of symptoms during pregnancy was the most predictive factor for untreated CTS evolution. All patient-oriented and clinical measurements showed that an earlier onset of symptoms was a negative prognostic factor. According to the neurophysiologic evolution, weight gain appeared predictive: an higher gain implied a lower probability of improvement at follow-up examination.

AB  - A 26-year-old woman acutely developed bilateral sensory symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Neurophysiological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of CTS (severe at right and moderate at left hand). Because of the severity of the CTS in young patients without evident causes, we asked some further investigations in order to find a primary disease that might cause CTS. Endocrinological studies revealed a Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism. She was treated for the thyroiditis with improvement of thyroid function and entrapment syndrome. Neurophysiological controls confirmed the progressive improvement of CTS. The current case suggests to look for subclinical endocrinological disease when severe CTS is found in young patients without mechanical stress condition (work or hobby).

AB  - Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) is a myopathy causing asymmetric proximal and distal limb muscle involvement in patients over 50 years. Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neuron in the spinal cord and brainstem, characterized by progressive muscle weakness resulting in paralysis. The pathogenesis of cell injury in both diseases is still unknown: several hypothesis have been proposed addressing viral, autoimmunity, genetic and oxidation stress factors. We report on 2 cases with clinical presentation of upper and/or lower motor neuron involvement and histopathological diagnosis of IBM. Case 1: a 68 years old man with an 18-month history of progressive weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia. Neurological examination showed generalized muscle weakness, wasting of the finger flexors and quadriceps, fasciculations, deep tendon hyperreflexia. Electromyography (EMG) showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at limbs and tongue muscles. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced cMAP amplitude at the legs, Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) revealed marked pyramidal tract involvement. Blood examination showed increased E.S.R. with normal level of serum creatinine kinase, copper, ceruloplasmin, and iron. Antiganglioside antibodies titer was normal and blood lactate analysis showed normal values during exercise. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed increased protein level. Brain magnetic resonance imaging disclosed of involvement of the cortico-spinal tract and deposits of paramagnetic material in the basal ganglia with normal dopaminergic receptorial SPECT binding. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with ?rimmed vacuoles?. Case 2: a 64 years old woman with 20 month history of muscle weakness slowly progressing from upper to lower limbs. Neurological examination showed distal muscle weakness and wasting at the upper limbs, deep tendon hypo-areflexia. EMG showed neurogenic signs and fasciculations at four limbs. MEP and nerve conduction studies were normal but H reflex and F late responses were absent. E.S.R. was increased, while antiganglioside antibodies titer, thyroid hormones dosage and CSF examination were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed a neurogenic myopathy with rare ?rimmed vacuoles?. These case reports, although not nosologically defined, confirm the clinical variability of the IBM and rise questions on the possible mechanisms of neuronal damage in motor neuron syndromes.

AB  - Mutations in a gene encoding a novel protein of unknown function, the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1), are associated with one of the autosomal recessive forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT4A). Mutations in GDAP1 can cause both axonal and demyelinating inherited peripheral neuropathies. The GDAP1 gene maps on chromosome 8q21.1, encompassing 13.9?kb of genomic DNA. The coding sequence is comprised of six exons. Little is known about the function of GDAP1. The mouse homologue Gdap1 is highly expressed in brain. Northern-blot analysis showed that GDAP1 is also expressed in peripheral nerves, both in neurons and in Schwann cells. A series of Italian patients with demyelinating (n?=?42) and axonal (n?=?39) peripheral neuropathy with possible recessive inheritance was screened for mutations in the GDAP1 gene. The entire coding region, including exon-intron boundaries, was examined by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing. All patients were negative for the 17p11.2 duplication and for mutations in the MPZ, GJB1, PMP22 and EGR2 genes. SSCP analysis showed a few electrophoretic variants, in the exon 1, exon 3 and exon 4, respectively. Direct sequencing demonstrated the presence of a common single nucleotide polymorphism in the exon 4 (c.507T?>?G) and a nucleotide substitution in the exon 3. The latter was found in four patients, belonging to three families, and was not detected in a series of normal subjects. Further studies are in progress to evaluate the possible role of this variant in the pathophysiology of the disease. This work was partially supported by grants MURST 2000 to F.A. and Ministero della Sanità to P.M.

AB  - Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, characterized by rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic or nuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions. Clinical features are proximal and/or distal weakness, frequent muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia and poor responsiveness to steroid treatment. The involvement of peripheral nerve in both sporadic and familial IBM is a debated issue. Among six cases (five men; age range: 65?82?yrs.) of muscle biopsy proven sporadic IBM, we found variable neuropathic changes. Myogenic/neurogenic mixed EMG pattern was detected in four patients. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies showed abnormalities consistent with axonal multiple mononeuropathy in three and with axonal polyneuropathy in two patients, whereas one subject had no neurogenic findings. However, the degree of peripheral nerve impairment was usually mild and not related to severity of myopathy. Sural nerve biopsy was performed in the case with more prominent clinical and electrophysiological polyneuropathy. Moderate homogeneous loss of myelinated fibers, with recurrent regeneration clusters and atrophic/degenerating axons were observed. No segmental demyelination was present. In spite of marked inflammatory changes in muscle, neither mononuclear cell infiltrates nor filamentous inclusions were detected in nerve. Similarly, whereas paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions were observed in muscle, minor but recurrent mitochondrial changes were detected in nerve. Muscle mitochondrial abnormalities have been reported about twice in IBM compared with other inflammatory myopathies. A relation of this finding with high incidence of associated peripheral neuropathy in IBM and mitochondrial myopathies has been hypothesized. On the other hand, the follow-up of our patients shows improvement of nerve conduction values in clinically responders to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, suggesting a significant role of immune processes for the pathogenesis of nerve damage in IBM.

AB  - Demyelination and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation are hallmarks of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies, of which Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 A (CMT1A) neuropathy is the typical example. In CMT1A, an altered dosage of the PMP22 gene determines a defect of myelination and an abnormal SC phenotype, characterized by hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family of proteins, including EGF and neuregulins, and their receptors, namely EGFr and the erbB family, control growth and development of SC. Their expression in mature SC is down-regulated but, during Wallerian degeneration or chemical myelinolysis, these receptors are transiently over-expressed, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. On the other hand, neuregulin 1 inhibits SC myelination and induces demyelination and SC dedifferentiation and proliferation. These effects might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies. We have therefore immunolocalized EGF, EGFr and the erbB receptors (erbB 2, 3 and 4) in sural nerve biopsies from patients with CMT1A as compared to chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) nerve biopsies and to normal nerves, in order to evaluate if the expression of these molecules is up- or down-regulated in these disorders. Among CMT1A nerves, immunoreactivity for EGF, EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 was moderately to markedly increased in SC, particularly in onion bulbs, in most cases, while a mild to moderate expression of erbB 4 in SC cytoplasm was observed in a few cases. On the other hand in CIDP, which shares with CMT1A histopathological features such as de-remyelination and SC hyperplasia, only the expression of erbB 3 was up-regulated in a minority of cases. Since in SC the functional neuregulin receptor is a heterodimer, composed by erbB2 and erbB3, the parallel up-regulation of these two molecules in CMT1A may bear a functional significance. This would be confirmed if an overexpression of neuregulins could be demonstrated, along with our finding of an increased expression of EGF and its receptor. In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that, in CMT1A, a persistent activation of neuregulin signaling pathways not only is indicative of SC dedifferentiation but also may contribute to demyelination and onion bulb formation or maintenance.

AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - ABSTRACT The recently proposed Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) represent a first step toward a uniform definition of PD-MCI across multiple clinical and research settings. However, several questions regarding specific criteria remain unanswered, including optimal cutoff scores by which to define impairment on neuropsychological tests. Seventy-six non-demented PD patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and were classified as PD-MCI or PD with normal cognition (PD-NC). The concordance of PD-MCI diagnosis by MDS Task Force Level II criteria (comprehensive assessment), using a range of standard deviation (SD) cutoff scores, was compared with our consensus diagnosis of PD-MCI or PD-NC. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were examined for each cutoff score. PD-MCI subtype classification and distribution of cognitive domains impaired were evaluated. Concordance for PD-MCI diagnosis was greatest for defining impairment on neuropsychological tests using a 2 SD cutoff score below appropriate norms. This cutoff also provided the best discriminatory properties for separating PD-MCI from PD-NC compared with other cutoff scores. With the MDS PD-MCI criteria, multiple domain impairment was more frequent than single domain impairment, with predominant executive function, memory, and visuospatial function deficits. Application of the MDS Task Force PD-MCI Level II diagnostic criteria demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity at a 2 SD cutoff score. The predominance of multiple domain impairment in PD-MCI with the Level II criteria suggests not only influences of testing abnormality requirements, but also the widespread nature of cognitive deficits within PD-MCI. ? 2013 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are successfully used as immunomodulatory therapy in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) but their mechanism of action remains unknown. An anti-idiotypic block of pathogenic autoantibodies has been often postulated even if other possible mechanisms, including a modulation of the release of various cytokines, have been proposed. To evaluate the expression of cytokines in patients with MMN and their possible modulation by IVIg, we determined circulating levels of TNFα, INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12 by ELISA in serum samples of 17 patients with MMN and compared them with 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 with multiple sclerosis (MS), 6 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 5 with myasthenia gravis (MG) and 12 healthy controls (NS). Comparable levels of INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10 and IL12 were detected in patients? sera and controls. Even if TNFα levels did not differ significantly among patients? groups, they were higher than in any healthy control (mean?±?SD 1.2?±?0.5?pg/ml, range 0.7?2.4?pg/ml), in 12 (70%) MMN patients (mean?±?SD 3.6?±?1.9?pg/ml; range 0.2?7.5?pg/ml), all ALS, 3 MS (25%), 2 CIDP (40%) and 2 MG (40%). We then measured the concentration of TNFα before and after IVIg therapy in 9 MMN and 2 ALS patients. In all but one MMN patients, circulating levels of TNFα slightly increased after treatment with IVIg (mean values 4.3 vs. 7.2?pg/ml) and decreased 3 weeks after therapy while in both ALS patients they decreased or remained unchanged. No detectable level of TNFα was found in IVIg preparation. This study shows that, similarly to what previously reported in other autoimmune neuropathy as GBS and CIDP, TNFα serum levels are slightly increased in MMN but, at odds with what reported in these disease, their concentration tend to increase parallel to clinical improvement after IVIg therapy. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenetic implication of this finding and in particular whether a possible deviation from a presumably Th2 to a Th1 immune response may help explaining the effect of IVIg in MMN.

AB  - We studied the effect of chronic compression of median nerve at wrist on cutaneous innervation. Two-mm punch biopsies were obtained from third fingertip in 40 patients (32 female and 8 male, age range 30?74 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with diabetes and other metabolic or endocrinological disorders or with electrophysiological findings of a diffuse neuropathy were excluded. By means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy we counted epidermal nerve fibers, Meissner corpuscles and myelinated papillary endings. All patients underwent electrophysiological study and quantitative sensory testing using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for tactile threshold and Medoc TSA II Neurosensory analyzer for thermal threshold evaluation. Morphological and functional data were compared with age and sex matched controls. We observed abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers, mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents in all patients. These abnormalities ranged from mild to marked and appeared more severe in patients with a longer disease duration and a slower conduction velocity along the median nerve.
