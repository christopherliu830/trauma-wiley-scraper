AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Behçet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.

AB  - Platinum compounds are very effective anti-cancer agents and act forming adducts with DNA and cytoplasmic proteins. Their main dose-limiting side effect is peripheral neurotoxicity. Cisplatin neurotoxicity has been studied in many in vitro and in vivo models but little information is available for oxaliplatin. In this study we evaluated and compared the effect of cisplatin and oxaliplatin (a gift from Debiopharm S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in an in vitro model of neurotoxicity using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which may be considered as neuroblasts. Both platinum compounds are toxic and induce cellular death by apoptosis. Oxaliplatin is less neurotoxic than cisplatin. Concentrations of oxaliplatin 3?4 times higher than those of cisplatin are necessary to induce the same percentage of cellular death. We analyzed the activation/inactivation of specific molecules involved in the apoptotic transduction pathway. After exposure to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and thus could not exert its anti-apoptotic action. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, caspase 3, and caspase 7 were activated. In our experiments in SH-SY5Y cells treated with cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the amount of p53 protein was markedly increased. In treated cultures, both caspase 3 and 7 were cleaved with the appearance of their active fragments which induced PARP cleavage. Our results suggest that neurotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin share a similar pathway. Neurotoxicity induced by platinum compounds is due not only to DNA damage but also to the activation of specific molecular pathways committing cells to apoptosis.

AB  - A 69-year-old right-handed man was recently referred to our institution with a two-month history of diplopia and ptosis in his left eye: the ocular symptoms typically fluctuates during the day, being least severe in the morning and worsening as the day progress or while reading or driving. Neostigmine injection produced a clear improvement of weakness. The serum concentration of anti-AChR antibody was elevated >?8.4?nmol/L (NV?<?0.4); a chest CT scan was unremarkable with no evidence of mediastinal mass. The clinical picture and laboratory tests support the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia. His past medical history was insignificant until the age of 59. At that time, he complained with a diffuse, slightly asymmetrical muscle weakness both in the upper and lower limbs and sensory symptoms of glove and stocking distribution (numbness). A progressive course over months was seen with hand and anterior leg muscles hypertrophy becoming evident. Strength was decreased distally greater than proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. The cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a protein level of 72?mg/dl (NV?<?45?mg/dl). Nerve conduction study showed a multifocal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with both conduction block/temporal dispersion of the C-MAP and slowing of the velocity. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered and the patient was treated with steroids, plasmapheresis and azathiaprine: after a slight improvement, the condition has been stabilized. Both MG and CIDP have been individually associated with disorders of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis. Their concurrence is rarely found (less than 10 cases to the best of our knowledge): although the existence of this syndrome can be strongly supported by the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory data, a common basic abnormality of immune regulation is still unknown.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Ischemia-reperfusion injury impacts early liver graft function. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) as early as at reperfusion has shown to predict in-hospital complications, but its impact on vascular complications and long-term outcomes is not ascertained. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on all consecutive patients transplanted during a 6-year period to define significant early systemic inflammatory response (ESIR). The main end-point was 3-year graft survival. Significant ESIR was defined according to IL-6 level at reperfusion on an exploratory set of 121 patients and validated on an independent cohort (n = 153). Results Significant ESIR was defined as IL-6 at reperfusion >1000 ng/mL in the exploratory cohort. Three-year graft and overall survival were lower in patients with ESIR in the determination set (P = 0.001 and 0.045, respectively). This was confirmed in the validation set (P = 0.045 and 0.027). In patients with high cytolysis, IL-6 identified patients at risk for arterial thrombosis. The main determinants for IL-6 level were intragraft lactate level, cold ischemia time, and anhepatic phase duration (P = 0.005). IL-6 level independently predicted graft survival (P = 0.0003). Conclusions IL-6 at reperfusion is a valid biomarker to predict long-term survival. Furthermore, it helps the interpretation of cytolysis in the prediction of early vascular complications.

AB  - ABSTRACT The recently proposed Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) represent a first step toward a uniform definition of PD-MCI across multiple clinical and research settings. However, several questions regarding specific criteria remain unanswered, including optimal cutoff scores by which to define impairment on neuropsychological tests. Seventy-six non-demented PD patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and were classified as PD-MCI or PD with normal cognition (PD-NC). The concordance of PD-MCI diagnosis by MDS Task Force Level II criteria (comprehensive assessment), using a range of standard deviation (SD) cutoff scores, was compared with our consensus diagnosis of PD-MCI or PD-NC. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were examined for each cutoff score. PD-MCI subtype classification and distribution of cognitive domains impaired were evaluated. Concordance for PD-MCI diagnosis was greatest for defining impairment on neuropsychological tests using a 2 SD cutoff score below appropriate norms. This cutoff also provided the best discriminatory properties for separating PD-MCI from PD-NC compared with other cutoff scores. With the MDS PD-MCI criteria, multiple domain impairment was more frequent than single domain impairment, with predominant executive function, memory, and visuospatial function deficits. Application of the MDS Task Force PD-MCI Level II diagnostic criteria demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity at a 2 SD cutoff score. The predominance of multiple domain impairment in PD-MCI with the Level II criteria suggests not only influences of testing abnormality requirements, but also the widespread nature of cognitive deficits within PD-MCI. ? 2013 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society
