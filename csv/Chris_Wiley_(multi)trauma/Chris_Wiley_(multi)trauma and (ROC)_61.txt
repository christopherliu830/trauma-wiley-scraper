AB  - Abstract pLT is a highly standardized therapy for children with end-stage liver disease and liver-based metabolic diseases. However, NCs after transplantation occur and especially younger children are considered as more vulnerable and susceptible to NCs. Up to now, detailed data particularly for the very young age group do not exist. We therefore retrospectively studied NCs in children after pLT under age of 24 months. Forty children aged between 19 days and 22 months were evaluated according to type of NC and potential risk factors. NCs occurred in 8/40 patients (20%). All experienced new-onset seizures and in 1/6 surviving patients, seizures evolved into epilepsy. Other NCs were intracerebral abscess (1/8 patients) and subdural hemorrhage (1/8 patients). The overall 3-year mortality rate was 10% (4/40 patients). Significant risk factors for NCs and therefore seizures were HAT (P = 0.020), total surgery time (P = 0.009), retransplantation (P < 0.001), period of catecholamine therapy (P = 0.024), period of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.014), and period of sedation (P = 0.010). Our study is the first to provide detailed information on NCs after pLT in children under 24 months of age. The incidence of NCs in this particular group of very young patients was not increased compared to previously published data of children of all ages. Main NC was new-onset seizure. In the surviving infants, prognosis of seizure was excellent and the risk of developing epilepsy was low. Even more, the occurrence of NCs did not significantly affect mortality or survival in this particular age group.

AB  - Objective The clock drawing test (CDT) is a widely used cognitive screening tool that has been well accepted among clinicians and patients for its ease of use and short administration time. Although there is ample interest in the CDT as a screening instrument, there remains a range of CDT administration and scoring systems with no consensus on which system produces the most valid results while remaining user friendly. The aims of this review are to synthesize the available evidence on CDT scoring systems' effectiveness and to recommend which system is best suited for use at the clinical frontlines. Design A Pubmed literature search was carried out from 2000 to 2013 including manual cross-referencing of bibliographies in order to capture studies published after Shulman's comprehensive review published in 2000. A brief summary of all original scoring systems is included, as well as a review of relevant comparative studies. Results The consensus from multiple comparison studies suggests that increasing the complexity of CDT scoring systems does little to enhance the test's ability to identify significant cognitive impairment. Moreover, increased complexity in scoring adds to the administration time, thereby reducing the test's utility in clinical settings. Conclusions In comparing scoring systems, no system emerged as consistently superior in terms of predictive validity. The authors conclude that when scoring the CDT as a screening instrument in a primary/general medicine/community setting, simpler is better, and perhaps qualitative assessment of ?normal? versus ?abnormal? may be sufficient for screening purposes and the establishment of a baseline for follow-up.
