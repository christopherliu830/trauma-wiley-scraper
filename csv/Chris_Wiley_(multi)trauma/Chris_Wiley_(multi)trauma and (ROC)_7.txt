AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives:? Coronary artery disease (CAD), as the leading cause of death, poses a huge economic burden on health-care systems. We used a multi-marker approach to explore discriminative abilities of several lipid, inflammatory, and oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers as CAD predictors. We assessed their cost-effectiveness compared with the Framingham risk score (FRS). Methods:? Using a decision model, we evaluated the costs, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of each model. The FRS was used as the baseline model. Other models were formed with the consecutive addition of selected markers: apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein B (apoB), apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] isoform, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (SOD), sulfhydryl, and superoxide anion (O2-). A best-case model was formed from a combination of diagnostic markers to yield the best patient stratification algorithm. All models were assessed by their predictive probabilities using receiver operating characteristic curves. To accomplish our goals, we recruited 188 CAD patients (verified by coronary angiography) and 197 asymptomatic CAD-free subjects for comparison. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. Results:? Only two strategies had outstanding discriminative abilities: the best-case model (FRS, SOD, and O2-) and FRS plus SOD with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.924 and 0.906, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratio varied between ?593 per AUC for the baseline model to ?2425 per AUC for FRS plus apo(a) isoform. Strategies involving oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers were more cost-effective than strategies involving lipid or inflammatory markers. All results were robust. Conclusion:? Our results support the feasibility of a multimarker approach for CAD screening. The introduction of oxidative stress/antioxidative defense markers in the clinical laboratory would be convenient and cost-effective.

AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Abstract Emerging research has provided support for the use of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scales in developing countries; however, this research has yet to be extended to southern Africa. This study sought to evaluate the performance of the Kessler scales in screening for depression and anxiety disorders in the South African population. The scales along with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) were included in the South African Stress and Health study, a nationally representative household survey. The K10/K6 demonstrated moderate discriminating ability in detecting depression and anxiety disorders in the general population; evidenced by area under the receiver operating curves of 0.73 and 0.72 respectively. However, both scales failed to meet our acceptability criteria of high sensitivity and high positive predictive value. Examinations of differences in responding by race/ethnicity revealed that the K10/K6 [Kessler Psychological Distress Scale 10-item (K10) and the abbreviated six-item (K6)] had significantly lower discriminating ability with respect to depression and anxiety disorders among the Black group (0.71) than among the combined minority race/ethnic groups of White, Colored, and Indian/Asian (0.78; p?=?0.016). The difference in time period assessed on the K10/K6 (past 30?days) versus the CIDI (past 12?months) was a notable limitation of this study. Additional validation studies using clinician diagnostic instruments are recommended. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background The Choosing Wisely campaign has called for better engagement of palliative and hospice care services for patients in the emergency department (ED). PREDICT is a clinical prediction tool that was derived in an Australian ED cohort. It assesses a patient's risk of mortality at 1 year to select those who would benefit from advanced care planning. Such goals-of-care discussion can improve patients? ability to communicate what they want out of their healthcare and, in cases of end of life, potentially reduce the number of futile interventions. Using a cutoff of 13 points, PREDICT had a reported 95.3% specificity and 53.9% sensitivity for 1-year mortality. We externally validated PREDICT and derived a simpler modified PREDICT tool to systematically identify high-risk patients eligible for goals-of-care discussions and palliative care consultation in the ED. Methods This was an observational cohort study of a random sample of 927 patients aged 55+ seen in the ED in 2014. We identified advance healthcare directives (AHDs) on file. We summarized diagnostic accuracy of the clinical tool to predict 1-year mortality using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). We refined PREDICT using multivariable modeling. We followed reporting guidelines including STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) for cohort studies and Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD). Results A total of 927 patients were included: 55.0% were male, 63 (7.0%) were nursing home residents, 389 (42.0%) patients had an AHD in their medical record at the time of ED visit, and 245 (26.4%) were deceased at 1 year. Of the 780 patients with PREDICT scores < 13, a total of 164 (21.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.3?24.1) were deceased at 1 year, and of the 147 patients with PREDICT scores ≥ 13, a total of 81 (55.1%; 95% CI = 46.7?63.2) were deceased at 1 year. The AUC of the PREDICT score was 0.717 (95% CI = 0.680?0.754), sensitivity was 33.1% (95% CI = 27.3?39.4), and specificity was 90.3% (95% CI = 87.8?92.4) to predict 1-year mortality. The modified PREDICT tool resulted in an AUC of 0.709 (95% CI = 0.671?0.747). We decided to select this model as the preferred model, as the variable of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with multiorgan failure can be difficult to assess in the ED and may delay advanced care planning. Reweighting the score did not improve fit or the AUC, so points assigned to each variable were not adjusted. Conclusion PREDICT is an easy tool to administer to be able to identify patients who are at high risk of 1-year mortality and who could benefit from AHDs, goals-of-care discussion, and when appropriate in the context of an end-of-life setting, palliative medicine consultation. External validation of PREDICT was successful in our population. We simplified PREDICT and derived a new tool, the modified PREDICT minus ICU tool, without significantly altering the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for death at 1 year. The next steps include external validation of the newly derived rule and prospective implementation.
