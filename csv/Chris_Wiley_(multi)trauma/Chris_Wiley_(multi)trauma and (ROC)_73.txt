AB  - Abstract We have previously demonstrated that sickle cell disease (SCD) patients maintain normal global systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output. However, ischemic end-organ injury remains common suggesting that tissue oxygen delivery may be impaired by microvascular dysregulation or damage. To test this hypothesis, we performed fingertip laser Doppler flowmetry measurements at the base of the nailbed and regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) on the dorsal surface of the same hand. This was done during flow mediated dilation (FMD) studies in 26 chronically transfused SCD, 75 non-transfused SCD, and 18 control subjects. Chronically transfused SCD patients were studied prior to and following a single transfusion and there was no acute change in rSO2 or perfusion. Laser Doppler estimates of resting perfusion were 76% higher in non-transfused and 110% higher in transfused SCD patients, compared to control subjects. In contrast, rSO2 was 12 saturation points lower in non-transfused SCD patients, but normal in the transfused SCD patients. During cuff occlusion, rSO2 declined at the same rate in all subjects suggesting similar intrinsic oxygen consumption rates. Upon cuff release, laser doppler post occlusive hyperemia was blunted in SCD patients in proportion to their resting perfusion values. Transfusion therapy did not improve the hyperemia response. FMD was impaired in SCD subjects but partially ameliorated in transfused SCD subjects. Taken together, non-transfused SCD subjects demonstrate impaired conduit artery FMD, impaired microcirculatory post-occlusive hyperemia, and resting hypoxia in the hand despite compensated oxygen delivery, suggesting impaired oxygen supply-demand matching. Transfusion improves FMD and oxygen supply-demand matching but not microcirculation hyperemic response.

AB  - shyu y.-i.l., chen m.-c., wu c.-c. & cheng h.-s. (2010)?Family caregivers? needs predict functional recovery of older care recipients after hip fracture. Journal of Advanced Nursing?66(11), 2450?2459. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a report of a study of the effect of family caregivers? needs on the functional recovery of elders with a hip fracture during the first 6?months after discharge. Background.? Family members are closely involved in the postdischarge care of older Chinese patients. However, the influence of family caregiving-related variables, such as caregiver?s needs, on recovery after hip fracture has not been explored. Methods.? Data were collected between 2002 and 2005 with elders with hip fracture and their family caregivers at a medical centre in Taiwan. Data were collected at 1, 3 and 6?months after discharge, and 120 people completed all follow-ups. The effect of caregiver needs on elders? recovery was analysed using the generalized estimating equations approach. Findings.? Elders whose caregivers reported a need for information on caregiving and related health care were more likely (odds ratio?=?1·93, confidence interval?=?1·08?3·46) to recover their walking ability than those whose caregivers did not report such need. However, elders whose caregivers reported a need for social services were less likely to recover their walking ability (odds ratio?=?0·38, confidence interval?=?0·18?0·78), and activities of daily living (odds ratio?=?0·40, confidence interval?=?0·17?0·94) than those whose caregivers did not report such need. Conclusion.? Healthcare providers should include caregivers? needs in their clinical assessment of Chinese elders after surgery for hip fracture. Given the rapidly increasing population of Asian elders in Western countries, the results of this study may be applicable to other countries with Chinese populations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives To describe the case history and associated obstetric and neonatal outcomes of eight women who had their heroin dependency managed over pregnancy by naltrexone implant (two ? 1.8 g of naltrexone embedded in poly-DL-lactide acid) treatment. Method Case data on maternal management associated with naltrexone implant were collected at the Australian Medical Procedures Research Foundation, Perth, Australia and three Perth hospitals. Results Despite earlier instability on oral naltrexone and repeated relapses back to dependent heroin use these women, following treatment with naltrexone implant, remained heroin free throughout their pregnancies. Neonatal and obstetric outcomes were unremarkable. Conclusions This case series provides preliminary evidence that the pregnant heroin user can be managed by naltrexone implant without obvious risk to the mother or developing foetus. Importantly, the current case series suggests that the pregnant woman who finds it difficult to stabilise on oral naltrexone maintenance and returns to dependent heroin use may be managed using implantable naltrexone, thereby removing from her the onus for daily naltrexone medication compliance. The authors conclude that naltrexone implant may represent an important procedure for managing the pregnant heroin dependent patient who finds it difficult to shift away from her heroin use patterns. These preliminary findings require confirmation using a much larger controlled study.
