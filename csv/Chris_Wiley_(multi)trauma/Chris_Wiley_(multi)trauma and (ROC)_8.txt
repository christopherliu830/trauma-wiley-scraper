AB  - Summary.? Current diagnostic management of hemodynamically stable patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the accurate and rapid distinction between the approximate 20?25% of patients who have acute PE and require anticoagulant treatment, and the overall majority of patients who do not have the disease in question. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating PE to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in 20?40% of patients. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the first line tool to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with a likely probability of PE or an elevated D-dimer blood concentration. While single-row-detector technology CTPA has a low sensitivity for PE and bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) of the lower limbs is considered necessary to rule out PE, multi-row-detector CTPA is safe to exclude PE without the confirmatory use of CUS.

AB  - Introduction? Traumatic tricuspid regurgitation secondary to blunt chest trauma has been reported in literature. We report our experience with a case of ?Torrential Tricuspid Regurgitation? following permanent pacemaker lead extraction which was successfully treated with tricuspid valve repair and annuloplasty. Report? A 67 year old woman was treated for Sick sinus syndrome with permanent pacemaker implant. She had three generator changes for end of life and repositioning.Erosion of generator, led cardiologist to plan lead and generator extraction with the surgical backup. During lead extraction a small piece of papillary muscle was avulsed. The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the theatre. However in ward she developed right sided cardiac failure not responding to conservative therapy. A transthoracic echo (TTE) revealed torrential tricuspid regurgitation with a freely mobile posterior leaflet with attached chordae and avulsed papillary muscle.During surgery the tricuspid valve was successfully repaired and transesophageal (TOE) images showed trivial to mild tricuspid regurgitation at the end of repair procedure. Additional procedure also included ligation of both atrial appendages and implantation of epicardial leads and pacemaker. Patient made good recovery from operation. Conclusion? To the best of our knowledge this is first report of repair of tricuspid valve in ?Torrential Tricuspid Regurgitation? following pacemaker lead extraction. We share our experience with tricuspid valve repair technique and annuloplasty.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract The clubhouse model is a community psychiatric rehabilitation program aiming to provide a restorative environment for people with severe mental health problems. These clubhouses provide their members with opportunities for friendship, employment, and education, which help them on their paths towards mental health recovery. Towards that end, the model features clubhouse members and staff working side by side to execute clubhouse activities. That is, unlike most of the community mental health programs where staff provide services to their clients, clubhouse staff are required to partner with members in their work. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand how the clubhouse staff elicited member participation and facilitate recovery. The research was conducted between Year 2013 and Year 2014 at the world's first clubhouse: Fountain House in New York City. The first author conducted 262 hr of active participant observation in 41 visits to Fountain House, and in-depth interviews with 38 staff members who had worked at Fountain House for at least 1 month during the study period. The dimensional analysis procedure was used to analyse the observation notes and interview transcripts. Results showed that participation was a key to rebuilding members? self-confidence, which further encouraged members to seek more opportunities for self-enhancement and personal growth. Specific organisational policies, programming, practical considerations, and other strategies shaped a positive environment for members to exercise autonomy, experience self-efficacy, and model behaviours after others who have succeeded. Findings of this research support the egalitarian staff?member relationships and the maintenance of an open and transparent atmosphere of the clubhouse, as observational learning enables members to move forward with their journeys to recovery. Findings also may inform efforts to shift traditional psychiatric services towards recovery-oriented care.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? We examined whether a previously validated verbal dyspnoea rating scale, and/or other demographic and clinical parameters, could predict ED departure status, among ED patients presenting with shortness of breath. Methods:? In this prospective observational study, a convenience sample of patients presenting to an inner urban adult tertiary hospital ED with shortness of breath were assessed at triage using objective and subjective breathlessness parameters. These included respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and verbal dyspnoea scores. A verbal dyspnoea score for worst dyspnoea during the current episode and basic demographic and presentation characteristics were also collected. These variables were assessed as predictors of ED departure status (inpatient admission or ED discharge) using logistic regression. Results:? From a sample of 253 participants, verbal dyspnoea scores ≥8 predicted inpatient admission 89% specificity (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.1?93.4), and scores ≤3 predicted discharge with 95% specificity (95% CI 89.5?98.0). For patients with shortness of breath as the primary complaint, the combination of verbal dyspnoea score ≥6, heart rate ≥94?bpm at triage and ambulance arrival predicted admission with 90% sensitivity (95% CI 82?95%) and 84% specificity (95% CI 73?92%). These same variables predicted admission for all patients with 84% sensitivity (95% CI 75.8?89.2) and 79% specificity (95% CI 71.5?85.5). Conclusion:? Verbal dyspnoea score, alone and in combination with heart rate and arrival transport, can accurately predict admission. Once validated they might be useful in assessing, prioritizing and making rapid site of care decisions for breathless patients presenting to the ED.

AB  - Background Admission lactate and lactate clearance are implemented for risk stratification in sepsis and trauma. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results regarding outcome and lactate are conflicting. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management trial in which 950 unconscious patents after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to a temperature intervention of 33°C or 36°C. Serial lactate samples during the first 36 hours were collected. Admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and the clearance of lactate within 12 hours after admission were analyzed and the association with 30-day mortality assessed. Results Samples from 877 patients were analyzed. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for death by day 30 for each mmol/L was 1.12 (1.08-1.16) for admission lactate, P < .01, 1.21 (1.12-1.31) for 12-hour lactate, P < .01, and 1.003 (1.00-1.01) for each percentage point increase in 12-hour lactate clearance, P = .03. Only admission lactate and 12-hour lactate levels remained significant after adjusting for known predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (0.61-0.69), P < .001, 0.61 (0.57-0.65), P < .001, and 0.53 (0.49-0.57), P = .15 for admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and 12-hour lactate clearance, respectively. Conclusions Admission lactate and 12-hour lactate values were independently associated with 30-day mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while 12-hour lactate clearance was not. The clinical value of lactate as the sole predictor of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is, however, limited.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Background Endoscopic Draf 2B and Draf 3 frontal sinusotomies are frequently performed for chronic refractory frontal rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between Draf 2B and Draf 3 procedures. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing patients undergoing bilateral Draf 2B vs Draf 3 procedures from 2000 to 2016. Patients with neoplasia, dysplasia, mucocele, cystic fibrosis, or ciliary dyskinesia were excluded. Preoperative disease parameters included number of prior surgeries, presence of polyps, preoperative 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score, frontal Lund-Mackay score, anterior-posterior diameter of the frontal ostium, and Global Osteitis Scoring Scale (GOSS). Postoperative outcomes included SNOT-22 score, neo-ostium patency, surgical revision rates, and complications. Results A total of 21 patients with bilateral Draf 2B and 17 patients with Draf 3 surgeries were compared. Mean follow-up time was 15.6 months. No significant differences were seen between groups for any preoperative disease parameter. Both cohorts showed statistically significant (p = 0.0001 [Draf 2B]; p = 0.0001 [Draf 3]) and clinically meaningful (? = 24.1; ? = 24.9) improvements in SNOT-22 at last follow-up vs preoperatively. The Draf 2B group had greater improvement in SNOT-22 score than the Draf 3 group at 1 to 3 months (p = 0.003), but the magnitude of improvement equalized at 5 to 9 months (p = 0.66) and last follow-up (p = 0.90). No significant differences were noted between groups regarding patency, revision rates, or complications. Conclusion Both Draf 2B and Draf 3 procedures offer durable symptomatic improvement for patients with refractory frontal CRS. The Draf 2B is associated with earlier postoperative symptom improvement and overall shows comparable long-term outcomes to the Draf 3 sinusotomy.

AB  - Abstract Objective Prognostic models are commonly used in the clinical setting. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the Rapid Emergency Medical Score (REMS) or alternate models. Methods A retrospective cohort study of critical care patients who underwent retrieval service transfer to an ICU in a single state-wide service in Victoria, Australia. All patients aged 18 years and over transferred to an ICU between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013. Retrieval and ICU datasets were probabilistically linked. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the capacity of physiological markers and patient characteristics to predict in-hospital mortality in the ICU population. The prediction performance was evaluated using measures of discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (Hosmer?Lemeshow [H-L statistic]?). Results There were 1776 ICU patients who were transferred and 1749 (98.5%) had complete data. Of the 1749 patients with complete data, 257 (14.7%) died in-hospital. The REMS calculated at the time of retrieval referral demonstrated borderline predictive capability (C-statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.62?0.76). Following logistic regression analysis of the REMS components, final variables included in the Retrieval REMS model were age, mean arterial pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale score. This model demonstrated acceptable predictive capability (C-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.64?0.79). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) Retrieval REMS for survivors and non-survivors, respectively, were 7 (5, 10) and 9 (7, 11), P < 0.01. Conclusions The availability of a validated tool such as Retrieval REMS assists recognition of high-risk patients and consideration of this risk in retrieval mission planning and response.
