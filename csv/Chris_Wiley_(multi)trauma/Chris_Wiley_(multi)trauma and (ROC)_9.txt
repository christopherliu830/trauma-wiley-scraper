AB  - Objective To report prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes for presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnosed among an emergency-care population of UK dogs. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design using emergency-care veterinary clinical records from the VetCompass Programme spanning September 1, 2012 to February 28, 2014 and risk factor analysis using multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The study population comprised 77,088 dogs attending 50 Vets Now clinics. Overall, 492 dogs had presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnoses, giving a prevalence of 0·64% (95% Confidence interval: 0·58 to 0·70%). Compared with cross-bred dogs, breeds with the highest odds ratios for the diagnosis of presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus were the great Dane (odds ratio: 114·3, 95% Confidence interval 55·1 to 237·1, P<0·001), akita (odds ratio: 84·4, 95% Confidence interval 33·6 to 211·9, P<0·001) and dogue de Bordeaux (odds ratio: 82·9, 95% Confidence interval 39·0 to 176·3, P<0·001). Odds increased as dogs aged up to 12 years and neutered male dogs had 1·3 (95% Confidence interval 1·0 to 1·8, P=0·041) times the odds compared with entire females. Of the cases that were presented alive, 49·7% survived to discharge overall, but 79·3% of surgical cases survived to discharge. Clinical Significance Approximately 80% of surgically managed cases survived to discharge. Certain large breeds were highly predisposed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to validate a newly developed tool for predicting the risk of recurrence within 12 months of a venous leg ulcer healing. Performance of the tool to predict recurrence within a 12-month period was assessed using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) analysis. Multi-site retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies were undertaken to validate a risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers within 12?months. In the retrospective study (n =?250), 55% of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months, and the risk assessment total score had excellent discrimination and goodness of fit with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90, P <?.001). The prospective study (n =?143) observed that 50.4% (n =?63) of venous leg ulcers recurred within 12?months of healing. Participants were classified using the risk assessment tool as being at low risk (28%), moderate risk (59%), and high risk (13%); the proportion of wounds recurring at 12?months was 15%, 61%, and 67% for each group, respectively. Validation results indicated good discrimination and goodness of fit, with an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82, P <?.001). Validation of this risk assessment tool for the recurrence of venous leg ulcers provides clinicians with a resource to identify high-risk patients and to guide decisions on adjunctive, tailored interventions to address the specific risk factors to decrease the risk of recurrence.

AB  - Background Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cardiovascular co-morbidities hasten the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or accelerate its course. Methods To evaluate the utility of cerebral vascular physical function and/or condition parameters as potential systemic indicators of AD, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound was used to assess cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance of the 16 arterial segments comprising the circle of Willis and its major tributaries. Results Our study showed that decreased arterial mean flow velocity and increased pulsatility index are associated with a clinical diagnosis of presumptive AD. Cerebral blood flow impairment shown by these parameters reflects the global hemodynamic and structural consequences of a multifaceted disease process yielding diffuse congestive microvascular pathology, increased arterial rigidity, and decreased arterial compliance, combined with putative age-associated cardiovascular output declines. Conclusions TCD evaluation offers direct physical confirmation of brain perfusion impairment and might ultimately provide a convenient and a noninvasive means to assess the efficacy of medical interventions on cerebral blood flow or reveal incipient AD. In the near term, TCD-based direct assessments of brain perfusion might offer the prospect of preventing or mitigating AD simply by revealing patients who would benefit from interventions to improve circulatory system function.

AB  - Objectives To identify the incidence, risk factors and presenting signs of lymphoma in dogs presenting to primary-care practice in the UK using analysis of data within the VetCompass? programme. Materials and Methods Case records from the VetCompass? programme from primary-care practices in the UK were searched for newly diagnosed lymphoma in dogs within a 1-year period: 2013. Diagnosis was based on clinical records with or without laboratory confirmation. Signalment was evaluated as risk factors for lymphoma diagnosis using multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 286 presumed newly diagnosed cases identified during 2013 from 455,553 dogs (overall incidence risk 63 of 100,000 dogs per year) of which 193 (67%) were laboratory confirmed (42 of 100,000 dogs per year). Advanced age, dogs older than 12?years, dogs weighing more than 30?kg and some specific breeds were significantly associated with lymphoma diagnosis. Only 18 dogs (6%) of the population identified were referred to a specialist clinic. Clinical Significance This study concurs with others that age, bodyweight and breed are significant risk factors for lymphoma. Results of this study highlight: (1) the low number of dogs with lymphoma that are referred to specialists in the UK and (2) that few dogs undergo immunophenotyping (which can carry prognostic importance), emphasising the importance of epidemiological programmes that evaluate diseases presented to primary-care veterinarians.

AB  - Abstract Aim CHA2DS2-VASc score has been proven to have great prognostic value in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We aimed to determine whether the addition of renal dysfunction in the CHA2DS2-VASc score would improve the prognostic impact of the scoring system to predict prognosis among ACS patients. Methods A total of 3031 ACS patients were prospectively enrolled at 39 hospitals and followed for 1 year. The patients were divided into three groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (group 1, eGFR>90; group 2, eGFR between 60 and 90; and group 3, eGFR<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The occurrence of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death was recorded. Results As renal function progressively decreased from group 1 to 3, the patients were, respectively older and had higher incidence of comorbidity, worse Killip classification, and less evidence-based medical therapies. The rate of subsequent MI, stroke or death increased from 3.4% in group 1 to 7.4% in group 2 and 17.2% in group 3 (P?< 0.001). Renal dysfunction (eGFR<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were both significant predictors of adverse events in multivariable regression analyses. Renal dysfunction can further stratify patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1 into 3 groups with different adverse event rates (group 1, 3.0%; group 2, 4.1%; and group 3, 9.2%, P?< 0.001). A new scoring system (R-CHA2DS2-VASc score) derived by assigning one more point for eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 to the CHA2DS2-VASc score could improve its predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.70 vs. 0.66, P?< 0.001). Conclusions Renal dysfunction is a significant risk factor of future adverse events in ACS patients and may improve the prognostic impact of the CHA2DS2-VASc score.

AB  - Abstract Title. Pressure ulcer risk in long-term units: prevalence and associated factors Aim.? This paper is a report of a study to assess pressure ulcer prevalence in a group of long-term units and to describe the main factors associated both with risk for and presence of a pressure ulcer. Background.? Despite being potentially preventable, pressure ulcers are highly frequent among institutionalized patients and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Method.? A cross-sectional study was carried out, involving 571 patients from 10 long-term units in Rome, Italy. Healthcare staff in each unit evaluated pressure ulcer risk and collected clinical data while a single Registered Nurse assessed all patients to identify pressure ulcers. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the two outcomes: condition at risk for pressure ulcers (Braden score?≤?16) and pressure ulcer presence. The data were collected in February-March 2005. Findings.? The overall prevalence of pressure ulcers was 27%. Multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant positive association between high-risk condition of pressure ulcer and previous stroke (OR?=?1·96; 95% CI 1·30?2·96), previous trauma (OR?=?1·83; 95% CI 1·12?2·99) and cognitive decline (OR associated with a 1 point Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire increase?=?1·26; 95% CI 1·05?1·50). The model for pressure ulcer presence confirmed a statistically significant excess in patients with cardiovascular diseases (OR?=?1·79; 95% CI 1·13?2·85), with high Activity of Daily Living scores (OR associated with a 1 point increase 1·38; 95% CI 1·03?1·84) and low Braden Scale scores (OR associated with a 1 point increase?=?0·80; 95% CI 0·70?0·87). The risk of pressure ulcers according to number of full-time nurses and auxiliary staff per 10 beds lower than five was marginally statistically significant (OR?=?1·60; 95% CI 0·98?2·61). Conclusion.? Further research is needed to validate our findings and further prospective research is needed to identify ways of preventing pressure ulcers. Our data on staffing suggest that organizational factors should be taken into account when exploring determinants of pressure ulcers.

AB  - Currently the most sensitive method for localizing lung cancers in central airways is autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) in combination with white light bronchoscopy (WLB). The diagnostic accuracy of WLB + AFB for high grade dysplasia (HGD) and carcinoma in situ is variable depending on physician's experience. When WLB + AFB are operated at high diagnostic sensitivity, the associated diagnostic specificity is low. Raman spectroscopy probes molecular vibrations and gives highly specific, fingerprint-like spectral features and has high accuracy for tissue pathology classification. In this study we present the use of a real-time endoscopy Raman spectroscopy system to improve the specificity. A spectrum is acquired within 1 second and clinical data are obtained from 280 tissue sites (72 HGDs/malignant lesions, 208 benign lesions/normal sites) in 80 patients. Using multivariate analyses and waveband selection methods on the Raman spectra, we have demonstrated that HGD and malignant lung lesions can be detected with high sensitivity (90%) and good specificity (65%).

AB  - Summary Epilepsy can be a devastating disorder. In addition to debilitating seizures, epilepsy can cause cognitive and emotional problems with reduced quality of life. Therefore, the major aim is to prevent the disorder in the first place: identify, detect, and reverse the processes responsible for its onset, and monitor and treat its progression. Epilepsy often occurs following a latent period of months to years (epileptogenesis) as a consequence of a brain insult, such as head trauma, stroke, or status epilepticus. Although this latent period clearly represents a therapeutic window, we are not able to stratify patients at risk for long-term epilepsy, which is prerequisite for preventative clinical trials. Moreover, because of the length of the latent period, an early biomarker for treatment response would be of high value. Finally, mechanistic biomarkers of epileptogenesis may provide more profound insight in the process of disease development.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the operating characteristics of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as a screen for ?at-risk? drinking in a multi-ethnic sample of primary care patients, from a family practice center located in the southwestern United States. A probability sample of 1333 family medicine patients, stratified by gender and racial/ethnic background (white, African-American and Mexican-American) completed the AUDIT, followed by the Alcohol Use Disorders and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule (AUDADIS) to determine ICD-10 diagnoses. Indicators of hazardous alcohol use and alcohol-related problems were included as measures of ?at-risk? drinking. Despite differences in the spectrum of alcohol problems across patient subgroups, there was no evidence of gender or racial/ethnic bias in the AUDIT as indicated by Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve analysis. Excluding abstainers from the analysis had little impact on screening efficacy. In this patient population, the A UDIT appears to be an unbiased measure of ?at-risk? drinking.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) could predict return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) undergoing CPR. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Two private specialty referral hospitals. Animals Thirty-five client-owned dogs and cats in CPA in which CPR was performed and pertinent data recorded on a purpose-made form. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results PetCO2 was recorded at 1-minute intervals during CPR. Hospital, animal, arrest, and outcome variables were also reported in the Utstein style where possible. Twelve animals (7 dogs and 5 cats) achieved ROSC; 4 of these (2 dogs and 2 cats) had sustained ROSC, of which 1 dog was discharged alive. Patients that achieved ROSC had significantly higher initial PetCO2 (P = 0.0083), peak PetCO2 (P < 0.0001), average PetCO2 (P < 0.0001), and ?PetCO2 (difference between last and first recorded PetCO2; P = 0.0004) than patients not resuscitated. The PetCO2 accurately discriminated between ROSC and failure to achieve ROSC at minutes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of CPR with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926, 0.967, 0.938, 0.933, 0.956, and 1.00, respectively. The optimal cutoff PetCO2 was 18 mm Hg (2.4 kPa), with a sensitivity of ≥80% and a specificity of ≥95% at minutes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, correctly classifying 91?100% of cases. Conclusions The results of this small study support previous recommendations to monitor PetCO2 during CPR and suggest that PetCO2 during CPR may be useful for determining the probability of ROSC. Absolute values and trends of PetCO2 may assist clinicians and owners in making decisions for pets with CPA.
