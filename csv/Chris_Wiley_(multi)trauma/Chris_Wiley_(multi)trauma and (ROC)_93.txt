AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Summary Current, high-quality data are needed to evaluate the health impact of the epidemic of obesity in Latin America. The Latin American Consortium of Studies of Obesity (LASO) has been established, with the objectives of (i) Accurately estimating the prevalence of obesity and its distribution by sociodemographic characteristics; (ii) Identifying ethnic, socioeconomic and behavioural determinants of obesity; (iii) Estimating the association between various anthropometric indicators or obesity and major cardiovascular risk factors and (iv) Quantifying the validity of standard definitions of the various indexes of obesity in Latin American population. To achieve these objectives, LASO makes use of individual data from existing studies. To date, the LASO consortium includes data from 11 studies from eight countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela), including a total of 32?462 subjects. This article describes the overall organization of LASO, the individual studies involved and the overall strategy for data analysis. LASO will foster the development of collaborative obesity research among Latin American investigators. More important, results from LASO will be instrumental to inform health policies aiming to curtail the epidemic of obesity in the region.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

Bertram 1 , Gary Mathern 2 , Helen Cross 3 and Maria Thom 4 ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 4 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) Summary: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been synonymous with hippocampal sclerosis, such that the consensus is that the removal of the latter cures the former. There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.
