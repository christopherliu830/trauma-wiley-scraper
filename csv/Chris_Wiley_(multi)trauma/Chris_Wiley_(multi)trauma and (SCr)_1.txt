AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Abstract The number of pancreas transplants performed in the United States stabilized over the last 3 years after nearly a decade of steady decline. Numbers of new additions to the list also stabilized during the same period. Notably, the persistent decline in pancreas after kidney transplants also seems to have abated, at least for now. The first full year of data after implementation of the new pancreas allocation system revealed no change in the distribution of organs between simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant and pancreas transplant alone. The percentage of kidneys used in SPK transplants was also unchanged. While a uniform definition of pancreas graft failure was approved in June 2015, it is awaiting implementation. Meanwhile, SRTR will refrain from publishing pancreas graft failure data in the program-specific reports. Therefore, it is difficult to track trends in outcomes after pancreas transplant over the past 2 years. New initiatives by the OPTN/UNOS Pancreas Transplantation Committee include facilitated pancreas allocation and broadened allocation of pancreata across compatible ABO blood types to increase organ utilization.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted to heart transplant recipients by donor organs. Mid-term results were reported using HCV-positive donors in patients at risk of imminent death (group I, n?=?10), or in patients who otherwise would not have been offered heart transplantation (group II, n?=?10) because of age (9/10) or associated medical risk (1/10). Medical records pertaining to patients receiving HCV-positive allografts between July 1994 and December 1999 were reviewed. The recipients consisted of 19 males and one female, with a median age of 54?years for group I and 66 for group II. The HCV RNA level, seroconversion of anti-HCV antibody, biochemical liver dysfunction, and causes of death were examined. Older recipients received reduced immunosuppression. Two patients in group II were HCV positive and were also retransplants. The hospital mortality rate was 10% in group I and 20% in group II; both hepatitis C-positive recipients died postoperatively prior to discharge. All predischarge deaths were related to multi-system organ failure (MSOF). All 17 survivors were HCV negative prior to transplant. Of these, 4/17 seroconverted. HCV RNA was detected in two of them. At a median follow-up of 26.4?months, 2/11 current survivors continue to test anti-HCV positive and are RNA negative. Three-year actual survival was 40% for group I and 70% in group II. Transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) accounted for one postoperative death in group I. Current data show that four out of 11 survivors had developed TCAD at 3-year follow-up, yielding an actual freedom from TCAD rate of 12/17 (70%) at 3-year follow-up. Hepatitis C transmission using a donor heart as the reservoir is moderate (25%). Limited use of such donors is justified in selected patients. The risk for hepatic disease may be reduced by tailoring immunosuppression specifically for such recipients, particularly if they are at low risk of rejection. Further studies are necessary to define a possible association between HCV and TCAD.

AB  - Abstract This article examines the normative underpinnings of ?trust talk?, asking how biomedical discourse constructs racial group boundaries and what implications this has for our understanding of the politics of medicine more broadly. Drawing upon a 2-year multi-method study of the world's largest stem cell research initiative and extending key insights from the sociology of race?ethnicity and social studies of science and medicine, this paper identifies three ways in which discourse in the stem cell field constructs racial group boundaries ? through diversity outreach, clinical gatekeeping, and charismatic collaborations. In so doing, the paper also explicates counter-narratives ? medical racial profiling, subversive whiteness, and biopolitical minstrelsy ? as forms of discursive resistance that challenge the normative underpinnings of recruitment discourse.

AB  - Abstract The first full year of data after implementation of the new kidney allocation system reveals an increase in deceased donor kidney transplants among black candidates and those with calculated panel-reactive antibodies 98%?100%, but a decrease among candidates aged 65 years or older. Data from 2015 also demonstrate ongoing positive trends in graft and patient survival for both deceased and living donor kidney transplants, but the challenges of a limited supply of kidneys in the setting of increasing demand remain evident. While the total number of patients on the waiting list decreased for the first time in a decade, this was due to a combination of a decrease in the number of candidates added to the list and an increase in the number of candidates removed from the list due to deteriorating medical condition, as well as an increase in total transplants. Deaths on the waiting list remained flat, but this was likely because of an increasing trend toward removing inactive candidates too sick to undergo transplant.

AB  - Abstract CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RNAi knock down of CDK5 reduced the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and prevented neuronal loss in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice. Here, we report that CDK5 RNAi protected against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity using primary hippocampal neurons transduced with adeno-associated virus 2.5 viral vector eGFP-tagged scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR during 12 days. Protection was dependent on a concomitant increase in p35 and was reversed using p35 RNAi, which affected the down-stream Rho GTPase activity. Furthermore, p35 over-expression and constitutively active Rac1 mimicked CDK5 silencing-induced neuroprotection. In addition, 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease mice (24 months old) were injected in the hippocampus with scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR, and spatial learning and memory were performed 3 weeks post-injection using ?Morris? water maze test. Our data showed that CDK5 knock down induced an increase in p35 protein levels and Rac activity in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice, which correlated with the recovery of cognitive function; these findings confirm that increased p35 and active Rac are involved in neuroprotection. In summary, our data suggest that p35 acts as a mediator of Rho GTPase activity and contributes to the neuroprotection induced by CDK5 RNAi. CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that p35/Rac1 signaling is critical in the CDK5 shRNAmiR-induced neuroprotection against glutamate neurotoxicity and is also correlated with the recovery of cognitive function in 3xTg-AD mice. CDK5 shRNAmiR blocks calpain activation, and the cleavage of p35 to p25 produced by glutamate, which generates neuroprotection in a p35 up-regulation dependent mode and its down-stream control of Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Despite a severe shortage of organ supply, patients are reluctant to accept organs from deceased donors with AKI, let alone from pediatric AKI donors. Methods We assessed 70 patients who received kidneys from donors with AKI (10 with pediatric and 60 with adult donors) and 176 contemporaneous patients who received kidneys from non-AKI donors (41 with pediatric and 135 with adult donors) between March 2012 and February 2017 for retrospectively evaluating the clinical outcomes. Results AKI was defined and staging by the RIFLE criteria and pediatric-modified RIFLE criteria. Median age was 11.00 years IQR (4.50-14.00 years), and median weight was 25.00 kg (IQR, 17.00-45.00 kg) for all pediatric donors. Median follow-up was 8 months (range, 1-49 months). Adult AKI group had the highest incidence of DGF (35.0% vs 10%, 9.8%, and 19.3%, P = 0.011). There was a significant increase in DGF in higher AKI stages (Risk: 20.7%, Injury: 46.7%, Failure: 50.0%; P = 0.014) among patients with adult donors. No significant differences were noted in 1-year (100.0%, 95.1%, 98.3%, and 97.8%; P = 0.751) and 3-year (100.0%, 95.1%, 98.3%, and 97.8%; P = 0.751) patient survival, and 1-year (90.0%, 97.6%, 98.3%, and 95.6%; P = 0.535) and 3-year (90.0%, 97.6%, 98.3%, and 95.6%; P = 0.535) graft survival. Conclusion Transplants procured from donors with AKI, particularly pediatric ones, could achieve excellent intermediate-term clinical outcomes and thus potentially expand the donor pool.
