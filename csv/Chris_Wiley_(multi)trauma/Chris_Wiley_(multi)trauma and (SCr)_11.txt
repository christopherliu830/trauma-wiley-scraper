AB  - Abstract Although intra-dialytic hypertension (IDH) has been noted in clinical settings for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed IDH incidence in our center and the correlation between postdialysis volume state and IDH. One hundred thirty-one maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were enrolled in our study, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and echocardiography (ECG) were recorded. In addition, demographic data were collected, and laboratory examinations were conducted. The patients were grouped into four groups according to the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between predialysis and postdialysis. The incidence of IDH was 10.7%. The proportion of extracellular water to total body weight (ECW/TW), as evaluated by BIA, was significantly higher in the IDH group than in the other three groups both in pre-and post-dialysis. In particular, postdialysis SBP was highest in the highest tertile interval of ECW/TW. In addition, among the four groups, left ventricular volume (LVV) was highest in the IDH group. Binary logistic analyses revealed that predialysis SBP, postdialysis ECW/TW and LVV were independent risk factors of intradialytic hypertension. When predicting IDH, the AUC of the ROC curve was higher for ECW/TW combined with LVV (0.752, 95% CI 0.613?0.896) than for either LVV or ECW/TW alone. Our study further showed that post-dialysis volume expansion is an important factor for the development of IDH.

AB  - Establishment of a preferential liver allocation rule for simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation (SLK) and revisions of laws regarding organ transplants from deceased donors have paved the way for SLK in Japan. Very few cases of SLK have been attempted in Japan, and no such recipients have survived for longer than 40 days. The present report describes a case of a 50-year-old woman who had undergone living donor liver transplantation at the age of 38 years for management of post-partum liver failure. After the first transplant surgery, she developed hepatic vein stenosis and severe hypersplenism requiring splenectomy. She was then initiated on hemodialysis (HD) due to the deterioration of renal function after insertion of a hepatic vein stent. She was listed as a candidate for SLK in 2011 because she required frequent plasma exchange for hepatic coma. When her Model for End-stage Liver Disease score reached 46, the new liver was donated 46 days after registration. The reduced trisegment liver and the kidney grafts were simultaneously transplanted under veno-venous bypass and intraoperative HD. The hepatic artery was reconstructed prior to portal reconstruction in order to shorten anhepatic time. Although she developed subcapsular bleeding caused by hepatic contusion on the next day, subsequent hemostasis was obtained by transcatheter embolization. Thereafter, her recovery was uneventful, except for mild rejection and renal tubular acidosis of the kidney graft. This case highlights the need to establish Japanese criteria for SLK.
