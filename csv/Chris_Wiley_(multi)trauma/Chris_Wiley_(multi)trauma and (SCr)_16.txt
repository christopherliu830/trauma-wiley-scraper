AB  - Summary This chapter begins with a discussion of pathophysiology and implications of broad classes of congenital cardiac defects, including mixing lesions, shunts, and outflow obstruction lesions. Next, airway and ventilation management is presented, focusing on cardiorespiratory interactions, and the influence of lung volumes, intrathoracic pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure on cardiac physiology. Then, alternative modes of ventilation, and weaning from ventilation are discussed. The next section of the chapter presents a discussion of myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic monitoring, with an emphasis on assessment of cardiac output, surgical factors, effects of bypass, dysrhythmias, low preload/high afterload, and decreased myocardial contractility. The latter part of the chapter starts with a presentation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, postoperative complications, quality improvement, and mechanical support of the circulation. Finally, reviews of hemostasis, infection control, neurological complications and monitoring, fluid management and renal dysfunction, and nutritional and gastrointestinal complications are presented.

AB  - Abstract Background Stillbirths (>20 weeks? gestation), which account for about 1 in 200 US pregnancies, may grieve parents deeply. Unresolved grief may lead to persistent depression. Methods We compared depressive symptoms in 2009 (6?36 months after index delivery) among consenting women in the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network's population-based case?control study conducted 2006?08 (n?=?275 who delivered a stillbirth and n?=?522 who delivered a healthy livebirth (excluding livebirths?<37 weeks, infants who had been admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or who died). Women scoring?>12 on the Edinburgh Depression Scale were classified as currently depressed. Crude (cOR) and adjusted (aOR) odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals [CI] were computed from univariate and multivariable logistic models, with weighting for study design and differential consent. Marginal structural models examined potential selection bias due to low follow-up. Results Current depression was more likely in women with stillbirth (14.8%) vs. healthy livebirth (8.3%, cOR 1.90 [95% CI 1.20, 3.02]). However, after control for history of depression and factors associated with both depression and stillbirth, the stillbirth association was no longer significant (aOR 1.35 [95% CI 0.79, 2.30]). Conversely, for the 76% of women with no history of depression, a significant association remained after adjustment for confounders (aOR 1.98 [95% CI 1.02, 3.82]). Conclusions Improved screening for depression and referral may be needed for women's health care. Research should focus on defining optimal methods for support of women suffering stillbirth so as to lower the risk of subsequent depression.

AB  - The present paper reviews Scandinavian contributions to the field of psychophysiology in a fifteen year perspective (1968?1983). Psychophysiology is defined as that domain within psychobiology where the investigator uses a physiological measure to indirectly assess a psychological construct, e.g. heart-rate to index anxiety. Only research that fit this definition is reviewed. Thus, research belonging to physiological psychology and behavior pharmacology is excluded. The paper is divided into several areas covering studies related to attention and the orienting response (OR); classical autonomic conditioning and biofeed-back learning; clinical psychology and behavior medicine; emotion and motivation, and methodological contributions. The review of studies related to attention and OR is focussed on the work by Näätänen and by Öhman who both have made distinguished contributions to this area of research. The so-called ?prepared-learning? project is described as an example of Scandinavian conditioning studies. Other examples include Bohlin's research on attention and habituation, and the work by Schalling and by Fredrikson in clinical psychology and psychopathology. Norwegian research on muscle tension and respiratory activity done by Svebak is also reviewed. A total of 114 papers written by about 95 different researchers are reviewed. Thus, psychophysiology may be regarded as a firmly rooted research tradition in Scandinavia, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is concluded that Scandinavian psychophysiology research is at the front line internationally concerning problem areas and methodology.
