AB  - Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) is reported as a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. Recently, continuous blood purification (CBP) has been mostly applied for MODS treatment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CBP on plasma phospholipid level in patients with MODS. Methods A total of 126 patients with MODS and 120 healthy people were collected. The serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes were detected, and the correlation among phospholipid compounds with serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes was analyzed. Results Before CBP, levels of body temperature, RR, HR, CVP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 were obviously higher, and pH, HCO3-, PaO2, SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 were lower in the MODS group than those in the control group. During CBP, the MODS group had gradually declined RR, CVP, levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 and increased HCO3-, PaO2 and SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747. Besides, levels of PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 had an obvious negative correlation with levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, BUN, SCr, and PaCO2, and a significant positive correlation with levels of HCO3-, PaO2, and SaO2. Conclusion CBP could effectively ameliorate clinical signs of patients with MODS and correct the plasma phospholipid levels.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To determine the frequency and independent predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in addition to the prognostic implications of both AKI and periprocedural red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on 30 day and cumulative late mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Background: RBC transfusions have been reported to predict AKI following TAVI. Data on the prognostic implications of both factors, however, are lacking. Methods: 126 consecutive patients underwent TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System. AKI was defined according to the valve academic research consortium definitions as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg dL?1 (≥26.4 ?mol L?1) or a percentage increase ≥50% within 72 hr following TAVI. Results: Five patients on chronic haemodialysis and three intraprocedural deaths were excluded, leading to a final study population of 118 patients. AKI occurred in 19% of the patients necessitating temporary haemodialysis in 2%. Independent predictors of AKI included: previous myocardial infarction (OR: 5.72; 95% CI: 1.64?19.94), periprocedural (<24 hr) RBC transfusions (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.01?1.70), postprocedural (<72 hr) leucocyte count (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02?1.37), and logistic EuroSCORE (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01?1.14). In patients with AKI, 30-day mortality was 23% and cumulative late mortality (median: 13 months) was 55%. AKI (OR: 5.47; 95% CI: 1.23?24.21) and postprocedural leucocyte count (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03?1.38) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality while AKI (HR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.36?5.71) was the only independent predictor of late mortality. Conclusions: AKI following TAVI occurred in 19% of the patients. RBC transfusion was found to be an independent predictor of AKI, which in turn predicted both 30-day and cumulative late mortality. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate estimated and measured donor renal function in predicting graft function long-term and to identify donor criteria associated with nonacceptable graft prognosis. In 200 consecutive cadaver donors creatinine clearance was measured at explantation and estimated using the Cockcroft formula on admission serum creatinine. Graft function was evaluated in recipients (n?=?387) by 24-h creatinine clearance regularly during 3years after transplantation. Measured creatinine clearance correlated to some extent with long-term graft function, while Cockcroft estimation was slightly superior and similar to using donor age only. Kidneys from donors with intra-operative creatinine clearance ≤?55mL/min (median 50mL/min) produced acceptable recipient graft function of 48mL/min at 3years and 76% 3-year graft survival. Donor age ≥?60years resulted in clearance at 3years of 29mL/min and 78% 3-year graft survival; adding the criteria of admission Cockcroft ≤?60mL/min, graft function at 3years (28mL/min) and 3-year graft survival (76%) were similar. In conclusion, creatinine-based estimates of the functional capacity of the donor kidney, calculated or intra-operatively measured, do little to improve the ability of donor age alone to predict long-term allograft function after renal transplantation, and nonacceptable donors are not discriminated.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to develop a diffusion tensor MR imaging pulse sequence that allows whole brain coverage with isotropic resolution within a clinically acceptable time. A single-shot, cardiac-gated MR pulse sequence, optimized for measuring the diffusion tensor in human brain, was developed to provide whole-brain coverage with isotropic (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) spatial resolution, within a total imaging time of approximately 15 min. The diffusion tensor was computed for each voxel in the whole volume and the data processed for visualization in three orthogonal planes. Anisotropy data were further visualized using a maximum-intensity projection algorithm. Finally, reconstruction of fiber-tract trajectories i.e., ?tractography? was performed. Images obtained with this pulse sequence provide clear delineation of individual white matter tracts, from the most superior cortical regions down to the cerebellum and brain stem. Because the data are acquired with isotropic resolution, they can be reformatted in any plane and the sequence can therefore be used, in general, for macroscopic neurological or psychiatric neuroimaging investigations. The 3D visualization afforded by maximum intensity projection imaging and tractography provided easy visualization of individual white matter fasciculi, which may be important sites of neuropathological degeneration or abnormal brain development. This study has shown that it is possible to obtain robust, high quality diffusion tensor MR data at 1.5 Tesla with isotropic resolution (2.5 ? 2.5 ? 2.5 mm) from the whole brain within a sufficiently short imaging time that it may be incorporated into clinical imaging protocols.

AB  - Abstract Aim To conduct an evidence synthesis of normative reference values for bladder function parameters in women. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting bladder function parameters obtained from noninvasive tests in healthy women. Seven databases were searched for relevant studies from inception through December 2018, with manual searching of reference lists. We included English language articles that provided quantitative data on urination frequency, voided and postvoid residual volumes, and uroflowmetry results in women without lower urinary tract symptoms. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by at least two independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analytic models were used to derive study-level pooled mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 24 studies (N?=?3090 women, age range, 18-91 years) met eligibility criteria. Pooled mean estimates of bladder function parameters were: 6.6 daytime voids (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.2, 7.0), 0.4 nighttime voids (95% CI, 0.0, 0.8), 1577?mL for 24-hour voided volume (95% CI 1428,1725); 12?mL for postvoid residual volume (95% CI, 4, 20); and 28?mL/sec for maximum flow rate (95% CI, 27,30). Between-study heterogeneity was high for all outcomes (I2?=?61.1-99.6%), but insufficient data were available to explore reasons for this high heterogeneity (eg, differences by age). Conclusion Although summary mean estimates of bladder function parameters were calculated, the wide heterogeneity across studies precludes generalization of these estimates to all healthy women. Further research is needed to determine normative reference values within specific groups, such as those defined by age.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD patients. Methods Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS <?5) and moderate to severe calcification group (AACS ≥?5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of the study (30 November 2016). Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42?±?13.48?years. Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02?1.10), P = 0.003), longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00?1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 3.01 (1.18?7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels (OR 2.83 (1.01?7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 1.08 (1.01?1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard ratio 3.14 (1.04?9.44), P = 0.042). Conclusion Our data suggest that AAC is prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was the investigation of the maximal potential donor pool and causes of non-realized organ donation. On-site retrospective medical-record review was performed for all cases of patient death (n=1608) occurring in 1999 at 34 (83% of all) intensive care units (ICUs) in the region of the transplant center in Prague. Czech Republic. Two hundred and eighty-eight (18%) patients died with clinical signs of brain death. ICU physicians considered 111 of them as being potential donors at the time; 63 became donors and 48 did not. The remaining 177 patients with clinical signs of brain death were, in retrospect, assessed as being unsuitable (n=105) or suitable (n=72) for donation. The maximal potential donor rate was 55.7 per million population (pmp), with a more conservative estimate of 37.4 pmp. The actual donor rate was 18.1 pmp. For the maximal level to be approached, further educational efforts are warranted, targeting ICU physicians and concentrating on the identification of potential donors.
