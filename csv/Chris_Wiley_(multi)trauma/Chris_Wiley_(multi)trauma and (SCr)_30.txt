AB  - The present review aimed to summarize the effectiveness and features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of infectious diseases and to discuss the limitation of the development of TCM. The personalized medicine with TCM exerts a curative effect on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with unique advantages on the improvement of clinical manifestation, pathogen inhibition, and organ recovery during severe and drug-resistant infection. The deficiency of personalized medicine with TCM lies in that the current research design of TCM primarily focuses on the study of the effective components and material basis of Chinese herbs at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level, while ignoring the guidance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, which is the core concept of individualized treatment. Personalized medicine with TCM has a broad prospective for infectious diseases due to the specific efficacy and advantages. While the curative effect of individualized treatment with TCM cannot be excluded from the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, the study of personalized medicine with TCM for infectious diseases urgently requires a unified standardization of the clinical syndrome differentiation and the evolution rule of infectious diseases by TCM theory.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialysis is often complicated by cardiovascular instability (CVI). We studied factors contributing to this problem during 720 hemodialyses (HDs) in 20 patients; 480 dialyses were 6/week and 240 were 3/week. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR) and maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP). Independent variables were dialyses/week (DIAL), ultrafiltration (Uf), % of body weight (BW), pre-post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1?kg?1 BW), target-postdialysis BW (Ta-Po BW), Kt/V, ?PO4, ?bicarbonate, ?potassium, ?BUN, an ?unphysiology index? summing up changes in electrolytes, and BUN and BW during dialysis (UPI). The relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased 0.5?±?11/min; MAX BP fall was 23?±?17?mmHg; OV BP fall was 12?±?19?mmHg. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=?38???DIAL???4?+?T???0.1?+?Uf???1.8?+?PO4 ??1.8???UPI??0.2???K/V???2, r?=?0.30, p?<?0.0001; MAX BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+??PO4???2.6?+?11, r?=?0.34, p?<?0.0001; OV BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+?PO4???2.7 +?1, r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001. Conclusion:? To prevent BP fall and tachycardia during hemodialysis, the most important factor to decrease is unphysiology, i.e., the oscillations in electrolytes, fluid spaces, and osmolality that occur during dialysis. The best way to do this is to dialyze patients daily. An unexpected finding worthy of further investigation was the large detrimental influence of ?PO4 on CVI.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.

AB  - Low serum albumin, high serum phosphorus, and fluid overload are common issues in dialysis patients. This can be attributed to many causes such as inadequate understanding and lack of accountability in the patients' care. These abnormal levels contribute to increased medical complications and increased mortality. Objective:? (i) Improve patient education of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid maintenance. (ii) Improve patients' albumin, phosphorus, and fluid levels by 25 percent. Methods:? A baseline level was collected on all patients by averaging last 3 laboratory findings. All patients were educated recognizing several different learning styles. Educational posters were displayed, one-on-one education was provided, as well as educational games on the role of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid. Patients were also educated on the role of diet in these levels. Positive reinforcement, peer pressure, and intensive team approach were used through the 8-week incentive contest. Feedback on progress was provided in written and verbal format. Prizes were awarded for best shift levels and shift with most improvements. Results:? Levels measured at the end of the educational period and contest showed a 71% improvement in albumin levels, 52% improvement in phosphorus levels, and a 42% improvement in fluid levels. Conclusion:? Significant improvements found in all areas are attributed to three factors: education, consistent, individual, intensive attention, and incentives. Peer pressure was found not to be as effective but that individual tracking for incentives may be more effective if done ongoing. Our follow up several months later found a slight decrease in improvements, and we recognize a need for an ongoing intervention. Yet, we found an overall improvement of level of understanding and commitment to their overall health.

AB  - Aim:? The comparative study of hemodialysis (HD) adequacy of Kt/V measurement between classic method (Daugirdas formula) and urea sensor monitor (online). Patients and methods:? 30 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis were studied. A comparative evaluation of HD adequacy during the same session was done with two different methods: (1) blood samples were drawn in the beginning and in the end of HD session for the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and after measurement of HD adequacy by 3rd generation Daugirdas formula and (2) urea sensor monitor use for continuous HD adequacy measurement during HD session. Results:? There was statistically significant correlation of Kt/V Daugirdas with Kt/V online (r?=?0.8, p?<?0.001). Also there was statistically significant correlation between solute removal index (SRI), Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=?0.81, p?<?0.001) and Kt/V online (r?=?0.92, p?<?0.001). From nutrition indices that were measured, the protein catabolic rate (PCR) had marginal negative correlation with the two compared adequacy indices, Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=??0.24, p?<?0.03), and Kt/V online (r?=??0.17, p?<?0.03) although the nPCR (normalized PCR) had marginal positive correlation (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.05) (r?=?0.42, p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? The use of online urea sensor monitors contributes to the easy measurement of adequacy and nutrition indices and hence complicated mathematical formulas are not necessary. The results of these measurements are reliable and comparable with classic methods of HD adequacy evaluation.
