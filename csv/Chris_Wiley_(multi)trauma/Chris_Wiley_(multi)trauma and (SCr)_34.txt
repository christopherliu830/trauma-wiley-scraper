AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.

AB  - Objective:? To have 1 nurse successfully train 2 patients at a time for nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) within a 7?10 week time period. Methods:? Over the past 6 years, Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. has evolved its NHHD program from 1 nurse training 1 patient during an average 6 week period to training 2 patients in a 7?10 week period. Patients came either from our in-center population or directly from internal medicine. Our pre-evaluation procedures and manual were revised. Patients were pre-evaluated for literacy, manual dexterity, strength, hearing and visual deficits, substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and compliance before being accepted into the program. A home visit was made to evaluate their environment, family interactions, and water source. Our training manual was rewritten to fifth grade level. Every patient was given index cards printed in 20 size font with step-by-step procedures for machine setup, put-on and takeoff, re-circulation, and power failure. Patients were dialyzed 4 days/week to improve cognitive function and ?dialyzed the bucket? 1 day, thus training 5 days/week. One nurse trained 2 patients, staggering their start dates 2 weeks apart to allow for both individual and group teaching. Fistula or IJ catheter was used for access. Patients were trained alone or with a partner. In the last week of training, patients were dialyzed for 7?h and were expected to complete all procedures independently. Results:? From March 2003 to August 2003, 6 patients were trained for NHHD. 2 patients finished training in 7 weeks, 2 in 9 weeks, and 2 in 10 weeks. Conclusion:? One nurse can successfully train 2 patients at a time for NHHD in a 7?10 week time period at a decreased cost to dialysis provider.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) patients are often inconvenienced when intravenous iron preparations are administered. Formerly, these patients received their medication in the clinic on an off-dialysis day or during in-center hemodialysis (HD). For the last 2 years, 5 patients in our HHD program have been receiving intravenous ferric gluconate during their routine HD session. Procedure:? All patients were trained in the proper administration of ferric gluconate in-center. No test dose was administered. Ferric gluconate was infused via the heparin infusion pump on their HD machine at a rate of 31.25?mg/h. Doses were of either 62.5?mg or 125?mg per session. K/DOQI guidelines for intravenous iron use were adhered to. TSATs greater than 25%, ferritin greater than 100?ng/mL and less than 800?ng/mL, and hemoglobin between 11 and 12?g% were the goals of therapy. Both loading doses (8 doses during sequential HD sessions) and maintenance doses every week or every other week were employed. Results:? Over the last 2 years, 223 doses were administered at home. No serious reactions occurred during the course of therapy. One patient experienced minor nausea and vomiting during one dose, which was thought to be possibly related to the iron infusion. This patient subsequently received ferric gluconate again without difficulty. Conclusion:? Ferric gluconate can be safely administered at home during HHD.

AB  - Purpose:? Several studies have showed that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD, 6 times weekly 6?8?h) results in a better outcome. How do patients and their partners experience this very intensive treatment that has a great impact on daily life? Methods:? We followed a cohort of 12 patients (11 male, 1 female, mean age 46.8?±?9.4 years, time for renal replacement 11.3?±?9.4 years) and their partners during a year after starting NHD, using questionnaires and interviews and the SF-36. Results:? Both the physical and the mental components of the SF-36 showed an improvement in all aspects (p?<?0.05), even in this small group. All couples considered NHD a tremendous improvement over routine thrice weekly dialysis. The drawbacks (such as daily routine and the intrusion of the treatment in bed) are outweighed by the advantages (such as better clinical condition, less fatigue, less uremic symptoms, better quality of life, more time, and free diet). Following are a few comments on NHD: ?NHD is a difference of day and night,??NHD gave me independence,??Since I do NHD, I do aerobics,??I am becoming too fat now!,??My husband now is much faster than I am when we walk or ride the bicycle,??There is no reason now why I won't live long,??I got an excellent, but demanding new job, which is possible thanks to NHD,??Being a good team is a prerequisite for success,??Don't expect too much. You will remain a chronic patient,??Become confident with ?conventional? home hemodialysis first before you start NHD.? Conclusion:? NHD results in a tremendous improvement of quality of life. However, patients and partners need active support.

AB  - Increased radial artery wall thickness (RAWT) is considered to be associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as coronary artery atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, exact measurement of RAWT by noninvasive method before the operation is very important. Objective:? This study was designed to evaluate accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 21 hemodialysis patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation for the first time. We measured RAWT (intima-media thickness) using high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography at the wrist before the AVF operation. We obtained specimens of the radial artery during the AVF operation and then measured RAWT by histologic examination. Results:? Mean age of the patients was 60?±?13 years and the number of females was 7 (33.3%). Mean values of RAWT measured by Doppler ultrasonography and histologic examination were 485?±?93??m (300?700??m) and 426?±?106??m (300?700??m), respectively. The value of RAWT of Doppler sonographic measurement well correlated with that of histologic measurement (r?=?0.800, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that Doppler ultrasonography is an effective tool in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients before AVF operation.

AB  - The influence of dialysis prescription on outcome is well established. Hemodialysis dose has been shown to have a distinct impact upon the morbidity and mortality rate in patients on regular treatment therapy. Hence, adequacy of dialysis should be guaranteed. New devices based in online conductivity measures have been developed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose. The aim of this study was to compare online conductivity monitor (OCM) with dialysis dose standard methods (Daugirdas Kt/V). 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. Each patient was subjected to OCM on midweek day, during 3 consecutive weeks on the same day that blood Kt/V samples were taken as well. Each patient got 3 OCM measurements and Kt/V samples. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. Descriptives (n?=?24) Mean SD Age (year) ??64.75 ??18.243 Dry weight ??69.7125 ??12.01178 Interdialysis weight gain 2266.67 1016.673 BMI ??25.4155 ???3.83630 HD time ?245.21 ??21.340 OCM ???1.29921 ???0.201072 Daugirdas Kt/V ???1.3287 ???0.21043 Watson volume (L) ??36.833 ???6.3095 Linear regression analysis: Kt/V OCM relationship Variable Regression coefficient (?) r2 p Age (year) ?0.631 0.398 <0.001 Daugirdas Kt/V ?0.981 0.962 <0.001 BMI ?0.327 0.107 NS Watson volume (L) ?0.833 0.694 <0.001 The OCM option correlates well with Daugirdas Kt/V obtained from blood samples, in 96.2%, and provides a safe and accurate tool for hemodialysis, adding efficiency to dialysis adequacy monitoring in clinical practice. Also, OCM allows for an individualized dialysis dose. Furthers studies are required to evaluate its influence on patients' evolution.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - More frequent dialysis is thought to be associated with increased heparin requirements; however, limited data are available which compare heparin requirements of conventional to daily dialysis. Objectives:? To determine differences in heparin dose during conventional thrice-weekly dialysis (CHD) compared to daily hemodialysis (DHD). Methods:? All patients within the daily home hemodialysis at the Northwest Kidney Centers were evaluated for heparin dose both pre- and post initiation of daily hemodialysis. Patients on DHD received an initial bolus of heparin, without a continuous heparin drip, and supplemental heparin midway through the dialysis run as needed to maintain adequate activated clotting times (ACTs). CHD patients received a heparin bolus, followed by initiation of heparin drip as needed to maintain adequate ACTs. Results:? Of the 1117 patients who dialyze at the NKC, 55% were Caucasian, 21% African-American, 20% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35% were of other ethnicity. The majority of patients were greater than 60 years (56%), while 36% ranged from 40?60 years and 13% ranged from 20?40 years. Male patients constituted 54% of patients. Diabetes was the primary cause of renal disease (36%), followed by hypertension (21%) and glomerular disease (18%). Of those patients in the home hemodialysis program (n?=?45), 10 patients started daily home hemodialysis using the Aksys daily home hemodialysis system. Of those, the majority was male (100%), Caucasian (78.8%) with an average age of 46.7?±?18 years. Glomerulonephritis was the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (40%), while the percentages of other diseases were similar [Alport's syndrome (20%), hypertension (20%) and diabetes (10%)]. Compared to initial DHD heparin requirements (10,111?±?2219 units), CHD heparin dose requirements (6833?±?2715 units) were significantly lower (p?=?0.045); however, total heparin needs were similar between groups (10,166?±?4380 units vs. 10,778?±?2959 units) (p?=?0.324). Conclusion:? Although patients initiating DHD have greater initial heparin requirements than when on CHD, total heparin doses remain similar to those required on conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Greater initial heparin doses required during short daily dialysis appear safe compared to those of conventional dialysis.

AB  - Cardiovascular complications affect diabetic subjects early and the more susceptible ones are those on hemodialysis. Objective:? This study was designed to observe prevalent cardiac involvement in both pre- and already on dialysis diabetics. Method:? Sixty diabetics, 30 predialysis (predialysis diabetics, group 1), and 30 on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD, group 2) were randomly selected and their different clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. Result:? Both groups of patients were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Features like systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in predialysis diabetics group than in MHD group [138?±?19 vs. 152?±?32, p?<?0.02 and 74?±?10 vs. 87?±?10?mmHg (p?<?0.001)]; hemoglobin higher [10.3?±?2.1 vs. 7.5?±?1.5 g/dL (p?<?0.001)]; serum creatinine was lower [3.49?±?1.8 vs. 9.5?±?2.5 mg/dL (p?<?0.001)] (due to recruitment criteria); left ventricular muscle mass index (LVMI) also lower [137?±?96 vs. 211?±?77?g/m2 (p?<?0.001)]; left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) less [58?±?21 vs. 85?±?25 mL/m2 (p?<?0.001) and fractional shortening (FS, %) higher [33?±?4.3 vs. 28?±?5.8 (p?<?0.006)]. Only 11% of Pre subjects had LV hypertrophy (LVMI >131?g/m2 in male and in female LVMI >110?g/m2) whereas it was 51% in MHD (p?<?0.001). Systolic dysfunction (FS?=?<25%) was 4% in Pre subjects and 24% in MHD (p?<?0.03) group. Correlation study showed systolic and diastolic blood pressure; both had positive correlation with LVMI (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.008 and r?=?0.32, p?<?0.02) and LVEDVI (r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and r?=?0.35, p?<?0.01) and also similarly positive with serum creatinine (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.02 and r?=?0.5, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? It may be concluded that cardiac parameters are grossly altered in majority of diabetics on dialysis and higher serum creatinine and uncontrolled blood pressure may be responsible for this.

AB  - Bacteremia (B) is a well-known complication of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Although prophylactic measures such as topical and catheter lock antibiotics have been demonstrated to decrease the risk of B in hemodialysis (HD) in patients with a CVC, there are concerns about the development of resistance to these agents when used for long periods of time. Objective:? We wondered if we could limit the use of these agents by identifying the period when B was most common after CVC placement. Method: We prospectively noted all patients with a CVC who developed B in any of our 3 units in CT, U.S.A.; 62 episodes of B occurred between 1/1/03 and 9/18/03. 35% of all of the HD patients had a CVC for access during the study period. Results: Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 22 (35.5%) episodes; Gram-negative organisms for 21 (33.8%) and other staphylococcal species for 14 (22.6%). The other 3 episodes were other Gram-positive organisms and 6 patients developed B with more than 1 organism. 3 (4.8%) patients expired while being treated for the B. The average time to onset of B was 96?±?98 CVC days with a range of 1?365 days. There was no difference in time to onset based on organism. 43.5% of the episodes of B occurred less than 60 days after the CVC was inserted, but 27.4% occurred greater than 100 days after CVC insertion. Conclusion:? The time to onset of CVC-related B was variable among the patients developing B in this study. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing the risk of B in patients with a CVC must be used for the life of the CVC.

AB  - Purpose:? Nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHHD, 6?7 times weekly 6?9?h) results in better clinical outcome than conventional 3 times weekly hemodialysis. A good training program for patient and partner is a prequisite for success. We developed a training course for patients and partners. Methods:? Since December 2001, we trained 20 patients and their partners to perform NHHD in 2 succeeding groups. The first group, consisting of 15 patients and their partners, started a NHHD pilot study. During this pilot study, we improved the training course. The second group of 5 were trained with this improved program. All 5 participants were home hemodialysis patients for over 1 month before starting the NHHD course. First, they learned how to handle the single needle system. Then, they performed single needle hemodialysis for 2 weeks at home. This was followed by an in-center NHHD training, consisting of 4 conventional day-time and 3 long (8?h) nocturnal dialysis treatments. Main targets during this training period are to learn to deal with safety precautions, online monitoring, and special machine features, and to check biochemistry and heparinization during long dialysis. 1 month after the training we evaluated the course with all participants. Results:? For 9 of 15 couples in the first group, the training appeared to be exhausting. Stress factors were an overloaded program and too little experience with several new skills including needle technique before starting NHHD. The second group started the NHHD training 2 weeks after the single needle training. This second group was pleased with the training protocol. Conclusion:? The training course for NHHD should not be overloaded. Patients need time to learn new skills before starting NHHD.

AB  - It is unlikely that there is a solitary hospital-based dialysis unit that can claim an unlimited amount of available chronic spots. Many units, in fact, constantly face a problem of overcrowding, long patient waiting lists, and ongoing shortages of nurses trained in highly specialized areas such as dialysis. In addition, conventional dialysis does not afford the best outcomes to patients with lifestyle, fluid control, hypotension, or hypertension issues. Objective:? We developed an in-hospital nocturnal program with the goal of solving some of these issues related to wait lists, overcrowding, and shortages of trained hemodialysis nurses. Method:? In the first year, a four-bed room was converted into a 4 station unit. Nurses from the 24 bed in-patient Nephrology/Urology/Ophthalmology unit were trained to perform hemodialysis. Stable, hospitalized dialysis patients or in-center dialysis patients were selected if they met criteria drawn up by the medical director. Staffing for the unit was established at 3?:?1 or 4?:?1 patient to nurse ratio. Support staff included a hemodialysis-trained ward nurse with an assignment of 5?6 hospitalized patients. Back-up support included assistance with trouble-shooting and break coverage for the nocturnal nurse. Results:? We currently have 12 nurses from the ward trained to do hemodialysis. The nocturnal unit has been operating 3 nights/week, with plans to expand to 6 nights/week within the year. We have 3 patients on the program with plans to increase to 6?8 patients as more nurses are trained. Initiation of hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis has led to the opening of in-center dialysis spots as well as shortening wait periods for patients in the Pre-Renal Clinic, awaiting initiation of chronic dialysis. This model has also provided the in-center dialysis unit with a greater pool of skilled hemodialysis nurses to draw from during shortages. Anecdotal reports from patients indicate that they feel much better, and 1 patient no longer requires antihypertensives for their blood pressure control. Conclusion:? We conclude that hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis is a novel and extremely viable solution for many of the issues facing dialysis units today.

AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis patients is, to a large extent, determined by demographics and by existing comorbidities, but it is obvious that variations in dialysis dose have substantial effects. Using eKt/V, 1.2 monthly comparisons are recommended by European guidelines, but they assume that dose is maintained during all monthly sessions. Because of dialysis-related problems like hypotension, reduction of blood flow, dialysis time, microclotting of the dialyzer, and vascular access problems, the delivered dose may vary from session to session. New developed devices based on online conductivity clearance reflect the electrolyte clearance and, thus, clearance of urea. The aim of this prospective study was to show the variability of dialysis dose. 24 anuric patients were studied during 3 months: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with online conductivity monitor (OCM) and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Each patient was subjected to OCM on regular sessions during 3 months, and blood Kt/V samples were taken on midweek day, once a month. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation with other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The conductivity-based OCM provides an accurate tool to monitor the dose and control of each hemodialysis session and adds to the efficiency of current dialysis adequacy monitoring. OCM device requires little maintenance, and no extra effort is needed. Monthly Kt/V does not reflect the variability of each session. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its influence on morbidity and mortality. ? Descriptives ?

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.
