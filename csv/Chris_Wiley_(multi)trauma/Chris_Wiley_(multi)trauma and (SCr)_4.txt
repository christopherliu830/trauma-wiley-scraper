AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic smoking in alcohol dependence is associated with abnormalities in brain morphology and metabolite levels in large lobar regions (e.g. frontal lobe). Here, we evaluated if these abnormalities are specifically apparent in several cortical and select subcortical components of the extended brain reward system (BRS), a network that is critically involved in the development and maintenance of all forms of addictive disorders. We studied 33 non-smoking and 43 smoking alcohol-dependent individuals (ALC) with 1 week of abstinence and 42 non-smoking Controls. At 1.5 Tesla, we obtained regional measures of cortical thickness and N-acetylaspartate (NAA; a surrogate marker of neuronal integrity) concentration in major components of the BRS as well as the corresponding measures throughout the cortex. Smoking ALC and non-smoking ALC demonstrated decreased thickness compared with Controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the total BRS, total frontal cortex and global cortex. Smoking ALC had significantly decreased thickness compared to non-smoking ALC in the ACC, insula, the total BRS and total frontal cortex. Smoking ALC had also lower NAA concentrations than both non-smoking ALC and Controls in the DLPFC, insula, superior corona radiata and the total BRS. Alcohol consumption and common medical and psychiatric co-morbidities did not mediate differences between smoking and non-smoking ALC. This dual modality magnetic resonance (MR) study indicated that chronic smoking in ALC was associated with significant cortical thinning and NAA abnormalities in anterior brain regions that are implicated in the development and maintenance of addictive disorders.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence?2b What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Tumour in a solitary functioning kidney represents an absolute indication for nephron-sparing surgery whenever technically feasible. We report the longest follow-up data comparing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic cryoablation in patients with solitary kidney with oncological follow-up to five years. OBJECTIVES ??We compare perioperative, functional and intermediate-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) vs laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) for small renal tumour in patients with a solitary kidney. ??A treatment algorithm is also proposed. PATIENT AND METHODS ??Over a 10-year period (02/1998-09/2008), 78 patients with a small tumour in a functionally solitary kidney underwent LPN (n= 48) or LCA (n= 30). ??Baseline, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS ??Demographic data were similar between the LPN and LCA groups. Tumours were somewhat larger (3.2 vs 2.6?cm) in the LPN group. LPN was associated with greater blood loss (391 vs 162?mL; P= 0.003), and trended towards more post-operative complications (22.9% vs 6.7%; P= 0.07). ??By 3 months post-operative, eGFR decreased by 14.5% and 7.3% after LPN and LCA, respectively (P= 0.02). Post-operative temporary dialysis was required after 3 LPN (6.2% vs 0%, P= 0.16). ??Median follow-up time for LPN and LCA was 42.7 and 60.2 months, respectively. ??Local recurrence was detected in 4 (13.3%) LCA patients only (P= 0.02). ??Overall survival was comparable between LPN and LCA at 3 and 5 years, respectively (P= 0.74). The LPN group had superior cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years compared to the LCA group (P < 0.05, for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS ??Given adequate technical expertise, both LPN and LCA are viable nephron-sparing options for patients with tumour in a solitary kidney. ??Although LCA is technically easier and has superior functional outcomes, oncologic outcomes are superior after LPN.

AB  - In the year 2003, the 13th Australian Society for Psychophysiology Conference had a particular significance by combining with a pre-conference workshop on Neuroscan conducted by Ross Fulham and Alex Sergejew. The workshop was made possible by the loan of Neuroscan dongles by Compumedics. The Scientific Program of the ASP meeting was composed of invited keynote speakers, oral and poster presentations on the most advanced findings in all aspects of psychophysiology, and neuroimaging. The keynote speakers were Professor Richard Silberstein from Swinburne University, Melbourne, Victoria and Dr Françoise Macar from CRNS, Marseille, France. Oral and poster presentations were given by 55 attendees, and spanned both psychophysiology and neuroimaging topics in cognition and emotion, attention, language and memory, as well as individual differences, human factors and autonomic function. The presentations also covered neuroinformatics and new methods, and clinical applications to disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder and Parkinson's disease. Student prizes were presented to Kate Briggs ? best poster (honours); Andrew Kemp ? best poster (postgraduate); Hannah Keage ? best platform presentation (honours); and Melinda Veltmeyer ? best platform presentation (postgraduate).

AB  - Abstract Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug often used to treat multiple myeloma, can cause hypo- or hyperthyroidism. We present a patient being treated with lenalidomide for 2 years who developed severe hypothyroidism that was complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Thyroid function tests should be serially monitored in patients taking lenalidomide.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Deceased donor (DD) kidneys exhibiting severe atherosclerosis involving the renal artery (RA) may represent a contraindication to kidney transplantation (KT). Methods Eversion endarterectomy (EE) was performed as a salvage procedure to permit KT. Results We identified 17 cases (1.2% of all DD KTs during the study period) involving EE of the DD RA. Thirteen (76.5%) kidneys were imported, and mean Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) was 81%. Mean DD age was 59 years, mean RA plaque length was 1.7 cm, and mean glomerulosclerosis on biopsy was 10%. Mean recipient age was 64 years, and dialysis vintage was 32 months. With a mean follow-up of 36 months, actual patient and graft survival rates were both 76.5%. One patient died early without a technical problem. Of the remaining 16 patients, 2-year patient and graft survival rates were both 100%. There were no early or late vascular complications. The incidence of delayed graft function was 35%. Mean serum creatinine and GFR levels in patients with functioning grafts at latest follow-up were 1.8 mg/dL and 40 mL/min, respectively. Conclusions EE appears to be a safe and under-utilized procedure that may prevent discard of marginal donor kidneys and is associated with acceptable short-term outcomes.
