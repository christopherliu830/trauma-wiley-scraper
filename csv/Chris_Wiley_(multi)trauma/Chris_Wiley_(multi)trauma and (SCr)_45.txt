AB  - This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of school-based Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on cognition, behavior, socio-emotional outcomes and academic achievement. The review summarizes 61 studies and synthesizes 35 studies, with a total of 6,207 student participants. MBIs have a small, statistically significant positive effect on cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes. But there is not a significant effect on behavioral and academic outcomes. There was little heterogeneity for all outcomes, besides behavioral outcomes, suggesting that the interventions produced similar results across studies on cognitive, socio-emotional and academic outcomes despite the interventions being quite diverse. Plain language summary Mindfulness-based interventions in schools have positive effects on cognitive and socio-emotional processes but do not improve behavior and academic achievement MBIs have a small, positive effect on cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes, but not a significant effect on behavioral and academic outcomes. The review in brief The use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in schools has been on the rise. Schools are using MBI's to reduce student stress and anxiety and improve socio-emotional competencies, student behavior and academic achievement. MBIs have small, positive effects on cognitive and socio-emotional processes but these effects were not seen for behavioral or academic outcomes. The studies are mostly of moderate to low quality. Therefore, further evidence from independent evaluators is needed to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of intervention. What did this review study? With the diverse application and findings of positive effects of mindfulness practices with adults, as well as the growing popularity with the public, MBIs are increasingly being used with youth. Over the past several years, MBIs have received growing interest for use in schools to support socio-emotional development and improve behavior and academic achievement. This review examines the effects of school-based MBIs on cognitive, behavioral, socio-emotional and academic achievement outcomes with youth in a primary or secondary school setting. MBIs are interventions that use a mindfulness component, broadly defined as ?paying attention in a particularly way: on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally?, often with other components, such as yoga, cognitive-behavioral strategies, or relaxation skills training. What studies are included? Included studies used a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental, single group pre-post test or single subject design and reported at least one of these outcomes: cognition, academic performance, behavior, socio-emotional, and physiological. Study populations include preschool, primary and secondary school students. A total of 61 studies are included in the review, but only the 35 randomized or quasi-experimental studies are used in the meta-analysis. Most of the studies were carried out in North America, and others in Asia, Europe and Canada. All interventions were conducted in a group format. Interventions ranged in duration (4-28 weeks) and number of sessions (6-125 sessions) and frequency of meetings (once every two weeks to five times a week). What is the aim of this review? This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of school-based MBIs on cognition, behavior, socio-emotional outcomes and academic achievement. The review summarizes 61 studies and synthesizes 35 studies, with a total of 6,207 student participants. What are the main results in this review? MBIs have a small, statistically significant positive effect on cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes. But there is not a significant effect on behavioral and academic outcomes. There was little heterogeneity for all outcomes, besides behavioral outcomes, suggesting that the interventions produced similar results across studies on cognitive, socio-emotional and academic outcomes despite the interventions being quite diverse. What do the findings in this review mean? Findings from this review indicate mixed effects of MBIs in schools. There is some indication that MBIs can improve cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes, but no support for improvement in behavior or academic achievement. Despite the growing support of MBIs for adults, youth may not benefit in the same ways or to the same extent as adults. While not well studied, anecdotal evidence indicates costs and adverse effects of these types of interventions that should be better studied and weighed against the small to no effects on different types of outcomes when considering adoption of MBIs in schools. These findings should be read with caution given the weakness of the evidence produced by the studies. The high risk of bias present in the studies means that further evidence is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of intervention. The evidence from this review urges caution in the widespread adoption of MBIs and encourages rigorous evaluation of the practice should schools choose to implement it. How up-to-date is this review? The review authors searched for studies published until May 2015. This Campbell systematic review was published in March 2017. Executive summary BACKGROUND Due to educational policy initiatives over the last two decades, school districts across the United States have placed more emphasis on improving academic standards and accountability. Indeed, children are spending between 20 to 25 hours per year on meeting federal, state and local school-district testing requirements (Hart et al., 2015). This increased emphasis on academic standards and high stakes testing has, at least in part, been blamed for the increasing levels of stress and anxiety children are experiencing (APA, 2009; Merkangas et al., 2010; Pope, 2010). In addition to changes in education policy requiring an increased emphasis on academic standards and accountability, schools are increasingly expected to attend to the social, emotional, and behavioral needs and problems of students. Given that as many as 13% to 20% children in the U.S. are experiencing one or more mental disorders (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013), schools are increasingly challenged to respond to the growing emotional and behavioral needs of their students. Moreover, socioemotional development and competencies have been linked to learning and academic achievement, and have thus become a target for school-based interventions as a means of improving learning and academic achievement (Durlak, Weisberg, Dymnicki, Taylor,  Eisenberg, Spinrade,  Zins  deVibe et al., 2012; Cramer, Haller, Lauche,  Vollestad, B. Nielsen,  Regehr, Glancy,  Kabat-Zinn, 1979; Bootzin  Segal, Williams,  Semple, Reid,  Singh et al., 2007), and Learning to Breath (LTB; Broderick  Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins,  g = 0.25 (95% CI [0.06, 0.43], p = .01) and socioemotional outcomes (k = 28; g = 0.22 (95% CI [0.14, 0.30], p < .001), and small and non-significant effects on academic outcomes (k = 5; g = 0.27 (95% CI [-0.04, 0.57], p = .08.) and behavioral outcomes (k = 13; g = 0.14 (95% CI [-0.02, 0.30], p = .08). Heterogeneity was small and not statistically significant in all meta-analyses with the exception of behavioral outcomes (I2 = 48%; T2 = .034; Q = 22.96, p = .03). Six studies measured physiological factors, with three of those studies from the same author team. Due to the nature of these measures, the time dependency of some of these measures (cannot compare AM cortisol to PM cortisol for example), and that so few studies measured these outcomes, quantitatively synthesizing these outcomes across these studies was not warranted. Overall, there wasa moderate to high risk of bias across the 35 studies included in the meta-analyses, with variation in high risk areas across studies. Twenty-one studies (60%) were rated low risk and 14 studies (40%) were rated high risk of bias for random sequence generation. Only one study reported that participants and study and school staff were blinded to program allocation (Sibinga et al., 2013), although they did not specify how they blinded study and school staff to condition. The remaining studies were rated as high risk (86%) or unclear risk (11%). Most of the studies in this review were rated as low risk of attrition bias (74%). For the studies included in the meta-analyses, most studies were assessed as unclear risk for reporting bias as we could not find any protocols of studies with which to compare planned to actual reported outcomes. It must be noted, however, that several studies reported to use, and then only reported data for, subscales of measures rather than reporting the full measure score or all subscale scores. Thus, it is unclear whether the a priori intentions of these authors were to only use certain subscales or if the participants did complete the full measure and the study authors only described the use of and reported data for the subscale only. We also coded for additional factors related to potential bias in this corpus of studies: researcher allegiance bias, funding source bias, and confounding factors. Of the 35 studies included in the meta-analysis, we were able to clearly identify an author role in the development and/or delivery of the intervention in 18 (51%) of the studies. The funding source was often not reported, or the studies were not funded. In four of the studies (11%), the authors identified a funding source that was also an entity involved in the development or the delivery of the intervention. We also examined whether there were confounding factors with either the treatment or comparison groups. Thirteen studies (37%) were assessed as having a confound at the level of the instructor (n = 7; only one instructor in treatment, control or both conditions) or at the school/classroom level (n = 6; one classroom or school in the treatment, control or both conditions). A larger mean effect was observed for studies in which a confound was present, thus likely upwardly biasing results; however, we conducted sensitivity analysis and found that the difference in magnitude of effect between studies with and without confounds was not statistically significant. AUTHORS? CONCLUSIONS Results indicate mixed results of school-based mindfulness interventions across the outcomes of interest in this review, with finding favorable impacts of mindfulness interventions on those processes that are likely more directly targeted by mindfulness interventions, namely cognitive and socioemotional outcomes. We found a lack of support at posttest to indicate that those positive effects on cognitive and socioemotional outcomes then translate into favorable outcomes for academic and behavioral outcomes as is hypothesized. The lack of heterogeneity for all outcomes with the exception of the behavioral outcomes indicate that the interventions in this review, although quite diverse in their characteristics, produced similar results across studies on cognitive, socioemotional and academic outcomes. These findings provide some support for the use of school-based mindfulness interventions for some outcomes, but do not provide overwhelming support of MBIs as being the panacea as some have advocated. The quality of the evidence varied, with some important risks of bias present across a large proportion of studies which threatens the internal validity of the included studies and is cause for caution in interpreting the results of this review. Overall, the evidence from this review urges caution in the enthusiasm for, and widespread adoption of, school-based mindfulness interventions for children and youth. While the evidence points to positive effects on socioemotional and cognitive outcomes, there is a lack of evidence of effects on academic and behavioral outcomes. Despite the empirical support of mindfulness-based interventions for adults, children and adolescents may not benefit from mindfulness-based interventions similarly to adults. Children and adolescents may not be developmentally ready for the complex cognitive tasks, focus and level of awareness that mindfulness-based interventions require. Moreover, we know little about the costs and adverse effects of school-based mindfulness interventions?the costs of implementing these programs may not be justified, and there are some indications that mindfulness-based interventions may have some adverse effects on children and youth; however, these have not been adequately examined. If schools do want to implement mindfulness-based interventions, we urge schools to evaluate the practice in a rigorous way and monitor outcomes and costs.

AB  - In this paper, we argue that clients who purchase commercial sex from victims of forced prostitution should be strictly liable in torts towards the victims. Such an approach is both normatively defensible and doctrinally feasible. Fairness and equality demand that clients would compensate victims, even if one refuses to acknowledge that purchasing sex from a prostitute who might be a victim is a faulty behaviour. Clients profit from the activity of purchasing commercial sex, so fairness demands they will bear the costs they impose on victims who are unable to refuse the contact. Strict liability will bring about desirable distributive results along the lines of sex, class and race. Imposing strict liability will ensure consistency of the English law of trespass and it is supported by several instrumental considerations. Such strict liability could be grounded in battery, despite the appearance of apparent consent by the victim to sell sexual services to the client. This is so for two main reasons. First, the extreme coercion operated on the victim renders her consent void so that an innocent third party cannot rely on the appearance of consent. Secondly, the client should be considered as having constructive notice with respect to the trafficker's coercion. Our argument is supported by ? but does not hinge upon accepting ? the insight that the client's behaviour is ultimately faulty. ?Why do you come here? Is it possible ? is it possible you don't understand how horrible it is? Your medical books tell you that every one of these women dies prematurely of consumption or something; art tells you that morally they are dead even earlier. Every one of them dies because she has in her time to entertain five hundred men on an average, let us say. Each one of them is killed by five hundred men. You are among those five hundred! If each of you in the course of your lives visits this place or others like it two hundred and fifty times, it follows that one woman is killed for every two of you! Can't you understand that? Isn't it horrible to murder, two of you, three of you, five of you, a foolish, hungry woman! Ah! isn't it awful, my God!? (Anton Chekhov, A Nervous Breakdown)
