AB  - In the year 2002 the 12th Australian Society for Psychophysiology Conference had a particular significance by combining its meeting for the first time with the 6th Australian Functional Brain Mapping Symposium. The Scientific Program of the ASP and AFBM meeting was composed of Invited Keynote Speakers, Oral and Poster Presentations on the most advanced findings in all aspects of psychophysiology and neuroimaging. The conference was also preceded by a workshop on the SPM software package for neuroimaging analysis. The Keynote speakers were Professors Ruben and Raquel Gur from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. Oral and poster presentations were given by over 100 attendees, and spanned both psychophysiology and neuroimaging topics in cognition and emotion, attention, language and memory, as well as individual differences, human factors and autonomic function. The presentations also covered data basing, neuroinformatics and new methods, and clinical applications to disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - After a child's death to cancer, families commonly want continued connection with the healthcare team that cared for their child, yet bereavement follow-up is often sporadic. A comprehensive literature search found that many bereaved parents experience poor psychological outcomes during bereavement and that parents want follow-up and benefit from continued connection with their child's healthcare providers. Evidence suggests that the standard of care should consist of at least one meaningful contact between the healthcare team and bereaved parents to identify those at risk for negative psychosocial sequelae and to provide resources for bereavement support.

AB  - The influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on transplanted kidney outcome is not well understood. The aim of this one-centre study was to analyse the association between tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interferon-? (IFN-?) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) genotypes and the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and 5-year kidney graft loss. Genotyping was performed in 199 subsequent kidney graft recipients from deceased donors without induction therapy based on polymerase chain reaction method using sequence-specific primers for TNF-α (-308A/G), IL-10 (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C), IL-6 (-174G/C), IFN-? (+874T/A) and TGF-?1 (in codons 10T/C and 25G/C). Genotypes were grouped according to the strength of cytokine expression. During a 5-year follow-up period, 14 patients died with functioning graft and 33 developed graft failure. The analysed polymorphisms were not associated with the incidence of DGF. The frequency of early episodes of AR was significantly associated only with TGF-?1 genotype. There was an association between -174G/C IL-6 gene polymorphism and the death-censored kidney graft survival. The risk of graft loss during 5-year follow-up period was greater by 57% for GG or GC (higher IL-6 production) than for CC carriers. None of the other analysed polymorphisms significantly influenced both patients and kidney graft survival, also in the analysis of the subgroup with human leucocyte antigen-DR mismatch. -174G/C IL-6 genotype of the kidney graft recipient could modulate the rate of graft excretory function deterioration and the risk of graft loss by influencing their constitutional expression.
