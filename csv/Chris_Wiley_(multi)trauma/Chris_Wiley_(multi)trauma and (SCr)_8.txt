AB  - Abstract This article highlights preclinical and clinical studies in the field of wasting disorders that were presented at the 12th Cachexia Conference held in Berlin, Germany, in December 2019. Herein, we summarize the biological and clinical significance of different strategies including antibodies that target Fn14, Spsb 1, SAA1 treatment, ZIP14, a MuRF1 inhibitor, and new diagnostic tools like T-cell communication targets and cut-offs for the detection of skeletal muscle wasting. Of particular interest were the transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells and muscle stem cell communication. Importantly, one presentation discussed the effect of metal ion transporter ZIP14 loss that reduces cancer-induced cachexia. The potential of anti-ZIP14 antibodies and zinc chelation as anti-cachexia therapy may require testing in patients with cancer cachexia. Large clinical studies were presented such as RePOWER (observational study of patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy), MMPOWER (treatment with elamipretide in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy), and ACT-ONE as well as new mouse models like the KPP mouse. Promising treatments include rapamycin analogue treatment, anamorelin, elanapril, glucocorticoids, SAA1, antibodies that target Fn14, and a MuRF1 inhibitor. Clinical studies investigated novel approaches, including the role of exercise. It remains a fact, however, that effective treatments for cachexia and wasting disorders are urgently needed in order to improve patients' quality of life and their survival.

AB  - The article endeavors, from a point of view informed by domestic violence (DV) research, to provide information, options, and tools that may help judicial (and nonjudicial) mediators make settlement processes equitable and safe. While opinions about the use of mediation and judicial dispute resolution in domestic violence cases are polarized, the reality is that the vast majority of these cases are settled by lawyers prior to trial, by judges in dispute resolution processes, by mediators, or by intimate (and formerly intimate) partners themselves. Thus the ultimate goal of this article is not to weigh the merits of settlement against litigation; instead the goal is to support the work of judges and mediators in making settlement processes equitable and safe. Key Points for the Family Court Community Judicial dispute resolution (JDR) is a recognized component of judicial practice Some JDR cases will involve intimate partner violence Identifying and responding to domestic violence violence by type Screening for domestic violence Pre-dispute-resolution assessments: of risk, of parties, and of process Options to enhance due process and safety

AB  - Purpose We investigate the importance of high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate on oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion imaging for human brain imaging and evaluate human brain imaging with OGSE on the MAGNUS head-gradient insert (200 mT/m amplitude and 500 T/m/s slew rate). Methods Simulations with cosine-modulated and trapezoidal-cosine OGSE at various gradient amplitudes and slew rates were performed. Six healthy subjects were imaged with the MAGNUS gradient at 3T with OGSE at frequencies up to 100 Hz and b = 450 s/mm2. Comparisons were made against standard pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion in vivo and in an isotropic diffusion phantom. Results Simulations show that to achieve high frequency and b-value simultaneously for OGSE, high gradient amplitude, high slew rates, and high peripheral nerve stimulation limits are required. A strong linear trend for increased diffusivity (mean: 8?19%, radial: 9?27%, parallel: 8?15%) was observed in normal white matter with OGSE (20 Hz to 100 Hz) as compared to PGSE. Linear fitting to frequency provided excellent correlation, and using a short-range disorder model provided radial long-term diffusivities of D∞,MD = 911 ± 72 µm2/s, D∞,PD = 1519 ± 164 µm2/s, and D∞,RD = 640 ± 111 µm2/s and correlation lengths of lc,MD = 0.802 ± 0.156 µm, lc,PD = 0.837 ± 0.172 µm, and lc,RD = 0.780 ± 0.174 µm. Diffusivity changes with OGSE frequency were negligible in the phantom, as expected. Conclusion The high gradient amplitude, high slew rate, and high peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of the MAGNUS head-gradient enables OGSE acquisition for in vivo human brain imaging.

AB  - Summary Overall, more than 60 hand/forearm/arm transplantations and 16 face transplantations have been performed in the past 12?years. In the European experience summarized here, three grafts have been lost in response to a vascular thrombosis (n?=?1), rejection and incompliance with immunosuppression (n?=?1) and death (n?=?1). The overall functional and esthetic outcome is very satisfactory, but serious side effects and complications related to immunosuppression are challenges hindering progress in this field. The high levels of immunosuppression, skin rejection, nerve regeneration, donor legislation and the acceptance level need to be addressed to promote growth of this promising new field in transplantation and reconstructive surgery.

AB  - Summary.? Background:? Increasing the threshold to define a positive D-dimer could reduce unnecessary computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) but might increase rates of a missed PE and missed pneumonia, the most common non-thromboembolic diagnosis seen on CTPA. Objective:? Measure the effect of doubling the standard D-dimer threshold for ?PE unlikely? Revised Geneva (RGS) or Wells? scores on the exclusion rate, frequency and size of a missed PE and missed pneumonia. Methods:? Patients evaluated for a suspected PE with 64-channel CTPA were prospectively enrolled from emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient units of four hospitals. Pretest probability data were collected in real time and the D-dimer was measured in a central laboratory. Criterion standard was CPTA interpretation by two independent radiologists combined with clinical outcome at 30?days. Results:? Of 678 patients enrolled, 126 (19%) were PE+ and 93 (14%) had pneumonia. Use of either Wells??≤?4 or RGS?≤?6 produced similar results. For example, with RGS?≤?6 and standard threshold (<?500?ng?mL?1), D-dimer was negative in 110/678 (16%), and 4/110 were PE+ (posterior probability 3.8%) and 9/110 (8.2%) had pneumonia. With RGS?≤?6 and a threshold <?1000?ng?mL?1, D-dimer was negative in 208/678 (31%) and 11/208 (5.3%) were PE+, but 10/11 missed PEs were subsegmental and none had concomitant DVT. Pneumonia was found in 12/208 (5.4%) with RGS?≤?6 and D-dimer?<?1000?ng?mL?1. Conclusions:? Doubling the threshold for a positive D-dimer with a PE unlikely pretest probability could reduce CTPA scanning with a slightly increased risk of missed isolated subsegmental PE, and no increase in rate of missed pneumonia.
