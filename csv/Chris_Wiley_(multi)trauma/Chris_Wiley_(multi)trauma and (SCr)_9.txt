AB  - Summary Cumulative evidence indicates a role for the complement system in both pathology and recovery after ischemic stroke. Here, we review the current understanding of the dual role of complement in poststroke injury and recovery, and discuss the challenges of anti-complement therapies. Most complement directed therapeutics currently under investigation or development systemically inhibit the complement system, but since complement is important for immune surveillance and is involved in various homeostatic activities, there are potential risks associated with systemic inhibition. Depending on the target within the complement pathway, other concerns are high concentrations of inhibitor required, low efficacy and poor bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, approaches to target complement inhibitors to specific sites have been investigated. Here, we discuss targeting strategies, with a focus on strategies developed in our lab, to specifically localize complement inhibition to sites of tissue injury and complement activation, and in particular to the postischemic brain. We discuss various injury site-specific targeted complement inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic stroke treatment, as well as their use as investigative tools for probing complement-dependent pathophysiological processes.

AB  - Background Mortality prediction models are applied in the intensive care unit (ICU) to stratify patients into different risk categories and to facilitate benchmarking. To ensure that the correct prediction models are applied for these purposes, the best performing models must be identified. As a first step, we aimed to establish a systematic review of mortality prediction models in critically ill patients. Methods Mortality prediction models were searched in four databases using the following criteria: developed for use in adult ICU patients in high-income countries, with mortality as primary or secondary outcome. Characteristics and performance measures of the models were summarized. Performance was presented in terms of discrimination, calibration and overall performance measures presented in the original publication. Results In total, 43 mortality prediction models were included in the final analysis. In all, 15 models were only internally validated (35%), 13 externally (30%) and 10 (23%) were both internally and externally validated by the original researchers. Discrimination was assessed in 42 models (98%). Commonly used calibration measures were the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (60%) and the calibration plot (28%). Calibration was not assessed in 11 models (26%). Overall performance was assessed in the Brier score (19%) and the Nagelkerke's R2 (4.7%). Conclusions Mortality prediction models have varying methodology, and validation and performance of individual models differ. External validation by the original researchers is often lacking and head-to-head comparisons are urgently needed to identify the best performing mortality prediction models for guiding clinical care and research in different settings and populations.

AB  - ABSTRACT This report on end-of-life decision-making in Canada was produced by an international expert panel and commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada. It consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 reviews what is known about end-of-life care and opinions about assisted dying in Canada. Chapter 2 reviews the legal status quo in Canada with regard to various forms of assisted death. Chapter 3 reviews ethical issues pertaining to assisted death. The analysis is grounded in core values central to Canada's constitutional order. Chapter 4 reviews the experiences had in a number of jurisdictions that have decriminalized or recently reviewed assisted dying in some shape or form. Chapter 5 provides recommendations with regard to the provision of palliative care in Canada, as well as recommendations for reform with respect to the various forms of assisted death covered in this document.

AB  - Abstract Kidneys from pDDs are increasingly used to narrow the huge gap between incremental demand and static supply. However, there is still controversy on the clinical outcome of SKT from pDDs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 452 adult recipients in our center between March 2012 and February 2017. Outcomes of 3 groups, transplants with organs from pDDs (n=50), aDDs (n=207), and LDs (n=195), were compared. The mean age and weight of pDDs were 8.98 years (range 8 months-17 years) and 30.05 kg (range 8.2-55 kg), respectively. There was no difference in 1-year (96.0%, 98.1%, and 99.0%, respectively, P=.277) and 3-year patient survival (96.0%, 98.1%, and 99.0%, respectively, P=.277) or in 1-year (96.0%, 96.6%, and 98.5%, P=.307) and 3-year (96.0%, 96.6% and 97.9%, P=.437) graft survival. SCr, eGFR, and allograft size were similar among the 3 groups at 6th month post-transplant and thereafter. Incidence of DGF was higher in patients of the aDD group than those in the pDD group (22.7% vs 10.0%, P<.001), but there was no difference in AR and infection. SKT from pDDs to adult recipients is effective and safe with acceptable outcomes, and it will be a promising expansion to the donor pool.
