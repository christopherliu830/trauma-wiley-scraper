AB  - Abstract Objective Regionalised civilian trauma systems improve patient outcomes, but may deskill clinicians outside major trauma services (MTSs). We aimed to characterise experience and confidence in trauma management among emergency physicians working in MTS to those working elsewhere. Methods Emergency physicians working within the Victorian State Trauma System were surveyed about their pre- and post-fellowship training experience, their estimated hours per fortnight in different centres, the frequency of performance/supervision of critical emergency skills and their confidence in a range of trauma skills. Results The 138 respondents analysed represented 33% of active Victorian FACEMs. The cohort were mostly males (69.6%), younger than 50 (75.4%) and were generally (69.6%) six or more years post-fellowship. FACEMs working in a MTS were more likely to have been a trauma registrar prior to fellowship (13.3% vs 3.7%, P = 0.046). MTS clinicians performed more, supervised more and were more confident in trauma team leading, traumatic airway management and rapid infusion catheter and multi-access catheters. Confidence in trauma team leading was only associated with exposure to performance or supervision of trauma team leading. Performance of trauma team leading was more common in clinicians at a MTS (odds ratio 3.19, 95%?CI 1.00?10.20, P = 0.05). Conclusion Exposure to major trauma is associated with time spent working in a MTS and exposure is associated with confidence. A mature inclusive trauma system must ensure clinicians across the system gain the experience or training to provide trauma care that will result in similar outcomes for patients regardless of initial presenting hospital.

AB  - calleja p., aitken l.m.  (b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

AB  - Abstract The effect of the fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid on early thrombus formation following microvascular trauma was investigated in the central arteries of ears in 86 rabbits (in all 172 vessels), divided into four separate blind randomised studies. In the first part a common end-to-end anastomosis was done and in the last three studies a severe trauma-arteriotomy/intimectomy was performed. Parameters studied were vessel bleeding times, patency rates, weights of intraluminal thrombotic material, haematocrit and plasma fibrinolytic activity. In the first study consisting of 14 control animals and 18 animals treated with 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid, end-to-end anastomosis was performed on the central artery of one ear and on the central vein of the other ear. In the second, third, and fourth studies consisting of 18, 20, and 16 control vessels and the same number of corresponding vessels in treated animals a 7-mm longitudinal arteriotomy followed by a deep 5-mm-long intimectomy was performed. The second and third treated groups were given 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid 5 min and 1 h, respectively, before reflow and the fourth group 28 mg/kg bw 5 min before reflow. The difference between the second and third studies was the addition, to mimic clinical situations, of 8.5 ml saline/kg bw 2 h before reflow in the third study. In conclusion, treatment with a single clinical dose, 14 mg/kg of tranexamic acid, did not influence vessel bleeding times or thrombus formation in the anastomotic or severe trauma models and seems safe to use. Not even a double clinical dose, 28 mg/kg, influenced thrombus formation in a statistically significant way. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 17:278?285 1996

AB  - Background Workers' compensation (WC) data traditionally provides information to stakeholders on work-related disabling injuries. It is important to complement this with information on serious threat to life (TTL) injury, which is the focus of this paper. Methods In this cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study, based on New Zealand's WC data linked to hospital discharge data, TTL was measured using the ICD10-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS); ICISS?≤?0.941 was used to define serious TTL injury. Results During 2002?2004, there was an average of 368 serious TTL work-related injury cases annually. The distribution of these injuries was very different from those traditionally found using WC data to describe disabling injury. For example, for serious TTL injury the main injury types included traumatic brain injury, whereas for disabling injury it was sprains and dislocations. Conclusions The method presented provides the opportunity for government agencies to produce a national description of the epidemiology of serious TTL work-related injuries. Am. J. Ind.

AB  - Summary Photography should be regarded as an integral part of daily clinical practice, and photographic equipment as part of the dental armamentarium, no different to a dental handpiece. However, the common consensus is that a camera is an extraneous apparatus, exclusively reserved for specialists, or clinicians with a penchant for taking pictures. The technical requirements of a lens for dental photography is that it serves a dual-purpose, first for portraiture and second for close-up or macrophotography. Many cameras have built-in flashes that pop-up when the lighting conditions are less than optimal. This is satisfactory for general photography but ill-advised for macrophotography. Some relatively inexpensive items are also useful for completing the photographic equipment arsenal. These include rechargeable batteries, a multi-card reader for transferring images to a computer, UV bulbs for visualising fluorescence of natural teeth and artificial prostheses, or porosity defects in porcelain restorations.

AB  - Successful treatment and prevention of kidney disease in dogs requires a multi-dimensional approach to identify and eliminate causes or exacerbating factors, provide professional evaluation on a regular basis and implement a comprehensive treatment programme when necessary. Over the years, many therapeutic and preventive interventions have been developed or advocated for chronic kidney disease in dogs, but evidence of efficacy or effectiveness is often lacking or highly variable. Accordingly, the main objective of this systematic review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence supporting various aspects of managing canine chronic kidney disease.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the general health status of asylum seekers and their access to health services. DesignProspective questionnaire survey. SettingA community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. ParticipantsForty of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. Main outcome measuresResults on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of Northern Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. ResultsMore than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P< 0.001) and serious (P< 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P<0.001). Twenty or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; ConclusionsAlthough a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: To present suggestions on planning for development of emergency medicine (EM) and out-of-hospital care in countries that are in an early phase of this process, and to provide basic background information for planners not already familiar with EM. Methods: The techniques and programs used by the authors and others in assisting in EM development in other countries to date are described. Conclusions: Some aspects of EM system development have applicability to most countries, but other aspects must be decided by planners based on country-specific factors. Because of the very recent initiation of many EM system development efforts in other countries, to the authors' knowledge there have not yet been extensive evaluative reports of the efficacy of these efforts. Further studies are needed on the relative effectiveness and cost-benefit of different EM development efforts.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the number and causes of deaths of Australian citizens who died overseas in a 12-month period. DesignRetrospective survey of deaths reported to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by Australian embassies, high commissions and consulates for the period July 1992 to June 1993. Data on Australians travelling overseas were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ResultsDuring the year 1992-1993, 2 299 500 Australians travelled overseas for less than 12 months (short term travellers), with an estimated mean trip duration of 6.3 weeks. Another 65 450 left for more than 12 months (long term travellers), and 27 910 left permanently (residents). Of the 421 recorded deaths, 289 were in short term travellers, 108 in long term travellers/residents and 24 in members of work parties. The annual crude mortality rate for short term travellers and work party members was estimated at about 0.1%. Men outnumbered women almost 4:1. Death rates increased with age, reflecting underlying medical problems in older travellers, with heart disease being the leading cause (146 deaths, 35%). Fatal trauma predominated in younger people. Accidents, mainly in traffic, accounted for 77 deaths (18%) and infections for 10 (2.4%), including two cases of malaria. Death rates varied between geographical regions, with New Zealand being the safest destination. ConclusionsThe risk of an Australian dying while travelling overseas is probably little different from that while staying home. The low level of fatal infections may result from preventive measures. Travellers should be aware of the danger of accidents, particularly traffic accidents, while overseas.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the special applications, which are advanced principles for maximising the full potential of digital dental photography. These include taking additional images for elucidating certain features, or analysing images for effective communicating with patients and fellow colleagues. Whilst the essential dental portfolio, essential portrait portfolio and optional images are sufficient for most modalities, some procedures require specific types of imagery for multi-diagnosis and facilitating collaborative care. In order to demonstrate detailed analysis of hard and soft tissues, the case study shows replacement of defective composite restorations in the maxillary sextant. The photographic set-up uses a single compact flash as the key light on one side, which alternates from the right to left with a silver reflector on the opposite side. Treatment sequencing involves documenting step-by-step clinical or laboratory techniques. Also, a sequence of images can demonstrate the use of particular instruments or materials for a restorative or surgical modality.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Abstract A novel living hyaline cartilage graft (LhCG) with controllable dimensions and free of non-cartilaginous constituents for articular regeneration is developed. As a living graft for regenerative medicine, LhCG is purely living tissue based and truly scaffold-free. The process of neotissue formation in LhCG is mediated by an interim biomaterial-based novel scaffolding system. This design highlights a philosophy of using biomaterials in engineered regenerative medicine as a transient guiding facility rather than a permanent part of substitute. The fabrication is designed and practiced in a continuous and integrated process, which attributes to its simplicity in operation. Because of the intrinsic non-cell-adhesive property of hydrogel scaffolds, articular chondrocytes? phenotype is always preserved throughout the whole procedure, which has been tested and approved both in vitro and in vivo. In situ grafting trials in a rabbit model showcase high success rates in both cartilage repair and graft-host integration. Beyond cartilage repair, this LhCG model may provide a living-tissue-based open platform or niche for multi-tissue regenerations.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

Methods:? 2???104?hMSCs (Bio Whittaker) per fibrin gel were suspended in fibrin formulations with varied fibrinogen (5, 17, 50?mg/ml) and thrombin (250, 167, and 1?U/ml); and cultured in 24-well plates at 37?°C, 5% CO2 for up to 2 weeks. Formulational influences on clot structure were evaluated by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. hMSC proliferation and morphology were monitored by calcein staining. hMSC-conditioned medium was assayed using zymography (MMP-2, MMP-9), fibrin overlay (uPA), and reverse overlay (PAI-1) to examine the effect of fibrin formulation on protease activity and fibrinolysis. Results/Discussions:? Confocal and electron microscopy revealed formulation dependence on three-dimensional fibrin structure, with lower fibrinogen concentrations yielding more open, homogeneous microstructures. Although hMSCs are viable in all fibrin formulations investigated, proliferation rates varied with fibrinogen concentration, with lower fibrinogen concentrations (i.e., 5?mg/ml) promoting greater hMSC proliferation. Protease levels and activities were sensitive to culture time and fibrin formulation. PAI-1 expression was elevated in hMSCs inside fibrin gels, while uPA activity was low. Both the pro and active form of MMP2 was detected by gelatin zymography, but no MMP9 was detected. This study suggests that fibrinogen:thrombin ratio can significantly influence hMSCs proliferation and interactions, and should be carefully considered when developing formulations for optimal delivery of hMSCs.
