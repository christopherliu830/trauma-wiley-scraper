AB  - Key points Inadequate sleep and irregular work schedules have not only adverse consequences for individual health and well-being, but also enormous economic and safety implications for society as a whole. This study demonstrates that visual motion processing and coordinated eye movements are significantly impaired when performed after sleep loss and during the biological night, and thus may be contributing to human error and accidents. Because affected individuals are often unaware of their sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, there is a critical need for non-invasive, objective indicators of mild, yet potentially unsafe, impairment due to disrupted sleep or biological rhythms. Our findings show that a set of eye-movement measures can be used to provide sensitive and reliable indicators of such mild neural impairments. Abstract Sleep loss and circadian misalignment have long been known to impair human cognitive and motor performance with significant societal and health consequences. It is well known that human reaction time to a visual cue is impaired following sleep loss and circadian misalignment, but it has remained unclear how more complex visuomotor control behaviour is altered under these conditions. In this study, we measured 14 parameters of the voluntary ocular tracking response of 12 human participants (six females) to systematically examine the effects of sleep loss and circadian misalignment using a constant routine 24-h acute sleep-deprivation paradigm. The combination of state-of-the-art oculometric and sleep-research methodologies allowed us to document, for the first time, large changes in many components of pursuit, saccades and visual motion processing as a function of time awake and circadian phase. Further, we observed a pattern of impairment across our set of oculometric measures that is qualitatively different from that observed previously with other mild neural impairments. We conclude that dynamic vision and visuomotor control exhibit a distinct pattern of impairment linked with time awake and circadian phase. Therefore, a sufficiently broad set of oculometric measures could provide a sensitive and specific behavioural biomarker of acute sleep loss and circadian misalignment. We foresee potential applications of such oculometric biomarkers assisting in the assessment of readiness-to-perform higher risk tasks and in the characterization of sub-clinical neural impairment in the face of a multiplicity of potential risk factors, including disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms.

AB  - Fibrin clot formation during normal wound healing is essential to hemostasis. Fibrin clots also serve as a scaffold for cells, such as fibroblasts, invading the wound bed. The mechanical characteristics of this fibrin ? fibroblast tissue over a period of time, as the fibrin is replaced with collagen, is not well understood. In this paper, we attempt to measure specific mechanical characteristics in these systems over a period of 10 days by using fibrin ? fibroblasts constructs prepared in a culture dish. We have also examined the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final fibrin clot on these characteristics. A well-established indentation protocol was used to determine the nominal elastic modulus of the cell-fibrin constructs at specified time points. Human fibroblast cell line CRL-2522 was used. Fibrin clots with different fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were prepared as described in Cox et al. (Tissue Engineering, Vol. 10 (5/6): 942) with cell concentration of 50,000 fibroblasts per fibrin clot. Four constructs were prepared for each of the following days 1, 5, and 10. 1?mL of a serum ? containing medium was added to each well, and plates were transferred to a 5% CO2 incubator at 37?°C. On days 1, 5, and 10, the fibrin ? fibroblast constructs were subject to a compressive indentation protocol. This involved applying a circular, flat-ended silica indenter to the surface of the cell/fibrin constructs through controlled displacements until reaching a specified maximum displacement, u*. An Instron 3365 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 2.5?N load cell with a load resolution of 0.1?mN was used. Displacement rates in the range of 5?10?mm/min were used with peak displacements, u*?=?0.1?5?mm. The force required to maintain these displacements was automatically recorded and analyzed for indentation stiffness over the fixed displacement range of 1.0?1.5?mm at 50?msec intervals. Our results indicate that for the unpopulated fibrin, there was a linear (R?=?0.983) relationship between the indentation stiffness and fibrinogen concentration. Also, there was a nonlinear relationship between indentation stiffness and concentration of collagen in the fibrin/collagen constructs. Finally, we found in one of the cell-populated formulations a steady decrease in the indentation stiffness with increasing incubation time (1?10 days), suggesting that the cells exerted a significant effect on the construct structure and hence mechanical function.

AB  - Abstract In many cities throughout North America, human?coyote conflicts are an emerging problem. Little research has described temporal and spatial patterns of human?coyote conflicts, although such information can be an important step in developing and optimizing management efforts. We used reports from 22 entities within the Denver Metropolitan Area (DMA) in Colorado that provided information on coyote observations (signs, sightings, and encounters) and conflicts (incidents, pet-attacks, and human-attacks). Our objectives were to 1) define, quantify, and map categories of coyote observations and conflicts, and 2) investigate temporal and spatial patterns of conflicts, particularly related to land cover types and housing density classes. We compiled 4,006 coyote reports, including 78 signs (1.9%), 3,023 sightings (75.5%), 395 encounters (9.9%), 26 incidents (0.6%), 471 pet-attacks (11.8%), and 13 human-attacks (0.3%). We found a strong seasonal pattern with reports of both observations and conflicts highest during December?March and lowest during July?September. Numbers of coyote conflicts were disproportionately greater in open space and development land cover types (in contrast to natural and agricultural land cover) and in suburban housing areas (in contrast to urban, exurban, and rural areas). Hotspots of coyote conflicts were apparent in the southern region of the DMA, possibly because coyotes had better access to development, and hence interaction with residents, via natural areas bordering urban areas; reporting bias may have also influenced this outcome. Our results will help target management efforts, particularly those focused on people (e.g., education), but also highlight the critical need for improved methods of collecting conflict information via a standardized reporting mechanism to help reduce bias. ? 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The incidence of new HIV infections in Asia and the Pacific will soon pass that in Africa and is projected to increase into the next century. The AIDS epidemic arising from these infections will have enormous consequences for the health and socioeconomic development of a region encompassing more than half the world's population.
