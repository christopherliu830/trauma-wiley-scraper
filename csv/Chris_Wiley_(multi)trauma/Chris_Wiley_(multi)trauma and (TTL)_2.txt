AB  - Lack of sensory feedback during laser surgery prevents surgeons from discerning the exact location of the incision, which increases duration and complexity of the treatment. In this study we demonstrate a new method for monitoring of laser ablation procedures. Real-time tracking of the exact three dimensional (3D) lesion profile is accomplished by detection of shock waves emanating from the ablation spot and subsequent reconstruction of the incision location using time-of-flight data obtained from multiple acoustic detectors. Here, incisions of up to 9 mm in depth, created by pulsed laser ablation of fresh bovine tissue samples, were successfully monitored in real time. It was further observed that, by utilizing as little as 12 detection elements, the incision profile can be characterized with accuracy below 0.5 mm in all three dimensions and in good agreement with histological examinations. The proposed method holds therefore promise for delivering high precision real-time feedback during laser surgeries. (? 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA, Weinheim)

AB  - Abstract Background Defecatory disorders (DD) are defined by clinical and objective features of impaired rectal evacuation. The epidemiology of DD in the population is unknown, partly because many constipated patients do not undergo anorectal tests. Our objectives were to estimate the incidence rate and clinical features of DD in the community. Methods We reviewed the medical records of all patients older than 16 years in Olmsted County, MN, who had constipation and underwent anorectal manometry from 1999 through 2008. Criteria for diagnosing DD were constipation for 6 months or longer and one of the following: (i) abnormal rectal balloon expulsion test; (ii) reduced or increased perineal descent; or (iii) two or more abnormal features with defecography or surface electromyography. Key Results Of 11 112 constipated patients, 516 had undergone anorectal tests; 245 of these (209 women, 36 men) had a DD. The mean (±SD) age at diagnosis was 44 years (±18) among women and 49 years (±19) among men. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 19.3 (95% CI: 16.8?21.8). The age-adjusted incidence per 100 000 person-years was greater (p < 0.0001) in women (31.8, 95% CI: 27.4?36.1) than in men (6.6, 95% CI: 4.4?8.9). Prior to the diagnosis of DD, nearly 30% of patients had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 48% had a psychiatric diagnosis, 18% had a history of abuse, and 21% reported urinary and/or fecal incontinence. Conclusions & Inferences Among constipated patients, DD are fourfold more common in women than men and often associated with IBS and psychiatric diagnoses.

AB  - Summary The photography of injuries, like the photography of latent marks, can often be one of the most photographically satisfying in terms of results. This chapter looks at the potential of some of these techniques to increase contrast and clarity, allowing us to deploy them with confidence and to capture far more than conventional photography can. Before considering how to achieve the best result through photography, it is useful to have a very basic understanding of exactly what is happening medically with a bruise, bite or burn. There are occasions when the requirement for visual supporting evidence is crucial if a case is to progress; it is in these circumstances that the forensic photographers must look at other alternatives, such as infrared, long-wave ultraviolet fluorescence, and deep blue fluorescence. Finally, the chapter discusses the basic equipment required to undertake any injury photography.

AB  - ObjectiveTo analyse trends in prognostic factors at diagnosis of melanoma to indicate targets for health promotion. MethodsCases of melanoma notified to the South Australian Cancer Registry during 1981-1992 (1361 in situ and 4509 invasive) were analysed by tumour site, histological type, stage, thickness, period of diagnosis and sociodemo-graphic characteristics of the patient. ResultsThe relative probability of being diagnosed with an in-situ, rather than a thin invasive, lesion increased progressively between 1984-1986 and 1990-1992. The relative probability of having an in-situ melanoma diagnosed was: lower among those aged 80 years or more; higher among patients residing in the upper socioeconomic areas of Adelaide; high for lesions on the face; and high for lentigo maligna as opposed to superficial spreading lesions. The relative probability of invasive lesions being diagnosed when more than 1.5 mm thick decreased progressively between the 1981-1983 and 1990-1992 diagnosis periods. The relative probability of thick lesions being diagnosed was higher among older patients and for nodular lesions compared with superficial spreading or lentigo maligna lesions. Facial lesions and those in males tended to be thicker. ConclusionsThere are favourable trends towards earlier detection of melanomas in South Australia, probably reflecting the effect of skin-cancer awareness campaigns. Further campaigns should emphasise early detection in people aged 60 years and over, males and residents of less affluent areas. Early detection of nodular melanomas and invasive lesions of the face also warrants special attention.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?.

AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.
