Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Cortical oscillatory dynamics are known to be critical for human movement, although their functional significance remains unclear. In particular, there is a strong beta (15?30 Hz) desynchronization that begins before movement onset and continues during movement, before rebounding after movement termination. Several studies have connected this response to motor planning and/or movement selection operations, but to date such studies have examined only the early aspects of the response (i.e., before movement) and a limited number of parameters. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a novel motor sequence paradigm to probe how motor plan complexity modulates peri-movement beta oscillations, and connectivity within activated circuits. We also examined the dynamics by imaging beta activity before and during movement execution and extracting virtual sensors from key regions. We found stronger beta desynchronization during complex relative to simple sequences in the right parietal and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during movement execution. There was also an increase in functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and right parietal shortly after movement onset during complex but not simple sequences, which produced a significant conditional effect (i.e., complex?>?simple) that was not attributable to differences in response amplitude. This study is the first to demonstrate that complexity modulates the dynamics of the peri-movement beta ERD, which provides crucial new data on the functional role of this well-known oscillatory motor response. These data further suggest that execution of complex motor behavior may recruit key regions of the fronto-parietal network, in addition to traditional sensorimotor regions.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the success of strategies ?including replacing petrol with aviation gasoline (avgas) in the fuel supply, and employment and skills-training programs targeting young people ?in reducing petrol sniffing at Maningrida, an isolated Aboriginal community in northern Australia. MethodsA follow-up study of 13 Aboriginals who were non-sniffers, 15 who were ex-sniffers and 27 who were petrol sniffers in 1992 was conducted by questionnaire in 1994, 20 months after intervention strategies were commenced; 11 non-sniffers, 11 ex-sniffers and 18 petrol sniffers, respectively, participated. Main outcome measuresPetrol-sniffing status, changes in employment status, blood lead levels of the participants, and community crime statistics. ResultsAfter intervention strategies in Maningrida, petrol sniffing ceased, with related crime falling markedly. Employment increased significantly among petrol sniffers, from 7% to 63% (x2= 11.53; df= 1; P< 0.001). Only two petrol sniffers were reported to have continued petrol sniffing elsewhere. Apart from one of these individuals, who had recently returned to Maningrida, blood lead levels fell significantly in those with a history of petrol sniffing, indicating they had not continued to sniff avgas, which contains lead additives (0.8 g/L). ConclusionsWhile avgas introduction was a key element in eliminating petrol sniffing, its apparent lack of success as a single intervention elsewhere indicates the importance of widespread community resolve against petrol sniffing and the development of coordinated employment strategies in successfully eliminating the practice and reducing associated social disruption.

AB  - Abstract The term ?reactive nitrogen species? includes nitrogen monoxide, commonly called nitric oxide, and some other remarkable chemical entities (peroxynitrite, nitrosoperoxycarbonate, etc.) formed mostly from nitrogen monoxide itself in biological environments. Regardless of the specific mechanisms implicated in their effects, however, it is clear that an integrated pharmacological approach to peroxynitrite and related species is only just beginning to take shape. The array of affected chemical and pathological processes is extremely broad. One of the most conspicuous mechanisms observed thus far has been the scavenging of the peroxynitrite anion by molecules endowed with antioxidant activity. This discovery has in turn lent great significance to several naturally occurring and synthetic antioxidants, which usually protect not only against oxidative reactions, but also from nitrating ones, both in vitro and in vivo. This has proven to be beneficial in different tissues, especially within the central nervous system. Taking these results and those of other biochemical investigations into account, many research lines are currently in progress to establish the true potential of reactive nitrogen species deactivators in the therapy of neurological diseases, ischemia-reperfusion damage, renal failure, and lung injury, among others. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Comparatively few cases of mycetoma (?Madura foot?) have been reported in Australia, and only one caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. We report two Aboriginal women from remote communities in central Australia who presented with longstanding mycetomas caused by this organism. Difficulties in diagnosis substantially delayed commencement of effective treatment, illustrating the need to consider this condition in chronic suppurative skin infection.
