AB  - Since the literature has a paucity of documented lesions of the vestibular hair cells and neurons in Meniere's disease, the cause of canal paresis remains unexplained. A clinicopathological correlation was sought and demonstrated between ampullary distortion of lateral canal and reduced caloric response. The findings in this investigation make a strong case for ampullary distortion disrupting the tenuous but vital cupulary attachment resulting in canal paresis. This concept is attractive because it explains an important clinical event in Meniere's disease on the basis of the only consistent histopathological finding, namely, membrane distension.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the estimated death rates associated with alcohol and tobacco use for Australian Aboriginals in Western Australia with those for non-Aboriginals. Method: Deaths attributable to tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were estimated for 1989?1991 with the aetiological fractions method, using data from the Health Department of Western Australia's mortality database. Results: Tobacco smoking was responsible for 15.4% of all deaths and 13.9% of Aboriginal deaths, and alcohol consumption for 5% and 9.2%, respectively. The age-standardised death rates per 100000 person-years for tobacco and alcohol were: Aboriginal males, 271 and 152; other males, 113 and 29; Aboriginal females, 118 and 56; and other females, 32 and 15. Of those who died as a result of tobacco use, 49% of Aboriginal males and 48% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in non-Aboriginal males. For alcohol-related deaths, 62% of Aboriginal males and 70% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 35% and 23%, respectively, in non-Aboriginals. Conclusion: During 1989?1991 tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were responsible for much higher death rates among Aboriginals than among non-Aboriginals in Western Australia.

AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the clinical and epidemiological features of an outbreak of a viral infection affecting humans and horses. SettingStables in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane. SubjectsAffected horses and humans, and at-risk human contacts. Results: A pregnant mare died two days after arrival from a paddock elsewhere in Brisbane. Eight to 11 days later, illness (depression, anorexia, fever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal discharge) was reported among 17 other horses from the same or an adjoining stable. Fourteen horses died or were put down. Five and six days after the index mare's death, a stable-hand and then a horse trainer, both of whom had had close contact with the sick mare's mucous secretions, developed influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand recovered but the trainer developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis, and died from a cardiac arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A morbillivirus cultured from his kidney was identical to one isolated from the lungs of five affected horses. The two affected humans and eight other horses were seropositive for the infection, which was reproduced in healthy horses following challenge by spleen/lung homogenates from infected horses. There was no serological evidence of infection in 157 humans who had had contact with the stables or the sick horses or humans. ConclusionsA previously undescribed morbillivirus infected a probable 21 horses and two humans; one human and 14 horses died. That no further cases were detected among humans suggests that the virus was of low infectivity. The source of infection remains undetermined.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses two main groups of enzymes, namely those involved in cell signalling and those that perform a number of protein modifications, such as glycosylation. The signalling enzymes include protein kinases and phosphatases, cyclases and phosphodiesterases, also an extensive group of small GTP-binding proteins. Some lipid kinases and phosphatases relating to inositol signalling are listed with the protein kinases and protein phosphatases, respectively. Lastly, the 'other signalling enzymes' list entries (prenyltransferases and phospholipases for example), that do not readily fit into the other categories. The protein modification enzymes are involved in protein synthesis and folding, as well as breakdown by peptidases and their inhibitors. There are also sections devoted to glycosylation, ubiquitylation (and related) modifications as well as specific (epigenetic) modifications to chromatin proteins. The section on 'other protein modifications' includes such diverse enzymes as the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, transglutaminases and tubulin tyrosine ligases.
