AB  - Abstract Functionalization of material surfaces can improve their biointegration and bactericidal effect. To expand the biomedical applications of titanium in artificial cornea implantation surgery, titanium alloy substrates were coated with polydopamine and dual bound with recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-microbial peptide (AMP), SESB2V. Successful chemical binding was assessed with attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Coating thickness was assessed by atomic force microscopy. Cellular studies revealed that the functionalized substrates displayed the abilities to enhance primary human corneal fibroblast adhesion, proliferation, and viability. Angiogenesis assay with human mesenchymal stem cells was used to verify the biological functions of immobilized VEGF while bactericidal assay was evaluated for the anti-microbial activities of immobilized SESB2V peptide. We found that the titanium surface that was sequentially functionalized with VEGF and SESB2V had enhanced fibroblast proliferation and anti-microbial properties. The incorporation of such peptides into an artificial cornea implant is important for implant-tissue integration and wound healing. This may improve implant integration and reduce the risk of device infection following artificial cornea implantation. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2012.

AB  - Abstract Background Poorer surgical outcomes in older patients undergoing locoregional head and neck reconstruction have raised questions about tolerance of aging tissue to iatrogenic ischemic insults. Methods We examined the effects of aging on viability of pedicled composite flaps in 2-month and 6-month old Sprague?Dawley male rats and correlated flap survival with vascular endogenous growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2-mediated signaling events. Flap segments were assessed for gross/cellular necrosis by optical microscopy and for proangiogenic, apoptotic, and proliferative protein-marker content. Results Flap necrosis significantly increased with age (4.2% in young vs 49.17% in old), correlating with reduced expression of VEGF, inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Akt activation, impaired Akt-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation, elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activation of Caspase-3, upregulated nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage and lower proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) levels. Conclusion Pedicled flap survival is higher in younger rats in part because of unhindered expression of VEGF and enhanced activity of cell survival and promigratory signaling pathways. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF) in stab and freeze brain injury models in rats. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-VEGF antibodies demonstrated an increase in VEGF-positive cells in and around both lesions. Morphologically, the injury-induced VEGF-positive cells resembled astrocytes. Double immunofluorescent staining for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and VEGF demonstrated directly that VEGF-positive cells which appeared in response to these injuries were astrocytes. VEGF expression in astrocytes was maximal on days 3 and 4 after injury in terms of both cell number and affected area. The increase in VEGF-positive cells was more widespread in the freeze lesion than in the stab wound, and occurred in both the lesioned and nonlesioned hemispheres. VEGF-positive cells were still present 3 weeks after both injuries, but their numbers were reduced and their distribution became limited to the immediate vicinity of the lesions. These observations indicate that astrocytes react to injury by increasing VEGF expression, suggesting that VEGF might participate in the central nervous system response to injury. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract Hydrogels are promising materials in regenerative medicine applications, due to their hydrophilicity, biocompatibility and capacity to release drugs and growth factors in a controlled manner. In this study, biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels based on blends of natural polymers were used in in vitro and ex vivo experiments as a tool for VEGF-controlled release to accelerate the nerve regeneration process. Among different candidates, the angiogenic factor VEGF was selected, since angiogenesis has been long recognized as an important and necessary step during tissue repair. Recent studies have pointed out that VEGF has a beneficial effect on motor neuron survival and Schwann cell vitality and proliferation. Moreover, VEGF administration can sustain and enhance the growth of regenerating peripheral nerve fibres. The hydrogel preparation process was optimized to allow functional incorporation of VEGF, while preventing its degradation and denaturation. VEGF release was quantified through ELISA assay, whereas released VEGF bioactivity was validated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a Schwann cell line (RT4-D6P2T) by assessing VEGFR-2 and downstream effectors Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, dorsal root ganglia explants cultured on VEGF-releasing hydrogels displayed increased neurite outgrowth, providing confirmation that released VEGF maintained its effect, as also confirmed in a tubulogenesis assay. In conclusion, a gelatin-based hydrogel system for bioactive VEGF delivery was developed and characterized for its applicability in neural tissue engineering. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Understanding dentinogenesis and pulp regeneration during physiological and pathological conditions represents a real challenge in the provision of a suitable treatment that ideally leads to the induction of the pulp regenerative potential. This paper focusses on the early steps of dentin?pulp regeneration that appear to be critical after pulp capping procedures. Different models are described in this paper where the interactions between different cell types in vitro illustrate their role in maintaining pulpal homeostasis. After traumatic injuries, the cells modify the local pulpal microenvironment by secreting growth factors that orchestrate and induce the processes required for dentin?pulp regeneration. Applying dental materials onto the injured pulp modifies this local microenvironment and affects the potential for pulpal regeneration. The paper also describes the added value of developing an entire human tooth culture model for understanding these early steps and discusses the interest of its use in evaluating newly developed pulp capping materials through the example of BiodentineTM, developed as a dentin substitute. The growth factors sustained release simulating the local microenvironment is also discussed. Simulating the pulp local environment with a continuous growth factors release is also a basic requirement for establishing future pulp tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell based therapies for the repair and regeneration of various tissues are of great interest for a high number of diseases. Adult stem cells, instead, are more available, abundant and harvested with minimally invasive procedures. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent progenitors, able to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and adipose tissues. Human adult adipose tissue seems to be the most abundant source of MSCs and, due to its easy accessibility; it is able to give a considerable amount of stem cells. In this study, we selected MSCs co-expressing CD34 and CD90 from adipose tissue. This stem cell population displayed higher proliferative capacity than CD34?CD90? cells and was able to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes (PPAR?+ and adiponectin+) and endothelial cells (CD31+VEGF+Flk1+). In addition, in methylcellulose without VEGF, it formed a vascular network. The aim of this study was to investigate differentiation potential of human adipose CD34+/CD90+ stem cells loaded onto commercial collagen sponges already used in clinical practice (Gingistat) both in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that human adult adipose and loose connective tissues can be obtained in vivo, highlighting that CD34+/CD90 ASCs are extremely useful for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5 ? 10?9, 10?8, 10?7 mol/L) of P4 or 10?6 mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9 mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7 mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6 mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9 mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7 mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the risk factors reported to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The most important risk factors for VTE are a history of previous VTE, recent surgery, hospital in-patient stay and cancer. Pulmonary embolism remains the most widely reported preventable cause of death in patients undergoing surgery. It is the most common cause of death within 30 days of surgery, with 40% of VTE events occurring later than three weeks post operatively. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery are among the highest risk patients (odds ratio?>?10), and this includes total hip and knee arthroplasty, hip/leg fractures, major orthopaedic trauma and spinal surgery. Lower limb immobilisation in casts, with or without surgery, increases the risk of VTE. Approximately 70-80% of fatal hospital-acquired thrombosis (HAT) occurs in medical patients. Venous thrombosis is increased in most acute medical conditions, necessitating hospital admission.

AB  - Abstract Diseases that jeopardize the musculoskeletal system and cause chronic impairment are prevalent throughout the Western world. In Germany alone, ~1.8 million patients suffer from these diseases annually, and medical expenses have been reported to reach 34.2bn Euros. Although musculoskeletal disorders are seldom fatal, they compromise quality of life and diminish functional capacity. For example, musculoskeletal disorders incur an annual loss of over 0.8 million workforce years to the German economy. Among these diseases, traumatic skeletal muscle injuries are especially problematic because they can occur owing to a variety of causes and are very challenging to treat. In contrast to chronic muscle diseases such as dystrophy, sarcopenia, or cachexia, traumatic muscle injuries inflict damage to localized muscle groups. Although minor muscle trauma heals without severe consequences, no reliable clinical strategy exists to prevent excessive fibrosis or fatty degeneration, both of which occur after severe traumatic injury and contribute to muscle degeneration and dysfunction. Of the many proposed strategies, cell-based approaches have shown the most promising results in numerous pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated success in the handful of clinical trials performed so far. A number of myogenic and non-myogenic cell types benefit muscle healing, either by directly participating in new tissue formation or by stimulating the endogenous processes of muscle repair. These cell types operate via distinct modes of action, and they demonstrate varying levels of feasibility for muscle regeneration depending, to an extent, on the muscle injury model used. While in some models the injury naturally resolves over time, other models have been developed to recapitulate the peculiarities of real-life injuries and therefore mimic the structural and functional impairment observed in humans. Existing limitations of cell therapy approaches include issues related to autologous harvesting, expansion and sorting protocols, optimal dosage, and viability after transplantation. Several clinical trials have been performed to treat skeletal muscle injuries using myogenic progenitor cells or multipotent stromal cells, with promising outcomes. Recent improvements in our understanding of cell behaviour and the mechanistic basis for their modes of action have led to a new paradigm in cell therapies where physical, chemical, and signalling cues presented through biomaterials can instruct cells and enhance their regenerative capacity. Altogether, these studies and experiences provide a positive outlook on future opportunities towards innovative cell-based solutions for treating traumatic muscle injuries?a so far unmet clinical need.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that combined intracavernosal injection with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with adeno-associated virus-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (AAV-BDNF) synergistically facilitates the neural regeneration and erectile function after cavernosal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into five equal groups: eight had a sham operation while 32 had bilateral cavernosal nerve freezing followed by an immediate intracavernosal injection with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), VEGF, AAV-BDNF, or AAV-BDNF?+?VEGF. Erectile function was assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 3?months, and samples of the major pelvic ganglia and penile tissue were evaluated histologically. RESULTS In this animal model of impotence from nerve injury, the recovery of erectile function was greatest in those receiving AAV-BDNF?+?VEGF; the mean (sd) maximal intracavernosal pressure in this group was 87.2?(20.78)?cmH2O, compared with 37.3?(11.39) for VEGF alone and 49.8?(29.58) for AAV-BDNF alone. No erectile dysfunction was identified in the sham group, with a pressure of 100.7?(22.70)?cmH2O, while all treatment groups significantly outperformed the PBS (control) group, at 29.3?(13.52)?cmH2O. Furthermore, all animals receiving monotherapy or combined treatment had more NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve fibres than controls but less than in the sham group. CONCLUSION Bilateral cavernosal nerve freezing causes erectile dysfunction with accompanying neurological changes. Intracavernosal injection with either VEGF or AAV-BDNF alone enhances nerve regeneration, with combined therapy (VEGF and AAV-BDNF) promoting neural and erectile recovery additively.

AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - ABSTRACT Spinal cord injury (SCI) is global health concern. The effective strategies for SCI are relevant to the improvement on nerve regeneration microenvironment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important cytokine for inducing angiogenesis and accelerating nerve system function recovery from injury. We proposed that VEGF could improve nerve regeneration in SCI. However, an uncontrolled delivery system target to injury site not only decreases the therapeutic efficacy but also increases the risk of tumor information. We implanted collagen scaffold (CS) targeted with a constructed protein, collagen-binding VEGF (CBD-VEGF), to bridge transected spine cord gap in a rat transected SCI model. Functional and histological examinations were conducted to assess the repair capacity of the delivery system CS/CBD-VEGF. The results indicated that the implantation of CS/CBD-VEGF into the model rats improved the survival rate and exerted beneficial effect on functional recovery. The controlled intervention improved the microenvironment, guided axon growth, and promoted neovascularization at the injury site. Therefore, the delivery system with stable binding of VEGF potentially provides a better therapeutic option for SCI. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Aims The effect of combustion smoke inhalation on the respiratory system is widely reported but its effects on the central nervous system remain unclear. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of smoke inhalation on the cerebellum and hippocampus which are areas vulnerable to hypoxia injury. Methods Adult male Sprague?Dawley rats were subjected to combustion smoke inhalation and sacrificed at 0.5, 3, 24 and 72?h after exposure. The cerebellum and hippocampus were subjected to Western analysis for VEGF, iNOS, eNOS, nNOS and AQP4 expression; ELISA analysis for cytokine and chemokine levels; and immunohistochemistry for GFAP/AQP4, RECA-1/RITC and TUNEL. Aminoguanidine (AG) was administered to determine the effects of iNOS after smoke inhalation. Results Both the cerebellum and hippocampus showed a significant increase in VEGF, iNOS, eNOS, nNOS and AQP4 expression with corresponding increases in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased AQP4 expression and RITC permeability after smoke exposure. AG was able to decrease the expression of iNOS, followed by VEGF, eNOS, nNOS, RITC and AQP4 after smoke exposure. There was also a significant increase in TUNEL+ cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus which were not significantly reduced by AG. Beam walk test revealed immediate deficits after smoke inhalation which was attenuated with AG. Conclusion The findings suggest that iNOS plays a major role in the central nervous system inflammatory pathophysiology after smoke inhalation exposure with concomitant increase in proinflammatory molecules, vascular permeability and oedema, for which the cerebellum appears to be more vulnerable to smoke exposure than the hippocampus.

AB  - The authors have developed a CDS by culturing fibroblasts on the two-layered spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid (HA) and atelo-collagen (Col). This CDS is designed to promote wound healing by synergistic effect of fibroblasts and matrix. Both HA and Col molecules seem to function biologically in the process of wound healing. HA molecules play a critical role in several cellular functions such as migration and proliferation by promoting adhesion and disadhesion between the cell and the tissue substrate. Besides providing structural support and strength to the new tissue, Col molecules have a profound effect on the cells within and on its matrix. Col and Col-derived peptides act as chemoattractants for fibroblasts in vitro and may have a similar activity in vivo. Fibroblasts seeded on the Col surface of two-layered spongy matrix were found to attach, proliferate, and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as fibronectin. The cryopreserved CDS was found to keep the original potency to release VEGF after thawing followed by re-culturing. Multi-center's clinical research using allogeneic CDS has been proceeded as a national millennium project for regenerative medicine. These products are able to be stored in a freezer and transported to other hospitals in a frozen state. The clinical evaluation involving 180 cases has been already conducted using allogeneic cryopreserved CDS at 30 hospitals across Japan since April 2001. The results obtained in our clinical study suggest that this type of allogeneic CDS is able to provide an effective therapy for patients with severe full-thickness skin defects. These excellent clinical evaluations seem to be closely related to the results obtained in this fundamental study, especially related to the potency of cryopreserved allogeneic CDS to release VEGF and fibronectin.

AB  - Abstract Objective Soft tissue (ST) dehiscence with graft exposure is a frequent complication of vertical augmentation. Flap dehiscence is caused by failure to achieve tension-free primary wound closure and by the impairment of flap microcirculation due to surgical trauma. Soft tissue expansion (STE) increases ST quality and quantity prior to reconstructive surgery. We hypothesized that flap preconditioning using STE would reduce the incidence of ST complications after bone augmentation and that optimized ST healing would improve the outcome of bone regeneration. Materials and methods Self-filling tissue expanders were implanted in mandibular bone defects in ten beagle dogs. After expansion, alloplastic scaffolds were placed for vertical bone augmentation in STE sites and in control sites without STE pre-treatment. ST flap microcirculation was analysed using laser Doppler flowmetry. The incidence of graft exposures was evaluated after 2 weeks. Bone formation was assessed after 2 months, using histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. Results Test sites showed significantly less impairment of perfusion and faster recovery of microcirculation after bone augmentation. Furthermore, no flap dehiscences occurred in STE sites. Bone regeneration was found in both groups; however, significantly greater formation of new bone was detected in test sites with preceding STE. Conclusions Preconditioning using STE improved ST healing and bone formation after vertical augmentation. The combination of STE and the subsequent placement of alloplastic scaffolds may facilitate the reconstruction of severe bone defects.
