AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.

AB  - Summary The journey from emerging technology to therapeutic paradigm change follows a rocky road. The development of monoclonal antibodies as a commercially viable industry exemplifies this. Several technological S-curves have been navigated to make mAbs the conventional pharmaceuticals that they have become today: from discovery and engineering to clinical translation and industrial scale manufacturing. The transformational nature of these new molecules has generated a multi-billion dollar global industry. A historic recollection of the defining events that shaped the mAb technology is particularly relevant to regenerative medicine in general and therapeutic stem cells in particular. A point of inflexion in the value of mAb transactions occurred with the commercial success of the first mAb blockbuster (rituximab), triggering multi-billion USD licensing transactions and very large M (3) enhancement of biological attributes, (4) combination with conventional drugs, (5) delivery devices and formulation, and (6) solid organ transplantation. Each co-evolutionary advance contributes to the clinical, economic and access to care value proposition that makes or breaks a technology, as it transitions from bench to bedside.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary Orthobiologics have emerged as new treatment options in human and animal athletes. Musculoskeletal disorders such as tendinopathies, desmopathies, and osteoarthritis are common in competition and working dogs because of stresses induced by their repetitive activities. Several therapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, shockwave therapy, and surgery have been used to treat these disorders, but variable levels of evidence and success have been reported. Tendon and ligament healing potential is limited, especially in chronic injuries, which are commonly seen in athletes. Therefore, novel regenerative treatment approaches are of great interest in sports medicine. There are two goals of this chapter. First, the definitions and proposed mechanisms of action for different orthobiologics are reviewed; second, the clinical applications and the evidence for efficacy of these novel treatments are discussed. The chapter focuses on two major topics. Platelet-rich plasma is reviewed in detail, as this is the most commonly used orthobiologic in veterinary medicine. Stem cell applications are also presented, focusing on musculoskeletal and spinal injuries. The chapter is not intended to provide a thorough review of the literature on these topics, but aims to introduce the sports medicine and rehabilitation therapist to the growing area of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Aims Urethral stricture (US) formation is caused by fibrosis after excessive collagen formation following an injury or trauma to the urethra. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on a urethral injury (UI) model of male rats. Methods A UI model was used by applying a coagulation current to the urethras of male rats. There were four groups with six rats in each: control group, PRP applied to naive urethra, UI group, and UI with PRP application. PRP was applied to the urethra after a coagulation current-induced injury as soon as possible. On the 14th day, all rats were sacrificed and urethral tissues were investigated for collagen type I, collagen type III, platelet-derived growth factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor-?, and transforming growth factor-? using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The effect of urethral damage and healing was evaluated for collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio. Results The collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio was significantly higher in UI group (P?<?0.05) than in the others, while UI with PRP application group had comparable results with the control group (P?>?0.05). Conclusions The results of this study show that PRP has a preventive effect on stricture formation in a UI model of rats, as shown by its effect on collagen synthesis. Further studies that eventually show the effects of PRP on human tissues are necessary and promising.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - Abstract Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been clinically investigated as an adjuvant local therapy for brain tumors. Therapeutic interventions intended to promote tumor cell death can also promote changes in the tumor microenvironment that could favor tumor growth. We have previously shown that PDT can activate pro-angiogenic factors in the normal rodent brain. This study seeks to further elucidate the effects of subtherapeutic doses of Photofrin-PDT on normal brain and to establish a mouse model for studying glioma progression in an environment modified by oxidative stress. Photofrin was administered to nude mice, and a defined intracranial area was illuminated with laser to deliver an optical dose equivalent to 80 J/cm2. Three and 7 days after PDT, mice were sacrificed and brains were fixed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. PDT treatment resulted in transient increase in cell proliferation, associated with a robust activation of astrocytes and microglia in the treated region, without causing substantial cell death. To test how this modified environment would affect glioma growth, human glioblastoma U87 cells were implanted in the PDT-treated hemisphere or in the control brain subjected to sham surgery. Significantly larger tumors were observed after 3 weeks in the PDT treated brains relative to control treatment. Our results indicate that subclinical Photofrin-PDT locally alters the brain homeostasis without inflicting significant disruption to the tissue architecture, providing a model to study the effects of the microenvironment on glioma growth, with implications for the optimization of the clinical use of PDT for brain tumors. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Abstract The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is an important physiologic barrier that separates CNS from soluble inflammatory mediators and effector immune cells from peripheral circulation. The optimum function of the BBB is necessary for the homeostasis, maintenance, and proper neuronal function. The clinical and experimental findings have shown that BBB dysfunction is an early hallmark of various neurologic disorders ranging from inflammatory autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and traumatic diseases to neuroinvasive infections. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the regulation of BBB function under homeostatic and neuroinflammatory conditions. Several neurologic disease-modifying drugs have shown to improve the BBB function. However, they have a broad-acting immunomodulatory function and can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. The recent development of in vitro multicomponent 3-dimensional BBB models coupled with fluidics chamber as well as a cell-type specific reporter and knockout mice gave a new boost to our understanding of the dynamics of the BBB. In the review, we discuss the current understanding of BBB composition and recent findings that illustrate the critical regulatory elements of the BBB function under physiologic and inflammatory conditions, and also suggested the strategies to control BBB structure and function.

AB  - Objectives To investigate thalidomide as an adjuvant treatment for canine haemangiosarcoma. Materials and Methods Fifteen dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma, initially treated by splenectomy, were included. Following recovery from surgery, all dogs received thalidomide continuously until their death. Tumour stage was established using CT scans of the chest and abdomen immediately before starting thalidomide treatment and again three months later. Cause of death was confirmed by post mortem examination. Results The median survival time of dogs receiving thalidomide was 172?days (95% confidence interval: 93 to 250?days). Five dogs (33% of the population receiving thalidomide) survived more than 1 year (range 458 to 660?days) after surgery. Dogs with stage 2 disease that received thalidomide also had a longer survival time than dogs with stage 3 disease (median survival time 303 versus 40?days). Of 15 dogs, 13 died from metastatic haemangiosarcoma. Clinical Significance Treatment using thalidomide may improve survival of dogs with splenic haemangiosarcoma and should be considered a possible adjuvant therapy.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Objectives:?? Extended radical pelvic resection for advanced primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy is an increasingly common procedure in major colorectal units. Aggressive pre operative chemo-radio therapy creates a cohort of patients with difficult reconstructive variables. We review our plastic surgical reconstructions in this highly heterogeneous population. Method:?? Utilizing the coding system at our institution we identified a cohort of patients whom underwent Vertical Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (VRAM) reconstruction for exenterative pelvic surgery. A thorough retrospective case note analysis was performed specifically looking at three variable subsets. Demographic data and peri-operative care Reconstructive surgical procedures and complications Tumour variables and patient survival outcomes Results:?? Statistical analysis of the patient cohort and subsets will be presented Conclusions:?? This study has demonstrated the versatility of the VRAM flap in obtaining a stable and supple reconstructive cover in advanced pelvic malignancy surgery. Our series confirms strong support for immediate VRAM reconstruction in all pelvic exenterative procedures. We have shown patients undergoing multi-visceral resection after prior chemo-radiotherapy can achieve early, healed and stable perineal closure with low morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Acellular nerves possess the structural and biochemical features similar to those of naive endoneurial tubes, and have been proved bioactive for allogeneil graft in nerve tissue engineering. However, the source of allogenic donators is restricted in clinical treatment. To explore sufficient substitutes for acellular nerve allografts (ANA), we investigated the effectiveness of acellular nerve xenografts (ANX) combined with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on repairing peripheral nerve injuries. The acellular nerves derived from Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits were prepared, respectively, and BMSCs were implanted into the nerve scaffolds and cultured in vitro. All the grafts were employed to bridge 1 cm rat sciatic nerve gaps. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 per group): ANA group, ANX group, BMSCs-laden ANA group, BMSCs-laden ANX group, and autologous nerve graft group. At 8 weeks post-transplantation, electrophysiological study was performed and the regenerated nerves were assayed morphologically. Besides, growth-promoting factors in the regenerated tissues following the BMSCs integration were detected. The results indicated that compared with the acellular nerve control groups, nerve regeneration and functional rehabilitation for the xenogenic nervetransplantation integrated with BMSCs were advanced significantly, and the rehabilitation efficacy was comparable with that of the autografting. The expression of neurotrophic factors in the regenerated nerves, together with that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord and muscles were elevated largely. In conclusion, ANX implanted with BMSCs could replace allografts to promote nerve regeneration effectively, which offers a reliable approach for repairing peripheral nerve defects.

Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored. Progress is slow due to several challenges such as but not limited to the choice of ink used for cell encapsulation, optimal cell source, bioprinting method suitable for replicating the heterogeneous tissues and organs, and so on. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in bioprinting of bone, their limitations, challenges, and strategies for future improvisations. The generated knowledge will provide deep insights on our current understanding of the cellular interactions with the hydrogel matrices and help to unravel new methodologies for facilitating precisely regulated stem cell behaviour.

AB  - Human perinatal tissues have been used for over a century as allogeneic biomaterials. Due to their advantageous properties including angiogenecity, anti-inflammation, anti-microbial, and immune privilege, these tissues are being utilized for novel applications across wide-ranging medical disciplines. Given continued clinical success, increased adoption of perinatal tissues as a disruptive technology platform has allowed for significant penetration into the multi-billion dollar biologics market. Here, we review current progress and future applications of perinatal biomaterials, as well as associated regulatory issues.

AB  - Abstract Bioprinting as an enabling technology for tissue engineering possesses the promises to fabricate highly mimicked tissue or organs with digital control. As one of the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting has the advantages of high throughput and precise control of both scaffold and cells. Therefore, this technology is not only ideal for translational medicine but also for basic research applications. Bioprinting has already been widely applied to construct functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In this review, the authors introduce the most popular techniques currently applied in bioprinting, as well as the various bioprinting processes. In addition, the composition of bioink including scaffolds and cells are described. Furthermore, the most current applications in organ and tissue bioprinting are introduced. The authors also discuss the challenges we are currently facing and the great potential of bioprinting. This technology has the capacity not only in complex tissue structure fabrication based on the converted medical images, but also as an efficient tool for drug discovery and preclinical testing. One of the most promising future advances of bioprinting is to develop a standard medical device with the capacity of treating patients directly on the repairing site, which requires the development of automation and robotic technology, as well as our further understanding of biomaterials and stem cell biology to integrate various printing mechanisms for multi-phasic tissue engineering.
