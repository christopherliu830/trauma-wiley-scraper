AB  - Objectives Two large multicenter randomised trials were performed in France to assess whether systematic screening with an artery uteroplacental Doppler (AUD) in low-risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low-dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and of preeclampsia. Study design and population The first trial ?Seine Saint-Denis? (SSD) trial included 3317 low-risk pregnant women (multi and primigravidae) in 17 French maternity Hospitals and the second ?Erasme? trial included 1869 primigravidae in 12 centres. In the Doppler group, the AUD was performed between 20 and 24?weeks, and women with abnormal results received 100?mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week. Results In the Doppler group, 232 patients (15.7%) had an abnormal result in the SSD trial and 20% in the ERASME trial. The predictive value of the AUD was comparable to that reported in the studies of low-risk populations, but with a low sensitivity. Finally, IUGR, whether defined by the third or tenth percentile, and preeclampsia did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in both trials. Conclusions There is no proof justifying the recommendation of a systematic AUD in a low-risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increase in prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of preeclampsia and IUGR. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled can aspirin prove its efficacy.

AB  - Abstract As an endogenous neuroprotectant agent, adenosine is extensively distributed and is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). Under physiological conditions, the concentration of adenosine is low intra- and extracellularly, but increases significantly in response to stress. The majority of adenosine functions are receptor-mediated, and primarily include the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R). Adenosine is currently widely used in the treatment of diseases of the CNS and the cardiovascular systems, and the mechanisms are related to the disease types, disease locations, and the adenosine receptors distribution in the CNS. For example, the main infarction sites of cerebral ischemia are cortex and striatum, which have high levels of A1 and A2A receptors. Cerebral ischemia is manifested with A1R decrease and A2AR increase, as well as reduction in the A1R-mediated inhibitory processes and enhancement of the A2AR-mediated excitatory process. Adenosine receptor dysfunction is also involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and epilepsy. Thus, the adenosine receptor balance theory is important for brain disease treatment. The concentration of adenosine can be increased by endogenous or exogenous pathways due to its short half-life and high inactivation properties. Therefore, we will discuss the function of adenosine and its receptors, adenosine formation, and metabolism, and its role for the treatment of CNS diseases (such as cerebral ischemia, AD, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders). This article will provide a scientific basis for the development of novel adenosine derivatives through adenosine structure modification, which will lead to experimental applications.

AB  - Neurotoxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy treatment, with unclear molecular mechanisms. Clinical studies suggest that the most frequent neurotoxic adverse events affect memory and learning, attention, concentration, processing speeds and executive function. Emerging preclinical research points toward direct cellular toxicity and induction of neuroinflammation as key drivers of neurotoxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment. Emerging data now show detectable levels of some chemotherapeutic agents within the CNS, indicating potential disruption of blood brain barrier integrity or transport mechanisms. Blood brain barrier disruption is a key aspect of many neurocognitive disorders, particularly those characterized by a proinflammatory state. Importantly, many proinflammatory mediators able to modulate the blood brain barrier are generated by tissues and organs that are targets for chemotherapy-associated toxicities. This review therefore aims to explore the hypothesis that peripherally derived inflammatory cytokines disrupt blood brain barrier permeability, thereby increasing direct access of chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS to facilitate neuroinflammation and central neurotoxicity.

AB  - Abdominal wall hernia is a recurrent issue world-wide and requires the implantation of over 1 million meshes per year. Because permanent meshes such as polypropylene and polyester are not free of complications after implantation, many mesh modifications and new functionalities have been investigated over the last decade. Indeed, mesh optimization is the focus of intense development and the biomaterials utilized are now envisioned as being bioactive substrates that trigger various physiological processes in order to prevent complications and to promote tissue integration. In this context, it is of paramount interest to review the most relevant bio-functionalities being brought to new meshes and to open new avenues for the innovative development of the next generation of meshes with enhanced properties for functional abdominal wall hernia repair.

AB  - Abstract Stem cells are known to maintain stemness at least in part through secreted factors that promote stem-like phenotypes in resident cells. Accumulating evidence has clarified that stem cells release nano-vesicles, known as exosomes, which may serve as mediators of cell-to-cell communication and may potentially transmit stem cell phenotypes to recipient cells, facilitating stem cell maintenance, differentiation, self-renewal, and repair. It has become apparent that stem cell-derived exosomes mediate interactions among stromal elements, promote genetic instability in recipient cells, and induce malignant transformation. This review will therefore discuss the potential of stem cell-derived exosomes in the context of stromal remodeling and their ability to generate cancer-initiating cells in a tumor niche by inducing morphologic and functional differentiation of fibroblasts into tumor-initiating fibroblasts. In addition, the immunosuppressive potential of stem cell-derived exosomes in cancer immunotherapy and their prospective applications in cell-free therapies in future translational medicine is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Vascularization is an essential process in bone formation, remodeling and regeneration during both bone development and fracture repair. Vascularization remains a big challenge directly leading to the final success of newly regenerated bone. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of different angiogenesis assays and bone defect models are described in details for investigating revascularization of materials of interest. Unlike conventional angiogenesis study with growth factors or pharmaceutical molecules performed in two-dimension, special considerations are taken into account whether these assays can be translated for testing three-dimensional implantable devices. Over the years, accurate and quantifiable in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays have been extensively demonstrated to be useful in examining how new blood vessels grow. These methods can contribute to the fundamental understanding of angiogenic properties of the materials, but a bone defect model is still pivotal in order to understand the cascade actions of angiogenesis along with bone formation. Finally, angiogenesis and osteogenesis are both complex processes interacting with each other, the choice of which assay to be performed should adequately address the clinical relevance and reflect the sequence of responses of revascularization of the test materials.

AB  - Veins used as grafts in heart bypass or as access points in hemodialysis exhibit high failure rates, thereby causing significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Interventional or revisional surgeries required to correct these failures have been met with limited success and exorbitant costs, particularly for the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Vein stenosis or occlusion leading to failure is primarily the result of neointimal hyperplasia. Systemic therapies have achieved little long-term success, indicating the need for more localized, sustained, biomaterial-based solutions. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of external stents to reduce neointimal hyperplasia. However, successful results from animal models have failed to translate to the clinic thus far, and no external stent is currently approved for use in the US to prevent vein graft or hemodialysis access failures. This review discusses current progress in the field, design considerations, and future perspectives for biomaterial-based external stents. More comparative studies iteratively modulating biomaterial and biomaterial-drug approaches are critical in addressing mechanistic knowledge gaps associated with external stent application to the arteriovenous environment. Addressing these gaps will ultimately lead to more viable solutions that prevent vein graft and hemodialysis access failures.

AB  - Biofilm infections are one of the modern medical world's greatest challenges. Probably, all non-obligate intracellular bacteria and fungi can establish biofilms. In addition, there are numerous biofilm-related infections, both foreign body-related and non-foreign body-related. Although biofilm infections can present in numerous ways, one common feature is involvement of the host response with significant impact on the course. A special characteristic is the synergy of the innate and the acquired immune responses for the induced pathology. Here, we review the impact of the host response for the course of biofilm infections, with special focus on cystic fibrosis, chronic wounds and infective endocarditis.

AB  - Abstract Polysucrose (PSuc) is hydrophilic, has excellent biocompatibility with cells as a density gradient and is resistant to enzymes. Its use in electrospun mats for tissue engineering applications has not been investigated due to its amorphous nature. For spinnability and robustness, polysucrose was blended with poly-L-lactide (PLLA) and polydioxanone (PDX) respectively and electrospun into nanofibrous mats. Interaction with cells was assessed using L929 mouse fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes separately and in co-culture. Effect of parameters such as porosity, fiber diameter, surface wettability and mechanical properties of mats on cell-scaffold interactions was studied. Depending on nature and composition of mats, fibroblasts showed dendritic, spindle or round cell morphologies along with the formation of lamellipodia, filopodia, fibrillar or fiber-like projections of 100 nm and 200?300 nm in diameter respectively from the periphery or center of cells. Granular extracellular matrix was formed on both PLLA-PSuc and PDX-PSuc 50?50 seeded with keratinocytes. Growth of keratinocytes was enhanced in co-culture with fibroblasts with the formation of a skin-like layer. Both cells showed the ability to form multilayer structures. The mats maintained their physical integrity during the period of study. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 106A: 3275?3291, 2018.
