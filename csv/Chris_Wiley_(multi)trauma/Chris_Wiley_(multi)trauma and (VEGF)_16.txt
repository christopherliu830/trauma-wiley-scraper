AB  - Abstract Cervical cancer is the third leading cause of female death in the world. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently considered to be valuable as noninvasive cancer biomarkers, but their role in the prognosis of cervical cancer has not been elucidated. We aimed to find serum miRNAs that can be used as prognostic factors for cervical cancer. A traumatic pathological biopsy is the only reliable method for determining the severity of cervical cancer currently. Thus, noninvasive diagnostic markers are needed. The serological expression of candidate miRNAs were measured in 90 participants, including 60 patients with cervical cancer and 50 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two patients with cervical cancer were excluded from the study because of lack of data. miRNAs were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miR-143/?4636 appeared specific for cervical cancer compared with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P?<?.001). The classification performance of validated miRNAs for cervical cancer [Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)?=?0.942] was better than that reached by squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag; AUC?=?0.727). Poor-differentiation group has lower miR-143/?4636 levels in serum (P?<?.05). miR-4636 level was correlated gross tumor volume and the depth of invasion (P?<?.0001). In our study, we found a combination of miR-143 and miR-4636 that is independently and strongly associated with cervical cancer prognosis and can be used as a clinically prognostic factor.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Dentofacial defects can be small or very large, consisting of defects in the craniomaxillofacial region with missing soft tissue, bony and other hard tissue components. Such combined mucosal, osseous and even cartilaginous defects can be reconstructed using flaps and bone grafts, or hopefully, in the future with bone graft substitutes or even tissue engineered constructs. The healing of such wounds always relies on the vascularity of the surrounding tissues. This chapter seeks to provide a physiological basis for the mechanisms involved in the healing of such large complex defects. The reconstruction of specific defects must follow sound and logical surgical principles. The authors employ the concept of the reconstructive surgical ladder, in which techniques of step-wise increasing complexity are used with a strong preference for the simplest possible procedure at the outset. A number of techniques are presented along with the principles of tissue engineering and the basis for bone regeneration using adipose derived stem cells, growth factors and resorbable scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract There are increasing reports of using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat advanced liver disease. We consider several critical issues that underlie this approach. For example, are there multipotent stem cell populations in human adult bone marrow? Can they develop into liver cells or supporting cell types? What are stromal stem/progenitor cells, and can they promote tissue repair without replacing hepatocytes? Does reversal of end-stage liver disease require new hepatocytes, a new liver microenvironment, both, neither or something else? Although many of these questions are unanswered, we consider the conceptual and experimental bases underlying these issues and critically analyze results of clinical trials of stem cell therapy of end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Minocycline is a second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been in therapeutic use for over 30 years because of its antibiotic properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is mainly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris and some sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, it has been reported that tetracyclines can exert a variety of biological actions that are independent of their anti-microbial activity, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. These findings specifically concern to minocycline as it has recently been found to have multiple non-antibiotic biological effects that are beneficial in experimental models of various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatitis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, minocycline has also emerged as the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotection. This effect has been confirmed in experimental models of ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain, and of several neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Moreover, other pre-clinical studies have shown its ability to inhibit malignant cell growth and activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus, and to prevent bone resorption. Considering the above-mentioned findings, this review will cover the most important topics in the pharmacology of minocycline to date, supporting its evaluation as a new therapeutic approach for many of the diseases described herein.

AB  - Abstract Wound healing is an inherent response resulting in the restoration of tissue integrity. It is a complex process involving cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The dermal tissue is an important component of skin that acts as a connecting link between the epidermis and hypodermis. The appearance of scars and contractures after autologous split-thickness skin transplantation or single epidermis diaphragm transplantation for full skin defects indicates that the dermal tissue plays an important role in skin regeneration. Theoretically, dermis cannot regenerate like the liver, bone and epidermis after being destroyed by burns or avulsion. Scarring is hard to avoid during the process of natural healing. However, if the dermis could be reconstructed perfectly, this would be a breakthrough in the methods used for wound healing. In this review, we summarize recent research about dermal regeneration and discuss the probability of advances in the field. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Neural regeneration devices interface with the nervous system and can provide flexibility in material choice, implantation without the need for additional surgeries, and the ability to serve as guides augmented with physical, biological (e.g., cellular), and biochemical functionalities. Given the complexity and challenges associated with neural regeneration, a 3D printing approach to the design and manufacturing of neural devices can provide next-generation opportunities for advanced neural regeneration via the production of anatomically accurate geometries, spatial distributions of cellular components, and incorporation of therapeutic biomolecules. A 3D printing-based approach offers compatibility with 3D scanning, computer modeling, choice of input material, and increasing control over hierarchical integration. Therefore, a 3D printed implantable platform can ultimately be used to prepare novel biomimetic scaffolds and model complex tissue architectures for clinical implants in order to treat neurological diseases and injuries. Further, the flexibility and specificity offered by 3D printed in vitro platforms have the potential to be a significant foundational breakthrough with broad research implications in cell signaling and drug screening for personalized healthcare. This progress report examines recent advances in 3D printing strategies for neural regeneration as well as insight into how these approaches can be improved in future studies.
