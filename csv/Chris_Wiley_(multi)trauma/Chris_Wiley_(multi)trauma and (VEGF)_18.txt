AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Abstract Aims: We studied the effect of binge drinking on surgical dexterity immediately after and the morning after alcohol intake. Methods: Five surgeons (all males, age 31?42 years) were trained on laparoscopic surgical simulator (MIST-VR) to reach a desired standard of performance. Three sets of experiments were a control with no alcohol and full night's sleep, a sham night out (sleep deprived) without alcohol and a night out with alcohol ad libitum. Parameters recorded were average time taken to perform task, error rate, average diathermy time and diathermy (damage) time to main object. Comparisons between baseline readings, those in the middle of night and those of following morning were made with Wilcoxon signed ranks test (all two tailed, significance at P < 0.01). Results: The candidates consumed on an average 10.33 (range 6?15) units of alcohol and had 0.86 per cent (range 0.71?1.1 per cent) of breath alcohol levels and had an average of 3.75 (range 3?5 h) hours of sleep after a typical night out. The morning-after breath alcohol levels were 0 per cent. There was significant deterioration in the performance indicators in all the parameters immediately after alcohol consumption. The time taken to complete task and the time when the diathermy was used were still significantly worse the morning after the typical night out. The sham night out showed deterioration only on time parameters with control night out showed no changes. Conclusions: A typical night out deteriorates performance on a surgical simulator, which persists till the following morning as compared to just a ?nonalcoholic? night out.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Major general surgical operations, especially for malignancy, are associated with a high risk of venous thrombo-embolic (VTE) complications, of which about 40 per cent occur after discharge. In this systematic review we examine the value of extended thrombo-prophylaxis. Methods: Three randomized, controlled trials, which studied 1 week versus 4 weeks of thromboprophylaxis (TP) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), were included in the analysis. We used RevMan (Version 4.1.1, Oxford  P = 0.002). The risk of bleeding was 3.5 per cent in both groups (OR 0.99, 95 per cent CI 0.47?2.06; P = 1). Conclusions: Extended TP results in significant reduction of the risk of developing VTE in patients undergoing major general surgical operations without any increase in the risk of bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Aims: To assess the effects of surgery and ANH on coagulation. Methods: A total of 33 patients randomized to ANH (n = 17)/no ANH (n = 16), undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, were prospectively studied. Coagulation tests included aPTTR, INR, platelets, fibrinogen and thromboelastography (TEG). Results: There was no significant difference between groups at entry. In ?no ANH?, as operation progressed, there was a decrease in platelet count (P < 0.001) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increase in aPTTR (P = 0.002) and INR (P = 0.001). The TEG confirmed this; decrease in alpha angle (P = 0.006), MA (P = 0.003) and G (P = 0.001), increase in K (P = 0.008). Prior to knife to skin, ANH reduced platelet count (P = 0.003) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increased aPTTR (0.003) and INR (P = 0.001). R time was shortened (P = 0.001) but MA (P = 0.001) and G (P < 0.001) decreased. Re-transfusion of autologous blood increased platelet count (P = 0.03) and fibrinogen (P = 0.004), decreased aPTTR (P = 0.017) and INR (P = 0.002), without affecting the TEG. Between the groups, at the time of knife to skin, the ANH group had a lower platelet count (P < 0.001), increased INR (P = 0.006), reduced MA (P = 0.010) and G (P = 0.011), but shortened R time (P = 0.004). At 1 h into operation, the platelet count remained lower (P = 0.002), the INR (P = 0.005) and aPTTR (P = 0.008) significantly prolonged. Immediately prior to re-transfusion the only difference was a prolonged INR (P = 0.023). By the end of the operation there was no difference between groups. In addition there was no difference in estimated blood loss. Conclusions: Coagulation is significantly impaired as operation progresses. Acute normovolaemic haemodilution impairs coagulation; this remains significantly impaired throughout operation.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Tissue repair of primary inguinal hernia using mesh relies on scar tissue bonding the mesh to give a sound repair. Collagen has the theoretical advantage of using natural collagen which will be incorporated into the repair and not be a permanent foreign body. Methods: A total of 140 patients were prospectively randomized to receive either polypropylene or collagen mesh. Performance was compared at operation, postoperatively, 3 months, 12 months. Patient's perceptions and quality of life were measured. Patients and researchers were blinded and analysis was undertaken at a separate institution. Results: A total of 78 patients received collagen and 62 received polypropylene mesh, with no difference in handling, insertion and suturing at operation. Postoperatively there was an increase in haematoma in the polypropylene group (P = 0.048). Infection and inflammation were similar postoperatively and at 3 months. There was one recurrent hernia in each group at 1 year. Activity and pain scores postoperatively were similar and were normal by 4 weeks. Quality of life was reduced in both groups at 4 weeks: Euroqol P = 0.002, SF 36: physical function P = 0.016, social function P = 0.003. At 3 months there was reduced physical function in the polypropylene group (P = 0.037). Conclusions: Initial results showed that collagen mesh is an effective method of providing tissue repair in primary inguinal hernia. The collagen mesh produced fewer haematomas postoperatively and patients recovered physical activity more quickly. Otherwise it produced results comparable to polypropylene without the risks of a permanently implanted foreign body. It is proposed to recruit 200 patients to the study and undertake follow-up for 2 years postoperatively.

AB  - Abstract Aims: A radical shift in management of abdominal sepsis from surgery to radiological drainage occurred in 20 years. This is safe and in majority it avoids the need for conventional surgery. When surgery is indicated it provides the roadmap by showing the exact nature of the abscess and its contents. This is a retrospective study from single centre to look at the outcome of management of localized intra-abdominal sepsis by using radiological guided drainage. Methods: All the patients who underwent radiological intervention for abdominal sepsis between 1995 and 2001 were included in the study. These were scanned and drains were inserted under radiological guidance under local anaesthetic. All these patients were followed up with antibiotics and drainograms when appropriate. Results: These patients were between ages of 14 and 84 years. A total of 216 procedures were performed. Twenty-four of them were diagnostic in that the patients were subjected to laparotomy or conservative management. A total of 192 patients had therapeutic aspiration or drainage. One hundred and forty-five patients had catheters inserted for continuous drainage and the rest had therapeutic aspiration. These patients included pelvic abscess (15 per cent), perinephric collections (12.4 per cent), subdiaphragmatic abscess (12 per cent), liver abscesses (8 per cent), pseudocysts (7 per cent), pericolic abscess (7.5 per cent), sub-hepatic abscess (5 per cent), psoas abscess (3.4 per cent), appendicular abscess (3.4 per cent), empyema gall bladder and pancreatic abscesses. Complications were minimal including transient sepsis, residual collection, haemorrhage into the cavity and persistent sinus. Our results include bacteriological studies of aspirates, which will be presented in detail at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Percutaneuos guided aspiration and drainage is a safe and effective alternative to conventional open surgical drainage. We recommend this as the first line of management.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Hyperhidrosis substantially impairs quality of life. Sympathectomy is often ineffective for axillary hyperhidrosis and carries a significant risk of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injection offers a temporary but effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the value to patients of this treatment as judged by their voluntary, self-initiated re-attendance for further treatment. Methods: A prospective database of all patients attending for Botulinum toxin injections for hyperhidrosis has been kept since October 1997. After treatment no routine review is arranged. Patients who want further injections must self refer to the clinic when they think it is necessary. Results: From October 1997 to January 2002 60 patients have received Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis (54 axillary, 6 plantar). 45 received their first injections more than 12 months ago and of these 31 (69 per cent) have initiated re-attendance for further treatment at a median of 10 months (IQR 7?13 months) after initial treatment. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin injection for hyperhidrosis is of sufficient value to at least 69 per cent of patients that they self-initiate repeated therapy. The median duration of efficacy is 10 months.

AB  - The benchmark treatment for diabetic macular oedema, the major cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetes mellitus, has traditionally been laser photocoagulation; however, as laser treatment does not always improve vision or even prevent further loss in many cases, several new pharmacotherapies that are injected into the vitreous for diabetic macular oedema have been successfully trialled over the past decade. Others are currently being evaluated. The two major classes of these drugs are steroids and vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists. In this article we briefly review the major clinical studies recently conducted in this field.

AB  - Abstract Background: Robotic-enhanced surgery has emerged as a solution to some of the drawbacks of traditional minimal access surgery. Master?slave telemanipulator systems have been extensively used in surgical interventions, but the learning curve in this technology has not been objectively assessed. Aims: Delineate the learning curve of surgeons for a robotic task in a complex bench model. Find if there is a quantifiable learning process in a short period of exposure to the Da Vinci system. Methods: Nine surgeons completed five synthetic small bowel anastomoses (Limbs and things, UK) using the Da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, CA) in standardized conditions. All procedures were digitized and quality scored independently by three surgeons employing the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to compare the first and last attempts. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Cronbach's-alpha was used to measure interrater reliability. Results: A learning curve was constructed using time and OSATS score of every task. Both variables showed a rapid and progressive learning process. Mean times for the first and last attempt were 3507 s and 2287 s (P < 0.008) and mean OSATS scores were 17 and 24 (P < 0.012), respectively. A high interobserver reliability was found (α = 0.894). Conclusions: This study clearly shows a significant reduction in the time taken (34 per cent) and improvement in quality (29 per cent) between the first and fifth attempt in a bench model. Therefore, we conclude that Da Vinci system allows fast adaptation and short learning process regardless previous surgical experience.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe and effective procedure but concerns have been raised that the operation has taken appendicectomy away from the basic surgical trainee (BST) and into the hands of more senior surgeons (HST). We assessed the impact of laparoscopic appendicectomy as a trainee operation. Methods: This was a prospective audit of 185 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis who were referred to a major teaching hospital over a 7-month period. Outcome measures included operative time, conversion from laparoscopic to open, complications, and length of stay. Results: Of the 120 patients who underwent surgical intervention by trainees, six had formal laparotomies, 40 patients successfully had a laparoscopic appendectomy, nine were converted (18.3 per cent), 24 patients had a diagnostic laparoscopy and 41 underwent open appendectomy. The performance of BSTs and HSTs is shown below. No significant difference was found in operative time for laparoscopic appendicectomy between trainees (BST median 65 min, HST median 60 min). The duration of laparoscopic appendectomy was significantly longer (median 60 min versus 40 min for open (P < 0.0001)). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared to open (49 h versus 72 h (P < 0.01)). There was no difference between the two groups of trainees. The complication rate was lower in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. Conclusion: In our experience laparoscopic appendectomy may fulfil a role in the training of laparoscopy that open appendectomy has traditionally provided for laparotomy.

Conclusion Abstract In tissue engineering cell cultures play a crucial role besides the matrix materials for the end of substituting lost tissue functions. The cell itself is situated at the cross-roads leading to different orders of scale, from molecule to organism and different levels of function, from biochemistry to macrophysiology. Extensive in vitro investigations have dissected a vast amount of cellular phenomena and the role of a number of bioactive substances has been elucidated in the past. Further, recombinant DNA technologies allow modulation of the expression profiles of virtually all kinds of cells. However, issues of vascularization in vivo limit transferability of these observations and restrict upscaling into clinical applications. Novel in vivo models of vascularization have evolved inspired from reconstructive microsurgical concepts and they encompass axial neovascularization by means of vascular induction. This work represents a brief description of latest developments and potential applications of neovascularization and angiogenesis in tissue engineering.
