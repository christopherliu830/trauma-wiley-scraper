AB  - Elderly hospital patients have ample exposure to situations and procedures that may increase their pressure ulcer risk. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in elderly medical patients and to determine whether the risk of pressure ulcers is associated with longer emergency department (ED) stays, lengthy procedures in the ED, or use of immobilizing restraints, medications, or devices in the ED. The study cohort was made up of 3,233 patients aged 65 or over admitted through the EDs of two Philadelphia hospitals. Sixty-five percent of subjects were aged 80 or more, 61% were female, and 69% were Black. The incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers on Day 3 of the hospital stay, as ascertained by direct skin examination, was 6.2%. There were 266 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers among 201 patients (mean per patient 1.3 pressure ulcers) 27% of the pressure ulcers were stage 1, 54% were stage 2, and the remainder were stages 3 or 4 or could not be staged. The median length of stay in the ED was 6.6 hours. The association between hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and extrinsic risk factors will be presented. The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors may lead to the development of effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.

AB  - Introduction: Thermal injury to the female breast is one of the most challenging aspects of aesthetic burn surgery today. As the ability to provide coverage for large body surface injuries has progressed greatly in recent years; attention can now be directed towards achieving aesthetically pleasing results. Breast reconstruction in the burn patient can be accomplished in several ways. In planning the reconstruction, one must account for gender, age, and stage of breast development at the time of injury. The following is the treatment protocol utilized at our institution. After determining the level of injury the injured area is cleansed and treated with topical anti-microbial agents such as Silvadene. If the decision is made to excise and graft the injured area one of two algorithms is followed. The first choice involves excising the burn and placing a split thickness skin graft to the area involved. This is done by placing a sheet graft and using aerosolized fibrin sealant to affix it to the wound bed. If the burn involves deeper elements of tissue then a second approach is taken which includes excision of the burn down to the level of fascia with preservation of the breast mounds and the nipple areola complex (NAR). The (NAR) is spared excision and allowed to heal. Reconstruction of the (NAR) can be deferred for a secondary procedure depending upon the response to primary healing. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to the area of injury. Again a sheet graft is preferred and fibrin sealant is utilized to improve graft fixation and contour. We attribute our excellent results to the sheet grafts and fibrin sealant used. It should be noted that the increased vascularity of the breast fat when compared to fat located elsewhere in the body allows the grafts to adhere and survive on this generally difficult to graft surface. Methods: We identified five female patients at our institution over the last 18 months with thermal injuries to the breasts. Each patient was placed into one of the two treatment algorithms. Results: The five patients had excellent outcomes. Breast mounds and symmetry were preserved. Further development of the breast was allowed in each patient. One patient even underwent a breast augmentation after surviving a 50% TBSA injury. Proper use of fibrin sealant and sheet grafts account for the excellent results seen at this institution. Conclusion: Following careful evaluation of the burned female breast cosmetically and functionally acceptable results can be attained when following our institution?s protocol for breast reconstruction in the female burn victim.

AB  - Aim: To document successful healing of a recalcitrant venous ulcer with adjunctive use of Dermagraft Materials and Methods: A 74-year-old Hispanic male presented with a chronic venous ulcer at the medial aspect of his right ankle. Biopsy failed to reveal malignancy and confirmed stasis changes. Treatment was ongoing including compression therapy, local debridements, and moist wound healing, off-loading, and nutritional support. The wound remained free of infection. Due to the continued recalcitrant nature of the lesion multiple applications of Dermagraft were utilized to augment healing. Results: The researcher observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue. Conclusions: Dermagraft appears to augment healing in patients with venous ulcers and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgements: Smith & Nephew Wound Management, Largo, Fl.

AB  - Background: More than three quarters of patients with a connective tissue disorder will develop secondary Raynauld?s disease. This more severe form of the Raynauld?s can lead to digital ischemia, tissue loss and may even result in the need for amputation of one or more digits. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor currently approved for use in vascular disease of the lower extremities. Case History: In August of 2002 a 62 year old female pianist with scleroderma presented to the wound clinic with a two year history of intractable digital pain secondary to ischemic ulcerations of the index, long and ring fingers of the right hand. She suffered from secondary Raynauld?s disease. Prior unsuccessful treatments included warming the hands, calcium channel blockade, anticoagulation, topical xylocaine and narcotic analgesics. In August of 2002 cilostazol was started at 100mg BID. Wound care consisted of serial debridement, moist wound healing and topical rhPDGF. Results: Four weeks into treatment the patient?s narcotic requirement decreased substantially and the fingers had a pink appearance. The ring finger healed after eight weeks. At three months the patient discontinued narcotic pain medication. Nine months into treatment the index finger had healed and she resumed playing the piano. The long finger finally healed one year after she initially presented to the wound clinic. Conclusion: Cilostazol may be an important adjunct in the treatment of secondary Raynauld?s disease particularly when digital ischemia has developed.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - A porcine model of second-degree burn wound was used to evaluate the effect of a newly developed topical oxygen emulsion (TOE) on collagen deposition during wound repair. A total of 6 pigs were used for the study. The burn wounds were treated with air exposure (no treatment), vehicle control or TOE, which contains super-saturated oxygen and releases oxygen in sustained high level when applied topically. Skin wound samples were collected at days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 after wounding. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) were used to examine the mRNA expressions for type I and type III collagens and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1). RT-PCR products were run on ethidium bromide gel and analyzed under UV light with Bio-Rad Gel Document 2000 system. The expression intensity was recorded as the mean gray value. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The results showed: 1). Higher mRNA expressions of collagen III and MMP-1 were observed in TOE treatment group compared with air exposure and vehicle control groups. 2). MMP-1 expression increased shortly after wounding with peak at days 4 and 7. 3). Collagen III expression increased earlier with peak at day 10 and day 14. 4). Collagen I expression level increased later than that of collagen III. Significant increase was seen after day 10 with the highest at day 21. However, there was no significant difference between vehicle control and TOE treatment groups. The data suggests that sustained high level of oxygen release by TOE may promote wound repair through the mechanism of increased expressions of type I and type III collagens. The TOE also increased the expression of MMP-1, which might accelerate clearing damaged collagens in the earlier phase of wound healing and promote collagen remodeling in the later phase. This study was supported by grants from DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Bacteria reside in various forms, including planktonic, or free-floating, or as biofilms, which are a tightly adherent, potentially more treatment-resistant form. Biofilms, composed in part as polysaccharide matrices, can act as protection for bacteria by shielding them from antimicrobials and the innate immune system. It is estimated that bacterial biofilm are responsible for 65?80% of all chronic infections and may be responsible in part for non-healing of chronic wounds. An advance in the treatment of non-healing wounds has lead to the development of human skin equivalents (HSE), which can successfully treat many non-healing wounds. Better understanding the interaction between bacteria and HSE might improve patient outcomes. Studies involving planktonic E. coli and HSE have demonstrated the growth of bacterial colonies only on the dermal surface. Growth was not seen on the epidermal layer of the HSE, possibly due in part to the expression of innate antimicrobial peptides called human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2), which are expressed by HSE keratinocytes. The objective of this study was to determine if biofilm formation could occur on a bioengineered HSE. We used a commercially available HSE. Three (3) mm full-thickness incisions were made in a triangular section of HSE. Each section was inoculated on the epidermal aspect with 1.0???105CFU per gram of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 35 degrees Celsius for specified time points. Sections of HSE were sampled in areas of injury at various time points. Biopsy sections were processed for histologic analysis with H&E and epifluorescent microscopy to visualize Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that biofilm formation occurred at multiple time points on HSE. Colonies of adherent bacteria were visualized within the injured area of the epidermal layer of HSE by H & E staining. Eplifluoresecnt microscopy using calcofluor white staining revealed the characteristic exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix of biofilm. Visualization of the expression of human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2) with HSE after biofilm formation is underway. This knowledge will help to understand the role of bacterial biofilms within HSE and their effect on subsequent healing.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of skin graft fixation with fibrin sealant (FS) alone by means of spray application with a low setting time (thrombin concentration 4?5?IU/ml) in comparison to point suture fixation as a clinical reference method. Furthermore, the influence of two different quantities of FS were tested. ?Material and Methods: On the dorsum of 6 male pigs four full-thickness wounds (8???4?cm) were excised in each animal. Randomly the four defects were divided into 3 groups (FS 0.05?ml/cm2; FS 0.15?ml/cm2(Tisseel, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria); Suture) and covered with autologous split thickness skin grafts. Outcome measurements included hematoma/seroma formation, graft dislocation, wound contraction, graft take rate and healed wound area. Observational time points were the 5th, 14th and 21st postoperative day.?Results: Hematoma formation on day of surgery was more pronounced in the suture group (FS 0.05?ml/cm2 vs. suture, p?<?0.05), similar the situation on the 5th postoperative day but without statistical significance. Graft dislocation revealed marked but not significant extended area in the suture group vs. the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group. The FS 0.05?ml/cm2 graft take on day 5 was found to be enhanced in comparison to the suture group. Excellent wound healing was notable on final observation day in the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group with a healed wound area of 99.7 (3.6/0.3). Corresponding values in the FS 0.15?ml/cm2 was 96.9 (4.7/2.1) and 95.9 (2.7/2.1) for the suture group. Values represents median (Q1/Q3). ?Conclusion: The application of a thin layer of FS (0.05?ml/cm2) in a low setting rate (4?5?IU thrombin) in split thickness skin transplantation via a spray device shows comparable results to those yielded with suture point fixation (surrogate for staples). Advantages are e.g. better cosmetic results and initial hemostasis with minimizing the incidence of early hematoma formation. Equal properties of manufactured low thrombin (4?IU; Canada) preparation vs. 500?IU (US) diluted to a 5?IU thrombin solution was also demonstrated.

AB  - At Ophidia Products, Inc. we have discovered Oxynor a synthetic therapeutic from snake venom for wound healing. The venom of Australian taipan snake (Oxyuranus s. scutellatus) is extremely potent due to the presence of taipoxin. The intact complex molecule of taipoxin having molecular weight 45.6?kDa is composed of three subunits α, ? and ?. Fractionation of crude venom by High pressure chromatography (HPLC) using ion exchange column permits separation of the subunits. The mitogenic activity was revealed in non toxic ? taipoxin. Non toxic ? taipoxin showed mitogenic activity on variety of eukaryotic cells. Its activity as a mitogen extended to wound healing in experimental animals. We identified the active domain for wound healing in ? taipoxin. after trypsin digestion were separated on HPLC, resolved into 11 different fragments. Each fragment was tested on PC12 cells to test mitogenic/neurotrophic activity. The fragment which showed the highest activity consisted of 21 amino acids. A synthetic peptide consisting of ten amino acids, from the N-terminal ?? was named Oxynor. Oxynor mimics the biological properties of natural ? taipoxin when tested in vitro and in vivo systems. The biological results showed that Oxynor was not toxic at the concentration of 100??g/ml for PC12 cells and 500??g/adult mouse. Oxynor was mitogenic to various eukaryotic cells. Oxynor is neurotrophic showing neurite outgrowth on PC12 cells. Growth of human skin fibroblast cells indicates that Oxynor has keratinous activity. Experimentally produced 4?mm punched wounds on the back of mice were treated with ? taipoxin 100??g/mouse or Oxynor at 500??g/mouse for seven consecutive days. The results showed complete closure of the wounds after six days while the wounds of control treated with PBS were open. Histology examination of the skin around the wounds revealed that treated mice showed re-epithelization of the epidermis, which looked close to the normal mouse skin biopsy. Whereas the controls showed distortion of epithelium. ? taipoxin and Oxynor were tested for in vivo at the concentration of 100??g/ml in hydrogel vehicle applied once daily to help heal 6?mm ischemic skin wounds in rats. At days 7 and 14 wound treated with ? taipoxin were about 15% smaller than the wounds treated with Oxynor. This shows that synthetic Oxynor is as efficacious as natural ? taipoxin under the conditions of the test. On increasing the concentration of Oxynor to 500??g/ml should give equivalent wound closure to 100??g/ml of ? taipoxin. In 1997 the US FDA approved for sale the first recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) for treatment of human non-healing wounds. Oxynor will be next therapeutic for wound healing Currently, Oxynor is in clinical trials, it has passed toxicity tests.

AB  - Fibroblast migration from the peri-wound collagenous stroma into the fibrin-laden wound is critical for granulation tissue formation and subsequent healing. Previously we found that fibroblast transmigration from a collagen matrix into a fibrin matrix required the presence of fibronectin (FN). Several cell surface receptors, namely integrins α4?1, α5?1 and αv?3 were also required for this invasive migration. Here we demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, known to bind FN at the highly cationic HepII domain is also required for fibroblast invasive migration of a fibrin/FN gel. This conclusion was based on fibroblast migration using two independent means of disrupting syndecan-4: heparinase degradation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans or suppression of syndecan-4 core protein with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Isolated syndecan-4 from these fibroblasts bound the Hep II recombinant constructs FN III12?15v?>?FN III12?15?>?FN III12?14 but did not bind the alternatively spliced IIICs (V) domain. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is required to stimulate fibroblast migration, markedly increased cell levels of syndecan-4 core protein in a time and dose dependent fashion. PDGF also induced up-regulation of syndecan-4 at transcriptional level as determined by RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that syndecan-4 is essential for fibroblast invasive migration into fibrin clot and that PDGF, the stimulus for migration, induces increased syndecan-4 core protein expression.

AB  - Introduction: Venous ulcers are the most common chronic wounds of the lower limbs. In our laboratory, the self-assembly method is used to reconstruct autologous skin that can be used as a biological dressing (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318; J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). Goals and Methods: The aim of this study was to establish if our self-assembled skin substitute (SASS) allows the closure of nonhealing venous leg ulcers. A case study of a 68-year-old woman with a chronic venous leg ulcer present for over one year and measuring 135?cm2 is thus herein presented. The autologous cells were isolated from a cutaneous biopsy (1?cm2) and cultivated in vitro(J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). The autologous SASS was produced and assembled by the cells thus it does not contain any exogenous or synthetic material (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318). The wound was debrided, covered with grafts of SASS and maintained in place with a compressive dressing (Coban, 3M, St-Paul, MN). A new SASS was applied weekly until wound closure. The SASS seemed to lessen the pain caused by the ulcer. Seven applications of the SASS were necessary to lead to a full wound closure. Conclusion: Venous leg ulcer quickly reepithelialized after application of our SASS This case indicates that use of the SASS can reduce pain and promote closure of nonhealing leg ulcers Furthermore, we thus hope that our SASS biological dressing maybe clinically useful to treat difficult-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was approved by the Health Canada?s Therapeutic Products Directorate and by the Ethic Committee of the CHAUQ, Saint-Sacrement Hospital.

AB  - A number of strategies have been explored for the treatment of cutaneous defects such as protein growth factor or gene therapy approaches. Alternative approaches include dermal or dermal-epidermal skin substitutes or clot substitutes such as fibrin sealants (FS?s). Here we test the fibrinogen-thrombin formulation of fibrin sealant combined with fibroblasts and PDGF in wound healing models. Four formulations varying in fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were applied to full-thickness biopsy wounds in the rabbit ear cutaneous wound-healing model with or without cultured rabbit dermal fibroblasts (RDFs; 3???105 cells/wound) embedded in the fibrinogen component. At post-wounding day 7, there was no difference in the diluted vs. non-diluted formulations for either the promotion of granulation tissue coverage of the open wounds or total granulation tissue area when tested without embedded cells. Including the RDFs, the highest degree of wound coverage by granulation tissue was observed in the combined dilution formulation (17.3?mg/ml fibrinogen, 167?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10) that was 167%(p?<?0.05) of the non-diluted FS containing cells (50?mg/ml fibrinogen, 250?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10). Inclusion of fibroblasts increased granulation tissue area within the wounds vs. FS alone (p?<?0.05) for each diluted formulation although no differences in this parameter was observed within each group (FS alone or with embedded cells). However, addition of the vulnerary growth factor PDGF-B (3??g; n?=?4) with the embedded RDFs in the combined dilution formulation increased granulation tissue area over 2-fold (p?<?0.01). Additionally, the presence of the RDFs promoted incorporation of the granulation tissue with and epithelial migration over the FS suggesting an active interaction between cells delivered to the wound by FS and the host repair cells. The findings suggest the progress of cutaneous defect repair can be enhanced by ex vivo cell delivery in Fibrin Sealant that is adjusted to balance hemostasis with promotion of wound healing processes.

AB  - Introduction: Burn depth, based on the hemodynamic alterations that occur following a thermal insult, can be assessed in a rapid, non-invasive, and nondestructive fashion using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR has the capability to determine the difference between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. Methods: Sixteen burn patients admitted to an adult regional burn center were studied and evaluated with the NIR point and imaging devices. Non-burned skin adjacent to the burn site was used as the control. NIR measurements were compared between superficial (8 wounds), full thickness (8 wounds) burn wounds and control sites. Results: NIR was able to easily detect an increase in oxyhemoglobin (68.3%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (4.8%, p?<?0.05%) and total hemoglobin (91.3%, p?<?0.05) which typically occurs with superficial burn injuries. Full thickness injuries experienced a substantial drop in oxyhemoglobin (88.8%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (79.1%, p?<?0.05) and total hemoglobin (77.5%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to control sites. Conclusions: These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy can successfully distinguish between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. The second phase of this study will involve determining the depth of indeterminant burn wounds and this preliminary data will also be presented. Acknowledgement: National Research Council of Canada

AB  - Introduction: Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each chromosome. Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the full length of the chromosome, up to 50?200 base pairs of the telomere are lost during each successive round of cell division. In adult human somatic cells, telomerase is not active resulting in progressive loss of telomere length and entry into replicative senescence as observed in cell culture. hTERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme which maintains telomere length. Transfection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by hTERT has been shown to reverse the senescent phenotype seen in aging HDFs in vitro. ERK (p44/42) is a MAP kinase which functions as a critical intermediary in the determination of cell growth and differentiation. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. ?Methods: In order to delineate some of the cellular mechanisms by which hTERT functions, we treated adenoviral hTERT (Ad-hTERT) transfected HDFs with TGFB1, and assayed phosphorylated ERK activity by Western blotting.?Results: Ad-hTERT treated HDFs demonstrated a 2?3 fold increase in phospho-ERK activity. In addition, our preliminary findings show that Ad-hTERT transfected HDFs have increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression by real-time rtPCR. ?Conclusions: Increased phosphor-ERK activity as well as increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression is seen in hTERT transfected HDF?s. Further studies will focus on defining other intermediary changes resulting from Ad-hTERT tranfection. Funding source: Geron Corporation

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem. p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression and attenuates proliferation of various cell types. Our in vitro rAd-p21 dose response studies of primary human dermal fibroblasts showed a 3?80 fold reduction of cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation at doses of 1???108?3???109?PN/mL, respectively. Further, rAd-p21 at 3???109 PN/mL showed a 2-fold less procollagen I (PIP) production when compared to control virus. These in vitro data demonstrate that rAd-p21 significantly attenuates fibroproliferation and procollagen production in the target cells. In vivo, a rat PVA sponge model was used. rAd-p21, at doses of 1???109, 1???1010 and 5???1010 PN was delivered into sponges that had previously been treated with a granulation tissue stimulator, rAd-PDGF-B. Results showed that sponges receiving rAd-PDGF-B alone had the highest % granulation fill (40?60% fill area). Sponges that were treated with rAd-PDGF-B for the first injection followed by rAd-p21 on a second injection showed a dose-dependent decrease in % granulation fill as rAd-p21 doses increased (p?<?0.001). On day 5 post-injection, IHC staining identified p21 protein expression only in sponges receiving rAd-p21. In addition, the quantitative measurement of cells labeled by BrdU or Ki67 demonstrated that rAd-p21 significantly attenuated cell proliferation when compared to rAd-PDGF alone in this model (p?<?0.01). In another in vivo experiment, a rabbit excessive scar model was used. rAd-p21, at a dose of 2???109?PN/wound was intradermally injected into the rabbit ear wounds that had previously been treated with PDGF-BB protein. Preliminary data showed that scar thickness in rAd-p21 treated wounds was significantly decreased in comparison to wounds treated with the control virus (p?<?0.05). These data suggest that rAd-p21 is effective in attenuating scars in the rabbit ear excessive scar model. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the further exploration of rAd-p21 as a useful therapeutic candidate for hyperproliferative diseases in patients.

AB  - Intro: Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation remains unclear, potentially involving mechanical strain, burns, or infection. We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.

AB  - Previous investigations have demonstrated that cutaneous healing in red Duroc pigs (RD) differs from healing in Yorkshire pigs (Y). Specifically, RD animals heal with the formation of hypercontracted, hyperpigmented scars, features which are not observed in Y animals. Further, this abnormal scarring may be genetically mediated, as demonstrated by the partial transmission of this phenotype to RD???Y offspring (F1). To further determine the degree of transmission of this phenotype, this study examined the effect of wound depth upon the healing response of F1 animals. Ten full thickness (FT) and ten deep dermal (DD, 1.8?mm) skin wounds (2?cm???2?cm) were created on the backs of juvenile female F1 animals (N?=?8) using previously published procedures. Biopsies (4?mm) were taken from FT and DD wounds on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Samples were used for histology and molecular analysis using RT-PCR. There were no detectable differences between the FT and DD wounds on the gross or histologic level. However on a molecular level, there were numerous differences between the FT and DD wounds. Several genes investigated demonstrated increased expression levels in the DD wounds as compared to the FT wounds. Further, DD wounds demonstrated a unique pattern of expression for several other genes that differed from that observed in either the F1 FT wounds or in any RD or Y wounds. Given that previous investigations have shown that FT and DD wounds are nearly identical within each of the RD and Y strains, this represents a novel finding. These results indicate that the healing phenotype of the F1 animals may be regulated both by genetics and by the wound size/depth, suggesting that human wound healing may be similarly influenced by genetics, wound depth and potentially, environmental factors.

AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - Bone marrow is an important supply for many progenitor cells, among them endothelial precursor cells. They have been already considered as potential therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic hindlimb. In this work we performed an unilateral chronic ischemic hindlimb model in 20 dogs, we were dissected and ligated the middle sacra artery and external right iliac artery preserving the internal iliac artery, after one week we removed de femoral artery performing a proximal and distal ligation and inserted into the gracilis muscle 3 Silastic tubes (0.8?mm diameter) in a middle circle form in order to created fibrocollagenous tunnels. Fifteen days later, we obtained bone marrow (30?mL) and mononuclear cells were separated; at the same time, all tubes were removed and bone marrow cells were transplanted into the fibrocollagenous tunnels, only in the third and fourth groups. During the 8 at 12 days we administered subcutaneously saline solution to the first and third groups and G-CSF to the second and fourth groups. Finally, after 30 days we performed contrasted angiographies from both limbs and was calculated mean angiographic score (MAS) from the number of vascular intersections, also was taken a biopsy from the central portion of right gracilis muscle for vascular assessment, as well as for vascular proliferating cells by immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated that white bone marrow cell transplantation enrichment by G-CSF administration stimulates angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb, twice than controls, and it is better than white bone marrow cell transplantation alone. White bone marrow cell is a potential therapy for ischemic hindlimb, because stem cells are growth factor provider, as well as an important source for endothelial precursors capable to form vessels de novo, mainly when this stem cells are deposited in an appropriate extracellular matrix, such as the fibrocollagenous tunnels in this model.
