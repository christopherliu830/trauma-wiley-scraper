AB  - The inability to experiment in humans creates a great need to develop culture systems that mimic human tissues/organs. Skin is arguably the simplest human tissue and therefore provides an excellent prototype for tissue engineering. Moreover, skin is the body?s first line of defense. Currently available skin replacements have been classified into four categories: (i) those that are composed completely of epidermal cells; (ii) those consisting of dermal components derived from processing of cadaver skin or from collagen and other matrix molecules; (iii) those containing both dermal and epidermal components and (iv) those that contain dermal, epidermal and vascular components. All of these substitutes have drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need for skin replacements that: (a) are prepared with pertinent primary human cells but yet can be ready ?off? the shelf; (b) can be prepared rapidly; (c) contain stable structures in particular microvessels that can rapidly connect with the patient?s vasculature in this manner establish circulation in the ?graft? increasing the chances of survival; (d) can be tailored for specific wound impairments (e) are long lasting. We have developed a new generation human ?skin? that can fulfil these requirements and can potentially be used as a ?living bandage?. We start with three primary human cell types and a collagen matrix that self-assemble into a connective tissue containing a network of mature microvessels, is covered with a stratified epidermis, expresses biochemical markers, matrix molecules, and cytokines characteristic of normal human skin and matures in 10?15 days. Moreover, two additional cell types, pericytes and monocytes, differentiate in situ adjacent to and within microvessels, respectively providing stability to the micriovessels and the epidermis expresses keratins that are typical of mature skin and not those characteristically produced in response to injury such as keratins 6, 16, 17. This tissue can potentially be developed into a skin replacement for patients with impaired healing. In addition, this tissue responds normally to bological stimuli, providing a powerful vehicle to investigate mechanisms of skin development and regeneration, understand pathological processes, and test drugs and treatments for skin diseases

AB  - A biofilm is a formation of surface-associated microbial cells that are enclosed in a self produced extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated a decrease in intestinal healing in intra-abdominal infection. Currently, the effect of localized intra-abdominal infection on anastomotic healing and strength is not known. This study was designed to evaluate anastomotic wound healing in the presence of intra-abdominal abscess. 30 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 270?300 grams were used for this experiment. 20 animals underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with 16 gauge needle. They were followed for 14 days. 9 of them died in the first week. The CLP animals had an initial 20% weight loss; however by day 10 they had a gradual return toward control weight. At the end of 14 days, rats from CLP group (n?=?11) and control group (n?=?10) underwent laparotomy and single-layer left colonic anastomosis. Blood cultures and abdominal swab cultures were sent from both groups. Post-operatively, animals were allowed to recover, food and water were offered ad libitum. At post-operative day five, animals were euthanized by thiopental overdose. Following anastomotic bursting pressure measurements, two samples were taken from the anastomotic line for subsequent determination of hydroxyproline content. Groups were compared with Students?t test. Data were expressed as means?±?SEM. In the post-operative period, all rats lost 10% to 12% of their body weight. No bacterial growth was detected in cultures. Hydroxyproline content measurements were significantly higher in the CLP group (11.2?±?0.3 vs. 9.8?±?0.5?ug HPO/mg dry tissue weight. P?<?0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in bursting pressure measurements between the groups (177?±?6.3 vs. 164?±?10.4?mmHg. P?>?0.05). These findings suggest that localized intra-abdominal infection without sepsis doesn?t inhibit intestinal anastomotic healing.

AB  - There is a wide spectrum of treatment modalities to manage hypertrophic scars, techniques like surgical excision, intralesional application of corticosteroids, pressure therapy or laser therapy are extensively used. From a cosmetic and physiological point of view scars are predominantly a concern of the patients, the cosmetic relevance for doctors is often of less importance. Therefore a treatment that can be performed by the patient her-/himself might be advantageous if it is efficacious and safe. Since the early 1980s so-called ?silicone gel sheeting? has been a widely used safe clinical management option for hypertrophic scars and keloids. The principle of the latter treatment has now been adapted and optimised towards a specific easily applicable adhesive polyurethane patch. This breathable, hypoallergenic patch is very well tolerated and avoids ? in contrast to silicone sheets ? moisture accumulation on the skin. Several clinical studies on both mature scars and on scar formation after surgical incisions show a reduction in visibility, redness, and roughness of the scars. The recommended eight weeks treatment might even be interrupted daily for twelve hours; the scar reducing effect is achieved as well. Extensive investigations on the polyurethane patch in vivo and in vitro propose an improved remodelling process of the scar tissue due to thermal and pressure effects of the patch but not by stratum corneum hydration. In vivo a better microcirculation can be observed in the scar tissue after treatment and in vitro an activation of enzymes involved in the remodelling process can be measured. In summary, physical effects are likely to be responsible for the successful results in clinical studies and individual applications of the new polyurethane patch for the reduction of hypertrophic scars.

AB  - Abstract Failure to downregulate inflammatory responses is often used to explain why chronic wounds fail to heal. The beneficial effects of surgical debridement are thought to be in part due to the transformation of a chronic wound to an acute wound, thereby allowing the inflammatory phase of acute wound healing to be reactivated. We tested the hypothesis that subcutaneous injection of the inducible isoform of the 70?kDa mammalian heat shock protein (iHSP70) will cause acute inflammatory swelling in an in vivo murine model. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Student?s t-test and significance was accepted when p?<?0.05. Subcutaneous injection of stress proteins iHSP70 was associated with significantly increased acute swelling in comparison to injections of saline, autologous serum (AS) or denatured iHSP70, *p?<?0.05, see figure below. Histological analysis demonstrated increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in those tissues receiving iHSP70. Stress proteins, within the acute wound environment, are proinflammatory and may set the stage for persistent inflammation within the chronic wound bed. Stress proteins may be future targets for therapeutic manipulation wherever acute inflammation fails to be downregulated. Exp.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate expression patterns of protein kinases and protein kinase activities in human corneal fibroblasts treated with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Methods: Human corneal fibroblast cultures were grown to confluence and treated with CTGF for 0, 5, and 15 minutes. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were obtained; protein kinase expression and activity arrays were performed using Kinetworks? analysis (screening for expression of 75 different protein kinases and 31 different phosphoproteins). Further studies using extended time courses of CTGF exposure in corneal fibroblasts (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes) were performed using immunoblot analysis to detect expression of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-cat), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). All results and were normalized by comparison to beta-actin. Results: After 5 minutes of exposure to CTGF, levels of active proteins increased for 21 of the 75 kinases analyzed. Some notable protein kinases that were induced include: death-associated kinase 1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2, protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-cat), protein kinase B alpha, and protein kinase C (ε, ?, and ?, subunits). Extended time course analysis of PKA-cat and FAK showed statistically significant increases in expression following CTGF stimulation within 15 minutes. Conclusion: CTGF increased the levels of active protein kinases in human corneal fibroblast cultures, including PKA-cat and FAK after 5 minutes of exposure. These results further our understanding of the signal transduction mechanism activated by CTGF in corneal fibroblasts. This suggests that CTGF mediates the effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) on protein kinase expression and phosphorylation of second messengers in processes such as cell proliferation and collagen synthesis.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the development of wound dressings that possess functionality beyond providing physical protection and optimal moisture environment. To this end, a novel dressing material based on a sulfonated-hydrocarbon backbone has been developed for the controlled release of therapeutic agents into chronic wounds. This versatile polymer possesses an ion-exchange capability that makes it amenable for binding and releasing a variety of potential agents. Polymer backbone was coated onto polyester fabric and then modified by ion exchange to incorporate Na+, Ag+, or doxycycline onto the polymer. The ability of several formulations of this hydrocarbon backbone product to sequester elastase and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) was then examined. Wound fluids containing elastase and MMP-8 were obtained from pooled wound fluids obtained from consented patients with pressure ulcers. Equivalent weights of product formulations were incubated for 2?4 hours at 25?°C with the wound fluids and then the remaining activities of elastase and MMP-8 determined using specific substrates (methoxysuucinyl-ala-ala-pro-val-p-nitroanilide and collagen type I respectively). Untreated polyester fabric served as a control and weight equivalents of gauze and Promogran? were also included for the purposes of comparison. The average reduction in apparent elastase activity in the wound fluid was 4%, 20.4%, 14%, 29%, and 55% for gauze, Promogran?, doxycycline, Ag+, and Na+ formulations respectively. Only Promogran? and the doxycycline formulation affected a decrease in apparent collagenolytic activity. These preliminary results provide evidence in support of the versatility of these new biomaterials for the controlled modulation of the chronic wound environment.

AB  - Background: Physiological differences between dominant and non-dominant arms may play an important role in wound healing of the upper extremities. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) studied this phenomenon in a human forearm model of acute wound healing. Methods: With informed consent, sixteen normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies on the flexor surface of both forearms: 2 biopsies on the dominant arm, and 2 on the non-dominant arm. The acute wound sites were then treated with i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel topically at various dosing intervals (Q.D. versus Q.O.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB alone Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone, or iii) bacitracin alone. Time-to-complete healing was measured as the primary endpoint. Results: The average time-to-complete healing for the dominant arm was shorter than the time required to heal the biopsies on the non-dominant arm, irregardless of the treatment applied. Conclusion: In the forearm biopsy model of acute wound healing, arm dominance is an independent variable and must considered in study designs. We postulate that this effect may be due to variation in microvascular perfusion. These results provoke further investigation into the physiological mechanisms underlying increased rate of healing in the dominant extremity.

AB  - Maththaan thailam, the Datura leaf juice is traditionally used for healing of wounds and related ailments in India. However, the scientific validity of the thailam has not been explored in the literatures. In the present study, the efficacy of maththaan thailam on healing of three types of wounds namely Open, Burn and Diabetic wound in animal models has been studied. Healing pattern and biochemical characterization of granulation tissue were assessed over the healing periods. Studies were more concentrated on to evaluate the change in the matrix metallo proteinase profile in the three different types of wound with respect to the applied thailam. Further supports were also expected from the antioxidant levels and histopathological examination of granulation tissue. It has been observed that among the three types of wounds, delayed healing was observed with diabetic wound. Complete healing of 2???2?cm2 wound size was achieved only after 22 days, whereas burn and open wound took only 16 and 9 days for complete closure. Further, MMP?s profile also showed a variation in the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 with respect to healing property. Biochemical and histochemical results and the antioxidant levels are highly correlated with the healing property irrespective of the wounds

AB  - A critical limitation of using retroviral vectors for gene therapy is their inability to infect non-dividing cells. Although, the adenoviral vectors have the advantage of being able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, they elicit inflammatory response, thus making the interpretation of in vivo experiments harder. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral vectors do not have those limitations, however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. To determine if low-oxygen microenvironment affects viral vector-mediated gene transfection, we have used two other viral vectors, Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral constructs in vitro and in vivo to express foreign genes in hypoxic cultured human dermal fibroblasts and ischemic rat wounds. Both cultured normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) human dermal fibroblasts were identically transfected by the AAV vector. A lenti6-LacZ construct was injected onto the periphery of rat ischemic and non-ischemic wound (106 pfu/wound) at the time of wounding. Wounds were harvested at post-operative day 7. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with a in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed without any inflammatory response. No significant difference of transfection efficiency was observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic wounds. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and Lentiviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in both ischemic and non-ischemic cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Introduction: Fetal mouse skin wounds heal without scar before gestational day E17. Because scarless repair is inherent to fetal skin and occurs superimposed on skin differentiation, genome-wide gene expression during skin development was tested. Methods: Dorsal skin from BALB/C mice fetuses at E14, E15, E18 and E20 was collected. RNAs from individual fetuses were hybridized to mouse microarrays with 42,000 gene elements. The E14/E18 hybridizations were repeated three times, and the E15/E20 repeated twice with different samples. (?x??=?fold change). Results: Increased genes on E18 and E20 were clustered into several groups: 1) ECMs: type I (2.8x), III (2.3x), VI, and XIV procollagens; 2) Cell surface: integrin beta1 binding protein2 (5.2x), integral membrane protein2A and 2B (avg 3.8x); 3) Proteases: mast cell protease4 (15x) and 5 (24x), MMP23 (3x); 4) Growth factor-related: acidic FGF (3.7x), FGF receptor3 (2.9x), TGF-alpha (2.3x). Decreased genes on E18 and E20 included: 1) Growth factors: TGF-beta2 (0.42x), PDGF-alpha (0.41x), PDGF receptor-beta (0.37x), NGF receptor associated protein (0.18x); 2) Proteases: MMP 11 (0.27x), 14 (0.39x); 3) ECM: fibromodulin (0.5x), Vcam1 (0.22x), keratin18 (0.2x) and 19 (0.46x), collagen XVIII (0.36x). Conclusions: Genes with increased expression at E14, E15 and decreased expression at E18, E20 have possible antifibrotic function. These data identify hundreds of possible anti-fibrotic and pro-fibrotic genes as candidates for further functional analysis as regulators of repair. Supported by NIH DE00463?03

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, there have been a number of studies in Europe on contact sensitivity in patients with chronic leg ulcerations with a frequency of positive patch test results ranging from 40 to 82.5%. The prevalence of sensitization has not been studied in North America. Furthermore, many of the newer dressings and wound care products in the market have not been studied for contact sensitivity in patients with chronic wounds. Objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitivity in patients with history of leg ulcers in two North American study centers, 2) to compare our results to the European studies and to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) database and 3) to help delineate a standard battery of allergens for patch testing in North American leg ulcer patients Methods: 54 patients with an active or past leg ulcer were prospectively entered in the study. The patients were patch tested to both the NACDG Standard series, as well as, a comprehensive supplemental series of 48 allergens including wound care medicaments and dressings. Results: 63% of patients were sensitized to at last one allergen. The most common allergens were Balsam of Peru (29.6%), bacitracin (24.1%), fragrance mix (20.4%), wood tar mix (20.4%), propylene glycol (13.5%), neomycin sulfate (13%), benzalkonium chloride (13%), carba mix (11.1%), nickel sulfate (11.1%) and Duoderm CGF (11.1%). Duoderm CGF was the most allergenic dressing in our study group. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of positive patch tests in patients with past or current leg ulcerations. Using a modified leg ulcer series along with the standard NACDG series is very important in evaluating patients with leg ulcers.

AB  - Abstract Cartilage tissue engineering is a rapidly progressing area of regenerative medicine with advances in cell biology and scaffold engineering constantly being investigated. Many groups are now capable of making neocartilage constructs with some level of morphological, biochemical, and histological likeness to native human cartilage tissues. The application of this useful technology in articular cartilage repair is well described in the literature; however, few studies have evaluated its application in head and neck reconstruction. Although there are many studies on auricular cartilage tissue engineering, there are few studies regarding cartilage tissue engineering for complex nasal reconstruction. This study therefore highlighted the challenges involved with nasal reconstruction, with special focus on nasal cartilage tissue, and examined how advancements made in cartilage tissue engineering research could be applied to improve the clinical outcomes of total nasal reconstructive surgery.
