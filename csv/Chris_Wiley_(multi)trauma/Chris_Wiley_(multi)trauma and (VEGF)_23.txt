AB  - ABSTRACT Craniofacial (CF) tissue is an architecturally complex tissue consisting of both bone and soft tissues with significant patient specific variations. Conditions of congenital abnormalities, tumor resection surgeries, and traumatic injuries of the CF skeleton can result in major deficits of bone tissue. Despite advances in surgical reconstruction techniques, management of CF osseous deficits remains a challenge. Due its inherent versatility, bioprinting offers a promising solution to address these issues. In this review, we present and analyze the current state of bioprinting of bone tissue and highlight how these techniques may be adapted to serve regenerative therapies for CF applications.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Despite numerous hypotheses regarding the action of laser light, the use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury is still being verified. The present study investigates the effects of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on I/R injury of the musculus gracilis in rats. Materials and Methods I/R injury of the musculus gracilis flap was induced in male adult Sprague?Dawley rats (n?=?84). Rats were subdivided depending on treatment into four subgroups: (1) healthy group, (2) I/R injury without irradiation, (3) R group irradiated only during reperfusion after injury, and (4) IR group irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion injury. LLLT (AlGaInP; ??=?670?nm; 4?J/cm2; 40?mW/cm2) was applied to the injured muscle four times daily until euthanasia. Results Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels were significantly lower (P<0.05) in the irradiated groups during the first 12?120?hours, while the lower creatine kinase (CK) level reached statistical significance only at 24?hours in the irradiated group when compared to the control group. The number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the gracilis muscle was significantly lower in the treated group only on the second day (P<0.0001). The lowered percentage of necrosis in the muscle tissue was statistically significant after 6 and 10 days of treatment (P<0.0001), while lower atrophy and higher neovascularization were observed at 6?14 days of irradiation (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the group irradiated only during reperfusion and that irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion. Conclusion LLLT confers a protective effect against early inflammatory tissue response, further atrophy, and necrosis of the muscle and it stimulates neovascularization after I/R injury. Lasers Surg.

AB  - Despite the inherent ability of bone to regenerate itself, there are a number of clinical situations in which complete bone regeneration fails to occur. In view of shortcomings of conventional treatment, gene therapy may have a place in cases of critical-size bone loss that cannot be properly treated with current medical or surgical treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of gene therapy in general, nonviral techniques of gene transfer including physical and chemical methods, RNA-based therapy, therapeutic genes to be transferred for bone regeneration, route of application including ex vivo application, and direct gene therapy approaches to regenerate bone. ?2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract One of the principal limitations to the size of an engineered tissue is oxygen and nutrient transport. Lacking a vascular bed, cells embedded in an engineered tissue will consume all available oxygen within hours while out branching blood vessels will take days to vascularize the implanted tissue. One possible solution is to directly write vascular structures within the engineered tissue prior to implantation, reconstructing the tissue according to its native architecture. The cell patterning technique, laser-guided direct writing (LGDW), can pattern multiple cells types with micrometer resolution on arbitrary surfaces, including biological gels. Here we show that LGDW can pattern human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in two- and three-dimensions with micrometer accuracy. By patterning HUVEC on Matrigel, we can direct their self-assembly into vascular structures along the desired pattern. Finally, co-culturing the vascular structures with hepatocytes resulted in an aggregated tubular structure similar in organization to a hepatic sinusoid. This capability can facilitate studies of tissue architecture at the single cell level, and of heterotypic interactions underlying processes such as liver and pancreas morphogenesis, differentiation, and angiogenesis.
