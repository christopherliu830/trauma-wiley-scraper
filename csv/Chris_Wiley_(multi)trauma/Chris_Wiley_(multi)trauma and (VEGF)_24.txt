AB  - Abstract This Progress Report reviews recent advances in the utility of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimic biomaterials in presenting and delivering therapeutic cells to promote tissue healing. This overview gives a brief introduction of different cell types being used in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering while addressing critical issues that must be overcome before cell-based approaches can be routinely employed in the clinic. A selection of five commonly used cell-associated, biomaterial platforms (collagen, hyaluronic acid, fibrin, alginate, and poly(ethylene glycol)) are reviewed for treatment of a number of acute injury or diseases with emphasis on animal models and clinical trials. This article concludes with current challenges and future perspectives regarding foreign body host response to biomaterials and immunological reactions to allogeneic or xenogeneic cells, vascularization and angiogenesis, matching mechanical strength and anisotropy of native tissues, as well as other non-technical issues regarding the clinical translation of biomatrix/cell-based therapies.

AB  - Cancer remains a peculiarly stubborn disease to treat. Some forms of cancer have seen tremendous advances in the effectiveness of their treatments, whereas other forms have remained resistant to pharmacological control. This lack of hope for success is in part due to the types of drugs that are used in the clinic, and the targeted biological system being based purely on cellular growth rates. However, recent drugs designed to affect specific signalling pathways or proteins have been showing much success. Thanks to the ingenuity of pharmacologists in understanding and targeting these processes, there have been real improvements in treatment. Here we are presented with some of the research into such critical systems that have to be understood, so that they can be conquered. We will also look at the challenges facing cancer pharmacologists and what the field may present to us all in the future.

AB  - Abstract Aim Epidural analgesia reduces the surgical stress response. However, its effect on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the genesis of inflammation following major abdominal surgery remains unclear. Our main objective was to elucidate whether perioperative epidural analgesia prevents the inflammatory response following colorectal cancer surgery. Methods Ninety-six patients scheduled for open or laparoscopic surgery were randomized to epidural analgesia (group E) or patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (group P). Surgery and anaesthesia were standardized in both groups. Plasma cortisol, insulin and serum cytokines [interleukin 1? (IL-1?), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor α, interferon ?, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor] were measured preoperatively (T0), 1?6 h postoperatively (T1) and 3?5 days postoperatively (T2). Mixed model analysis was used, after logarithmic transformation when appropriate, for analyses of cytokines and stress markers. Results >There were no significant differences in any serum cytokine concentration between groups P and E at any time point except for IL-10 which was 87% higher in group P [median and range 4.1 (2.3?9.2) pg/ml] compared to group E [2.6 (1.3?4.7) pg/ml] (P = 0.002) at T1. There was no difference in plasma cortisol and insulin between the groups at any time point after surgery. A significant difference in median serum cytokine concentration was found between open and laparoscopic surgery with higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 at T1 in patients undergoing open surgery compared to laparoscopic surgery. No difference in serum cytokine concentration was detected between the groups or between the surgical technique at T2. Conclusions Open surgery, compared to laparoscopic surgery, has greater impact on these inflammatory mediators than epidural analgesia vs intravenous analgesia.

AB  - Inflammatory pathologies are a growing burden for developed societies, and the tools offered by medicinal chemistry/biotechnology have provided us with an armamentarium of active principles. Unfortunately, most of them are marred by very significant side effects that can be summarized by two words: poor targeting (of cells, of tissues, etc.). This review provides a broad overview of the approaches and of the materials used to obtain an inflammation-responsive or inflammation-targeted behavior, which can be used to improve anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we first define the biochemical factors that may allow both to recognize and to target an inflamed environment, for example, the leakiness of capillaries, the presence of oxidants (reactive oxygen species), or of upregulated receptors/enzymes. We then review the systems that have shown the possibility to accumulate in inflamed tissues, respond to its stimuli, or bind to activated inflammatory cells, separately discussing payload/carrier (guest/host) systems and macromolecular prodrugs/conjugates.

AB  - Abstract Adult marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are capable of dividing and their progeny are further capable of differentiating into one of several mesenchymal phenotypes such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, marrow stromal cells, tendon-ligament fibroblasts, and adipocytes. In addition, these MSCs secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors that have both paracrine and autocrine activities. These secreted bioactive factors suppress the local immune system, inhibit fibrosis (scar formation) and apoptosis, enhance angiogenesis, and stimulate mitosis and differentiation of tissue-intrinsic reparative or stem cells. These effects, which are referred to as trophic effects, are distinct from the direct differentiation of MSCs into repair tissue. Several studies which tested the use of MSCs in models of infarct (injured heart), stroke (brain), or meniscus regeneration models are reviewed within the context of MSC-mediated trophic effects in tissue repair.

AB  - Objective Inflammation is a well-known consequence of surgery. Although surgical debulking of tumor is beneficial to patients, the onset of inflammation in injured tissue may impede the success of adjuvant therapies. One marker for postoperative inflammation is IL-6, which is released as a consequence of surgical injuries. IL-6 is predictive of response to many cancer therapies, and it is linked to various molecular and cellular resistance mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to establish a murine model by which therapeutic responses to photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be studied in the context of surgical inflammation. Materials and Methods Murine models with AB12 mesothelioma tumors were treated with either surgical resection or sham surgery with tumor incision but no resection. The timing and extent of IL-6 release in the tumor and/or serum was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared to that measured in the serum of 27 consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who underwent macroscopic complete resection (MCR). Results MPM patients showed a significant increase in IL-6 at the time MCR was completed. Similarly, IL-6 increased in the tumor and serum of mice treated with surgical resections. However, investigations that combine resection with another therapy make it necessary to grow tumors for resection to a larger volume than those that receive secondary therapy alone. As the larger size may alter tumor biology independent of the effects of surgical injury, we assessed the tumor incision model. In this model, tumor levels of IL-6 significantly increased after tumor incision. Conclusion The tumor incision model induces IL-6 release as is seen in the surgical setting, yet it avoids the limitations of surgical resection models. Potential mechanisms by which surgical induction of inflammation and IL-6 could alter the nature and efficacy of tumor response to PDT are reviewed. These include a wide spectrum of molecular and cellular mechanisms through which surgically-induced IL-6 could change the effectiveness of therapies that are combined with surgery. The tumor incision model can be employed for novel investigations of the effects of surgically-induced, acute inflammation on therapeutic response to PDT (or potentially other therapies).

AB  - Abstract The lack of a functional vascular supply has, to a large extent, hampered the whole range of clinical applications of ?successful? laboratory-based bone tissue engineering strategies. To the present, grafts have been dependent on post-implant vascularization, which jeopardizes graft integration and often leads to its failure. For this reason, the development of strategies that could effectively induce the establishment of a microcirculation in the engineered constructs has become a major goal for the tissue engineering research community. This review addresses the role and importance of the development of a vascular network in bone tissue engineering and provides an overview of the most up to date research efforts to develop such a network.
