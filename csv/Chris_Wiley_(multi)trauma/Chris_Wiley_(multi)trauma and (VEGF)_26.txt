AB  - ABSTRACT We present a new surgical modification to allow propeller perforator flaps to cover pressure sores at various locations. We used a propeller perforator flap concept based on the detection of newly formed perforator vessels located 1 cm from the wound margin and stimulated by the chronic inflammation process. Between January 2009 and January 2017, 33 wound edge-based propeller perforator flaps were used to cover pressure sores at various locations in 28 patients. In four cases more than one flap was used on the same patient. The patients comprised 18 males and 10 females with a mean age of 41·25 (range, 16?70) years. All patients underwent follow-up for 0?12 months. The mean follow-up duration was 5·03 months. Venous congestion was observed in three flaps that were rotated by 180° (9·1%). However, there was a significant difference between flaps rotated by 90° and 180° according to the complication rate (P = 0·034). Out of 33 flaps, 29 flaps healed uneventfully. Patients were able to sit and lie on their flaps three weeks after surgery. In our study, we were able to obtain satisfying final results using these novel flaps.

AB  - Objective:? Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are a population of highly proliferative postnatal stem cells capable of differentiating into odontoblasts, adipocytes, neural cells, and osteo-inductive cells. To examine whether SHED-mediated bone regeneration can be utilized for therapeutic purposes, we used SHED to repair critical-size calvarial defects in immunocompromised mice. Materials and methods:? We generated calvarial defects and transplanted SHED with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate as a carrier into the defect areas. Results:? SHED were able to repair the defects with substantial bone formation. Interestingly, SHED-mediated osteogenesis failed to recruit hematopoietic marrow elements that are commonly seen in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-generated bone. Furthermore, SHED were found to co-express mesenchymal stem cell marker, CC9/MUC18/CD146, with an array of growth factor receptors such as transforming growth factor ? receptor I and II, fibroblast growth factor receptor I and III, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, implying their comprehensive differentiation potential. Conclusions:? Our data indicate that SHED, derived from neural crest cells, may select unique mechanisms to exert osteogenesis. SHED might be a suitable resource for orofacial bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Background The primary goal of this study was the fabrication, long-term stability, and measured release of a marker dye from a micro-patterned drug delivery device using (i) mechanical puncture and (ii) photodisruption with an ophthalmic Nd:YAG laser. Materials and Methods A drug delivery device was made from a transparent bio-compatible polymer. The device consisted of two 2.6?mm diameter reservoirs containing 10% Na fluorescein dye. The device was implanted in the rabbit's eye (n?=?2) with the cap of the device facing toward the exterior of the eye. Once the animals recovered from the implant surgery, 100% anhydrous glycerol was topically applied to the eye at the implantation site to decrease light scattering in the conjunctiva and sclera. The dye was released from one of the reservoir either using a 28?G ½ needle or an ophthalmic Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (FS) with fiber optic probe was used to measure the half-life of the dye in the eye. Measurements of fluorescence intensity were collected until the measurements return to baseline and histology was done on the tissue surrounded the device. Results None of the devices leaked of 10% Na fluorescein dye after implant. The ablation threshold of the drug delivery device was between 6 and 10?mJ to create 100?500?µm holes. The half-life measurement of the dye was found to be 13 days at the vitreous chamber after measuring the fluorescence intensity through the dilated cornea. Histology study showed minimal immune and foreign body response such as mild inflammation. Conclusion This study established that the drug delivery device seemed to elicit minimal inflammatory response and retained its fluidic content until it was released with relatively longer retention time (half-life). Thus, similar device could be used for controlled release of drugs for certain ocular diseases. Lasers Surg. Med. 44:30?48, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering of corporal tissue is a new development in otherwise untreatable erectile dysfunction and in urethral reconstructions to treat hypospadias or severe urethral stricture disease. Multiple complications can arise with the current treatments, whereas engineered tissue, if well vascularized and existing of autologous cells, may lead to better results. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of literature on cell-seeded-based tissue engineering of corporal penile tissue. A literature search was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Papers describing cell-seeded tissue engineering of corporal tissue were included. Studies using different techniques, such as intracavernous injection were excluded. Fifteen articles were included in the review. Twelve of these studies described engineering of the corpus cavernosum in animal models. Two articles were found on engineering of animal corpus spongiosum and one article on engineering of the human glans. Both synthetic scaffolds and biological scaffolds were used. The advantage of a biological, acellular scaffold was that the native, complex architecture of corporal tissue was maintained. Most studies used endothelial and smooth muscle cells from corporal origin, but stem cells were also investigated. Furthermore, dynamic culturing achieved an improved cell content and functionality. This review has summarized the developments in tissue engineering of corpus cavernosum and spongiosum tissue. Functional tissue has been developed in animal studies with the use of seeded cells on scaffolds. This knowledge will form a basis for the development of tissue engineering of corporal tissue for clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract Engineering complex tissues requires a precisely formulated combination of cells, spatiotemporally released bioactive factors, and a specialized scaffold support system. Injectable materials, particularly those delivered in aqueous solution, are considered ideal delivery vehicles for cells and bioactive factors and can also be delivered through minimally invasive methods and fill complex 3D shapes. In this review, we examine injectable materials that form scaffolds or networks capable of both replacing tissue function early after delivery and supporting tissue regeneration over a time period of weeks to months. The use of these materials for tissue engineering within the craniofacial complex is challenging but ideal as many highly specialized and functional tissues reside within a small volume in the craniofacial structures and the need for minimally invasive interventions is desirable due to aesthetic considerations. Current biomaterials and strategies used to treat craniofacial defects are examined, followed by a review of craniofacial tissue engineering, and finally an examination of current technologies used for injectable scaffold development and drug and cell delivery using these materials.

AB  - Abstract Our study was designed to investigate the effects of IL-7 during the differentiation process of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) toward lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). IL-7 was added to the traditional induced medium, which was called the IL-7 (+) group, while the group that used traditional induced medium was called the IL-7 (?) group. After 7 days of induction of ADSCs, a comprehensive analysis was conducted between these two groups. We examined the changes in Prox1, LYVE-1, Podoplanin and VEGFR-3 on the RNA and protein level and found that the expression of LEC markers in the IL-7 (+) group was higher than in the IL-7 (?) group. The characteristics of differentiated cells were confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. At the same time, we detected the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway involved in the differentiation process, and we found that the phosphorylation of AKT increased, however the expression of ERK was not significantly changed. In conclusion, our study found that IL-7 could improve the differentiation efficiency of ADSCs toward LECs through AKT signaling pathways.
