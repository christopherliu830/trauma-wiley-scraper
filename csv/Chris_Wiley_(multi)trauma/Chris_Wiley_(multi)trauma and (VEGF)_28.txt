AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Summary It is well recognized that human tumours are hypoxic compared to normal adjacent tissues and that hypoxia is related to a poor outcome regardless of modality of treatment, including surgery alone, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Hypoxia regulates a complex programme of gene transcription via hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1,-2). We have shown that in breast cancer and many other tumour types, tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of HIF-2α compared to normal tissue macrophages and compared to the tumour. This high macrophage HIF-2α is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome. The mechanisms up-regulating HIF-2α in macrophages may include inflammatory cytokines as well as hypoxia. Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages increases the basal level of HIF-2α protein and changes the programme of hypoxia. Many of these inducible genes are involved in inflammation and angiogenesis. Thus, the conversion of a peripheral monocyte into a macrophage generates a complex new programme of hypoxia-responsive genes that may contribute to angiogenesis and the complex microenvironment within the tumour, and as such provides important targets for therapy.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has a multitude of factors implicated in its etiology. The complex neuro-etiology and the restrictive nature of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) have significantly hindered the drug therapy of ALS. Riluzole, a moderately performing drug, is the only agent approved for treating ALS. However, several promising nanocarrier approaches are surfacing that can provide more efficient drug delivery. In addition, biologicals such as stem cells are able to carry neurotrophic factors to their target site, providing motor neurons with the benefits of both, stem cells and neurotrophic factors. This review examines the current drug delivery strategies investigated for optimally treating ALS and related neurodegenerative disorders. Examples include cerium oxide nanoparticles in Alzheimer's disease, odorranalectin, and lactoferrin-coupled PEG?PLGA nanoparticles for urocortin transportation in Parkinson's disease that can also be employed in ALS to bypass the BBB and increase drug bioavailability. A concise incursion into the progress (and lack thereof) made in ALS clinical trials is also discussed. Nanocarriers can potentially eliminate the challenges of poor drug bioavailability in ALS as they have been proven to cross the BBB and reach target sites while minimizing systemic side-effects. Nanocarrier-based delivery of ALS drugs is an area that requires much needed investigation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 104:1213?1229, 2015

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.
