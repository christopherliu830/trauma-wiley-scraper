AB  - Aim: Lethal diseases occasionally present with a ?chronic? ulcer. If a physician can not realize this fact, the ulcer might give rise to a misery result. We present three educational cases of chronic ulcers that give caution to physicians. Case report: The first case was a hand ulcer due to postradiation squamous cell carcinoma, which eventually led to amputation of index and middle finger. The second case was a leg ulcer due to postburn squamous cell carcinoma, resulting in death caused by visceral metastasis. Both cases were treated as simple chronic ulcers at other clinics for a long time. The third case was a lower leg ulcer caused by infection with cryptococcus neoformans. The ulcer was covered with a split thickness skin graft after administration of anti-fungal drugs. Conclusions: As seen in these cases, we must always have serious doubts why the ulcer is not easily healed. If the causative factor is not easily found, biopsies from the ulcer would be helpful for the true diagnosis of the ulcerative lesions.

AB  - Aim: A treatment of extensive burn contracture in children needs to repeat the autologous skin graft. This study was designed to evaluate the application of autologous CDS to prepare the proper wound bed acceptable for the split-thickness autologous skin graft. Methods: Prior to the clinical study, the master cell banking system was established using a small piece of skin derived from each patient. The autologous CDS was prepared by plating the patient's own fibroblasts, cultured from the master cells, on a spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid and atelo-collagen. The CDS was applied on the skin defects left behind surgical excision to release scar contracture. The split-thickness autologous skin graft (6?8/1000?inch) was applied on the wound bed, prepared by using the CDS. Results: The clinical trials were conducted in 5 cases. When the autologous CDS was applied on the skin defect, exposing subcutaneous fatty tissue, the highly vascularlized wound bed was prepared within about 1 week. Although a split-thickness skin graft was very thin, the severe contracture was not observed over a period of several months. Conclusion: The application of autologous CDS is promising for the treatment for extensive burn scar contracture in children.

AB  - It has been said that CO2 laser vaporization and resection conventionally performed for elevated lentigo may cause depressed scar formation when the diameter of the lesion exceeds 5?mm. Accordingly, in consideration of cosmetic factors, we have devised a method for the removal of even a larger elevated lentigo by the Flat Resection technique which can be used effectively without causing a depressed scar to form. Upon the primary laser irradiation, the lesion was resected at the horizontal plane of the skin, and the resected tumor was subjected to histopathological analysis. If the lesion remained about one month after the primary irradiation, additional laser treatment was performed at the patient's request. From our experience, satisfactory outcomes were obtained for up to 12-mm lesions. Following the flat resection, residual lesions were pathologically observed in 52.5%, and macroscopically observed in 45%. Additional laser treatment was performed for 35%. It was considered that this technique is useful for sites such as the base of ala nasi and the vicinity of the eyebrow, of which simple reefing requires skills. However, since the possibility of malignant degeneration of lentigo could not be ruled out in a longer-term follow-up, particular care is needed to select a case suitable for this technique.

AB  - Aim: We attempted to establish a rat model by placing gauze on a wound bed. We then used this model to evaluate the virulence of an established strain of Staphylococcus Aureus and a clinical strain isolated from a patient with a wound infection. Methods: Using a 1.5???1.5?cm template, full thickness skin wounds were made through the panniculus carnosus on the backs of rats. A small piece of gauze was placed over each wound. The wound beds were inoculated with 1.5???106?cfu of Staphylococcus Aureus from the American Type Culture Collection, or 1.5???106?cfu of a clinical isolate. The wounds were debrided every 48 hours and samples taken to the laboratory for quantitative bacteriologic analysis. Specimens were fixed and stained by H/E and Gram staining. Results: The clinical strain of Staphylococcus Aureus resulted in bacterial counts (cfu per gram of tissue) exceeding 107 on days 2 to 6, while the established stain produced bacterial counts exceeding 107?cfu on days 2 to 4 only. Gram stain analysis revealed that the clinical strain penetrated deep granulation tissue, whereas, the established strain was present in small cell nests at the wound margins. Conclusion: A clinical strain isolated from a patient showed deeper penetration of the wound bed than an established strain, resulting in prolonged elevation of the bacterial count.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to define the participation of local expression of IL-10 and TNFα around the anastomotic segment and clarify the effects of IL-10 and TNFα on anastomotic wound healing after digestive surgery under septic condition. Methods: Experimental animals were divided into LPS and control groups, which had either LPS or normal saline solution injected into the peritoneal cavity 24?h before transection and anastomosis of the colon. Immunohistochemical staining for IL-10 and TNFα on tissue samples were examined after the operation. Fibroblasts were cultured with IL-10 and TNFα, then proliferation rates were determined using the MTT assay. Type I collagen protein and MMP-I were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: In the LPS group, IL-10 and TNFα expression were more enhanced than that in the control group 24?h after the operation. IL-10 reduced fibroblasts proliferation in dose dependent fasion in the presence of TNFα. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that IL-10 reduced type I collagen protein and increased MMP-I. Conclusions: Local expression of IL-10 and TNFα at the anastomotic site acted as an inhibitory factor in the wound healing process. IL-10 suppressed the remodeling of the extracellular matrix during wound healing.

AB  - Aim: A method for preparing acellular trachea scaffold and its effectiveness were investigated by using rabbits and dogs Methods: The sacrificed dog or rabbit trachea was collected. The spiral stent of stainless steel was inserted in the obtained trachea. To remove all of cellular components in tissues, the trachea was rinsed with sterilized 0.5% Triton X-100 for 24 to 48 hours at ambient temperature and then for removing the detergents completely using fresh water. The acellular trachea obtained was lyophilized and sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. Before implantation, the lyophilized acellular trachea was soaked in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin and other adhesive molecules for 2 to 18 hours at 37 degree. After 15?mm of rabbit neck trachea was removed surgically under anesthesia, the same length of reengorged acellular rabbit trachea was implanted the removed region. In the case of dog, 50?mm of thoracic trachea was removed under the mechanical ventilation and then the same length of reengorged acellular trachea was implanted by technique of end to end anastomosis. The implanted trachea was rapped by omentum. The effectiveness of acellualr scaffold on implanted-animals was evaluated by endoscope finding. Results: 1) The rabbits implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for minimum 10 days and maximum 60 days. It was suggested that the cause of death was the infection of implantation region. 2) The dog implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for over 60 days at least. The cause of death was strangulated hernia. 3) The acellular trachea containing various growth factors or cultured with fibroblasts was not always effective. Discussion: It is not necessary for the animal implanted acellular trachea to be administered the immunodepressants such as the animal implanted cryopreserved trachea. From these results, the tissue engineered acellular trachea may be more effective than the cryopreserved trachea.

AB  - Aim: Limb ulcer due to severe ischemia often needs revascularization. In our hospital, the result of lower extremity bypass surgery for these patients is satisfactory, however, indication of this procedure is limited pathologically and technically. We recently have demonstrated a possibility of efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis by autologous bone marrow cell transplantation for severe ischemic ulcer of extremity. Methods: Eight patients (9limbs; 3limbs with arteriosclerosis obliterans, 6limbs with Buerger's disease) with ischemic ulcer of lower and/or upper extremity were treated with implantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell into ischemic skeletal muscles. Four weeks after transplantation, efficacy of this procedure were evaluated by Visual Ana log Scale, angiography and Laser Doppler Flow Analysis (LDFA). Results: In 4 out of 9 limbs, the ulcers healed dramatically. Seven limbs revealed angiographically improvement and icrease of blood flow by LDFA. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that therapeutic angiogenesis by autologous bone marrow cell transplantation is an effective and safty strategy for patient with peripheral arterial disease. We considered that it is more effective to Buerger's disease than arteriosclerosis obliterans.

AB  - Aim: In case of using metal wire in closing after the median sternotomy, several disadvantages have been reported, including long lasting subject's sense of incongruity, risks of tear of the wire and cutting to be made by the wire, tenderness and becoming an abstacle for the use of CT or MRI. In our facilities, in order to solve these problems, absorbable suture and absorbable rib fixing pins have been used in closing the sternum. Methods: Objects of the median sternotomy we?ve had since October, 2001, are six cases. The suture used was 6 PDS codes of 1?mm in diameter and it went through the sternum and ligated it. Three absorbable pins of poly-L-lactide were used. Results: A progress observation period after the operation is from one month to fourteen months.The prognosis have been good and complications not recognized. Conclusions: The way of closing the sternum with absorbing suture and absorbing rib fixing pins will make it possible to solve problems incurred from the metal wire suturing.

AB  - A 72-year-old female, who had slight impaired glucose tolerance, was diagnosed the second stage of carcinoma of the vulva. On the second day after radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphadenectomy, the center of the wound changed color into deep purple. On the 8th postoperative days, the swelling of the wound extended over the mons pubis and a thigh, so the infected wound, which reached the epimysium, was opened for the debridement. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram negative bacilli were detected from the wound. Firstly, the wound was cleaned by a physiological salt solution, streptokinase, and sulfadiazine silver. The gynecologist and nurses in charge discussed about the therapy under the consultation of a dermatologist and treated the wound by the wet treatment that a piece of gauze moisten by a physiological salt solution was exchanged 3 or 4 times a day after disinfecting by povidone iodine. On the13th postoperative days, the infection was controlled and on the19th days the skin was grafted from a thigh. After the successful skin grafting the patient was discharged. Carcinoma of the vulva tends to occur in elder women. Wounds are often dissociated because of an interruption in the circulation by the excessive extension of the skin. From the successful experience of wet treatment after a surgical wound infection, we recognized the necessity of close observation on surgical site and the importance of cooperation of the doctors and the nurses in charge.

AB  - Aim: It is important to analyze the angiogenesis and the formation of the granulation tissue in understanding the wound healing process. The dressing material is thought that the wound healing is promoted, and understanding the effect of the dressing material. The model which used the dressing material was made, and the angiogenesis in the granulation tissue formation process were compared. Method: The Sprague-Dawrey rat's granulation formation model and the model which used the dressing materials were made. The granulation tissue was removed on the 7th day, the 14th day, the 28th day, and the 42nd day. The angiogenesis and the formation of network of newly formed vessels during the granulation tissue formation were observed with Confocal laser scanning microscopy. Result: The angiogenesis starts from the depths part of the granuration tissue. Afterwards, it progresses superficial part of the granulation tissue, and the network of the blood vessel is formed. In this process, as the model which used the dressing material, the network of the angiogenesis was admitted from early time.

AB  - Aim: The movements of the cell population are different between 2-D culture and 3-D culture. From the observation of morphology of skeletal muscle cell 3-D culture, We expect that skeletal muscle cells differentiation is accelerate in the collagen gel 3-D culture, and the proliferation is suppressed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference between 2-D culture and 3-D culture of C2C12 cells. Methods: C2C12 skeletal muscle cells are incubated following three difference conditions for 48 hours, plastic dish 2-D culture, collagen coated dish 2-D culture and collagen gel 3-D culture. The culture medium is Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Collagens are removed by collagenase treatment and cells are homogenized. After centrifugation the top clear layer is used for CPK assay and protein development analysis by Western blotting Results: After 48 hour incubation, we observed cell morphology by a phase contract microscope. Cell fusion was observed in collagen gel 3-D culture. The fusion cells have many nucleus in the cytoplasm called synthetium. But in plastic dish 2-D culture and in collagen coated dish 2-D culture synthetiums were not observed and cells were mononuclear and monolayer. Cell prolieration was suppressed in collagen gel 3-D culture. CPK activity was five times activated in collagen gel 3-D culture than in plastic dish 2-D culture. Conclusions: We suggest skeletal muscle cells C2C12 are activate differentiation by collagen gel 3-D culture.

AB  - Critically larger bone and skin defects often lack the enough nutrient blood supply to induce normal wound healing. Additionally, deteriorated environment such as poor vascularity due to the hard fibrosis after irradiation or extensive tissue loss due to the highly damaged tissue or severe bacterial contamination, leads to finding another donor sites or another methods to repair. Potential free vascularized flaps are widely accepted for reconstruction purpose, however, the donor-site morbidity is sometimes concerned and its clinical application may be limited. Tissue engineered tissues are now most actively investigated and partially clinically appropriate for use. In order to assist the bone wound healing, the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), wrapped with the abdominal fascial flap, which is nutrient of superficial epigastric vascular systems in bone, and the full-thickness dorsal defect covered by artificial skin substitute as a carrier in skin, are used as cell source with potential differentiation with specific cytokines in a nude rat model for eliminating T cell immunity. The hMSCs and osteogenic cytokines such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were intra-arteriallly injected and incubated for 10 minutes and then the gelatin-carrier were wrapped with the abdominal superficial fascia and investigated for the subsequent experiments. The heterotopic bone formation was most significantly observed in 4 weeks after injection and this may be used clinically to enhance the compromised bone healing.

AB  - Aim: Vascularized periosteum has an ability of new bone formation, and porous hydroxyapatite (HA) has an property of bone conduction. A basic research was performed to investigate the possibility of making a ?hybrid? vascularized artificial bone from porous HA integrated with the vascularized periosteum. Materials  55%, dimension; 8???4???2?mm) were ligatened to the cambium layer of periosteum and muscle, and in the other group HA blocks combined with rhBMP-2 were apllied in the same manner. HA blocks were removed 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the operation and were examined histologically. This method was applied preliminarily to 5 patients who needed bony repair of anterior chest, midface, and mandible. Results: Osteogenesis was observed within the pores of the blocks over the course of time. In rhBMP-2 group, osteogenesis progressed rapidly to the same extent as in without rhBMP-2 group. In clinical cases, postoperative bone scintigraphy demonstrated radioactive uptake into HA implants, and biopsy revealed bone neogenesis into the pores of HA. Conclusions: Our basic research and preliminary clinical applications suggested that the possibility of making the hybrid type of vascularized artificial bone preparation with HA using this method. This will enable less invasive procedure and custom-made reconstruction without the need of vascularized autogeneous bone grafts.

AB  - Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) obtained from a single donor of the iliac crest, was further investigated for the cell proliferation, cell cycle profiles, gene expressions and the ultrastructures by electron microscopy. The hMSCs significantly increased the cell number by day 2 after by treatment of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 alone, or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or combination of both in the serum-free condition (P?<?0.01). The hMSCs demonstrated the remarkable proliferation cell nuclear antigen notably at day 1 and pituitary tumor transforming gene all through the experiment, suggesting the cell cycle progression by BMP-2 treatment as well as the strong cellular nuclear BrdU expression by immunocytochemistry. The fluorescence-activated cell sorter also demonstrated the similar pattern of the cell cycle progression between BMP-2 treatment in the serum-free and 10 % fetal bovine serum treatment. The BMP-2 treated hMSCs demonstrated the heterochromatin in the nucleus, suggesting the cell differentiation and the well-developed granular endoplasmic reticulums, indicating the protein production. The hMSCs successfully proliferate, the cell cycle is progressed, and the cell ultrastructure morphology suggest the remarkable nuclear and of granular endoplasmic reticulum induction by BMP-2 treatment in the serum-free condition.

AB  - Purpose and Methods: Between 1988 and 2000, 378 cases of keloids were treated and the therapeutic outcomes were evaluated. For this study, 147 keloids in 129 patients were selected. Results: The overall recurrence rate was 32.7%. Analysis of the therapeutic outcomes showed that the recurrence rates in the sites with high stretch tension, such as the chest wall, and the scapular and suprapubic regions were statistically higher than in sites without high tension, such as the neck, earlobes and lower limbs (p?=?0.0017). Discussion: The results suggested that keloid sites with a high risk of recurrence should be treated with escalated radiation doses. However in our experience, pigmentation increases when the radiation dose is increased. Additionally, pigmentation can be suppressed by the following methods: 1. reducing the one-time dose of irradiation while keeping the total dose unchanged; 2. lengthening the irradiation interval. Therefore we made a new protocols and provide further insights into the treatment: Total 20?Gy (4 days): Anterior chest wall, Scapular region and Suprapuvic region; Total 10?Gy (2 days): Ear lobe; Total 15?Gy (3 days): Others.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of the present study has been to assess possibilities of the FGF-2 incorporated chitosan hydrogel as a dressing for wound occlusion and healing acceleration in healing-impaired db/db mice. Methods: Mutant diabetic mice, C57BL/KsJ db/db, and their normal littermates (db/+) were used in this study. After full thickness-round wound (about 100?mm2) were prepared on the back of each mouse, the FGF-2 containing chitosan hydrogel was added onto the wound of each mouse and was irradiated with UV light. Similar full thickness-round wound were also prepared as controls without any trearment. The changes in wound area of mice were measured. The skin including the wound was removed from each mouse for histological examination. Results: For the db/db mice treated with the FGF-2-incorporated chitosan hydrogel, healing was faster than only chitosan hydrogel-treated and control wounds. On the other hand, the incorporated FGF-2 in the chitosan hydrogel did not show a stimulatory effect on the wound healing of db/+ mice. The vascularity of wound areas of db/db mice on day 4, evaluated immunohistochemically with anti-murine CD34, was markedly increased in FGF-2-incorporated chitosan hydrogel-treated wound. Conclusion: FGF-2-incorporated chitosan hydrogel may become accepted as an occlisuve dressing for healing impaired wound managemant.
