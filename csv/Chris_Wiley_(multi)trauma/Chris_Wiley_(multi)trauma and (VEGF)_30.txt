AB  - Aim: Development of adequate connective tissue as a bed below new epidermis is important for successful epitherialization. However, how the dermal fibrous architecture newly forms and changes chronologically in that process is unknown.The aim of the present study was to determine the regeneration process of neodermis in skin wound healing from the viewpoint of neoformation of its fibrous architecture Methods: We investigated the repair process of an excised skin wound made on experimental animals with the use of alkali water cell-maceration scanning electron microscopy, which allowed a three-dimensional demonstration of individual collagen fibrils in their natural from and location Results: Both new papillary dermis and new epidermis underwent synchronous development in epithelization, as if forming ?a unit?. The scar tissue has the same layered structure as seen in normal skin, namely epidermis including basement membrane, papillary dermis, and reticular dermis. The new epidermis on the new papillary dermis demonstrated a mature appearance and a mechanically stable condition. Conclusions: The healing process proceeds as forming a unit composed by epidermis including basement and papillary dermis, and is finally completed with total coverage of the wound by this unit. We would like to call this unit, the ?epithelization unit?.

AB  - Aim: Recently, various types of cultured skin substitutes have been developed and some of them are used clinically. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of allogenic cultured dermal substitute which was applied to burn injuries in clinical trials such as deep dermal burns and dermal burns. Methods: Allogenic cultured dermal substitute (CDS) was simply applied to the burn wound, over which covering materials were applied to protect CDS. Results: The application of CDS to deep dermal burns was proved to facilitate healthy granulation tissue formation at early stage and epithelialization from the outer margins. When CDS applied to the debrided wound surface of dermal burns, an excellent wound bed was generated which was suitable for the graft take of an autologous patch. Conclusion: CDS provides an excellent epithelialization and granulation for burn wounds.

AB  - Aim: Clinical researches using allogeneic CDS, developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University, have been carried out in 30 medical centers across Japan. The clinical results in our hospital, especially focusing on the treatment of refractory ulcers and dermal burns, were reported in this study. Methods: The CDS was prepared by plating cultured fibroblasts on a spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid and atelo-collagen. The CDS was used in 13 clinical trials, including 6 refractory ulcers, 4 dermal burns, 1 skin defect left behind preparing skin flaps, and 2 skin defects left behind removal of scar. The use of CDS in conjunction with a conventional ointment-gauze dressing was repeated at an interval of 4 to 7 days over a period of 2 to 6 weeks. Results: The successful application with CDS was achieved in all cases. Especially, in case of refractory ulcers, failed to heal even by using trafermin (Fiblast spray?) or other ointments, a complete healing was achieved in one case and wound size reduction was observed in other 5 cases within 6 weeks. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the CDS is effective in the treatment of refractory ulcers and other skin defects. The excellent clinical results seem to be related to the cytokines released from the CDS.

AB  - We have treated superficial skin lesions using pulsed carbon dioxide laser with scanner (NIDEK COL-1040). We can choose the shape, size and power of irradiation programmed in the scanner. It makes the treatment more effective and uniform to combine the scanner mode with the pulse mode. However, for a lesion of complicated shape, it is difficult to avoid skin damage caused by multiple irradiations to a small area and/or irradiation to the normal skin. The result may be unsatisfactory with pigmentation or unsightly scar in such case. As the water-solvability is a characteristic of the carbon dioxide laser beam, we used water film around the lesion to avoid unexpected irradiation to the normal skin. This method provided us better results.

AB  - It is clear that the interruption of microcirculation is one of the significant factors to the pathophysiology of pressure ulcers. But the relation between them has not sufficiently elucidated yet. We aimed at developing the experimental animal model of pressure ulcers. Using the originally designed skinfold chamber and pressing systems, we visualized interruption, remodeling and angiogenesis of microcirculation dynamically. And such various microcirculatory responses also could be evaluated and recorded chronically. We compared ischemia-induced injury to ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury with this model, and analyzed each reaction of microcirculation quantitatively by measuring the functional capillary density. This model can be useful from the viewpoint of microcirculation.

AB  - In this study, the bone defects created on animal cranium which treated by BMP gene (cDNA plasmid) and bFGF protein introduced with porous HAP and the bone formation was analyzed histpathologically. The bone defect of 1.2?cm in the diameter was made on rabbit's cranium and HAP pellets of exactly 1.0?cm in diameter were implanted after completion of hemostasis. The amount of the bone formation was compared with or without the presence of the BMP-2 cDNA plasmid. In addition, simultaneous administration of bFGF containing solution with or without BMP gene were performed to analyze the effect of combined use of them. The bone formation was vigorously observed in the cranial defect in the groups, which received the BMP-2 gene with HAP at three weeks after the operation, and complete ossification was observed at 9 weeks after the operation. In the HAP which containing BMP-2 gene implanted group, although it revealed that new bone formation was evident surrounding the HAP pellets at three weeks after the operation, the inducted bone tissue did not fill to the entire pores of the HAP pellets even at 9 weeks after the operation which condition was improved by coadministration of bFGF with BMP gene. Those results show that at the BMP gene therapies the bone formation in the pores of the HAP pellet was promoted by coadministration of bFGF. It is possible the effects of the administration of the BMP-2 gene will be improved, from the above-mentioned result, through coadministration of bFGF and BMP gene.

AB  - Aim: This study observed neovascularization in an artificial dermis after secondary skin grafting both light microscopically and electron microscopically and examined the optimal time of operation for secondary skin grafting through change in form of the graft. Method: Using 31 adult rabbits, full-thickness skin defects were produced inside the ear. Artificial dermis was fixed on one side of the wounds (AD group). On the other side of the wound, artificial dermis was not used (Control group). On the fifth, seventh, and tenth day, thin split-thickness skin was taken from the back of a rabbit, and grafted. Result: It mainly observed about the tenth day because more than 60% of grafts exhibited complete take on the tenth day, while on the fifth or seventh day no taking was observed. Electron microscopic findings reveled that, in the AD group before transplant, neovascularization was seen, extending from the bed to artificial dermis vertically, but there was no angiogenesis observed extending from the wound margin centripetally. This centripetal angiogenesis was observed in the control group and seemed to indicated the contraction of the wound and grafted skin. Conclusion: It was concluded that the most suitable period for secondary skin grafting in the experiment model was 10 days after implantation of artificial dermis.

AB  - Aim: To compare the duplex-derived parameters between patients with early, and those with advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), and to determine the indicative parameters reflecting the progression of CVI. Methods: A total of 1132 limbs in 914 patients with of primary valvular incompetence were included. The clinical manifestations were categorized according to the CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic) classification, and the patients were divided into two groups: group I (C1?3EP,AS,D,P,PR) and group (C4?6EP,AS,D,P,PR). The distribution of venous insufficiency was determined, and the parameters assessed were the duration of reflux (s), the peak reflux velocity (cm/s), and the flow at peak reflux (ml/s). Results: There was no significant difference in overall superficial venous reflux between the groups. And the frequency of isolated deep and perforator incompetence did not differ between the groups. The duration of reflux did not improve the discrimination power between the groups. In contrast, the peak reflux velocity had significant discrimination power at the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ, p?<?0.0001) and sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ, p?=?0.0002), and in the greater saphenous vein (GSV, p?<?0.0001), in the superficial femoral vein (SFV, p?=?0.0041), and popliteal vein (POPV, p?=?0.003). The peak reflux flow was significantly higher in group II at the SFJ (p?<?0.0001) and SPJ (p?=?0.0029), and in the GSV (p?<?0.0001), in the common femoral vein (p?=?0.006), in the SFV (p?=?0.0005), and POPV (p?=?0.0003). Conclusions: Superficial venous insufficiency may play a major role in the disease development of advanced CVI. The peak reflux velocity and peak reflux volume improve discrimination power between early-stage and advanced CVI.

AB  - Aim: Keloid lesions develope as a result of abnormal growth of dermal fibroblasts after the injury. On the other hand, cell division cycle (Cdc) 25 is a family of phosphatases that activate the cell cycle regulating cyclin-dependent kinases. The three members of this family, Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C act in different phases of the cell cycle. In this study, we examined the dgree of expression of these phosphatases in keloid fibroblasts. Methods: Primary cultures of keloid and adjacent normal dermal fibroblasts (n?=?4) as well as frozen and paraffin-embedded keloid and normal dermal tissues (n?=?12 and n?=?17 respectively) were examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses for the expressions of Cdc25A, Cdc25B, Cdc25C and phosphorylated Cdk2. Results: Cdc25A protein levels were frequently increased in keloid fibroblasts as compared to the adjacent normal-appearing fibroblasts or different normal dermal fibroblasts. In contrast, Cdc25B and Cdc25C were none or rarely expressed. The incrased levels of Cdc25A were associated with lower levels of its substrate, Cdk2, in a phosphorylated or inactive form. Conclusions: Taken together, our data show that Cdc25A protein levels increase in keloid fibroblasts and this increase may be sufficient to activate its substrate, Cdk2, and accelerate the cell cycling. These results may have implication for the development of strategies to silence Cdc25A activity after the wound healing as a therapeutic modality for the keloid lesions.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the morbidity associated with both construction and reversal of loop ileostomies. Methods: Thirty-three patients who had loop ileostomies constructed and 31 of these same patients who had their loop ileostomies reversed between 1994 and 2001 were reviewed. The loop ileostomies were constructed in round-shaped (2.5?3?cm in diameter) like a end ileostomy and everted to produce a 2?3?cm stoma without a rod Results: The average size of ileostomies was 28???29???25(hight)mm. Five patients had complications arising from ileostomy construction including 4 parastomal irritation, 1 ileus, and 1 stomal ulcer. All complications improved with conservative management. Mean time to ileostomy reversal was 78 days. Of 31 patients who had loop ileostomies reversed, 10 patients had staple closure (functional end-to-end anastomosis with ENDO GIA 45). Nine patients had complications associated with reversal including 6 small bowel obstruction due to anastomotic stenosis(anastomotic edema), 1 leakage and 2 SIRS. Of these 9 patients, 2 required surgical intervention. One patient suffered leakage required reanastomosis, one for SIRS required reconstruction of loop ileostomy. Of 6 patients developed small bowel obstruction, 3 required long intestinal tube decompression. All patients improved with conservative management. 10 patients who had their loop ileostomies closed by functional end-to-end anastomosis had no bowel obstruction and other complications. Conclusions: Defunctioning loop ileostomy is associated with low morbidity. We recommend a defunctioning ileostomy as the procedure of choice for temporary fecal diversion, and functional end-to-end anastomosis in reversal of ileostomies.

Good granulation, epithelialization and reduction of ulcer were observed in all patients by once-daily spraying of this product after washing the topical region. This preparation is a drug developed aiming at the basic fibroblast-proliferating factor playing an important role in the wound healing process in the body and expecting the therapeutic effects on refractory skin ulcer. Although there are some restrictions including the tropical conditions such as infection and adherence of necrosed tissues and careful administration to the patients with a past history of malignant tumor, its good therapeutic effects were expected in the patients ineffective with other drugs, and this product was evaluated to be useful from the viewpoint of QOL, such as shortening of treatment period, reduction of cost and low invation.

AB  - Summary This chapter highlights the history of biological approaches to mood disorders and then reviews recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of these complex disorders. Perhaps the major development in the past decade has been a shift from a view of depression as a relatively straightforward disorder of monoaminergic function to a more nuanced view of multiple causal steps ranging from alterations in neuronal second messenger systems to dysregulation of growth factor, peptide, and transmitter systems. Bipolar disorder includes manic or hypomanic episodes alternating with depressive episodes, with periods of normal mood between episodes. The depressive episodes of bipolar disorder are phenomenologically indistinguishable from unipolar depressions. The chapter presents a brief review of neurotrophic/growth factor systems and signaling pathways. It presents an overview of the data demonstrating the role of these factors in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.

AB  - Aim: Lethal diseases occasionally present with a ?chronic? ulcer. If a physician can not realize this fact, the ulcer might give rise to a misery result. We present three educational cases of chronic ulcers that give caution to physicians. Case report: The first case was a hand ulcer due to postradiation squamous cell carcinoma, which eventually led to amputation of index and middle finger. The second case was a leg ulcer due to postburn squamous cell carcinoma, resulting in death caused by visceral metastasis. Both cases were treated as simple chronic ulcers at other clinics for a long time. The third case was a lower leg ulcer caused by infection with cryptococcus neoformans. The ulcer was covered with a split thickness skin graft after administration of anti-fungal drugs. Conclusions: As seen in these cases, we must always have serious doubts why the ulcer is not easily healed. If the causative factor is not easily found, biopsies from the ulcer would be helpful for the true diagnosis of the ulcerative lesions.

AB  - Aim: A treatment of extensive burn contracture in children needs to repeat the autologous skin graft. This study was designed to evaluate the application of autologous CDS to prepare the proper wound bed acceptable for the split-thickness autologous skin graft. Methods: Prior to the clinical study, the master cell banking system was established using a small piece of skin derived from each patient. The autologous CDS was prepared by plating the patient's own fibroblasts, cultured from the master cells, on a spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid and atelo-collagen. The CDS was applied on the skin defects left behind surgical excision to release scar contracture. The split-thickness autologous skin graft (6?8/1000?inch) was applied on the wound bed, prepared by using the CDS. Results: The clinical trials were conducted in 5 cases. When the autologous CDS was applied on the skin defect, exposing subcutaneous fatty tissue, the highly vascularlized wound bed was prepared within about 1 week. Although a split-thickness skin graft was very thin, the severe contracture was not observed over a period of several months. Conclusion: The application of autologous CDS is promising for the treatment for extensive burn scar contracture in children.

Accordingly, in consideration of cosmetic factors, we have devised a method for the removal of even a larger elevated lentigo by the Flat Resection technique which can be used effectively without causing a depressed scar to form. Upon the primary laser irradiation, the lesion was resected at the horizontal plane of the skin, and the resected tumor was subjected to histopathological analysis. If the lesion remained about one month after the primary irradiation, additional laser treatment was performed at the patient's request. From our experience, satisfactory outcomes were obtained for up to 12-mm lesions. Following the flat resection, residual lesions were pathologically observed in 52.5%, and macroscopically observed in 45%. Additional laser treatment was performed for 35%. It was considered that this technique is useful for sites such as the base of ala nasi and the vicinity of the eyebrow, of which simple reefing requires skills. However, since the possibility of malignant degeneration of lentigo could not be ruled out in a longer-term follow-up, particular care is needed to select a case suitable for this technique.
