AB  - Aim: Limb ulcer due to severe ischemia often needs revascularization. In our hospital, the result of lower extremity bypass surgery for these patients is satisfactory, however, indication of this procedure is limited pathologically and technically. We recently have demonstrated a possibility of efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis by autologous bone marrow cell transplantation for severe ischemic ulcer of extremity. Methods: Eight patients (9limbs; 3limbs with arteriosclerosis obliterans, 6limbs with Buerger's disease) with ischemic ulcer of lower and/or upper extremity were treated with implantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell into ischemic skeletal muscles. Four weeks after transplantation, efficacy of this procedure were evaluated by Visual Ana log Scale, angiography and Laser Doppler Flow Analysis (LDFA). Results: In 4 out of 9 limbs, the ulcers healed dramatically. Seven limbs revealed angiographically improvement and icrease of blood flow by LDFA. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that therapeutic angiogenesis by autologous bone marrow cell transplantation is an effective and safty strategy for patient with peripheral arterial disease. We considered that it is more effective to Buerger's disease than arteriosclerosis obliterans.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of wound dressing material, Calcium-Zinc Alginate: Curasorb Zn? as a carrier of the recombinant human bFGF, histological detection was performed. Methods: Full thickness skin defect on the back of Wistar rat was made for four groups; the control group, bFGF group; topical application of recombinant human bFGF for 5??g per day, Ca-Zn Alginate group; topical use of the dressing and the group that both the bFGF and Ca-Zn Alginate were applied, nine rats for respective group. Results: Significant granulation was noted both bFGF group and Ca-Zn Alginate group compared to the control group. Fibrosis was noted in the control and Ca-Zn Alginate group whereas no fibrosis was noted in the FGF group. Numerous amounts of cells were noted in the FGF group which indicate strong inflammation. Also, marked abscess formation was noted in the bFGF group. The greatest thickness of granulation was obtained in the group that both the bFGF and Ca-Zn Alginate were applied. Conclusions: It was considered that the appropriate use of the carrier for the bFGF is important to control infection. The Ca-Zn Alginate dressing was effective to suppress abscess formation.

AB  - Aim: This study was aimed to confirm the usefulness of allogeneic cultured dermal substitute (CDS) in the treatment of skin defects after excision of skin cancer. Methods: Eleven elderly patients (mean age of 76.3 year old) with skin cancer were included in this study. Most of the patients had basic disease such as diabetes or ASO. Allogeneic CDS used in the study were produced at Kitasato University. The CDS were applied to skin defects with exposing bone or tendon after oncological surgery, and changed once or twice a week until the open wound became suitable for autologous skin grafting or healed completely. Results: Healthy granulation tissue was formed to cover the exposed bone or tendon in all cases. Only in one case, the treatment with allogeneic CDS was abandoned owing to undesirable infection. In eight cases, appropriate wound beds acceptable for autologous skin graft were prepared. In other two cases, the skin defect became smaller and eventually closed without skin graft. In ten cases with or without skin graft, undesirable scar contracture was not observed over prolonged follow-up. Conclusions: Elderly patients with skin cancer provide reconstructive surgeons with challenging problems when bone or bare tendon is exposed after oncological surgery. Flap transfer might be complicated especially when the patients suffered from a basic disease such as diabetes or ASO. This study has confirmed that the use of allogeneic CDS is a safe and reliable method to achieve wound healing in those high-risk patients.

AB  - We showed mesenchymal progenitor cells(MPC) contain various cells, and the differentiational capacities and effects on wound healing were different each other. Bone marrow of the femur of adult F344 rat was suspended into culture medium and plated on a plastic dish.10?15 passaged cells were cloned in 100 types cells. For investigation of the differentiational capacity, the cells were treated by differentiational medium. The capacity of myogenesis was examined immunohistochemically with anti-skeletal muscle myosin antibody. Osteochondrogenesis were investigated by alcian blue staining and adipogenesis by oil red O staining. The 53% of cells showed myogenesis, 78% osteochondrogenesis and 100% adipogenesis. The one type of cell showed amazing adipogenesis pattern, which we named ?O? cell. Next we injected MPC and this ?O? cell into the rats? dorsal skin, and 1?cm full thickness incisional wounds were made immediately after. 2 weeks later, wounds were harvested and examined histologically. The wounds transplanted with high dose of MPC healed with very fine scar and collagen fibers were thick and aligned like normal dermis. But by transplanting the ?O? cells, wounds healed with ordinary scar formation. By tansplantating mesenchymal progenitor cells, lesion healed with less scars. And there was a possibility that the MPC responded to the wound healing and regenerated dermal structure nearly normally. But the wounds healed not well by transplanting just ?O? cell although it possesses the amazing differentiational capacity. The data demonstrate that plural types cells were necessary for wound healing.

AB  - Failure of re-epithelialization characterizes the pathophysiology of chronic wounds. However, the mechanism of this failure has not been fully clarified. During the re-epithelialization of acute wounds, migrating epidermal cells up-regulate integrins α5?1, αv?5, αv?6 and these integrins play an important role in the re-epithelialization process. Laminin-1 is a basement membrane component which appears during the late phase of the re-epithelialization process. In this study, with 6 specimens from burn patients (acute wounds, control) and 11 specimens from patients with pressure ulcers, we examined the expression of α5?1 in the migrating epidermis, laminin-1 at the dermal-epidermal junction and fibronectin in the dermis by an immunohistochemical method. We then compared the findings for α5?1 with histological, laminin-1 and fibronectin distribution findings. In 8 out of the 11 pressure ulcer specimens, the expression of α5?1 significantly decreased or was negative while it increased in the control. The degree of expression correlated well with histological findings of epidermal elongation over the wound bed. Moreover, fibronectin distribution in all the pressure ulcer specimens decreased considerably while it increased in three out of the six burn specimens. A statistically significant correlation was found between the distance at which the cells were positively stained for α5?1 and the distance at which they were negatively stained for laminin-1 in both the burn (control) and pressure ulcer specimens. Our data demonstrated that the decrease in α5?1 expression correlated with the failure in re-epithelialization of chronic wounds (pressure ulcers). It was also suggested that the decrease in fibronectin distribution was responsible for the failure of the re-epithelialization process.

AB  - Aim: This paper reports on the delay in wound healing of chronic hemodyalysis patients who under-went abdominal surgery. Methods: The subjects were 19 hemodyalysis patients who had had elective abdominal operations and 20 hemodyalysis patients who had undergone emergency abdominal surgery. For all subjects, we retroactively investigated the incidence of wound complications and the differences in postoperative values for TP, ALB, RBC and HGB between the wound-complication group and the no- wound-complication group. Results: In the elective-surgery group, the incidence of wound complications was 21%, including one suture failure, one wound deficiency and three wound infections. No patients died. In the emergency-surgery group, the incidence of wound complications was 40%, with two suture failures, four wound deficiencies and two wound infections. The postoperative death rate was 20%. There was no significant difference in TP, ALB, RBC, or HGB between the wound-complication group and the non-complication group in either the elective or the emergency surgery group. Conclusions: In hemodyalysis patients, pre-and postoperative infection had a great influence on wound healing.

AB  - Aim: Quality of Life (QOL) of patients after cancer surgery has become more important as success rate of surgical treatment has been improved. Anal sphincter preservation has been concerned in treatment for colon cancer, in particular rectum cancer. However, in order for patients to become cancer free, colostomy is the essential treatment. In usual stoma, skin contacts directly with colon membrane, and this sometimes induces (i) skin troubles around the stoma (e.g., ulcer, abscess, fistula), and (ii) constriction, collapse, perforation, hernia or obstruction of the colon. The skin troubles are the complications that are unavoidable only through the improvement and control of the equipment because the skin directly touches to the stool. Therefore, preventive measures should be employed at colostomy. For this purpose, a new colostomy technique was applied from the point of plastic and reconstruction surgery. Methods: In order to reduce the duration and area of direct contact with stool, local flap and split-thickness skin grafting are applied. Colon is pull out to the abdominal wall by using the usual surgical procedure. The stoma is kept at a certain height from the abdominal wall by using the flap and the graft. Results: To date, the longest follow-up period is 8 years and 7 months. Frequency of skin problems due to direct contact with stool was reduced, infection and constriction on and around the stoma have been prevented, and defecation became able to be better managed.

AB  - Introduction: Oral mucosa heals faster with less scar than skin, but its mechanism has not been elucidated enough. We have studied whether there are any differences in the dynamic study of the bFGF expression in vivo during wound healing between oral mucosa and skin. Methods: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized, and a 3?mm circular exisional wound was made on the dorsum skin and intrabuccal mucosa of each rat. At days 0,1,3,5,7 and 10 post-wounding,wounds were harvested, and embedded in OCT. From photographs of the wounds, each wound area was measured by means of NIH images. Also, for histological study, sections were stained haematoxylin and eosin, and for immunohistochemical study, sections were stained with anti-bFGF antibody. Results: Oral wounds contracted significantly faster than skin. Regenerated skin appeared at day 1 post-wounding in oral wounds, but at day 3 in skin. Re-epithelialization was completed on day 5 post-wounding in oral, but on day 7 in skin. The number of bFGF-positive cells gradually increased in the granulation tissue, and the peak of positive cells in oral was observed on day 5 post-wounding, while that in skin on day 7. Conclusion: Oral mucosa healed faster than skin. The peak of bFGF expression was faster in oral mucosa than skin. It was thougt that bFGF effects the differences during wound healing between oral mucosa and skin.

AB  - Summary This chapter highlights the history of biological approaches to mood disorders and then reviews recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of these complex disorders. Perhaps the major development in the past decade has been a shift from a view of depression as a relatively straightforward disorder of monoaminergic function to a more nuanced view of multiple causal steps ranging from alterations in neuronal second messenger systems to dysregulation of growth factor, peptide, and transmitter systems. Bipolar disorder includes manic or hypomanic episodes alternating with depressive episodes, with periods of normal mood between episodes. The depressive episodes of bipolar disorder are phenomenologically indistinguishable from unipolar depressions. The chapter presents a brief review of neurotrophic/growth factor systems and signaling pathways. It presents an overview of the data demonstrating the role of these factors in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.

AB  - Aim: It is reported that Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increases the number and functions of the neutrophils of blood in animal models. In the present study, we observed the effects of G-CSF in rats with severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: Pancreatitis was induced by injection of 0.2?ml of 3% taurocholate acid into biliopancreatic duct of the Wistar rat. Thirty rats were randomized into three groups. 1: Control group (C group). 2: Acute pancreatitis (AP) group. 3: AP?+?G-CSF groups. G-CSF was administrated via jugular veins 1 hour before induction of pancreatitis. Blood and ascites at 1 and 3 hours after induction of pancreatitis were measured for the number of neutrophils, their phagocytosis and bactericidal activity and the concentrations of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â. Results: The phagocytic neutrophils increased in AP?+?G-CSF group (22?±?4.3???105) compared with AP group (10?±?1.9???105)(p?<?0.05); the bactericidal neutrophils increased in AP?+?G-CSF group (60?±?14.5???105) compared with AP group (20?±?6.1???105)(p?<?0.05). G-CSF did not increase any the concentration of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â in blood and ascites. Conclusions: G-CSF increases the number of phagocytic and bactericidal neutrophils of blood and ascites in SAP rat, without increasing the concentration of TNF-á, IL-6 and IL-1â, therefore improves host defense against infection.

AB  - This study was designed to try the application of autologous cultured dermal substitute (CDS) in conjunction with patient's own epidermis. The autologous CDS was prepared by seeding cultured autolougus fibroblasts on the spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid and atelo-collagen. A 9-year-old man with a giant congenital pigmented nevus (intradermal type) was included in this clinical study. A part of nevus (30?cm???10?cm) was excised superficially at a thickness of 20/1000?inches, and followed by second excision to remove nevus at a level of full-thickness skin. The autologous CDS was applied to the debrided wound surface. The split-thickenss skin obtained by first excision was preserved at 4?°C. After 1 week, the epidermis was obtained from the preserved split-thickness skin using dispase, and followed by grafting on the wound bed, which was prepared by applying autologous CDS. This patient's own epidermis was found to take permanently, achieving an excellent clinical results.

AB  - Aim: To examine the efficacy and safety of human embryonic stem (ES) cell-based therapies, allogeneic transplantation of monkey ES cells would be useful. We transplanted genetically marked monkey ES cells into the allogeneic fetus. Methods and Results: Cynomolgus ES cells were transduced once using a simian immunodeficiency virus-based lentivirus vector encoding the GFP gene driven by the CMV promoter at 1, 10 and 100 transducing units per cell. Five days posttransduction, 60, 80 and 90% of the cells expressed GFP, respectively, and the expression levels were stable for 5 months. GFP expression was still observed after embryoid-body formation. The gene-marked ES cells were transplanted into the cynomolgus fetus in the abdominal cavity (n?=?2) or liver (n?=?1) after the first trimester. The fetuses were delivered 1 month posttransplantation. Transplanted cell progeny were detected (?1%) in multiple tissues by quantitative PCR and in situ PCR of the GFP sequence. No teratoma was found in the tissues. Conclusions: Cynomolgus ES cells can be engrafted in the allogeneic fetus. We are now trying to transplant cynomolgus ES cells differentiated to neural or hematopoietic lineage.

AB  - Aim: Various treatments for hypertrophic and keloid scars have been attempted including electron beam irradiation, local triamcinolone injection, oral tranilast administration, use of silicone sheets, and compression therapy using splints. Among them, we have been attempting silicone cushion patching on hypertrophic scar. Methods: Twenty cases (10 males, 10 females) with hypertrophic scar were treated with silicone cushion. Scar surfaces were kept in contact with silicone cushion for as long periods of time as possible every day. Results were assessed in scores using objective findings (redness, bulging, induration) and subjective symptoms (itching, spontaneous pain, tenderness). Results: As for objective findings, redness remained unchanged in one case, but bulging and induration were found improved in all cases. As for subjective symptoms, itching and tenderness were found improved in all cases and clinical course considered proving usefulness of the treatment was obtained. Conclusions: Silicone cushions have highly viscous silicone oil enclosed in the silicone pack designed to generate negative charge electrostatic fields. Generation of adequate and sustaining electrostatic fields is important for useful clinical effect to exhibit on hypertrophic scar recession. Generation of negative charge electrostatic fields was confirmed on potential determination data with an electrostatic field meter as well.

AB  - Aim: Regarding the recent change in the surgical technique of infraumbilical incision for laparoscope insertion from lateral incision to longitudinal incision to reach inside the umbilicus, we conducted this study to find the merits and demerits of change as well as to clarify the circumstance in which poor wound cure occurs after laparoscopic operation. Methods: Total 608 patients who underwent laparoscopic operations between February 2000 and July 2002 at this hospital were used as the subjects of this study. Accordingly, the comparison was made between the 343 cases in the early stage (lateral incision) and the 380 cases in the late stage (longitudinal incision). Results: Postoperative wound trouble occurred in 24 (3.9%) of the 608 cases. Infection occurred in the wound made by open laparoscopy in 5 patients. The trouble in the trocker insertion site itself was observed in 19 cases (3.1%). The infraumbilical wound trouble occurred in 10 cases in the early stage and 5 cases in late stage indicated, indicating lower trouble rate in the latter.
