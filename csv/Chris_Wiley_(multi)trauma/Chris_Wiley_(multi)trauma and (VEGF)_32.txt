AB  - Summary This chapter highlights the history of biological approaches to mood disorders and then reviews recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of these complex disorders. Perhaps the major development in the past decade has been a shift from a view of depression as a relatively straightforward disorder of monoaminergic function to a more nuanced view of multiple causal steps ranging from alterations in neuronal second messenger systems to dysregulation of growth factor, peptide, and transmitter systems. Bipolar disorder includes manic or hypomanic episodes alternating with depressive episodes, with periods of normal mood between episodes. The depressive episodes of bipolar disorder are phenomenologically indistinguishable from unipolar depressions. The chapter presents a brief review of neurotrophic/growth factor systems and signaling pathways. It presents an overview of the data demonstrating the role of these factors in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.

AB  - Summary.? Vascular development requires correct interactions among endothelial cells, pericytes and surrounding cells. These interactions involve many cell adhesion interactions, including cell?matrix interactions both with basement membranes and with surrounding extracellular matrices. Investigations of the contributions of these various interactions in vascular development and angiogenesis have been rather uneven and incomplete over the past 10?15?years. There has been considerable concentration on a few receptors, matrix proteins and proteolytic fragments with the goal of finding means to control angiogenesis. Many other potential contributors have received much less attention. Even for those molecules that have been subject to intensive investigation, our knowledge is incomplete. This review will survey the spectrum of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and cell?matrix adhesion receptors (particularly integrins) that are likely to contribute to angiogenesis and discuss what is known and not known about the roles of each of them.

AB  - This study was conducted to know the impact of cryopreservation on caprine fetal adnexa derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the basic stem cell characteristics. Gravid caprine uteri (2?3 months) were collected from local abattoir to derive (amniotic fluid [cAF], amniotic sac [cAS], Wharton's jelly [cWJ], and cord blood [cCB]) MSCs and expanded in vitro. Cells were cryopreserved at 3rd passage (P3) using 10% DMSO. Post-thaw viability and cellular properties were assessed. Cells were expanded to determine growth kinetics, tri-lineage differentiation, localization, and molecular expression of MSCs and pluripotency markers; thereafter, these cells were transplanted in the full-thickness (2???2cm2) rat skin wound to determine their wound healing potential. The post-thaw (pt) growth kinetics study suggested that cWJ MSCs expanded more rapidly with faster population doubling time (PDT) than that of other fetal adnexa MSCs. The relative mRNA expression of surface antigens (CD73, CD90, and CD 105) and pluripotency markers (Oct4, KLF, and cMyc) was higher in cWJ MSCs in comparison to cAS, cAF, and cCB MSCs post-thaw. The percent wound contraction on 7th day was more than 50% for all the MSC-treated groups (pre and post-thaw), against 39.55% in the control group. On day 28th, 99% and more wound contraction was observed in cAF, cAF-pt, cAS-pt, cWJ, cWJ-pt, and cCB, MSCs with better scores for epithelization, neovascularization, and collagen characteristics at a non-significant level. It is concluded that these MSCs could be successfully cryopreserved without altering their stemness and wound healing properties. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.
