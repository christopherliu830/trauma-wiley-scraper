AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Abstract Brain perivascular macrophages (PVMs) belong to a distinct population of brain-resident myeloid cells located within the perivascular space surrounding arterioles and venules. Their characterization depends on the combination of anatomical localization, phagocytic capacity, and molecular markers. Under physiological status, they provide structural and functional support for maintaining brain homeostasis, including facilitation of blood-brain barrier integrity and lymphatic drainage, and exertion of immune functions such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Increasing evidence also implicates their specific roles in diseased brain, ranging from cerebrovascular diseases, A? pathologies, infections, and autoimmunity. Collectively, PVMs are key components of the brain-resident immune system, actively participate in a broad-spectrum of processes in normal and diseased status. Details of the processes are largely underexplored. Targeting PVMs would lead to new insights and be a promising strategy for a broad array of human diseases.

AB  - The blood?brain barrier (BBB) is a complex vascular structure consisting of microvascular endothelial cells that line the vessel wall, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, as well as the basal lamina. BBB cells act in concert to maintain the characteristic impermeable and low paracellular flux of the brain vascular network, thus ensuring a homeostatic neuronal environment. Alterations in BBB stability that occur during injury have dire consequences on disease progression and it is clear that BBB cell-specific responses, positive or negative, must make a significant contribution to injury outcome. Reduced oxygenation, or hypoxia, is a characteristic of many brain diseases that significantly increases barrier permeability. Recent data suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), the master regulator of the hypoxic response, probably mediates many hypoxic effects either directly or indirectly via its target genes. This review discusses current knowledge of physiological cell-specific regulation of barrier function, their responses to hypoxia as well as consequences of hypoxic- and HIF-1-mediated mechanisms on barrier integrity during select brain diseases. In the final sections, the potential of current advances in targeting HIF-1 as a therapeutic strategy will be overviewed.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in the approval and commercialization of gene therapeutics have fostered the return of gene therapy to center stage. But despite new optimism, no Food and Drug Administration approved product exists for the treatment of orthopedic disorders. Non-viral gene delivery is a promising alternative to recombinant protein administration and viral gene transduction for orthopedic tissue engineering. When applied using appropriately designed systems, it enables temporal control of the overexpression of therapeutic genes, leading to local production of regulatory factors at physiologically relevant levels. Incorporating genetic material into 3D scaffold biomaterials, that is, gene activated scaffolds or hydrogels, presents a particular opportunity to utilize non-viral gene therapy for in situ transfection of host cells and the regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. But controlled non-viral gene delivery for musculoskeletal regeneration depends on a multifactorial design in which the choice of gene delivery method, therapeutic gene, and supportive biomaterial play a central role for the success of this strategy. This paper reviews the different modalities of non-viral gene delivery used for the repair of bone and cartilage, and explores the current challenges and opportunities for the engineering of functional orthopedic tissues using gene activated scaffolds.
