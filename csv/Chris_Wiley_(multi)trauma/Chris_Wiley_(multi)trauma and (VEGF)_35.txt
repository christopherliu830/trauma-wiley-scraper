AB  - Summary There are many tubular structures in mammalian tissues. Tubular tissues generally have two distinguishing features: one is their specific three-dimensional shape; the other is their multilayered tubular walls, which are composed of different cell types. Mimicking the key features of tubular tissues in vitro is a challenge and prerequisite when engineering functional tissues. Currently, many methods to fabricate novel tubular structures have emerged. By using 2D cell patterning and stress-induced rolling membrane (SIRM) techniques, we can fabricate 3D tubes with controllable sizes in which different types of cells constitute different layers of the vessel wall, mimicking their natural arrangement in vivo. Furthermore, special-shaped tubular structures have been developed, which may mimic complex tubular tissues, such as the spinal cord. In summary, these newly developed tubular structures using microfluidic methods provide an opportunity to fabricate highly complex tissues that mimic structures in vitro and would be useful for tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract The current review focuses on pathophysiology, animal models and molecular analysis of stroke and retinal ischemia, and the role of stem cells in recovery of these disease conditions. Research findings associated with ischemic stroke and retinal ischemia have been discussed, and efforts towards prevention and limiting the recurrence of ischemic diseases, as well as emerging treatment possibilities with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in ischemic diseases, are presented. Although most neurological diseases are still not completely understood and reliable treatment is lacking, animal models provide a major step in validating novel therapies. Stem cell approaches constitute an emerging form of cell-based therapy to treat ischemic diseases since it is an attractive source for regenerative therapy in the ischemic diseases. In this review, we highlight the advantages and limitations of this approach with a focus on key observations from preclinical animal studies and clinical trials. Further research, especially on treatment with EPCs is warranted. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 1269?1279, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Human mesenchymal or stromal cells (hMSCs) isolated from various adult tissues are primary candidates in cell therapy and tissue regeneration. Despite promising results in preclinical studies, robust therapeutic responses to MSC treatment have not been reproducibly demonstrated in clinical trials. In the translation of MSC-based therapy to clinical application, studies of MSC metabolism have significant implication in optimizing bioprocessing conditions to obtain therapeutically competent hMSC population for clinical application. In addition, understanding the contribution of metabolic cues in directing hMSC fate also provides avenues to potentiate their therapeutic effects by modulating their metabolic properties. This review focuses on MSC metabolism and discusses their unique metabolic features in the context of common metabolic properties shared by stem cells. Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of MSC metabolic characteristics in relation to their in vivo origin and metabolic regulation during proliferation, lineage-specific differentiation, and exposure to in vivo ischemic conditions are summarized. Metabolic strategies in directing MSC fate to enhance their therapeutic potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are discussed. ? 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.
