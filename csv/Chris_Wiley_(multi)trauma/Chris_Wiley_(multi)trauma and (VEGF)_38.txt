AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.

AB  - Summary Splinter hemorrhages (SHs) of the nails represent a frequent although not specific clinical finding that has been associated with conditions of varying severity. However, to date, there is no single report of their characteristics and etiologies. The aim of this study is to guide clinical practice by reviewing all of the data concerning SH of the nails that have become available since the first description of this condition was published in 1923, with particular reference to all clinical features, associated medical conditions, pathogenesis, and necessary workup. PubMed and EMBASE were searched using the keywords ?splinter? AND ?hemorrhage*?; the only articles excluded were those studying SHs of the retina. Splinter hemorrhage is a frequent nail disorder that may be idiopathic, drug-induced, or a sign of a dermatological disease, such as psoriasis and lichen planus, or a wide range of systemic disorders, the most important of which are infections and vasculitis. Clinicians and dermatologists should be aware of all the clinical features of both SH and associated medical conditions.

AB  - Stem cells have potential in the retrieval and repair of injured tissue and renovation of organ function. To date, several studies have been carried out to elucidate how differentiation of stem cells can be used in regenerative medicine applications. Adipose tissue is an abundant and accessible source of stem cell, useful for regenerative therapeutic use. Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are favorable for future translational research and can be applied in many clinical settings. Adipose tissue repair has been recently adopted in clinical trials to prove that ASCs can be successfully used in patients. Variability in cell culture procedures (isolation, characterization, and differentiation) may have an influence on the experimental outcome. In this report, we consider the selection mechanisms of ASCs using flow cytometry, cell culture, freezing/thawing, cell cycle evaluation, histochemistry/immunofluorescence, and differentiation of ASCs. Both researchers and regulatory institutions should consider a new policy for GMP procedures and protocols, paying special attention to stem cell bio-physiology, to facilitate more clinically oriented studies. ASCs show angiogenic properties, with prospects of repairing tissue damaged by radiotherapy, as well as possessing the ability to heal chronic wounds. They can also be useful in surgical practice. We focus on the potential clinical application of ASCs that are currently available regarding translational medicine and the methods and procedures for their isolation, differentiation, and characterization.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were originally identified in Xenopus frogs as receptors that induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in cells. All three isoforms of PPAR possess similar structural and functional features. Activation of target genes occurs through direct binding of the PPAR:RXR heterodimer to specific nucleotide sequences called peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). Recent studies revealed new ways to activate PPARs and affect physiology. Each PPAR subtype is characterized by a specific tissue expression pattern, thereby accounting for their distinct biological functions. This chapter focuses on the major functions of PPARs, separated by PPAR subtypes, and their role in inflammatory, innate immunity, cancer, and angiogenic processes. PPARα and PPAR? serve as therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, respectively, and synthetic ligands of PPARδ are currently being explored for their potential to improve plasma lipoprotein levels.

AB  - Abstract The ideal stem cell for use in functional tissue engineering needs to be abundantly available, harvested with minimal morbidity, differentiated reliably down various pathways and able to be transplanted safely and efficaciously. Adult human adipose tissue contains a population of mesenchymal stem cells, termed ?adipose-derived stem cells? (ASC), which seem to fulfil most, if not all, of these criteria. ASC can be harvested readily, safely, and in relative abundance by modern liposuction techniques. They are capable of differentiating into other mesenchymal tissue types, including adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes and osteoblasts. They also show angiogenic properties, with recent evidence of a potential role in healing radiotherapy-damaged tissue, possibly due to their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Similarly, they may have a role in healing chronic wounds, and as such are being investigated in phase 1 trials for their ability to aid healing of recurrent Crohn?s fistulae. Subsequently they have a wide range of potential clinical uses in all fields of surgery. This article reviews the current and potential clinical applications of ASC in relation to surgery, as well as methods for their isolation, differentiation and molecular characterization.
