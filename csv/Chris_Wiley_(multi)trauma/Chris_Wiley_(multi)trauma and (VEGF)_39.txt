AB  - Summary This chapter presents case studies describing controversies, consensus, and new targets of recurrent and metastatic colorectal cancer. One case study discusses the scenario of a 53-year-old man presented four years ago with abdominal pain and signs of large bowel obstruction. He was diagnosed with an obstructing colon cancer at the hepatic flexure. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is 23, and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows new mesenteric lymphadenopathy surrounding the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as well as new 1 cm nodules in each lung. Another case study recommends the use of combination chemotherapy and fluoropyrimidine with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer if patient performance status and comorbidities allow.

AB  - Abstract The ideal stem cell for use in functional tissue engineering needs to be abundantly available, harvested with minimal morbidity, differentiated reliably down various pathways and able to be transplanted safely and efficaciously. Adult human adipose tissue contains a population of mesenchymal stem cells, termed ?adipose-derived stem cells? (ASC), which seem to fulfil most, if not all, of these criteria. ASC can be harvested readily, safely, and in relative abundance by modern liposuction techniques. They are capable of differentiating into other mesenchymal tissue types, including adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes and osteoblasts. They also show angiogenic properties, with recent evidence of a potential role in healing radiotherapy-damaged tissue, possibly due to their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Similarly, they may have a role in healing chronic wounds, and as such are being investigated in phase 1 trials for their ability to aid healing of recurrent Crohn?s fistulae. Subsequently they have a wide range of potential clinical uses in all fields of surgery. This article reviews the current and potential clinical applications of ASC in relation to surgery, as well as methods for their isolation, differentiation and molecular characterization.

AB  - Summary In many cases, bioinspired fabrication of bone tissue aims to recreate embryonic development to achieve greater tissue regeneration in an injured or defective adult tissue. This requires one to understand principles and components of natural bone development, such as inductive molecules (for example, growth factors), cell types, and structural tissue properties, and to incorporate these lessons from nature to form functional mineralized tissue. Therefore, it is important to understand the parameters associated with natural mineralized tissue growth, and which aspects can be mimicked in bone regeneration schemes. This chapter provides information about bone development with particular emphasis on aspects that can be mimicked in bone tissue engineering approaches. These natural processes will be used as a template to illuminate current approaches for mineralized tissue fabrication.

AB  - Abstract The hematopoietic system consists of: (1) a network of stem and progenitor cells of varying degrees of maturity interacting with other cells that possess supportive and regulatory capacities and (2) vascular stem cell niches with supporting stem cells in their self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and mobilization to the circulation. Recent data suggest that selective expression of organ-specific chemokines promotes the mobilization of bone-marrow-derived pluripotent cells, a process that is essential for tissue vascularization and organ regeneration. Despite intensive investigation, the pathways by which mechanical signals are converted to biochemical responses are not completely understood. Recent studies have suggested that chromatin shifts and cell cycle effects stem cell gene expression, and thus results in changes of its surface receptor expression at different points of the cell cycle machinery, therefore changing cell cycle transit. This review will attempt to discuss new approaches to determine the regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation by underlying the significance of the chaotic dynamics of transcriptional networks within a cell, with a combination of chemokines and cytokines in the environment, and mechanical forces, such as; stretch, strain and laminar flow, all involving both cooperation and competition.

AB  - Abstract Natural and synthetic materials have been developed to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix properties for tissue regeneration and reconstruction. On account of the excellent biological and mechanical properties, diverse decellularized tissue materials have been developed as natural scaffolds. Among them, decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has generated great interest in recent years due to the extensiveness of the source and the eximious potential to enhance the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. In this review, we compared the different physical, chemical, and biological treatment in recorded decellularization methods, and illustrated the similarities and differences in the characteristics of various aspects of DATs prepared by different methods, including macroscopic (macro) and microcosmic (micro) structure, cellular contents removal, DNA quantification, collagen, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or growth factors retention, and mechanical properties. We also summarized the DAT application in the studies of tissue regeneration, wound healing, drug screening, and other diseases. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to review developments in glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan research relevant to cartilage repair biology and in particular the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Glycosaminoglycans decorate a diverse range of extracellular matrix and cell associated proteoglycans conveying structural organization and physico-chemical properties to tissues. They play key roles mediating cellular interactions with bioactive growth factors, cytokines, and morphogenetic proteins, and structural fibrillar collagens, cell interactive and extracellular matrix proteoglycans, and glycoproteins which define tissue function. Proteoglycan degradation detrimentally affects tissue functional properties. Therapeutic strategies have been developed to counter these degenerative changes. Neo-proteoglycans prepared from chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan and hyaluronan or collagen-binding peptides emulate the interactive, water imbibing, weight bearing, and surface lubricative properties of native proteoglycans. Many neo-proteoglycans outperform native proteoglycans in terms of water imbibition, matrix stabilization, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. The biospecificity of recombinant proteoglycans however, provides precise attachment to native target molecules. Visco-supplements augmented with growth factors/therapeutic cells, hyaluronan, and lubricin (orthobiologicals) have the capacity to lubricate and protect cartilage, control inflammation, and promote cartilage repair and regeneration of early cartilage lesions and may represent a more effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of mild to moderate OA and deserve further study.

AB  - Summary The use of laser therapy for wound healing has been one of the most studied and implemented applications of photobiomodulation. The established mechanisms and physiologic benefits behind laser therapy make it an obvious choice as an adjunct modality to improve the speed and quality of wound repair. Acute and chronic, mild and severe, and clean and contaminated wounds of all species will respond favorably to laser therapy. For the best clinical results, we need to understand and be able to modify available laser parameters to deliver optimal photobiomodulation treatment regimes.

AB  - Fibrin clot formation during normal wound healing is essential to hemostasis. Fibrin clots also serve as a scaffold for cells, such as fibroblasts, invading the wound bed. The mechanical characteristics of this fibrin ? fibroblast tissue over a period of time, as the fibrin is replaced with collagen, is not well understood. In this paper, we attempt to measure specific mechanical characteristics in these systems over a period of 10 days by using fibrin ? fibroblasts constructs prepared in a culture dish. We have also examined the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final fibrin clot on these characteristics. A well-established indentation protocol was used to determine the nominal elastic modulus of the cell-fibrin constructs at specified time points. Human fibroblast cell line CRL-2522 was used. Fibrin clots with different fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were prepared as described in Cox et al. (Tissue Engineering, Vol. 10 (5/6): 942) with cell concentration of 50,000 fibroblasts per fibrin clot. Four constructs were prepared for each of the following days 1, 5, and 10. 1?mL of a serum ? containing medium was added to each well, and plates were transferred to a 5% CO2 incubator at 37?°C. On days 1, 5, and 10, the fibrin ? fibroblast constructs were subject to a compressive indentation protocol. This involved applying a circular, flat-ended silica indenter to the surface of the cell/fibrin constructs through controlled displacements until reaching a specified maximum displacement, u*. An Instron 3365 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 2.5?N load cell with a load resolution of 0.1?mN was used. Displacement rates in the range of 5?10?mm/min were used with peak displacements, u*?=?0.1?5?mm. The force required to maintain these displacements was automatically recorded and analyzed for indentation stiffness over the fixed displacement range of 1.0?1.5?mm at 50?msec intervals. Our results indicate that for the unpopulated fibrin, there was a linear (R?=?0.983) relationship between the indentation stiffness and fibrinogen concentration. Also, there was a nonlinear relationship between indentation stiffness and concentration of collagen in the fibrin/collagen constructs. Finally, we found in one of the cell-populated formulations a steady decrease in the indentation stiffness with increasing incubation time (1?10 days), suggesting that the cells exerted a significant effect on the construct structure and hence mechanical function.

AB  - Wound healing involves many cell types whose functions are dependent upon the coordinated production of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Recent data show that behavioral stress disrupts the cytokine profile and slows wound closure. For example, in mice, restraint stress (RST) suppressed IL-1?, PDGF, and MCP-1 production, and delayed healing of a 3.5?mm circular wound by more than 3 days. The RST-induced delay in healing was due, in part, to elevated glucocorticoids (GC) and could be blocked by administration of the androgen hormone, androstenediol (AED). Therefore, it was hypothesized that AED would antagonize GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level, prevent RST-mediated/GC-dependent suppression of cytokine expression at the tissue level, and restore healing to that of controls. Total wound RNA was collected after injury, cDNA was synthesized, and real-time PCR was used to quantify IL-1? RNA as a measure of proinflammatory gene expression and I?Bα RNA as a measure of NF-?B transcriptional activation. Compared to controls, RST delayed wound closure (P?<?0.001) and decreased IL-1?(P?=?0.021) and I?Bα expression within 12?24 hours of wounding (P?=?0.021). In contrast, treatment of RST animals with AED restored IL-1? gene expression and restored wound closure to that of controls. Additionally, AED enhanced I?Bα RNA postinjury (P?<?0.001) suggestive of enhanced NF-?B activation. Because of the macrophage?s ability to coordinate inflammatory responses during healing, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were used to examine modulation of NF-?B activity in AED and GC-treated cells. The data showed that dexamethasone blocked translocation of active p65 which correlated with diminished cytokine gene expression. In contrast, AED restored cytokine gene expression and nuclear p65 levels in GC-treated cultures. In sum, these data suggest that AED antagonized GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level and restored cutaneous wound healing to that of unstressed controls.
