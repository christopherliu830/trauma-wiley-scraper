AB  - Introduction:? Myofibroblasts are a subtype of fibroblasts, which appear temporally during wound healing. Young hypertrophic scar contains a large number of myofibroblasts and the number declines over time. It has been shown that deep partial-thickness wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars, which is similar to hypertrophic scar. As part of our validation of the Duroc model of hypertrophic scarring, we evaluated myofibroblasts in wounds on the Duroc pigs. Methods:? Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of 12 Durocs. Biopsies were taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, 15, and 21 postwounding. Samples were analyzed by immunochemical staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, for myofibroblasts) and heat-shock protein (HSP47, for fibroblasts). HSP47 positive cells were counted at 40X and the fraction of a-SMA positive cells out of fibroblasts was evaluated at 10X. Statistical significance was calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:? The counts of HSP47 and a-SMA positive cells are shown in the table below. In brief, in deep wounds most of the HSP47 positive cells were a-SMA positive at 1 and 2 weeks but this declined rapidly thereafter. In shallow wounds there were far fewer cells positive for a-SMA and the decline was even more rapid. 1W 2W 4W 15W 21W Number Shallow 105?±?22 151?±?59 106?±?23 ?57?±?20 44?±?4 HSP47 Deep 524?±?45 449?±?35 231?±?73 108?±?30 55?±?8 P value <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Percent Shallow 23% 3% 0 0 0 a-SMA Deep 90% 74% 10% 0 0 P value <0.05 <0.05 Conclusions:? a-SMA positive fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are present in deep Duroc wounds and the temporal pattern is similar to that reported for human hypertrophic scar. This further validates the female red Duroc model of human hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - There are only a few models for studying epidermal migration in vitro, and their interpretation is made difficult by reliance on cell monolayers and the choice of a specific substrate. In this study, the process of keratinocyte migration and epiboly were investigated by using a bilayered bioengineered skin construct, consisting of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (Apligraf, Organogenesis, Canton, MA). At baseline, 6-mm punch biopsies of the construct were placed in serum-free media (AIM-V) or DMEM with or without 10% FBS. At varying time points the bioengineered skin samples were processed and analyzed by histology and immunostaining. By 72 hours, in a time-dependent manner, the epidermis had migrated over and enveloped the entire dermis (full epiboly). Full epiboly was partially inhibited by serum and was maximal in serum-free medium. Epiboly was preserved 5 days after stated expiration date and was equivalent to that seen in unexpired construct when stored at room temperature. The process of epiboly was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by neutralizing antibodies to EGF and TGF-beta 1. The migrating epithelium was characterized by decreased keratinocyte proliferation (as per Ki67 immunostaining) and increased expression of vitronectin (epibolin). Increasing concentrations of antibodies of vitronectin blocked the process of epiboly, as did antibodies to the alpha5-betaV integrin receptor, which mediates vitronectin-driven keratinocyte locomotion. Interesting, epiboly was also blocked by preseeding human dermal fibroblasts on the dermal side of the construct. We propose that the process of epiboly in this model can be used to better understand and assess the mechanisms involved in keratinocyte migration and may be used as an assay for establishing construct functional viability.

AB  - We find that the ELR-negative CXC chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11(IP-9), expressed during wound repair, with IP-9 being produced by redifferentiated keratinocyte. Immunohistochemical analysis for IP-9 on human full thickness wound tissues collected from day 5 confirmed that IP-9 is a wound response protein. We have shown in in vitro coculture systems that IP-9 can serve as an autocrine factor promoting motility in keratinocyte while limiting motility in dermal fibroblasts. These effects occur via modulation of the intracellular proteases calpain isoforms that regulate cell adhesion during motility. Thus, the function of these chemokines in vivo is not obvious. To probe this, we have explored wound repair in mice lacking the receptor for these ligands, CXCR3. Quantitative analysis of IP-9 expression in wounds of these mice collected from day 2 to day 20 showed a significant increase in IP-9 levels in CXCR3-/- mice compared to wild type, which is expected if receptor-mediated feedback attenuation is lost. Full and partial thickness wound healing experiments on these mice showed a significant delay in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Histochemical analysis of tissues collected from both full and partial thickness wounds demonstrated differences in epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and angiogenesis in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Collagen, the major extracellular matrix protein organization were analyzed by trichrome and picrosirus red staining methods. We are also examining the effect of this lost receptor on promotility signaling from EGF receptors. These in vivo and in vitro studies confirm the pathophysiologic role of the chemokines IP-9 and IP-10 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 during wound repair.

AB  - Management of surgical defects following excisional and Mohs micrographic surgery for malignant skin lesions consists of autografting, skin flaps, primary closure, and healing by secondary intention. A fully differentiated bilayered cell-based therapy (BLCT/Apligraf), expresses multiple growth factors, provides a biologically active matrix, and appears to be immunologically inert. BLCT is FDA approved for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. BLCT is effective in hard-to-heal venous ulcers and, in diabetic foot ulcers, it is significantly associated with less amputations and osteomyelitis. A previous open-label trial showed BLCT to be safe and effective in surgical excision wounds. However, we have been interested in rigorously identifying differences in chronic compared to acute wounds when using BLCT or other skin substitutes. In this report of a multicenter randomized study, we enrolled and treated 181 patients eligible for secondary intention healing after Mohs or excisional surgery for skin cancer, with 172 completing the study. Face wounds were excluded. In total, 84 patients were treated with BLCT and 88 with dressings alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the quality of the healed wound using the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS). Pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and scar heights were assessed by the investigator and an independent observer as 0 (no scar) to 15 (worst scar). Scores of?≤?4 were assigned to 57 (65%) of BLCT-treated patients by both the investigator and observer, and to 60 (65%) and 54 (58%) of control patients according to the investigator and observer, respectively. There was no difference in healing time, and no severe adverse events or rapid cancer recurrence were observed in either group. In this randomized controlled trial of full thickness excision wounds after skin cancer removal, BLCT/Apligraf was safe and well tolerated.

AB  - Background:? The cytokine signals that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and the resulting reorganization of matrix are incompletely understood. We studied the response of fibroblasts to mediators known to affect matrix reorganization, TGF-? and TNF-α in a collagen matrix. Further, we sought to determine if any cell phenotype changes resulted in quantifiable alterations in the mechanical performance of the matrix. Methods:? Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen type I lattices for 1 and 5 days in DMEM with .5% FBS and TGF-?(1?ng/ml), TNF-α(10?ng/ml), or combinations TGF-?(1?ng/ml)?+?TNF-α(1,5, and 10?ng/ml). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine α-SMA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure α-SMA mRNA. An indentation mechanical method was used to measure Young?s modulus which represents matrix stiffness. Results:? TGF-? increases α-SMA, while TNF-α alone has no effect on basal α-SMA expression. When TGF-??+?TNF-α were both added, the expression of α-SMA returned to basal levels. Immunohistochemistry showed α-SMA is incorporated into prominent stress fibers only in the TGF-? group. Real-time PCR showed that TNF-α did not affect α-SMA mRNA, while TGF-? increased α-SMA mRNA 19-fold. Combination treatment reduced mRNA level by 16-fold, to 2.7-fold compared to control. Indentation testing showed that, in all treatment groups, lattices after 5 days in culture were stiffer. TNF-α appeared to reduce the stiffness of the lattices on both day 1 and 5 compared to control. Conclusion:? TNF-α decreases TGF-? induction of α-SMA expression at the transcriptional level and decreases lattice stiffness. The cellular responses to cytokines are reflected in both biochemical and mechanical behaviors. Understanding both will be necessary to understand how tissues remodel into functional tissue and scar.

AB  - Introduction:? As an initial pilot effort a prospective, case-controlled trial examining the effects of treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?), by continuous, subcutaneous infusion, was performed in diabetic patients with recalcitrant lower extremity wounds. While the primary outcomes for the trial were wound healing and limb preservation, evaluation of local tissue perfusion with transcutaneous oximetry and laser Doppler analysis (TcPO2/LD) were included as secondary objectives, and with the expectation they would be useful monitors of any interventional modality. Methods:? All patients enrolled had nonhealing wounds (>3 months) in critically ischemic lower extremities (Fontaine Stage III-IV or Rutherford Stage 4, 5, or 6). Hyperbaric oxygen exposures were included as diagnostic/monitoring indices. In the last four enrolled subjects TcPO2/LD measurements were made at ambient pressure and at 2.0 or 2.4 ATA before Remodulin? was begun and at various points during drug infusion. Results:? Early, observational evaluation of the TcPO2/LD data shows: 1?? These examinations prognostically profile healing in ischemic limbs. 2?? TcPO2/LD values demonstrate the efficacy of Remodulin? in augmenting perfusion in ischemic wounds. While there is a broad range, all measured parameters increased on the drug (resting TcPO2 ? 5?30?mmHg, the rate of TcPO2 rise following ambient pressure O2-challenge ? 25?150% and periwound TcPO2 ? 90?300?mmHg at 2.0 and 2.4 ATA). 3?? The in-chamber TcPO2 on Remodulin? further defines patients who will not benefit from HBO2 therapy. 4?? The TcPO2/LD data will assist in determining dosages, duration, and maintenance requirements for this drug both as a single agent and when used as an adjuvant to HBO2 therapy. Conclusions:? Treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?) has significant laudatory effects on local wound perfusion in ischemic lower extremities. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Venous leg ulcers are characterized by chronic inflammation and in consequence high extracellular matrix turnover, avoiding epithelialization. In this work we evaluated maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder versus standard care for the topical treatment of noninfected venous leg ulcers, smaller than 25?cm2. All patients received daily micronized diosmin/hesperidin and they were recommended an appropriate diet, an exercise program, cleaning of the ulcer, etc., except for compression stocking, since they are not available in the clinic. Both treatments were administered daily during 12 weeks. Clinically, most of the patients were colonized by Staphylococcus aureus; patients who received maltodextrin/ascorbic acid reported less pain than controls and they improved significantly twice and thrice the lesion size in weeks 8 and 12, respectively, when compared with the standard care, (% wound closure: maltodextrin group 78.7?±?21.6 vs. standard care 36.7?±?45.4). In order to know changes in cytokine expression in the wound fluid, ulcers were covered with an impermeable film for 24?h, at the beginning and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and the fluids were tested for IL-1?, TNF-α, IL-10, and PDGF-AB by ELISA. Important changes in wound closure were observed when TNF-α and IL-10 changed, increasing their expression in maltodextrin group, meanwhile those cytokines were diminished in the controls. Finally, histological assessment was performed from the two biopsies taken before and after 8 weeks of treatment to each patient. Type III collagen showed an increase, but type I collagen decreased in the tissues derived from maltodextrin group, opposite to the data obtained from standard care group. In conclusion, maltodextrin/ascorbic acid powder is an important topical treatment for chronic wounds, and it has demonstrated to improve wound closure when it was compared with the standard of care, even without compression.

AB  - The pathophysiology of wound repair is a delicately balanced, dynamic process involving both stimulatory and degradative factors to remove damaged tissue and synthesize new tissue. An imbalance of any of these factors may result in the formation of a chronic wound. Previous studies have indicated that the chronic wound environment is detrimental to cell and cytokine function, leading to delayed healing. The presence of a hostile chronic wound environment has been supported by many studies reporting elevated proteolytic activity in these wounds. However, it has not been determined if this elevation is due to an excess of a particular protease or a reduction in inhibitor levels. In this study we investigated the effect of PROMOGRANTM, a protease 'modulating matrix, on wound healing in patients with venous leg ulcers and examined the effect on the wound environment. Wound fluid samples were collected from a number of patients throughout the course of treatment and both protease and inhibitor levels were analyzed. Our results indicate that wounds which respond to PROMOGRANTM also exhibited an overall decrease in human neutrophil-derived elastase and MMP activity. An increase in the ratio of alpha-1-antitrypsin to human neutrophil-derived elastase was also observed suggesting a greater degree of regulation post therapy, and a return to a more acute-like wound environment. Wounds that did not respond to this treatment demonstrated a greatly reduced ratio, signifying a persistent excess of proteolytic activity and a continued delay in healing. It is unclear whether the observed biochemical changes in the wound environment are responsible for healing or merely symptomatic of the disease state. We have, however, shown that an overall reduction in proteolytic activity is concomitant with healing. This suggests that therapies that redress the balance of inhibitor to protease may be beneficial in treatment of chronic wounds.

AB  - Vulnerable populations generally have decreased access to health care, often present with advanced disease processes and experience poorer health outcomes compared to the general population. Here we report on the epidemiology and economics of a vulnerable population with chronic wounds served by an academic medical center that is the tertiary health care provider and referral center for the state of Mississippi. Data are being collected to determine if aggressive management and treatment improves health outcomes. The epidemiology of our population indicates that 48% are over 60 years of age; 45% are between 41?59 years of age; and 7% are under 40 years of age. About 61% are female and almost 39% male. Our vulnerable population is composed of 51.6% African Americans; 6.5% Native Americans; and 3.2% Hispanic Americans; with the remaining population or 38.7% Caucasian. The etiologies of wounds seen are 31% diabetic/neuropathic and 28.5% venous; followed by smaller percentages of surgically treated diabetic and venous wounds. We have found that this population commonly presents with a single wound, but that more than half (>50%) present with two or more wounds. A majority of these individuals (77%) visit the clinic more than two times, with most, or 44% visiting the clinic from two to five times. A smaller percentage, or about 30% visit the clinic six or more times. About 61% are either Medicare or Medicaid, or a combination, while the remainder are covered by private insurance (23%), workman?s compensation (3.2%), or are self-pay (12.9%). Despite this profile, the aggressive integration of a social worker in our clinic results in 35.5% being followed by home health. Thus, we will present data on whether the opening of a specialized treatment center results in better health outcomes in vulnerable populations once individuals receive appropriate referral and treatment.

AB  - We previously showed that Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, has profound effects on the process of wound healing by increasing both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of impaired porcine and murine repair. In the present study, using the scratch plate assay as an in vitro model of wound repair, we show that CRT (10?6?10?9?M) induces cell migration/wound closure in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts that is equivalent to EGF (positive control). Furthermore, by an MTS proliferation assay, CRT stimulated cellular proliferation of human keratinocytes (2-fold), fibroblasts (100-fold), and vascular endothelial cells (1.2-fold). Markedly increased cellular proliferation was confirmed by anti-ki67 immunostaining (IHC) which was confined to basal keratinocytes in the CRT-(5?mg/ml) treated porcine and murine wounds during reepithelialization and in numerous cells of the granulation tissue. Also, CRT increased dermal depth and granulation tissue formation between days 6?14 following injury (p?<?0.05). The effect of CRT on the dermal layer was qualitatively different than PDGF or PBS as there was a remarkably higher number of dermal cells that reconstituted the CRT-treated pig wounds, a more organized pattern of collagen organization by picrosirrius red staining, and greater fibronectin and TGF-?3 by IHC. CRT also increased tensile strength in a rat incisional wound model (p?<?0.005 @ 21 days). By Mac-138 IHC of porcine wounds, we observed an increase in macrophages in the wound bed compared to PDGF (p?<?0.013). Since the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is a CRT-dependent process, this finding suggests a potential role for CRT as a bacteriocidal and/or debriding agent. Unlike PDGF, CRT positively affects both the epithelial and dermal aspects of repair. Our studies suggest that CRT accelerates and improves the rate and quality of wound repair by affecting many cells involved in the repair process.

AB  - We have recently established a keratinocyte/fibroblast co-culture system and demonstrated a potent keratinocyte-derived antifibrogenic factor (KDAF) for dermal fibroblasts relative to that of control cells. Later experiments identified KDAF as being the keratinocytes releasable 14-3-3 sigma. It is also known as stratifin. In this study, we hypothesize that differentiated, but not proliferating, keratinocytes are the primary source of releasable 14-3-3 proteins in conditioned medium. We also suggested that fibroblasts are not the primary source of these proteins. To examine this hypothesis, in a longitudinal study, keratinocyte differentiation was induced by growing these cells in our test medium consist of 49% keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), 49% DMEM and 2% fetal bovine serum up to 24 days. When KCM was collected every other day and added to fibroblasts, the expression of collagenase mRNA was undetectable in cells receiving either fresh or 48?hr conditioned KSFM. However, the level of collagenase mRNA expression was markedly increased in fibroblasts receiving KCM collected at either early (day 2 and 4) or later (day 12?22) time points of replacing the KSFM with test medium. To examine whether fibroblasts also release different 14-3-3 isoforms, cultured conditioned media from both fibroblasts and keratinocytes were collected and evaluated for the presence of different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins by western blot analysis. The results revealed that fibroblasts which are highly responsive to some of the 14-3-3 isoforms such as α/? and σ forms, are barely able to express and release these factors into conditioned medium. This was in sharp contrast to a very high level of 14-3-3 proteins found in KCM. In conclusion, keratinocytes, but not fibroblasts, release different forms of 14-3-3 proteins which may function as MMP-1 stimulating factors for fibroblasts. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Extended healing time and lack of documented effective treatments of sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease create substantial problems. Locally applied zinc oxide has been reported to promote wound healing. We have compared topical zinc oxide (3%) with placebo meshes for pilonidal wounds healing by secondary intention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Sixty-four consecutive patients, 53 males, aged between 18 and 60 years (median 26 years) with excised pilonidal wounds were centrally randomized to local zinc oxide (30?mg/g, n?=?33) or to placebo (n?=?31) mesh treatment. Patients were followed with strict recording of beneficial and harmful effects. The median healing times were 54 days (42?71 days, interquartile range, n?=?33) for the zinc group and 62 days (55?82 days, n?=?31) for the placebo group. This difference was not statistically different (p?=?0.32). Based on Cox regression analysis initial wound volume influenced healing negatively (p?=?0.016) while smoking (p?=?0.011) was associated with faster wound healing. Significantly (p?<?0.01) more placebo (n?=?12) than zinc oxide-treated patients (n?=?3) needed antibiotics postoperatively. Although topical zinc oxide increased (p?<?0.001) wound fluid zinc levels (1830?±?405??M, mean?±?SEM) compared with placebo (3.1?±?1.6??M) serum-zinc levels did not differ significantly between the zinc (13.5?±?0.4??M) and placebo (12.8?±?0.4??m) groups on postoperative day 7. No adverse events were recorded. Topical zinc oxide treatment did not accelerate time to closure of open pilonidal wounds but was associated with reduced antibiotic usage.

AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.

AB  - Extracellular matrix laminins are the major noncollagenous components in the basement membrane zones (BMZ) and influence a variety of important biological processes including cell attachment, migration, and tissue development. A newly discovered laminin family member, laminin 10 (alpha 5, beta 1, and gamma 1), is found a major laminin present in the BMZs at the dermal-epidermal junction and dermal microvascular vessels. We examined the roles of laminin 10 in cutaneous wound repair in vitro and in vivo. Purified laminin 10 protein promoted human keratinocyte spreading and attachment, which is mediated by integrins. In human wound lesions, immunoperoxidase staining, with antibody 4C7 specific to laminin alpha 5 chain, stained strongly positive for laminin 10 in newly formed BMZs of epidermis and dermal blood vessels. Using a laminin 10 alpha 5 chain knockout mouse, excisional wounds in this model had abnormal reepithelialization and decreased granulation tissue formation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the BMZ of the mutant skin showed discontinuous lamina densa formation in areas between hemidesmosomes. In a porcine burn wound model, Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis found significant higher expression of laminin 10 shortly after wounding and persisted through day 21, peaking at day 10. This expression pattern is consistent with the reconstitution of BMZs in the epidermis and microvascular blood vessels. These studies indicate that laminin 10 plays important roles in wound healing by promoting cell migration, BMZ assembly, reepithelialization, and angiogenesis. This study was supported by grants from NIH/NIAMES, DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Homeobox genes are transcription factor that form nested patterns in specific regions throughout the body. Homeobox genes are important for wound healing study because some have been shown to be related to scarless fetal wound healing. Muscle segment homeobox-2 (Msx-2) is a homeobox gene commonly expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tissue morphogenesis. Overexpression of Msx-2 leads to craniosynostosis, epidermal dysplasia, and abnormal hair growth. A knockout of this gene causes pleiotropic defects in bone growth, cyclic alopecia, and a thinner dermis. While Msx-2 has been found to play many critical roles in development, no functional study has been conducted on Msx-2 and wound healing. We hypothesize that Msx-2 regulates skin morphogenesis during wound repair which was tested by studying excisional skin wound closure. Isolated keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of Msx-2 WT and KO mice were also studied to determine the effects of Msx-2. Results showed that Msx-2 mRNA was induced in epidermis and dermis during wound repair. Additionally, Msx-2 KO mice exhibited enhanced re-epithelialization and faster wound closure than the WT control. These repair phenotypes may be attributed to keratinocyte motility and fibroblast interaction with collagen matrix as, in vitro, Msx-2 KO keratinocytes exhibited increased motility, and fibroblasts show stronger collagen matrix contraction and expressed higher levels of α2?1 than WT control. Msx-2 KO fibroblasts were refractory to BMP4 in collagen matrix contraction, demonstrating a disruption in the Msx-2 pathway. In conclusion, Msx-2 may regulate skin morphogenesis during repair at both epithelial and mesenchymal levels. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM055081(TLT).
