AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Introduction:? Based on the results of a study showing increased healing rates in a rabbit wound healing model, a clinical study was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of a new electric stimulation bandage (POSiFECT dressing). Four patients have completed the study for the first-generation system and two are currently enrolled in the evaluation of the second-generation system. Materials and Methods:? Spinal cord-injured pressure ulcer patients were treated with the POSiFECT dressing in a randomized double-blind crossover study. During the first 8 weeks, subjects received a dressing supplying 50??A of current or one with an unconnected battery. During the treatment, bandages were changed every other day and wounds were assessed weekly to determine size, depth, and condition. At the end of 8 weeks the patients were unblinded and the control group was treated with working bandages for 8 weeks. After cessation of treatment, assessments continued each month for 2 months. Results:? The treatment led to statistically significant increases in healing rates during the first week (0.19?±?0.11?cm/wk) and the first 2 weeks (0.10?±?0.07?cm/wk) compared to both the control group (?0.03?±?0.0?cm/wk) and the follow-up period (?0.02?±?0.08?cm/wk). For each patient, however, there was a time frame during the 3rd to 5th week of treatment in which significant decreases in healing rate occurred (?0.31 to ?0.096). Conclusions:? The POSiFECT dressing appears to increase healing during the first few weeks after application. A modified clinical study is under way with a new dressing design as well as a treatment protocol providing 3 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks without stimulation and then 3 more weeks of stimulation. Acknowledgments:? This project was funded by Biofisica and the CDC through NCIPC.

AB  - It has been postulated that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species detected in fluids and biopsies of chronic wounds contribute to the failure of wound to heal by degrading essential growth factors, receptors and extracellular matrix proteins. This stimulated the development of a formulation containing metal ions (polyhydrated ionogen or PHI) and citric acid that reduced reactive oxygen species in cultures of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (J Wound Care 12:10, 2003). The effect of PHI on synthesis of MMPs was studied in cultures of tumor cells and human dermal fibroblasts. Dose response curves of PHI ranging from 0.02% to 10%(W/V) established no toxicity in cultures of human dermal fibroblasts after 24 hours of incubation with PHI at concentrations below 1.25%, as measured by MTT assay. Levels of MMP-2 activity measured by antibody capture assay were reduced approximately 80% in culture medium of Mor-86 glioma tumor cells after 24 hours of exposure to 1% PHI. These results suggest that PHI reduced the synthesis of MMP-2 protein, presumably by reducing transcription and/or translation of MMP-2 gene. Clinical case reports of chronic wounds treated by PHI dressing (DerMax) suggest that PHI treatment stimulated healing and reduced MMP-2 immunostaining in biopsies of the chronic wounds.

AB  - Scarless fetal wound healing in connective tissue is characterized by organized collagen deposition that leads to regeneration and apparently normal tissue structure and function. In contrast, adult wound healing is characterized by the deposition of unorganized collagen that leads to scar formation and a loss of functionally relevant structural organization. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules, and the subsequent remodeling and contraction during the wound healing process. Therefore, fibroblasts play a key role in the different outcomes observed in fetal and adult wound healing. The hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts, relative to adult fibroblasts, have an altered capacity to contract collagen gels and remodel collagen fibrils due to inherent differences in their contractile phenotype. In this study, an anchored collagen gel model was used to evaluate matrix contraction and remodeling by these different fibroblast phenotypes. Video microscopy was used to measure the changes in surface area of contracting collagen gels. Collagen gel reorganization was evaluated using a fitting algorithm to predict the distribution and orientation of collagen fibrils from scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, fibroblast morphology and proliferation on contracting collagen gels were examined. Understanding these phenotypic variations will elucidate key differences in the wound healing process that can be used for potential clinical applications involving cell therapy and tissue engineered constructs.

AB  - Currently, skin cells or tissues intended for therapeutical or cosmetic applications are typically cultured using standard in vitro culture techniques. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has been traditionally used for many years to assess angiogenesis of exogenous substances. Avian embryos have also been used to generate viruses for vaccine development. Most of the uses of the avian CAM cultures are typically conducted in ovo. However, xenobiotic cultures of ex ovo avian embryos and explanted organs, tissues or cells from human or other mammalian origin have not been used in the past with the explicit purpose of achieving the appropriate extent of expansion, differentiation or vascularization required for therapeutic or cosmetic implantation into humans or animals. Here, a novel method of xenobiotic skin culture was developed that can be employed for wound healing studies or for tissue engineering applications to sustain the culture of live skin explants through the benefit of a xenobiotic vascularization. The method uses fertile Japanese quail (Cortunix cortunix japonica) eggs. The eggs were incubated for at least 3 days in ovo using a static egg incubator. On day 3 the egg is opened under sterile conditions through the air chamber and placed in a cylindrical culture dish slightly larger than the overall diameter of the egg yolk. The embryo was then cultured at 37?°C for an additional 24 to 48 hours until a well-vascularized CAM covers the entire surface of the culture dish. Next, fragments of skin were placed directly over the CAM. The cultures were continued for 8 days and then the skin explants were transferred to new CAMs. These changes, every 8 days, were done at least five times allowing the skin to be maintained in culture for several weeks without apparent damage in viability. The skin fragments remained viable and capable of reepithelialization when wounded. Skin explants from both mouse and human were successfully cultured in this manner. Because immunological response cannot occur in the embryonic culture environment, it was possible to xenotransplant skin fragments without risk of rejection. The ensuing embryonic vessels developed into the xenotransplanted skin and generated a permeable vascular network that provided oxygen and nutrients necessary to ensure viability and promote proliferation and differentiation. Viability of the explants was evaluated by immunohisto chemical methods using proliferation and apoptosis markers (Caspase-3, BrdU, and PCNA). Vascularization was assessed using species-specific anti endothelial antibodies (anti-PECAM human and mouse and QH1 and QH2 monoclonal antibodies). The new method described herein has the distinct advantage of sustaining live, functional skin cultures by means of a rich vascular supply that provides cells with nutrients and oxygen.

AB  - Exposure to cigarette smoke has detrimental effects on the early stages of wound repair but not much is known about the effects of smoke on the development of the healing (granulation) tissue. Cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and deposition of ECM are critical processes for normal granulation tissue (GT) formation. Here we investigate the effects of MSW (?first-hand smoke?) and SSW (the main component of ?secondhand smoke?) smoke on wound healing in mice that have been smoking for 9 months. We show that both MSW and SSW smoke adversely affect wound contraction and closure. The keratinocytes accumulate at the edge of the wound and the GT is deficient in fibroblasts and ECM. Moreover, by immunolabeling for α-SMA, we found that the myofibroblasts remained at the edges of the wound rather than penetrating the GT, potentially contributing to the lack of wound contraction. To test the possibility that smoke inhibits cell migration, we plated primary human fibroblasts in between two interstitial collagen gels, treated the cultures with the smoke solutions and found that cell migration into the gels was inhibited. Furthermore, using the collagen gel contraction assay, we showed that cigarette smoke components inhibit gel contraction. To further decipher which components of the smoke contribute to delayed wound closure, we fractionated SSW smoke solutions into polar and nonpolar components using solid phase extraction cartridges. We show that both the polar and nonpolar fractions delay wound closure in vivo and that the nonpolar fraction inhibits cell migration whereas the polar faction increases cell survival. We are currently pursuing these studies by further fractionation of these two phases with the goal of identifying the specific component(s) in each fraction that cause these effects on cell migration and survival. Identification of the components in cigarette smoke that lead to delayed wound healing and eliminating them from cigarettes could help those exposed to secondhand smoke heal faster.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Repair of peripheral nerve injuries depends upon complex biology stemming from the manifold and challenging injury-healing processes of the peripheral nervous system. While surgical treatment options are available, they tend to be characterized by poor clinical outcomes for the injured patients. This is particularly apparent in the clinical management of a nerve gap whereby nerve autograft remains the best clinical option despite numerous limitations; in addition, effective repair becomes progressively more difficult with larger gaps. Nerve conduit strategies based on tissue engineering approaches and the use of silk as scaffolding material have attracted much attention in recent years to overcome these limitations and meet the clinical demand of large gap nerve repair. This review examines the scientific advances made with silk-based conduits for peripheral nerve repair. The focus is on enhancing bioactivity of the conduits in terms of physical guidance cues, inner wall and lumen modification, and imbuing novel conductive functionalities.

AB  - The typical management of ?sternal infection? is sternectomy and flaps. Healed wounds and low mortality are the rule, but problems of surgical morbidity, chest instability, respiratory mechanics, and upper extremity function complicate these procedures. However, when pathophysiology of sternal failure is critically assessed, and contemporary good bone and wound care are applied, results improve. Specifically, the sternotomy is a fracture. Sternal biomechanics after sagittal osteotomy promote nonunion. When the poor fixation of twist wires fails, sternal dehiscence and wound bursitis ensue, typical of any pseudarthrosis. Commonly misinterpreted as ?infection,? the bone remains intrinsically healthy, and these wounds simply need proper wound management until they can be reclosed, and then stable bone fixation with hardware. Experience.? 28 patients had plate-and-screw fixation of the sternum. Original operations: heart surgery, 26?pts (21?m/6?f, ages 44?82); thoracic cancers, 2?pts (42?m, 39?f). Presentation: dehiscence, abscess, open wound, 20?pts (variable acuity, variable surgery-until-complication intervals); healed wounds with instability symptoms, 8?pts. Ten pts had rewirings or other prior procedures which failed. For open wounds or abscess, debridement was followed by a period of open wound care (often outpatient) until suitable for closure. In all but the first 4 patients, hardware fixation used a mandibular plating system with 2.7?mm screws. Flaps and nonautogenous bone grafts were used as needed to fill gaps. Results.? Two early closures failed during intense coughing. The other 26 repairs withstood all postoperative stresses, and the fractures healed. Instability symptoms and disabilities were corrected. Bedside debridements and outpatient wound care kept utilization low in permissible circumstances, with no inpatient days for a few. The habitual indiscriminate designation of all sternal complications as ?infection? is inconsistent with well-understood principles of bone and wound pathology. Most sternums fail due to mechanical dehiscence. With bone preserving wound care followed by rigid internal fixation, as is practiced for all other fractures, outcomes, by all measures, are improved.

AB  - Background and Objectives:? Hyaluronan (HA), a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan is synthesized by one of three distinct hyaluronan synthases (HAS). The purposes of this study were to determine whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1?(IL-1?), and hyaluronan expression in normal jejunum-derived mesenchymal cells (JDMCs), to identify possible mechanisms involved and to determine the effects of glucocorticoids, a common therapy for intestinal inflammatory pathologies including Crohn?s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), on cytokine-mediated hyaluronan expression. Experimental Procedures:? JDMCs were stimulated with IL-1? for 20?hr with or without pretreatment for 1?hr with mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors or dexamethasone. HA levels from culture media were quantified using a slot blotting approach. HAS transcript levels were quantified using RPA. Immunoblotting was used to detect and quantify activation of MAP kinases. Results:? Preliminary data of sample tissue from patients with Crohn?s or UC indicated increased HAS transcript levels. Similarly, IL-1? induced an approximate 18-fold increase in both HAS2 steady state transcripts and HA levels. These increases were blocked by dexamethasone (95%). Knockdown with siRNA demonstrated that IL-1? induction of HA expression occurred via HAS2. Immunoblot analysis indicated that IL-1? activated the ERK1/2, p38 and JNK pathways. Inhibitors of the p38 and ERK1/2, but not JNK, blocked the IL-1? induction of HA expression (80 and 90%, repectively). Similarly, dexamethasone was also found to block activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 pathways indicating a mechanism for glucocorticoid steroid regulation of HAS expression. Conclusion:? This study provides evidence for proinflammatory cytokine regulation of HA expression in JDMCs. Furthermore, this study provides support for the hypothesis that HA may be one of the targets involved in the treatment of steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease. Support:? This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - Introduction:? There is extensive data implicating the role of the TGF-beta pathway in hypertrophic scarring. However, few studies have examined the temporal expression of the various TGF-beta cytokines and their receptors. Purpose:? This study sought to determine the temporal mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGFR-I, TGFR-II, Smad-3, and collagen I in a rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring compared to smaller, nonhypertrophic control scars. Methods:? In an established model of hypertrophic scarring, 7?mm (hypertrophic) and 5?mm (nonhypertrophic control) punch wounds were made on the ears of 12 rabbits. Wounds were harvested at days 7, 15, 28, and 40. Histologic evaluation was performed on all scars in order to validate the model. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to compare mRNA expression between the various time points. Results:? At day 7, the 5?mm wounds had epithelialized to a greater extent than the 7?mm wounds. At day 28 and 40, the 7?mm scars were hypertrophic compared to the 5?mm control scars. In both 7?mm and 5?mm scars, TGF-beta1 and beta3 levels declined over time. In 7?mm scars, TGF-beta2 peaked at day 28, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 15, and TGFR-II and Smad-3 remained stable over time. As expected, collagen I expression peaked at day 28. In the 5?mm scars, TGF-beta2 levels remained stable, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 28, while levels of TGFR-II and Smad-3 declined slightly over time. Collagen I expression peaked at day 15. Conclusions:? The up-regulation of TGF-beta2 mRNA expression in hypertrophic but not flat scars indicates that it may be important to scar hypertrophy. The sustained expression of TGFR-II and Smad-3 in hypertrophic scars compared to controls suggests that the role of the TGF-beta family in the process of hypertrophic scarring is complex.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of overexpression of erbB3 in wound healing and whether topical application of its various ligands enhances repair. Partial thickness porcine wounds were transfected with recombinant adenoviral particles containing erbB3 receptor gene or a vehicle ?-galactosidase gene (Lac Z). Highly similar ligands: Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Epiregulin (EPR), Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), Heregulin (HER) were topically applied to wounds boosted with erbB3 receptors. Enhanced wound healing parameters were assessed 5 days after initial treatment for reepithelization, dermal depth, macrophage infiltration, proliferating cells, angiogenesis, and apoptotic cells. Treatment with EPR and HB-EGF promoted greater resurfacing of the epidermal layer than EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle treated wounds. Neodermal formation as measured by dermal or granulation depth was significantly different in the EPR and HB-EGF treated wounds compared to EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle. Numerous hallmarks of enhanced wound maturity (fewer infiltrating macrophages, significant reductions in neovascularization, fibroblastic proliferation) were noted in EPR- and HB-EGF-treated wounds transfected with erbB3 as compared to vehicle controls. Only erbB3 wounds treated with these particular ligands showed significant increases in apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that wounds treated with this erbB3 receptor form supplied with topical application of EPR and HB-EGF exhibit synergistic and accelerating reparative effects on porcine partial thickness wounds as compared to vehicle. These in vivo findings suggest the complexity and evidence of synergism between the erbB receptor and its various ligands on wound healing. (This research work was funded by the NIH GM40437.)

AB  - This study examined adult hospitalized patients? responses to wound care pain and its treatment. Wound care included dressing change, packing, irrigation, and debridement. The subjective experience of pain intensity was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) prior to, immediately after, and 10 minutes after completion of the procedure. The sample was composed of 412 subjects. Most were male (52.3%), white (73.9%), had one wound (59.5%), and had undergone surgery (73.9%). When pain intensity was compared over time, pain intensity was greatest (NRS 4.4, SD 3.2) during the procedure (p?<?.023), and nonsurgical patients experienced significantly greater pain than surgical patients (p?=?.002)(NRS 5.3, SD 3.0, NRS 4.1, SD3.2, respectively). Most patients underwent multiple wound care procedures. When the pain intensity of undergoing only a dressing change (n?=?61), only packing (n?=?41), or ≥2 procedures (n?=?258) was examined by whether subjects had undergone surgery or no surgery, nonsurgical patients reported greater pain intensity with dressing change (p?<?.001) and ≥2 procedures (p?<?.001). Few subjects received analgesics (7.3% surgical patients 5.9% nonsurgical); there was no difference by group in the amount of opioid administered (p?=?.821). Sedatives and NSAIDS were rarely used. Treatment with pain medication was examined over time. Those with least pain received significantly less pain medication when compared with those who received premedication only and those who received medication prior to and during the procedure (p?<?.05). Findings show wound care is painful and wound care pain is undertreated. Further research is needed to address the effect of pain on wound-related patient outcomes and strategies to minimize pain.

AB  - Introduction:? There are several proposed animal models of hypertrophic scarring. However, most are quite dissimilar from the actual human event. It has been shown that wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars. We are attempting to fully validate this model. A fourfold increase in mast cells and formation of collagen nodules have been described as characteristics of human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized the occurrence of nodules and mast cells in Duroc scars is similar. Methods:? For nodules, we biopsied human hypertrophic scars (47 cases) taken 5 to 67 months from injury and Duroc scars (six animals) taken 0 to 5 months from injury. For mast cells, we biopsied human hypertrophic scar (five cases) taken 24 to 30 months from injury and Duroc scars (five animals) taken 5 months from injury. We stained the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (nodules) and Giemsa (mast cells) and counted intact mast cells in the upper papillary dermis in 20 and recorded nodules as present or absent. Results:? The results are included the table below. Tissue Month n Nodules mean?±?SD P Duroc Scar ?0?3 10 ?0 ?4?5 ?6 50% NODULES Human Hypertrophic ?5?12 ?9 33% 12?24 22 36% 24?67 16 81% MAST CELLS Duroc Scar ?4?5 ?5 ?41?±?26 <.05 Duroc Uninjured ?5 ?18?±?9 Human Hypertrophic 24?30 ?5 251?±?139 <.01 Human Uninjured ?5 ?60?±?24 Conclusion:? Collagen nodules and increased numbers of mast cells are present in Duroc scar giving further validity to the female, red Duroc pig as an animal model of hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - Background:? Both passive and active dressings and technologies are proposed for treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. A quantitative assessment of healing is needed. Measurement of scattering and absorption characteristics of healing tissue, by Diffuse Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) may provide such a method. Methods:? 20 rats were divided into an induced diabetic and a control group (N?=?10 each). Full thickness wounds were made on the dorsal surface and biopsies sent for histologic analysis. Wounds were interrogated at twice per week intervals using a frequency domain near infrared device with three wavelengths of incident light. Amplitude and phase of scattered light were obtained at four different source-detector distances at each wavelength. The probe was positioned at six different locations. Tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from amplitude and phase data. Wound dimensions were calculated by cross and parallel polarization. Results:? Thirty-eight wounds were evaluated during the experiment. Wound size decreased at twice the rate in control. Average absorption coefficient was higher, by a factor of 2, in diabetics. The average value of reduced scattering coefficient was 30% higher in diabetics as well. During healing, both scattering and absorption coefficient increased faster in diabetics. Discussion:? Higher absorption in diabetic rats suggest impaired blood flow. Scattering reflects tissue disorganization observed in delayed wound healing. Conclusion:? These data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy can detect the difference in oxygen delivery to the wound and assess wound healing progression. Further analysis is planned to investigate pathologic correlates with spectroscopic data.

AB  - Cultured skin substitutes (CSS) are used as an adjunctive treatment for closure of massive burn wounds. CSS are prepared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts combined with a collagen-based matrix. A cDNA microarray analysis was performed to characterize CSS at a molecular level. We hypothesized that combination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in a three-dimensional organo typic culture system would result in changes in gene expression compared with cells grown in monolayer culture. Human skin samples were obtained from breast and abdominal tissue of healthy adult females. Fibroblasts and kera tinocytes were isolated and grown in monolayer cultures; CSS, prepared with cells from four independent donors, were cultured for 2?weeks in vitro. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and CSS using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A gene chip representing over 22,000 human genes. Cluster analysis was performed to identify gene expression ?signatures? for each group, and further analysis was performed to identify genes that were significantly increased or decreased in CSS compared with either cell type. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression upon combination of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in organotypic culture. Genes belonging to several classes were significantly increased in CSS compared with fibroblasts and keratinocytes. For example, genes associated with epidermal differentiation, including fillagrin, corneodesmosin, involucrin, and multiple keratins (1, 10, 13, 16, 23), were increased in CSS. Several genes that are overexpressed in psoriasis (S100A7, SERPINB3, PSORS1C1), as well as cytokines IL- 6 and IL-8, were also increased in CSS. Further, multiple MMP genes were up-regulated in CSS. The results suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions contribute to morphogenesis of CSS, including the remodeling of the dermal layer and stratification and differentiation of the epidermal layer. This analysis reveals that CSS exhibit many characteristics of normal or inflamed human skin.
