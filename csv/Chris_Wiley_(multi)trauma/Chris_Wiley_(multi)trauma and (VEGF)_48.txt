AB  - Surgically accessing pathological lesions located within the central nervous system (CNS) frequently requires creating an incision in cosmetic regions of the head and neck. The biggest factors of surgical success typically tend to focus on the middle portion of the surgery, but a vast majority of surgical complications tend to happen towards the end of a case, during closure of the surgical site incisions. One of the most difficult complications for a surgeon to deal with is having to take a patient back to the operating room for wound breakdowns and, even worse, wound or CNS infections, which can negate all the positive outcomes from the surgery itself. In this paper, we discuss the underlying anatomy, pharmacological considerations, surgical techniques and nutritional needs necessary to help facilitate appropriate wound healing. A successful surgery begins with preoperative planning regarding the placement of the surgical incision, being cognizant of cosmetics, and the effects of possible adjuvant radiation therapy on healing incisions. We need to assess patient's medications and past medical history to make sure we can optimise conditions for proper wound reepithelialisation, such as minimizing the amount of steroids and certain antibiotics. Contrary to harmful medications, it is imperative to optimise nutritional intake with adequate supplementation and vitamin intake. The goals of this paper are to reinforce the mechanisms by which surgical wounds can fail, leading to postoperative complications, and to provide surgeons with the reminder and techniques that can help foster a more successful surgical outcome.

AB  - Summary Background Psoriasis involves a multifaceted interplay of keratinocytes, blood vessels, immune system mediators and expressed genes. Aim To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in the angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) and caspase-5 (CASP5) genes are associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis vulgaris (PV) in a Han population in northeastern China. Methods We analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms of ANGPT1 (rs2507800, rs1954727 and rs1010824), ANGPT2 (rs3739390, rs2442598 and rs1868554) and caspase-5 (rs507879, rs518604 and rs523104) in 343 patients with PV and 347 healthy controls (HCs) by the SNaPshot method, and evaluated the risk for psoriasis conferred by the individual polymorphisms and haplotypes. Results The rs2442598 polymorphism of ANGPT2 was significantly associated with PV. The CT+TT genotype was present at an increased frequency in patients with PV (adjusted OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.04?2.03, P = 0.03). However, the distribution of the other genotypes (rs2507800, rs1954727 and rs1010824 of ANGPT1; rs3739390 and rs1868554 of ANGPT2; and rs507879, rs518604 and rs523104 of caspase-5) was not significantly different between patients with PV and the HCs. Furthermore, none of the genes in the haplotype-based analysis showed any association with psoriasis risk. Conclusions Our data suggest that ANGPT2 variants may be involved in PV risk in a Han population in northeastern China.

AB  - Abstract The holy grail of artificial tissue is currently limited by the absence of a viable vascular network to sustain it. Although a growing amount of interest exists in engineering such a construct, they are essentially in their infancy. In this chapter, the basic concepts of microcirculation are laid down, along with current state-of-the-art technology used to develop an artificial capillary bed. A major limitation is the poor patency rates, especially at low-flow states, of contemporary microvascular grafts. Newer options for microvessels including the use of nano-engineered materials are explored and tissue engineering biological microvessels are also discussed. At the lower end of the spectrum, biomedical researchers have also used angiogenic factors to stimulate capillary development. More recently, stem cell technology has also come into vogue with the potential to promote arteriogenesis. In the future, it is foreseen that all these factors would be synergized to bridge the ?missing link? between the arterial system and tissue-engineered scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract Major advances have recently been made in our understanding of stem cell biology, and in the application of stem cells to treat cardiac disease. Resident cardiac stem cells have now been described and the long-accepted paradigm of the adult mammalian heart as an organ without regenerative capacity has been questioned. Various stem-cell-based approaches for ameliorating cardiac disease have been shown to be beneficial in animal models and are now being trialled in humans, with several phase I clinical studies already completed. Although these clinical studies lacked adequate placebo controls, they have consistently shown promising results. If confirmed by larger phase II/III trials, it is possible that within a few years a powerful new therapeutic option may be available for the burgeoning number of patients suffering from myocardial ischaemia and/or other cardiac disorders.
