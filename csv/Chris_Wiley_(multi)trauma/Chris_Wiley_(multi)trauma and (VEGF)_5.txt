AB  - Background:?? HNcSCC is common in Australasia. Recent advances have led to new paradigms in our understanding of the complex interactions between tumour, stromal and immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. The deranged interplay between tumour and its microenvironment eventually spirals towards irreversibility. The repertoire of gene expression in the tumour becomes increasingly abnormal, and results in metastasis. Purpose:?? To examine the tumour microenvironment including, tumour immunosurveillance, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and investigate the expression of EGFR, which is fundamental to skin physiology, in HNcSCC. Methods:?? Archived HNcSCC specimens were stratified into groups of primary lesions with and without metastasis. (Immuno) histochemical analysis was performed for the differential parameters of peritumoural mast cell, microvessel and lymphatic vessel densities, VEGF and EGFR expression. The effects of mast cells on cell cycle and apoptotic gene expression were studied using cell co-culture and cDNA micro-array. The mechanism of EGFR over-expression in metastatic HNcSCC and its potential link with HER2 were assessed with fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Results:?? Although mast cells demonstrate a tumour inhibitory effect by deregulating the cell cycle and apoptosis in vitro, this observation is not corroborated by study of tissue specimens. Lymphatic vessel density (but not microvessel density or VEGF expression) predicts metastatic potential. 75% of primary HNcSCC that subsequently metastasise over-express EGFR, with the majority harbouring HER2 polysomy. Conclusion:?? Improved understanding of the tumour microenvironment will hopefully lead to development of novel biologic therapy for HNcSCC.

AB  - The neuropilins, NP-1 and NP-2, are co-receptors for Sema3A and Sema3F, respectively, both of which are repulsive axonal guidance molecules. NP-1 and NP-2 are also co-receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The neuropilins and their ligands are known to play prominent roles in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation, and blood vessel formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To screen for additional molecular mechanisms by which Schwann cells and fibroblasts contribute to successful PNS axonal regeneration, we used cDNA microarrays (Clontech) to compare expression profile of multiple messenger RNAs in sciatic nerves distal to transection with their levels in normal sciatic nerves. An evocative result of this screen was a 14-fold increase in NP-2 mRNA in the axotomized nerve segments 4 days post-transection. We verified that NP-2 is induced in transected as well as crushed nerve segments by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, and examined the distribution of NP-2 expressing cells in injured sciatic nerves by in situ hybridization. Then, we sought evidences of induction in the injured nerves of the NP-2 ligands, Sema3F and VEGF, and widened our survey to determine whether expression of the functionally related genes, neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and its class 3 semaphorin ligand, Sema3A are also induced in PNS following injury. We showed by in situ hybridization induction of all those genes at four days post-crushed, distally to the lesion. Our results suggest the possibility that the neuropilins and their semaphorin ligands serve to guide, rather than to impede, regenerating axons in the adult PNS.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory properties of tumors play a pivotal role in tumor progression and inefficacy of therapies. It has been hypothesized that surgical interventions result in an accelerated tumor growth by increasing the level of pro-angiogenic cytokines with subsequent amplification of tumor angiogenesis. To characterize the microvascular properties of secondary bone tumors in vivo and determine the impact of minor surgery on the microcirculation, we performed intravital microscopy over 25 days using a xenograft model of breast cancer tumor growth (MCF-7) in bone. After engraftment of tumors the mice were treated with a mastectomy versus no surgery. Tumor growth was accompanied by angiogenic sprouting and decreased vascular diameters while blood flow rate and tumor perfusion remained constant. Mastectomy initially led to a significant reduction of functional vascular density, increased vascular diameter, and decreased blood flow velocities. However, neither tumor growth nor tissue perfusion was different between the groups. The presented study corroborates the assumption that tumor microcirculation in bone exhibits similar time-dependent alterations compared to soft tissue tumors. A minor surgical intervention did not change tumor growth kinetics however microcirculatory properties were altered. Whether major surgery has an impact on tumor growth in bone should be clarified in further studies. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Besides the use of autologous bone grafting several osteoconductive and osteoinductive methods have been reported to improve bone healing. However, persistent non-union occurs in a considerable number of cases and compromised angiogenesis is suspected to impede bone regeneration. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) improves angiogenesis. This study evaluates the effects of HBO on bone defects treated with autologous bone grafting in a bone defect model in rabbits. Twenty-four New-Zealand White Rabbits were subjected to a unilateral critical sized diaphyseal radius bone defect and treated with autologous cancellous bone transplantation. The study groups were exposed to an additional HBO treatment regimen. Bone regeneration was evaluated radiologically and histologically at 3 and 6 weeks, angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry at three and six weeks. The additional administration of HBO resulted in a significantly increased new bone formation and angiogenesis compared to the sole treatment with autologous bone grafting. These results were apparent after three and six weeks of treatment. The addition of HBO therapy to autologous bone grafts leads to significantly improved bone regeneration. The increase in angiogenesis observed could play a crucial role for the results observed. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 33:513?520, 2015.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of administering allogeneic blood products (ABP) on the progression of hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Sample population One hundred four dogs with hemangiosarcoma that survived until postoperative discharge from the hospital. Methods Medical records of dogs that had been operated on for hemoangiosarcoma were reviewed for signalment, presence of a hemoabdomen, presence of metastatic disease, and whether the dog had received chemotherapy or Yunnan Baiyao. Data that were collected were compared between dogs that received perioperative ABP and those that did not. Disease-free interval was compared between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain univariate descriptive statistics for time to clinical decline. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze association or effect of potential predictor variables. Results The median disease-free interval (DFI) was shorter in the 67 dogs that received a blood transfusion (76 days; range, 1-836) than in the 37 dogs that did not receive a blood transfusion (120 days; range, 38-916). According to the multivariable Cox regression model, administration of blood products (P?=?.04) and the presence of gross metastatic disease at the time of surgery (P?<?.01) shortened the DFI, whereas administration of Yunnan Baiyao (P?=?.01) prolonged the DFI. Conclusion Allogeneic blood product administration was associated with a shorter disease-free interval in this population. However, we could not demonstrate the association between blood products and shorter DFI because of confounding factors. Clinical significance Dogs that receive ABP at the time of surgical therapy for hemangiosarcoma may have accelerated disease progression compared with dogs that do not receive ABP.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with neurological deficits and loss of motor function that, depending on the severity, may lead to paralysis. The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 ?g/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 ?g was found to be as effective as 100 ?g in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury. Studies are underway in chronic SCI in a follow up manuscript.

AB  - Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer treatment. As important intracellular factors, aberrant tumor transmembrane signal transduction pathways, which include the prosurvival cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT) and the proapoptosis pathways (Wnt, p53 and TNF-α/NF-?B), have been proved to be crucial determinants of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in malignant lesions. There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation sensitization. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting aberrant tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of ionizing radiation. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the aberrant signal pathways, and the potential druggable targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the aberrant signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also addressed.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Significant progress has been made in the development of in vitro-engineered skin substitutes that mimic human skin, either to be used for the replacement of lost skin or for the establishment of in vitro skin research models. However, at the present time, there are no models of bioengineered skin that completely replicate the nature of uninjured skin. Obviously, there is still much room for improvement of the components of bioengineered skin and their interplay. This review summarises the important new discoveries in key elements of engineering of tissue-engineered skin including cell sources, biomaterials and growth factors, etc. Furthermore, basic and clinical applications for engineered skin substitutes in cell therapy, tissue engineering, and biomedical research continue to drive design improvements premised on these structure and function-based engineering paradigms.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Abstract. Purpose:? That vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in inflammatory angiogenesis has been well established. This pilot study was designed to evaluate experimental treatment with bevacizumab eyedrops in corneal neovascularization induced by alkali burn. The feasibility of topical administration, corneal cell viability and corneal penetration were investigated in an animal model. Methods:? Eighteen chinchilla bastard rabbit corneas injured with 1?m NaOH were divided into three groups: untreated, early and late treatment groups. Eyedrops of bevacizumab solution (25?mg/ml) were administered five times daily. Clinical examination under stereoscopic microscope was performed to evaluate corneal opacity, neovascularization, vessel size and oedema. Histopathology was analysed for vessel density and apoptotic reaction. Additionally, intracameral bevacizumab concentration was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after repeated topical applications. Results:? A fast increase in aqueous bevacizumab concentration was achieved when the solution was instilled every minute onto a healthy eye surface. As well as clear anti-angiogenic effects, anti-fibrotic effects were also seen after corneal burn, maintaining corneal transparency. Early treatment of actively growing vessels showed a significantly better outcome, although apoptosis of pre-existing vessels could also be induced by the late treatment. No specific toxicity was seen regarding epithelium, keratocytes or endothelium. Conclusions:? The data from this pilot study suggest that bevacizumab eyedrops can sufficiently penetrate the corneal stroma and anterior chamber. When administered soon after alkali burn, bevacizumab seems to significantly reduce corneal damage. Combinations of established treatment regimens with topical bevacizumab might be considered in severe injuries with otherwise devastating prognoses.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Summary The cerebral cortex, the most evolved part of the human brain, controls movements, receives sensations, and stores and recalls memories. In this section, we will focus on functional regeneration from injuries such as trauma, stroke, and neuronal degeneration. Although the brain is thought not to regenerate after injury, recent advances have shown that the brain is in fact capable of regeneration. The regeneration potency of the injured brain was uncovered by science, which reflects building and organizing new knowledge of something that does exist. In contrast, engineering reflects a creative application to develop something that does not yet exist. Thus, an engineering approach could bring out the regeneration potency of the injured brain. The key biological discoveries and molecular technology to support injured brain regeneration are introduced.

AB  - We have been cultivating human epidermal cells for therapeutic purpose according to the original methods developed by Rheinwald and Green. Cultured epithelium (CE) was applied to patients with severe skin defects, burn wounds, chronic skin ulcers and cutaneous disorders like hypomelanosis. Autologous CE allows to restore massive skin surface in a short period compared with other conventional treatments. For grafts take, it is important to manage wound beds properly prior to CE grafting. The CDS was applied to prepare wound bed acceptable for CE grafting. The CDS was designed to secrete various types of cytokines, i.e., VEGF and KGF to stimulate wound healing. The successful management of deep wounds like chronic skin ulcer or burn ulcer requires granulation tissue formation and epithelialization to wound closure. This study aimed to evaluate the application of CDS in conjunction with CE for patients with chronic skin ulcer and burn ulcer. In some cases the wounds were cured by using CDS, and followed by CE grafting. All clinical trials achieved excellent or good results, showing no contracture and no hypertrophic scar after wound closure. The CDS was found to be useful to prepare wound beds and to facilitate wound management.

AB  - Abstract Advances in high-throughput screening, together with rapid progress in genomic and proteomic sciences, have considerably stimulated the development of a variety of biomarker discovery tools and have contributed to the improvement of clinical diagnosis. Major challenges include the obtaining of high-quality data sets based on assays that are rapid, reliable, and inexpensive, but still highly sensitive and easy to perform. The microsphere-based flow cytometric technology is a platform that is currently entering the diagnostic market. This article reviews the development and the applications of microsphere-based flow cytometric platforms in basic and applied proteomic research, and discusses bead-based assays used in clinical applications.

AB  - The use of adjunctive peri-wound, ultrasound with either a 1?MgHz or 3?MgHz frequency has been reported on in the literature with variable results. MIST ultrasound therapy is a novel application of direct wound bed application of kilohertz ultrasound waves utilizing a normal saline mist as the coupling mechanism, allowing for no direct patient contact. The mist generated by the system is of relative uniform particle size and acts as a conduit of ultrasound energy. Unlike ultrasonic baths, which dissipate the vibrational energy over a large area, the transducer horn focuses the energy into a smaller area of application. The MIST? system consists of an ultrasonic power supply (generator), a transducer (or alternately referred to as the converter), and an applicator coupled to the transducer. The generator converts voltage to high frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is transmitted to the piezoelectric transducer within the converter, where it is changed to mechanical vibrations. The generator is designed to operate the converter at 40?kHz with a distal displacement of 60 microns. Published reports have described various biological effects of low frequency ultrasound including VEGF and PDGF production, increased protein synthesis, improved bone and wound healing. Other authors have published abstracts demonstrating clinical efficacy of this device on a broad range of patients with recalcitrant wounds. This report describes the clinical results of a prospective, non-randomized, efficacy trial, adding MIST ultrasound therapy to current treatment protocols in recalcitrant wounds. Wound healing trajectories before and after treatment will be evaluated and wound healing will be assessed with laser Doppler image analysis and trans-cutaneous oximetry.
