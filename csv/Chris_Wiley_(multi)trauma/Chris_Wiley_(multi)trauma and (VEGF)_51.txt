AB  - Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common diabetes and has numerous complications. Recent studies demonstrated that T2DM compromises bone fracture healing in which miR-222 might be involved. Furthermore, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3) that is the target of miR-222 accelerates fracture healing. Therefore, we assume that miR-222 could inhibit TIMP-3 expression. Eight-week-old rats were operated femoral fracture or sham, following the injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes one week later in fractured rats, and then, new generated tissues were collected for measuring the expression of miR-222 and TIMP-3. Rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and treated with miR-222 mimic or inhibitor to analyse osteogenic differentiation. MiR-222 was increased in fractured rats and further induced in diabetic rats. In contrast, TIMP-3 was reduced in fractured and further down-regulated in diabetic rats. Luciferase report assay indicated miR-222 directly binds and mediated TIMP-3. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation was suppressed by miR-222 mimic and promoted by miR-222 inhibitor. miR-222 is a key regulator that is promoted in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and it binds to TIMP3 to reduce TIMP-3 expression and suppressed MSCs? differentiation.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Abstract The current need for bone grafts in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery cannot be satisfied by autologous tissue transplant due to its limited availability and significant associated morbidity. Tissue engineering approaches could supply sufficient amounts of bone substitutes by exploiting the ability to harvest autologous osteogenic progenitors associated with suitable porous materials. However, the generation of clinically relevant-sized constructs is critically hampered by limited vascularization, with consequent engraftment and survival only of a thin outer shell, upon in vivo implantation. To overcome this limitation, different non-mutually exclusive approaches have recently been developed to promote or accelerate graft vascularization, from angiogenic growth factor gene delivery to surgical pre-vascularization of the construct before implantation. A simple, promising strategy involves the co-culture of vasculogenic cells to form an intrinsic vascular network inside the graft in vitro, which can rapidly anastomose with the host blood vessels in vivo. Recent data have shown that adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) may provide an efficient, convenient, and autologous source for both osteogenic and endothelial cells. When SVF progenitors were cultured in appropriate bioreactor systems and ectopically implanted, a functional vascular network connected to the host was formed concomitantly to bone formation. Future studies should aim at demonstrating that this approach effectively supports survival of scaled up cell-based bone grafts at an orthotopic site. The procedure should also be adapted to become compatible with an intra-operative timeline and complemented with the definition of suitable potency markers, to facilitate its development into a simplified, reproducible, and cost-effective clinical treatment.

AB  - Microcirculation (2010) 17, 164?178. doi: 10.1111/j.1549-8719.2010.00025.x Abstract Blood vessels have long been known to respond to hemodynamic force, and several mechanotransduction pathways have been identified. However, only recently have we begun to understand the effects of hemodynamic force on embryonic development. In this review, we will discuss specific examples illustrating the role of hemodynamic force during the development of the embryo, with particular focus on the development of the vascular system and the morphogenesis of the heart. We will also discuss the important functions served by mechanotransduction and hemodynamic force during placentation, as well as in regulating the maintenance and division of embryonic, hematopoietic, neural, and mesenchymal stem cells. Pathological misregulation of mechanosensitive pathways during pregnancy and embryonic development may contribute to the occurrence of cardiovascular birth defects, as well as to a variety of other diseases, including preeclampsia. Thus, there is a need for future studies focusing on better understanding the physiological effects of hemodynamic force during embryonic development and their role in the pathogenesis of disease.
