AB  - Abstract The European Society of Endodontology and the American Association for Endodontists have released position statements and clinical considerations for regenerative endodontics. There is increasing literature on this field since the initial reports of Iwaya et al. (Dental Traumatology, 17, 2001, 185) and Banchs  (i) resolution of clinical signs and symptoms; (ii) further root maturation; and (iii) return of neurogenesis. It is known that results are variable for these objectives, and true regeneration of the pulp/dentine complex is not achieved. Repair derived primarily from the periodontal and osseous tissues has been shown histologically. It is hoped that with the concept of tissue engineering, namely stem cells, scaffolds and signalling molecules, that true pulp regeneration is an achievable goal. This review discusses current knowledge as well as future directions for regenerative endodontics. Patient-centred outcomes such as tooth discolouration and possibly more appointments with the potential for adverse effects needs to be discussed with patients and parents. Based on the classification of Cvek (Endodontics and Dental Traumatology, 8, 1992, 45), it is proposed that regenerative endodontics should be considered for teeth with incomplete root formation although teeth with near or complete root formation may be more suited for conventional endodontic therapy or MTA barrier techniques. However, much is still not known about clinical and biological aspects of regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Abstract Background: Epistaxis is the most common manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting approximately 90% of patients at some point during their lifetime. Bleeding is chronic and varies from mild, self-limited episodes to severe, transfusion-dependent or life-threatening epistaxis. Treatment options vary from conservative, nonsurgical management to more aggressive surgical approaches. A number of treatment options have been introduced in recent years. There is little consensus in the literature regarding treatment algorithms. The objective of this investigation was to provide a contemporary review of HHT-related epistaxis, including pathophysiology, disease manifestations, and state-of-the-art treatment modalities. Methods: A systematic review of the literature for HHT-related epistaxis was performed using the search terms ?hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? and ?epistaxis.? Additional literature search regarding current recommendations for HHT evaluation and recent developments in genetic mechanisms, pathophysiology, and treatment of HHT was also performed. Results: A total of 308 articles were identified and reviewed for appropriateness of inclusion whereas 64 articles met inclusion criteria. Treatment options range from topical and hormonal therapy to more aggressive surgical modalities. Most treatment descriptions are case series, with few randomized controlled trials. A number of new and novel therapies have been introduced in recent years. Conclusion: HHT is a heterogeneous disease requiring multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. Therapeutic options for HHT-related epistaxis vary from conservative, nonsurgical measures to more aggressive surgical treatments. A graduated treatment plan is recommended. Patients present with a wide degree in variation of severity of epistaxis, and treatment is best tailored to the individual patient. ?2012 ARSAAOA, LLC.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Preclinical and clinical data have shown promise in using antiangiogenic agents to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We conducted this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of single-agent pazopanib in patients with MPM. Materials and Methods Patients with MPM who had received 0?1 prior chemotherapy regimens were eligible to receive pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6), with a preplanned interim analysis for futility. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS, adverse events assessment and clinical benefit (complete response, partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]). Results Thirty-four evaluable patients were enrolled, with a median age of 73?years (49?84). The trial was closed early because of lack of efficacy at the preplanned interim analysis. Only 8 patients (28.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2?48.7%) in the first 28 evaluable were progression-free at 6 months. PFS6 was 32.4% (95% CI, 17.4?50.5). There were 2 PR (5.9%) and 16 SD (47.1%). The overall median PFS and OS were 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.0?6.0) and 11.5 months (95% CI: 5.3?18.2), respectively. The median PFS and OS for the previously untreated patients was 5.4 months (95% CI, 2.7?8.5) and 16.6 months (95% CI, 6.6?30.6), respectively; and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.3?4.2) and 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.0?11.9), respectively, for the previously treated patients. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 23 patients (67.6%). Conclusion Single-agent pazopanib was poorly tolerated in patients with MPM. The primary endpoint of PFS6 was not achieved in the current study. ClinicalTrials.gov identification number. NCT00459862. Implications for Practice Single-agent pazopanib did not meet its endpoint in this phase II trial in malignant mesothelioma. Pazopanib is well tolerated in mesothelioma patients with a manageable toxicity profile. There is a need to better identify signals of angiogenesis that can be targeted in mesothelioma. Encouraging findings in frontline treatment warrant further investigations in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
