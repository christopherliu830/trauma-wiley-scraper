AB  - Abstract The treatment of full thickness skin loss, which can be extensive in the case of large burns, continues to represent a challenging clinical entity. This is due to an on-going inability to produce a suitable tissue engineered substrate that can satisfactorily replicate the epidermal and dermal in vivo niches to fulfil both aesthetic and functional demands. The current gold standard treatment of autologous skin grafting is inadequate because of poor textural durability, scarring and associated contracture, and because of a paucity of donor sites in larger burns. Tissue engineering has seen exponential growth in recent years with a number of ?off-the-shelf? dermal and epidermal substitutes now available. Each has its own limitations. In this review, we examine normal wound repair in relation to stem/progenitor cells that are intimately involved in this process within the dermal niche. Endothelial precursors, in particular, are examined closely and their phenotype, morphology and enrichment from multiple sources are described in an attempt to provide some clarity regarding the controversy surrounding their classification and role in vasculogenesis. We also review the role of the next generation of cellularized scaffolds and smart biomaterials that attempt to improve the revascularisation of artificial grafts, the rate of wound healing and the final cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), derived from mesenchymal stem cells, have been suggested as possible therapeutic tools for regenerative medicine. This chapter discusses the current understanding of the MSC secretome and its possible applications to regenerative medicine. It focuses particularly on the secretome composition and characterization, as well as its application in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and disorders of the nervous system. Over the last several years it has become evident that some therapeutic effects mediated by MSCs are mainly associated with the secretion of bioactive molecules and vesicles, which constitute their secretome. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is most commonly used to treat hematological malignancy for which no other potentially curative procedure is available. GVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic HSCT recipients, even when the donor and recipient have a high level of human leukocyte antigen compatibility.

AB  - Abstract In the present study we evaluated the motor recovery process of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), based on electrophysiological and histomorphometric criteria, after treatment with plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) injections and scaffolds in an ovine model. Three groups of sheep underwent a nerve crush lesion: the first group (n?=?3) was left to recover spontaneously (SR); the second group was administered saline injections (SI; n?=?5) and a third group (n?=?6) received PRGF injections and scaffolds immediately after the crush injury. At post-intervention week 8, 70% of sheep in the PRGF group were CMAP-positive, with no electrophysiological response in the rest of the groups. Histomorphometric analysis 12?weeks after the surgical intervention revealed that the average axonal density of the SR (1184?±?864 axons/µm2) and SI (3109?±?2450 axons/µm2) groups was significantly inferior to the control (8427?±?2433 axons/µm2) and also inferior to the PRGF group (5276?±?4148 axons/µm2), showing no significant differences between the control and PRGF groups. The axonal size of the SR and SI groups was significantly smaller compared with the control group (18?±?4?µm2), whereas the axonal size of the PRGF group (6?±?5?µm2) did not show statistical differences from the control. Morphometry of the target muscles indicated that the PRGF group had the lowest percentage volume reduction 12?weeks after the crush injury. The PRGF group had larger muscle fibre areas than the SI and SR groups, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Overall, these data suggest that the PRGF injections and scaffolds hastened functional axon recovery and dampened atrophy of the target muscles in an ovine model.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

AB  - Abstract Background Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a treatable cause of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. This clinical triad of symptoms occurs in association with ventriculomegaly and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Although the treatment outcomes after CSF shunting for INPH have improved significantly since its first description in 1965, shortcomings in our understanding still remain. Not all INPH patients exhibit clinical improvement after shunting, and it is challenging to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from shunting. Methods The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched for English-language publications between 1965 and October 2015. Reference lists of publications were also manually searched for additional publications. Results The findings of this review indicate that, despite efforts to improve patient selection, the degree of clinical improvement after shunting continues to demonstrate significant variability both within and between studies. These discrepancies in treatment outcomes are the result of controversies in 3 distinct but interrelated domains: the underlying pathophysiology of INPH, the diagnosis of INPH, and the identification of likely shunt-responders. Conclusions This review focuses on these 3 areas and their relation to surgical treatment outcomes. Despite the limitations of published outcome studies and limitations in our understanding of INPH pathophysiology, shunting is a safe and effective means of achieving meaningful clinical improvement in most patients with INPH.

AB  - Abstract Entheses (insertion sites, osteotendinous junctions, osteoligamentous junctions) are sites of stress concentration at the region where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. Consequently, they are commonly subject to overuse injuries (enthesopathies) that are well documented in a number of sports. In this review, we focus on the structure?function correlations of entheses on both the hard and the soft tissue sides of the junction. Particular attention is paid to mechanical factors that influence form and function and thus to exploring the relationship between entheses and exercise. The molecular parameters indicative of adaptation to mechanical stress are evaluated, and the basis on which entheses are classified is explained. The application of the ?enthesis organ? concept (a collection of tissues adjacent to the enthesis itself, which jointly serve the common function of stress dissipation) to understanding enthesopathies is considered and novel roles of adipose tissue at entheses are reviewed. A distinction is made between different locations of fat at entheses, and possible functions include space-filling and proprioception. The basic anchorage role of entheses is considered in detail and comparisons are explored between entheses and other biological ?anchorage? sites. The ability of entheses for self-repair is emphasized and a range of enthesopathies common in sport are reviewed (e.g. tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, jumper's knee, plantar fasciitis and Achilles insertional tendinopathies). Attention is drawn to the degenerative, rather than inflammatory, nature of most enthesopathies in sport. The biomechanical factors contributing to the development of enthesopathies are reviewed and the importance of considering the muscle?tendon?bone unit as a whole is recognized. Bony spur formation is assessed in relation to other changes at entheses which parallel those in osteoarthritic synovial joints.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?.
