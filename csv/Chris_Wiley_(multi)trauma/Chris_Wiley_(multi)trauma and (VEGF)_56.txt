AB  - Martin J. Gallagher*, Robert L. Macdonald*, John R. Huguenard?, Steven Petrou? and Hal Blumenfeld??*Neurology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN; ?Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; ?Howard Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia and ?Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: This session is designed to be a participatory workshop focused on addressing questions of ictogenesis and epileptogenesis in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) via a cross-disciplinary approach. Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.
