AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.

AB  - Abstract Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are endogenous bioactive lipids that participate in the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. These processes are each critical for successful embryogenesis, raising the possibility that lysophospholipid signaling may contribute to normal animal development. In fact, recent studies in developmental model systems have established that S1P and LPA are necessary for diverse developmental programs including those required for morphogenesis of vertebrate reproductive, cardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), as well as the establishment of maternal-fetal circulation and the immune system. Genetic, morphological, and biochemical characterization of developmental model systems offer powerful approaches to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of lysophospholipid signaling and its contributions to animal development and postnatal physiology. In this review, the routes of S1P and LPA metabolism and our current understanding of lysophospholipid-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells will be summarized. The evidence implicating lysophospholipid signaling in the development of specific vertebrate systems will then be reviewed, with an emphasis on signals mediated through G protein-coupled receptors of the Edg family. Lastly, recent insights derived from the study of simple metazoan models and implications regarding lysophospholipid signaling in organisms in which Edg receptors are not conserved will be explored. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Unlocking the secrets of the brain is a task fraught with complexity and challenge ? not least due to the intricacy of the circuits involved. With advancements in the scale and precision of scientific technologies, we are increasingly equipped to explore how these components interact to produce a vast range of outputs that constitute function and disease. Here, an insight is offered into key areas in which the marriage of neuroscience and nanotechnology has revolutionized the industry. The evolution of ever more sophisticated nanomaterials culminates in network-operant functionalized agents. In turn, these materials contribute to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including drug delivery, neuroprotection, neural regeneration, neuroimaging and neurosurgery. Further, the entrance of nanotechnology into future research arenas including optogenetics, molecular/ion sensing and monitoring, and piezoelectric effects is discussed. Finally, considerations in nanoneurotoxicity, the main barrier to clinical translation, are reviewed, and direction for future perspectives is provided.

AB  - Abstract The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation for over 20 years. The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13 to June 16, 2009 and co-chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to 280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research. These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Neutrophils are one of the most important effector cells of the innate immune response (1). They are traditionally seen as a homogenous population of short-lived cells mainly involved in the defence against extracellular microorganisms by phagocytosis and intracellular killing (1,2). The cells contain a large armamentarium that aids in this function and ranges from the production of reactive oxygen species by a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase to cytotoxic proteins and peptides residing in the different granules present in the cytoplasm (3). Recently, the view of neutrophils belonging to a homogenous population of cells has been challenged, and several neutrophil phenotypes have been described that exhibit specialized functions, such as involvement in tissue repair, tumour killing and immune regulation (4). It is not clear whether these cells belong to separate parallel lineages originating from the bone marrow or that neutrophils become instructed in the distant tissues, thus changing their phenotypes. In addition, functional heterogeneity in a phenotypically homogenous population of neutrophils adds to the complexity of neutrophil phenotypes(5). This article will review the current literature describing the heterogeneity within the neutrophil compartment with respect to both phenotype and function in health and disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is a sophisticated system that maintains a closed, humid, sterile and isolated environment. Wound infection is considered a relative contraindication. The objective of this study is to extend the indications for VAC therapy to include infected wounds by demonstrating its ability to increase the antibiotic concentration in the damaged and infected tissues. Patients who presented with ulcers infected with daptomycin-sensitive bacteria were eligible to be enrolled in this prospective study. They were given antibiotic therapy with daptomycin with a specific protocol. A biopsy of the lesion was carried out to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 0. Afterwards, the patients were subjected to VAC therapy. At the end of VAC therapy, a second lesion biopsy was performed and analysed to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 1. A control group was enrolled in which patients followed the same protocol, but they were treated with traditional dressings. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the two groups. The results highlighted a significant increase in the concentration of antibiotics in the study group tissue; the improvement was sensibly lower in the control group. Statistical differences were not found between the two groups. The preliminary analysis of the data showed an important increase of antibiotic concentration in the tissue after VAC therapy. Despite the encouraging data, it is necessary to broaden the sample of patients and perform the same study with other antibiotics.
