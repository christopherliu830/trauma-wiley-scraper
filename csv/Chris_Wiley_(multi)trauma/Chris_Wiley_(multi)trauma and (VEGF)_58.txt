AB  - ABSTRACT Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy is a sophisticated system that maintains a closed, humid, sterile and isolated environment. Wound infection is considered a relative contraindication. The objective of this study is to extend the indications for VAC therapy to include infected wounds by demonstrating its ability to increase the antibiotic concentration in the damaged and infected tissues. Patients who presented with ulcers infected with daptomycin-sensitive bacteria were eligible to be enrolled in this prospective study. They were given antibiotic therapy with daptomycin with a specific protocol. A biopsy of the lesion was carried out to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 0. Afterwards, the patients were subjected to VAC therapy. At the end of VAC therapy, a second lesion biopsy was performed and analysed to detect tissue concentration of the drug at time 1. A control group was enrolled in which patients followed the same protocol, but they were treated with traditional dressings. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the two groups. The results highlighted a significant increase in the concentration of antibiotics in the study group tissue; the improvement was sensibly lower in the control group. Statistical differences were not found between the two groups. The preliminary analysis of the data showed an important increase of antibiotic concentration in the tissue after VAC therapy. Despite the encouraging data, it is necessary to broaden the sample of patients and perform the same study with other antibiotics.

AB  - Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers, EV have beneficial effects, as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium (EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells (EV release).

AB  - Abstract The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation for over 20 years. The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13 to June 16, 2009 and co-chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to 280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research. These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a very complex and well-orchestrated phenomenon. It is carried out by the participation of all mature liver cell types. The process is associated with signaling cascades involving growth factors, cytokines, matrix remodeling, and several feedbacks of stimulation and inhibition of growth related signals. Liver manages to restore any lost mass and adjust its size to that of the organism, while at the same time providing full support for body homeostasis during the entire regenerative process. In situations when hepatocytes or biliary cells are blocked from regeneration, these cell types can function as facultative stem cells for each other. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors in the development of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These cardio-cerebral disorders promote a variety of vascular risk factors which in the presence of advancing age are prone to markedly reduce cerebral perfusion and create a neuronal energy crisis. Long-term hypoperfusion of the brain evolves mainly from cardiac structural pathology and brain vascular insufficiency. Brain hypoperfusion in the elderly is strongly associated with the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and both conditions are presumed to be precursors of Alzheimer dementia. A therapeutic target to prevent or treat MCI and consequently reduce the incidence of AD aims to elevate cerebral perfusion using novel pharmacological agents. As reviewed here, the experimental pharmaca include the use of Rho kinase inhibitors, neurometabolic energy boosters, sirtuins and vascular growth factors. In addition, a compelling new technique in laser medicine called photobiomodulation is reviewed. Photobiomodulation is based on the use of low level laser therapy to stimulate mitochondrial energy production non-invasively in nerve cells. The use of novel pharmaca and photobiomodulation may become important tools in the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline that can lead to dementia.

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - The potential to lower destructively high levels of elastase found in chronic wounds with oleic acid-treated cotton wound dressings was assessed and compared with two types of oleic acid-treated occlusive wound dressings. The ability of albumin to bind oleic acid and transfer elastase inhibitory activity from the dressing material to elastase in solution was examined. Cotton, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid wound dressings were treated with oleic acid and tested for their ability to lower elastase activity. Oleic acid?treated cotton gauzes, hydrogels, and hydrocolloid dressings were found to release oleic acid in the presence of albumin in sufficient quantities to inhibit elastase activity. The order of elastase lowering activity with the three oleic acid-formulated wound dressings was cotton gauze?>?hydrogel?>?hydrocolloid. Elastase inhibition by oleic acid displaced from gauze followed a dose response profile. In contrast Cathepsin G, when displaced by albumin, was inhibited within a narrow range of oleic acid formulations. The effect of albumin levels representative of the chronic wound on displacement of oleic acid was determined. Solubilization of cotton bound oleic acid by albumin was found to be most effective at 4% albumin. However, there was sufficient solubilization of oleic acid at the 2% albumin levels found in chronic wound fluid to achieve a significant elastase-lowering effect. Albumin promoted solubilization of oleic acid from cotton with a solubility threshold of 27?mg/g cotton gauze. Equivalent lowering of elastase activity was found with 1%, 2%, and 4% albumin concentrations with oleic acid on cotton at 128?mg oleic acid/gram of cotton.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.
