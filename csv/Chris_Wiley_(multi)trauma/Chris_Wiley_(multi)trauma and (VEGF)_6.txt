AB  - Abstract Unfocused extracorporeal shock waves (UESW) have been shown to have an anabolic effect on bone mass. Therefore we investigated the effects of UESW on bone in osteoporotic rats with and without anti-resorptive treatment. Twenty-week-old rats were ovariectomized (n?=?27). One group was treated with saline and another group with Alendronate (ALN) 2.4?µg/kg, 3?/week. UESW were applied 2 weeks after ovariectomy. Thousand UESW were applied to one hind leg, the contra-lateral hind leg was not treated and served as control. With the use of in vivo micro-CT scanning it was shown that in saline treated rats trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was higher at 2 weeks follow-up in UESW treated legs compared to control legs. However, at 4 and 10 weeks no difference was found. In ALN treated animals UESW led to a pronounced anabolic response resulting in an increase in BV/TV at all time-points. Furthermore, UESW resulted in increased cortical volume (CtV), higher trabecular connectivity and, more plate-like and thicker trabeculae. Biomechanical testing showed that UESW lead to a higher maximum force before failure and higher stiffness in all treatment groups. With histology abundant areas of intramembranous bone formation along the periosteal cortex and within the bone marrow were observed. In conclusion this study shows promising results for the use of UESW in the treatment of osteoporosis, especially when this treatment is combined with an anti-resorptive treatment. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Aim: In tissue engineering of the skin, the selection of a scaffold or a matrix in which a cultured cells grow is quite important. We have developed a tissue engineering skin composed of human keratinocytes and fibroblasts on an acellular allogenic dermal matrix (ADM), derived from cryopreserved human skin. Methods: ADM was prepared from cryopreserved split-thickness human skin by treating with Dispase and Triton X-100. The tissue engineering skin were produced by seeding human keratinocytes and fibroblasts on ADM. Several days after seeding, the tissue engineering skin was exposed to an air-liquid interface for another 7 days. Then, the histological structure of the skin and the production of growth factors by the skin were investigated. Results: The produced ADM was found to be completely acellular with remaining structure of the basement membrane components, such as type IV collagen and laminin. The developed tissue engineering skin had stratified keratinocytes on the surface of the ADM migrating fibroblasts in the dermal collagen structure, resembling to the normal skin appearance. It was found that several important growth factors in wound healing process, such as TGF-α, TGF-? and VEGF, were produced by the tissue engineering skin. Conclusions: It was suggested that ADM is suitable for a scaffold in tissue engineering of the skin.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcoma constitutes a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumours. Although they are common in the dog, many uncertainties surround the best options for clinical management. Despite recent improvements in outcome, approximately one in five patients may still die as a result of their disease. There is some evidence that wide surgical excision may not be required for every soft tissue sarcoma but, conversely, complacency in treatment may adversely affect outcomes for patients with aggressive disease. The purpose of this review is to examine the issues affecting the management of canine soft tissue sarcoma, and to evaluate the human literature for lessons that may guide future treatment directions for dogs. Comparative lessons from human soft tissue sarcoma that may be important for the canine patient in the future include (1) understanding the oncogenic potential of the pseudocapsule to better predict tumour behaviour and optimal surgical margins, (2) recognising the importance of planned multi-modality therapy for improving tumour control, (3) considering a role for compartmental resection strategies and (4) improving the accuracy of pretreatment analysis of the tumour to better predict behaviour and optimal treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Treating peripheral nerve injury faces major challenges and may benefit from bioactive scaffolds due to the limited autograft resources. Graphene oxide (GO) has emerged as a promising nanomaterial with excellent physical and chemical properties. GO has functional groups that confer biocompatibility that is better than that of graphene. Here, GO/polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoscaffolds are fabricated using an integration molding method. The nanoscaffolds exhibit many merits, including even GO nanoparticle distribution, macroporous structure, and strong mechanical support. Additionally, the process enables excellent quality control. In vitro studies confirm the advantages of the GO/PCL nanoscaffolds in terms of Schwann cell proliferation, viability, and attachment, as well as neural characteristics maintenance. This is the first study to evaluate the in vivo performance of GO-based nanoscaffolds in this context. GO release and PCL biodegradation is analyzed after long-term in vivo study. It is also found that the GO/PCL nerve guidance conduit could successfully repair a 15 mm sciatic nerve defect. The pro-angiogenic characteristic of GO is evaluated in vivo using immunohistochemistry. In addition, the AKT-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway might play a major role in the angiogenic process. These findings demonstrate that the GO/PCL nanoscaffold efficiently promotes functional and morphological recovery in peripheral nerve regeneration, indicating its promise for tissue engineering applications.

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which are dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Introduction: Adenoviral gene transfer of Angiopoietin-1 (AdAng1) recruits endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and improves diabetic wound healing. A suggested mechanism for EPC mobilization from the bone marrow (BM) is mediated through MMP-9 and stem cell factor (SCF). We hypothesize that Ang-1 recruits EPCs to diabetic wounds via an MMP-9 dependent mechanism. ?Methods: Lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with BM from transgenic TIE-2/LacZ mice. After engraftment, diabetes was induced with steptozotocin. 8?mm wounds were created in BM transplanted (BMT)(n?=?12) or MMP-9 knockout (KO)(n?=?12) mice and treated with 1???108 PFU of AdAng1, AdGFP or PBS. At 7 days wounds were analyzed for epithelial gap, vessel density, and EPCs. Serum levels of VEGF, proMMP9 and SCF were assessed. Data are expressed as mean?±?SEM ?Results: In diabetic BMT wounds, AdAng1 results in improved reepithelialization (Ang1 2.3?±?.2?mm; GFP 3.9?±?.2; PBS 4.0?±?.1 p?<?.0001) neovascularization (Ang1 6.8?±?.3Caps/Hpf; GFP 3.0?±?.4; PBS 2.9?±?.3 p?<?.0001) and EPC recruitment (Ang1 5.3?±?.4 EPCs/Hpf; GFP 2.1?±?.3; PBS 2.2?±?.3 p?<?.0001). AdAng1 treatment results in increased levels of proMMP-9 (Ang1 9.7?±?.8?ng/ml; GFP 6.3?±?.9; PBS 6.4?±?.4 p?<?.01) and SCF (Ang1 265?±?28?pg/ml; GFP 119?±?16; PBS159?±?12 p?<?.001). In MMP9 KO mice, AdAng1 accelerates reepithelialization (Ang1 3.2?±?.1?mm; GFP 4.1?±?.2; PBS 3.8?±?.2; p<.) but has no significant effect on neovascularization (Ang1 4.1?±?.5 Caps/HPF; GFP 3.9?±?.4; PBS 3.9?±?.6), EPC recruitment (Ang1 2?±?.3 EPC/Hpf; GFP 1.5?±?.3; PBS 1.6?±?.2) or SCF levels (Ang1 83?±?5?pg/ml; GFP 83?±?2; PBS 88?±?6). ?Conclusions: The effects of Ang-1 on EPC recruitment and neovascularization are dependent on MMP-9. Our data support the hypothesis that MMP-9 enables SCF to permit mobilization of EPCs.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

AB  - Abstract The trans-activating response of DNA/RNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 pathology is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases via unknown mechanisms. Here, we use a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human wild-type neuronal TDP-43 to study the effects of TDP-43 pathology on glutamate metabolism and synaptic function. We found that neuronal TDP-43 over-expression affects synaptic protein expression, including Synapsin I, and alters surrounding astrocytic function. TDP-43 over-expression is associated with an increase in glutamate and ?-amino butyric acid and reduction of glutamine and aspartate levels, indicating impairment of presynaptic terminal. TDP-43 also decreases tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and induces oxidative stress via lactate accumulation. Neuronal TDP-43 does not alter microglia activity or significantly changes systemic and brain inflammatory markers compared to control. We previously demonstrated that brain-penetrant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), nilotinib and bosutinib, reduce TDP-43-induced cell death in transgenic mice. Here, we show that TKIs reverse the effects of TDP-43 on synaptic proteins, increase astrocytic function and restore glutamate and neurotransmitter balance in TDP-43 mice. Nilotinib, but not bosutinib, reverses mitochondrial impairment and oxidative metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that TKIs can attenuate TDP-43 toxicity and improve synaptic and astrocytic function, independent of microglial or other inflammatory effects. In conclusion, our data demonstrate novel mechanisms of the effects of neuronal TDP-43 over-expression on synaptic protein expression and alteration of astrocytic function.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adult skeletal muscle can regenerate effectively after mild physical or chemical insult. Muscle trauma or disease can overwhelm this innate capacity for regeneration and result in heightened inflammation and fibrotic tissue deposition resulting in loss of structure and function. Recent studies have focused on biomaterial and stem cell-based therapies to promote skeletal muscle regeneration following injury and disease. Many stem cell populations besides satellite cells are implicated in muscle regeneration. These stem cells include but are not limited to mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, pericytes, fibroadipogenic progenitors, side population cells, and CD133+ stem cells. However, several challenges associated with their isolation, availability, delivery, survival, engraftment, and differentiation have been reported in recent studies. While acellular scaffolds offer a relatively safe and potentially off-the-shelf solution to cell-based therapies, they are often unable to stimulate host cell migration and activity to a level that would result in clinically meaningful regeneration of traumatized muscle. Combining stem cells and biomaterials may offer a viable therapeutic strategy that may overcome the limitations associated with these therapies when they are used in isolation. In this article, we review the stem cell populations that can stimulate muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo. We also discuss the regenerative potential of combination therapies that utilize both stem cell and biomaterials for the treatment of skeletal muscle injury and disease. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Aim: Available donor skin is so limited in extensive burns that wounds are usually closed using STSG harvested repeatedly from unburned skin. In such cases, it is important to accelerate the epithelization process of the donor wounds. We have developed a cultured cellular sheet composed of mixture of keratinocytes (KC) and fibroblasts (FB) seeded on a polyurethane membrane (mixed culture sheet) and investigated its effectiveness for the wound healing of STSG donor wounds. Methods: Normal human KC and FB were primarily cultured from a surplus human skin in a skin graft surgery. After a few passages of the cultivation, both cells were seeded on a thin polyurethane membrane. Each seeding density of KC and FB were equal. Several days after the co-cultivation, the mixed culture sheet was transferred to a freshly harvested STSG donor wound in an extensive burn patient. A polyurethane membrane without cells was used for control coverage. Seven patients were treated using the mixed culture sheets. Autologous cells were used in 3 cases, and allogenic cells were used in the other 4 cases. The time for the final epithelization was determined. In vitro production of several growth factors by a cellular sheet was also investigated by ELASA. Results and Conclusion: TGF-alpha, EGF, TGF-beta, VEGF were well produced by the mixed culture sheet. The time for final epithelization of the wounds was reduced by 2.5 days with the mixed culture sheet application as compared to the control sites. It was suggested that the mixed culture sheet may be useful for the treatment of STSG donor wounds.

AB  - Abstract Using a spleen autotransplantation model, we conducted hematological, hemorheological, immunological, and morphological studies in mice 6 weeks after splenectomy. Sixty male and female A/J inbred mice were equally divided into 3 groups: 1) SE group, splenectomy was performed; 2) AU group, spleen chips were autotransplanted into the omentum without vascular anastomosis following splenectomy; and 3) C group (controls), no intervention in these mice. At postoperative week 6, the following studies were performed: 1) measurement of hematological parameters; 2) hemorheological studies, including relative cell transit time (RCTT) and fibrinogen levels; and 3) activity of peripheral phagocytes, measured by zymozan-induced chemiluminescence, which was calculated in stimulation index values (SI). In addition, histological investigations of autotransplants were conducted. Erythrocyte mean cell volume and platelet counts, RCTT, fibrinogen levels, and activity of phagocytes were significantly higher in the SE group, compared to those in the C group. In the AU group, these parameters were similar to those in the C group. Morphologically, the transplanted spleen showed normal histology. These data indicate that the transplanted spleens restored their function. We conclude that spleen autotransplantation reserves the normal morphology of spleen and restores most of the spleen's hematological, hemorheological, and immunological functions. Both SI index and erythrocyte deformability can be an informative detection of decreasing splenic function. These data suggest that spleen autotransplantation may provide a useful tool to prevent complications following splenectomy in a clinical setting.

Párhuzamosan az autotransplantált lép-chipek szövettani értékelését is elvégeztük. Az erythrocyták átlagos térfogata és a thrombocyták száma, az RCTT és a fibrinogén szint, valamint a phagocyták aktivitása szignifikánsan nagyobb volt az SE, mint a C csoportban. Ezek a paraméterek az AU csoportban hasonlóak voltak a C csoport értékeihez. Az autotransplantált lépek normális histologiájú képet mutattak. Eredményeink azt sugallják, hogy a transplantalt lép-chipek funkciója helyreállt. Kísérleteink alapján úgy t?nik, hogy a lép autotransplantatio meg?rzi a lépszövet normál morphologiáját, nagyrészt helyreállítja a haematologiai, haemorheologiai és immunologiai funkciókat. A lépfunkció csökkenésének érzékeny jelz?je lehet az SI és a vörösvérsejt deformabilitás értékeinek változása. Adataink szerint a lépautotransplantatio hatékony eszköz lehet a splenctomiákat követ? komplikációk megel?zésében a klinikai gyakorlatban is. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 23:483?488 2003

AB  - Cellular interaction with biomaterials determines the fate of the implant. Naturally derived biomaterials such as small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and renal capsule matrix (RCM) may provide optimal structure and composition for cellular repopulation in certain wound healing applications. Porcine renal capsule matrix (RCM) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix undergoing characterization and preclinical investigation for the treatment of soft tissue injury. Early studies have demonstrated that RCM constructs induce host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. RCM consists primarily of collagen, although the other proteins have been detected, including the growth factors basic FGF, VEGF, and CTGF. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to envision the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that RCM is a dense, heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse following lyophilization, much of the native structure seen in the hydrated isolate is preserved. These differences are maintained following rehydration in normal saline. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture likely facilitates host interaction at the cellular level. Further compositional characterization is under way. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated, West Lafayette, IN.

AB  - The complexity of cellular and molecular events that occur during wound healing is given by the rapid and continuous changes of matrix structure, cell population, local cytokine composition, nutrient and oxygen availabilities and overall metabolic activity. Angiogenesis is an essential event in the repair of injured tissue. Transcriptional events leading to wound neovascularization begin immediately after the injury has occurred and continue throughout the process until scar remodeling becomes quiescent. This study investigated progression of wound angiogenesis by quantitatively measuring transcripts of multiple genes that participate in wound angiogenesis. The studies were done using a murine model of bilateral 3?mm excision wounds. Wound tissues were collected from 6 hours up to 10 days post-wounding. Each time point consisted of 8 wounds pooled from four different mice. After RNA purification, the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probe/primer sets for selected transcripts that included the following groups: a) angiogenic factors; b) anti-angiogenic factors; c) receptors; d) cytokines and enzymes; e) matrix proteins; f) signaling molecules and transcription factors; g) apoptosis and proliferation markers; and h) housekeeping genes. A total of 58 genes were profiled including four housekeeping genes. The transcripts revealed several patterns of expression. Some genes such as angiopoietin 1(Ang1), e-selecting, placental growth factor (PlGF), MMP-9 and thrombospondin 1(TSP1) had a clear biphasic pattern where early peaks were detected within the first 24 hours after wounding and were followed by dowregulation and a second increase in transcription after several days. Other transcripts appeared early and had a sustained expression and they include fibroblast growth factor two (FGF2), FGF7, hypoxia inducile factor alpha (HIF-1a) and STAT3. Examples of late transcripts included HOXD3 and alpha smooth muscle actin. Results derived from this study largely confirm previous studies profiling a small number of individual genes such as VEGF, TSP1 and 2 and others. However, the present study integrates complete transcriptional profiles of large number of genes known to have a critical role in healing progression with a particular emphasis on revascularization. A more detailed model of event sequences that lead to tissue reperfusion after injury is derived from the results.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Introduction:? Liposomal gene transfer is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of several pathophysiologic states. The purpose of the present study was to define whether the biological or chemical structure of a liposome influences cellular and biological regeneration in the skin and to determine by which mechanisms possible changes occur. Methods:? Rats were inflicted a full-excision acute wound and divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of DMRIE liposomes plus the Lac-Z gene, or DOTAP/Chol liposomes plus the Lac Z gene, or saline. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical 'techniques were used to determine molecular mechanisms after gene transfer, protein expression, dermal, and epidermal regeneration. Results:? DOTAP/Chol increased IGF-I and KGF protein concentration and caused concomitant cellular responses, e.g., by increasing IGFBP-3, p?<?0.05. DOTAP/Chol liposomes improved epidermal regeneration by exhibiting the most rapid area and linear wound reepithelization compared to DMRIE or control, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol and DMRIE exerted promitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on basal keratinocytes, p?<?0.05. Dermal regeneration was improved in DOTAP/Chol treated animals by an increased collagen deposition and morphology, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol liposomes increased VEGF concentrations and thus neovascularization when compared with DMRIE and saline, p?<?0.001. Summary:? In the present study we showed that different liposomes have different effects on intracellular and biological responses based on its chemical and molecular structure. For gene transfer in acute wounds the administration of DOTAP/Chol liposomes appears to be beneficial. Acknowledgments:? Clayton Foundation for Research
