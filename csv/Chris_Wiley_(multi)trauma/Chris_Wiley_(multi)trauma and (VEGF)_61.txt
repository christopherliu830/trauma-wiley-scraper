AB  - Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the binding and diffusion of growth factors in model extracellular matrices in order to investigate the importance of protein-matrix interactions in regulating signaling molecules within a three-dimensional matrix. Two important growth factors were studied, transforming growth factor ?1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are known to have specific affinities for fibronectin and the heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan perlecan, respectively. Collagen-based matrices were prepared by polymerizing type I collagen in the presence of fibronectin or perlecan, and we measured diffusion constants and binding constants of the two growth factors. The binding constant measured for transforming growth factor ?1 with fibronectin-containing matrices was in good agreement with that measured using affinity chromatography. However, the interactions measured between fibroblast growth factor and perlecan were significantly weaker than expected. Surprisingly, the strongest interactions by far were with monomeric collagen solutions and fibrillar collagen matrices. Our findings suggest a central role for the three-dimensional fibrillar collagen matrix in growth factor interactions, with modulatory roles for fibronectin or perlecan.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex biological event orchestrated by various resident and infiltrating cell types spanning multiple stages. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease released upon wounding, stimulates fibroblasts and macrophages at the sites of wounds to express, chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have used cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanisms involved in thrombin induces IL-8 expression in human macrophages. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR show that thrombin stimulates IL-8 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. Various inhibitors for signal transduction proteins were used to delineate the pathways involved. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibitors for both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NFÉ»B strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced production of IL-8 suggesting that they are major regulators of this stimulation. JNK was shown to be phorsphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to thrombin treatment confirming its involvement. In order to identify the mediator of JNK and the thrombin receptor, we use affinity pull down and found that Rho GTPase was activated by thrombin suggesting that Rho may be the mediator of JNK activation. In addition, we found that PKC is a negative regulator of thrombin-induced IL-8 expression. Our study broadens the horizon of how IL-8 is regulated in wound healing and may help develop pharmaceutical methods to manipulate this process in pathological conditions.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the effects of hibernation drugs on early wound sepsis in severely scalded rats. Methods:? Sprague-Dawley rats inflicted 30% TBSA deep thickness were randomly divided into A (immediate resuscitation) and B (immediate resuscitation and lytic cocktail). After infusion of 108?CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound on third postburn day, survival was compared between two groups. Local tissue samples and plasma were collected and the plasma level of IL-2 mRNA, IL-4 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA, and IFN-? mRNA were assayed by fluorescence PCR. Results:? Compared with Group A, host survival significantly increased (0.663?±?0.026, P?<?0.01), viscera injury decrease in group B after infusion bacteria. The plasma Th1 cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IFN-?) levels in B group were significantly increased compared with A group. However, the plasma Th2 cytokine mRNA (IL-4, IL-10) levels in group B were not as significantly increased as group A. Conclusions:? Immediate resuscitation with hibernation drugs can decrease viscera injury after sepsis, increase host survival and improve host immune system by preventing Th1 cell from over activation and decrease Th2 cytokines.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that ends with scar formation in adult skin. In contrast, fetal skin within the first and second trimesters of development heals without a scar. One of the most important aspects of scarless fetal wound repair appears to be the lack of inflammation in these wounds, suggesting that acute inflammation can promote scar formation in the skin. While it is well accepted that inflammation causes scar formation in the fetus, it is not known what specific factors produced during inflammation are responsible for these effects. The present experiments tested the possibility that oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells can contribute to scar tissue production by inducing inflammation in the fetus. Using a murine fetal wound repair model we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide increased E15 (embryonic day 15) fibroblast proliferation and ultimately interfered with scarless healing in E15 skin, possibly through the induction of TGF-?1. Defining the factors produced during the inflammatory response that contribute to scar formation could be important for the development of new therapies designed to minimize adult scarring.

AB  - An initiative to bring wound care ?back to the bedside? was introduced in a large teaching hospital. Wound consultation was available from either a nurse or physician member of a hospital-based wound team. Confusion over whom to consult coupled with multiple product options led to decreased critical thinking at the bedside. The volume of consultations precluded follow-up visits by the team, further fragmenting care. The proposed solution included partnering with a sole vendor to standardize wound products and assist with education on product selection and function. New policies and procedures were created. Each patient unit was staffed by a Nurse clinical specialist as part of a hospital-wide ?Magnet? application process. This individual assumed the role of ?skin care leader? and was required to attend two in-depth educational programs. All skin care leaders were required to become part of a hospital-wide quarterly prevalence and incidence project. The wound nurse assumed a more ?consultative? role for the skin care leaders who subsequently assisted the end user in this model; the bedside nurse. This paradigm shift in care did not result in any statistically significant changes in wound incidence and reintroduced skin care as an integral component of the assessment and care for the bedside nurse. This presentation will describe the process in detail. Acknowledgments:? This study was supported with an educational grant from Smith and Nephew, Largo, FL.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - The particular combination of polydeoxyribonucleotides, l-carnitine, calcium ions, proteolytic enzyme and other ingredients acts in a synergetic way in the regeneration of skin and connective tissues. This new formulation of active principles was tested in vitro as a cell and tissue culture medium and in vivo for various preparations in support of tissue regeneration. In vitro, the new blend allowed the maintenance of skin biopsies for more than 1?year in eutrophic conditions. Immunocytochemical analyses of fibroblasts isolated from these biopsies confirmed a significant increase of the epidermal and connective wound-healing markers such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, cytokeratin 1 (CK1), CK5, CK10 and CK14 versus controls. To examine the effects of the new compound in vivo, we studied impaired wound healing in genetically diabetic db/db mice. At day?18, diabetic mice treated with the new composition showed 100% closure of wounds and faster healing than mice treated with the other solutions. This complex of vital continuity factors or life-keeping factors could be used as a tissue-preserving solution or a cosmetic/drug/medical device to accelerate wound healing in the treatment of patients with deficient wound repair to promote the regeneration of cutaneous and connective tissues (injuries?wound, dermatitis) and prevent the recurrent relapses.

AB  - Background:? Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate the healing of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcerations. It appears to function as cell-based therapy (e.g., delivering growth factors), rather than as a true graft. Given this mechanism of action, its use could be expanded to areas in which traditional skin grafting is not routinely employed. Methods:? A 64-year-old wheel-chairbound Caucasian male presented to the wound clinic with a grade III left trochanteric pressure ulcer which had been present since 1976. He had been seen by numerous physicians and treated with debridement, topical antimicrobials, negative pressure therapy, growth factors, and a variety of dressings. We spent several months preparing the wound bed: maintaining adequate moisture balance, performing serial debridement, utilizing offloading surfaces and reducing the bacterial burden. His nutritional status was optimized. The wound bed developed a healthy granulating base but failed to close. Results:? A single unit of Apligraf was meshed at a 1:1.5 ratio and applied to the wound. It was fixed in place using a nonstick silicone dressing, foam, and a self-adhesive covering. The dressing was changed weekly in the wound clinic. The initial response was a decrease in wound depth followed by steady epithelialization. Complete closure occurred 17 weeks after grafting. The wound has not recurred. Conclusion:? This single case study suggests that bilayered cell therapy may have application in difficult wounds, such as pressure ulcerations. Further study into the efficacy of Apligraf in pressure ulcerations is ongoing.

AB  - In persons with venous ulcers and an absence of arterial disease, high compression as exemplified by the four layer bandage (Profore) has been demonstrated to be effective by a meta-analysis of existing studies. Despite optimized compression, some venous ulcers do not heal at the expected rate and persistent inflammation or infection may delay or prevent healing. We report the results of a case series that demonstrates an ionized silver dressing with prolonged release of nanocrystalline crystals (Acticoat 7) can decrease bacterial burden and accelerate healing in venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under a four layer bandage (Profore) for 12 weeks, or until healing. The primary efficacy objective measured the effect of the silver dressing on the wound microflora. Biopsies of the wounds were taken at baseline and after treatment with the silver dressing (Acticoat 7) and were analyzed for the bacterial species and number of bacteria present. In addition, serum silver levels were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and week 12 or final assessment. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. Of those patients who did not heal, 4 had more than a 94% reduction in wound area by the end of the 12-week study period. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase (p?=?0.054) in serum silver concentration during the treatment period. At baseline, prior to the silver dressing treatment (Acticoat 7), the median silver concentration was 0.3??g/L (range: 0.20?1.90??g/L). The median within patient change from baseline serum silver concentration was an increase of 0.15??g/L (range: ?0.3?2.8??g/L). Although this small increase was observed it was not considered clinically significant. This study illustrates the use of prolonged release nanocrystalline silver dressing to decrease the bacterial burden of chronic venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate.

AB  - Often chronic wounds have an increased bacterial burden that can impair healing without the classical clinical signs of infection. Silver dressings may provide an alternative topical method to control bacterial burden. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2?4 weeks therapy with the Silver Containing Hydrofiber? dressing on quantitative bacterial burden and clinical improvement in chronic wounds not healing at the expected rate. This was a single centre, four-armed study which included a total of 30 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and miscellaneous wounds that did not fit into any of the above categories. Patients had a baseline quantitative bacterial biopsy and this was repeated at weeks 2 to 4. The wound size was recorded along with a semi quantitative estimate of exudate and the periwound temperatures. Repeat measurements were performed at the follow-up visits and the decrease in wound size calculated. The underlying cause of the ulceration was be treated and corrected. This was followed by application of silver containing hydrofiber? dressing. There was a significant delay in healing of the leg ulcers associated with increased bacterial burden in the quantitative biopsy bacterial burden results at week 0 and healing at week 2. (p?=?0.01). Other subgroups had a similar association that did not reach statistical significance. The presence of an increased exudate in the leg ulcers at week two was associated with delayed healing at week 4 (p?=?0.05). There was also a significant increase in skin surface temperature of the surrounding skin with an increased quantitative bacterial biopsy of the deep wound compartment for venous, diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers with p values of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively. There was no significant decrease in exudate or increased healing of the wounds with the application of the silver hydrofiber dressing in this difficult to heal population. The population studied in this case series had increased bacterial burden in the deep compartment as measured with increased exudate and or an increased temperature of the periwound skin. These patients have an increased bacterial burden in the deep wound compartment that does not respond to topical ionized silver in the dressing studied.

AB  - How wound dressings may act locally to aid chronic wound healing is poorly understood. Along with an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and the realization that these ulcers exhibit a high degree of inflammation, models have been developed linking the disease etiology and the visible ulcer. Furthermore, these models have suggested ways in which present therapeutic regimens, such as compression, aid healing. However, little focus has been placed on understanding how locally applied wound dressings aid in the overall healing response in the context of elevated inflammation. Here, we propose that if wound dressings have the correct combination of novel materials and physical characteristics they may provide effective management of the damaging local factors (i.e., proteinases and/or bacteria), thereby promoting a local environment supportive of healing. For example, the management of damaging wound exudates, limiting its exposure to the wound bed and surrounding skin, reduces the irritant effects of these exudates, leading to a reduction in the localized stimulation of inflammation. A better understanding of local environment and wound dressing interactions will help in the development of more effective wound dressings in the future.

AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Purpose:? The purpose of this study was to determine the current use of wet-to-dry dressings as the principal wound care modality ordered by health care providers. In addition, this study describes the types of wounds wet-to-dry dressings are currently used for, the specialty of health care providers most likely to order these dressings, and associated data that indicates whether or not the clinical condition of the wound warrants the use of wet-to-dry dressing for mechanical debridement. Method:? This descriptive study involved a retrospective chart review of 202 home health and HMO case managed patients with open wounds One hundred and two HMO charts were reviewed; only 74 had sufficient data documented. One hundred and sixty-one home health charts were reviewed; only 128 were appropriate for data collection (closed incisions, drainage tubes, ostomies, and those charts where more than six items on the data collection sheet were not documented in the chart, were not used). The data was analyzed using SPSS. Findings:? This study suggests that the current use of wet-to-dry dressings is over 41% of all principal wound care modalities, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). The majority of wet-to-dry dressings ordered are for surgical wounds (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Furthermore, this study suggests that general surgeons are most likely to order wet-to-dry dressings (38%). Data also indicated that in over 78.6% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings, mechanical debridement was not indicated (the percent of granulating tissue in the wound bed was?>?75%). In only 3.5% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings was mechanical debridement possibly indicated by the amount of nonviable tissue in the wound bed. Discussion:? Clinicians need to be involved in research that will lead to evidenced based clinical practice and standardized wound care. The scientific literature suggests that wet-to-dry dressings are not evidenced based, but are detrimental to the granulating wound bed, painful, costly, and one of the least effective methods of debridement available today.

AB  - Induced organ regeneration is de novo synthesis of a physiological, or nearly physiological, organ at the same anatomical site as the organ that is being replaced. Regeneration of skin, peripheral nerves, and the conjunctiva have been accomplished using nothing more than biologically active scaffolds (regeneration templates) seeded with epithelial cells; devices for regeneration of the first two organs are in clinical use. Templates appear to function by blocking contraction well as by acting as temporary configurational guides for synthesis of new stroma that resembles that of the organ under replacement. The combined evidence supports a theory which predicts that selective blocking of the adult healing response uncovers part, at least, of the latent fetal response to injury and, in the presence of the appropriate scaffold, eventually leads to organ regeneration. An independent theory suggests that loss of regenerative potential, which is observed during the mammalian fetal-adult transition, is associated with simultaneous acquisition of individual immunocompetence.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.
