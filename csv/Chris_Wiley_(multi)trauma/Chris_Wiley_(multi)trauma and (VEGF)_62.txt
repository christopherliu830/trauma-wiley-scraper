AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an ubiquitous enzyme produced by different cell types. Previous reports have demonstrated ALP induction by extracellular matrix, ascorbic acid or IL-6. Using histochemical techniques, we evaluated the ex vivo activity of ALP in incisional and excisional acute wounds, chronic wounds, and keloids in animal and human models. We also compared in situ ALP activity with type I/III collagen levels using histological methods (Herovici technique). Results demonstrated that 1) during the first stage of acute wound healing the increase in ALP activity precedes high levels of type III collagen, meanwhile type I collagen diminishes. When ALP activity disappears, the proportion of type I/III collagen returns to normal. 2) ALP activity is almost null in chronic wounds, which are characterized by thick type I collagen fibers and some type III collagen throughout the tissue. However, when the wound is treated, ALP activity rises to maximum levels together with type III collagen, but type I collagen is absent. 3) In keloids ALP activity is also absent; however when the scar is treated with a proinflammatory cytokine downmodulator (collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone) endogenous type I collagen diminishes, while type III collagen and ALP activity are increased. Based on the above results we suggest that ALP activity is an acute inflammation marker since the enzyme levels are increased in acute wounds but not in chronic inflammation processes. Nevertheless, when chronic lesions or scars are in the process of healing, the increase in ALP activity is clear. And as a result, we believe that treatments for chronic wounds or scars induce acute inflammation and consequently stimulate wound repair or fibrolysis. In conclusion, ALP activity is an important factor to be considered in acute and chronic wound repair and their healing process.

AB  - Introduction:? Accurate wound size measurement is vital to assessment of progressive healing. Lack of an accepted ?gold standard? is a major obstacle to assessment of any effective wound management regimen. Methodology:? Sixteen pelvic region pressure ulcers were monitored weekly for 3 weeks. All wounds were stage III or IV, equally divided between sacral and ischial locations. Linear wound size was measured using the Decubitus Disposable Measuring Guide (DDMG). Wound size index was defined as the sum of the linear dimensions. Wound volume was determined by filling the covered wound cavity with fluid; the volume of saline required to fill the wound was a direct measure of wound volume. Results and Discussion:? Correlation between the two measurement methods was determined utilizing Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient. Wound size index decreased significantly (p?<?0.01) over the study period. Wound volume changes were nonsignificant. Closer evaluation of assessment methodology found missing wound volume data, due primarily to patient positioning difficulties. All missing data points were for ischial wounds. Wound absorption of measurement fluid and residual fluid in the wound prior to measurement could not be determined. Wound size index may be influenced by subjective evaluation of wound boundaries. Conclusion:? Wound size index significantly discriminated longitudinal changes in wound size, while volume measurements did not. Wound volume measurements have greater measurement errors than wound size index. Acknowledgments:? Support for this study was provided by the Veterans Administration Rehabilitation Research and Development Service.

AB  - Acute wounds caused by the severe and extensive infection such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci or MRSA may be life-threatening in immunocompromised hosts such as steroid users or those with venostasis in the lower legs. The principle of the treatment is the removal of the primary pathogens, however, difficulties of the lower leg reconstruction remain due to the tissue loss and the deficiency of the circulation system after extensive soft tissue debridement. For 10 immediately-developing extensive lower extremity cases, artificial skin substitutes composed of dried bilayer membranes of outer silicone membrane and inner porcine-tendon derived collagen layer (Pelnac?, Gunze Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were immediately after extensive and meticulous debridement. While the skin substitute integrated into the wound bed for maximally 3 weeks, total 20 micrograms of the basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)(Trafermin?, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were applied by the 27-Gage syringe daily. The outer membranes were removed and thin partial thickness skin grafting (9?10/1,000 inches) was performed and wound healed uneventfully. The bFGF-treated skin texture was significantly softer compared to control by a durometer (Teclock?, GS-701N, Tokyo, Japan)(p?<?0.01), which was a measuring device elastic hard products such as rubbers and polymers. Reconstruction using the porcine-derived artificial skin substitute in the lower extremities after extensive debridement was safe, easy, and reproducible. The quality of the wounds with bFGF significantly improves the healed skin texture.

AB  - A Laser Speckle Perfusion Imaging (LSPI) system has been developed to achieve rapid, high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of tissue blood flow. This study was designed to evaluate LSPI for monitoring dermal blood flow during the wound healing process in a well-established porcine model. Full-thickness excisional wounds (2???2?cm) were created on the dorsal skin of 11 juvenile female red Duroc pigs. The skin wounds were imaged weekly with the LSPI system until day 49 postwounding. Blood flow values for the wounds were normalized using the values from the surrounding healthy skin to account for variations in systemic perfusion from one scan date to the next. An average normalized perfusion value was obtained from the scans of all animals for each time point. Wound perfusion at the time of reepithelialization reached ?165% of the surrounding skin (p?<?0.001). This elevation in wound perfusion slowly and steadily decreased over time, until day 49 postwounding, at which time the values returned to normal. This trend toward decreased wound perfusion over time has previously been reported in human burn wounds using the LSPI instrument. Further, the LSPI data from this study and from other human studies correlates well with data generated using the more widely established Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) technique. The faster scan time and higher resolution of the LSPI method provides a distinct clinical advantage, both in terms of patient comfort and for reliably matching perfusion characteristics to their associated anatomical features. The fast temporal response of the LSPI instrument could be used to monitor vascular responses to mechanical or pharmacological interventions to study dynamic vascular changes to damaged tissues. This study validates LSPI as a tool to measure blood flow in skin wounds and further supports the use of the juvenile female pig as a model of excisional wound healing, yielding results comparable to healing in humans.

AB  - Awareness and research on epilepsy-related deaths (ERD), in particular Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), have exponentially increased over the last two decades. Most publications have focused on guidelines that inform clinicians dealing with these deaths, educating patients, potential risk factors and mechanisms. There is a relative paucity of information available for pathologists who conduct these autopsies regarding appropriate post mortem practice and investigations. As we move from recognizing SUDEP as the most common form of ERD toward in-depth investigations into its causes and prevention, health professionals involved with these autopsies and post mortem procedure must remain fully informed. Systematizing a more comprehensive and consistent practice of examining these cases will facilitate (i) more precise determination of cause of death, (ii) identification of SUDEP for improved epidemiological surveillance (the first step for an intervention study), and (iii) biobanking and cell-based research. This article reviews how pathologists and healthcare professionals have approached ERD, current practices, logistical problems and areas to improve and harmonize. The main neuropathology, cardiac and genetic findings in SUDEP are outlined, providing a framework for best practices, integration of clinical, pathological and molecular genetic investigations in SUDEP, and ultimately prevention.

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It has been speculated that a prolonged and elevated neutrophilic response has an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds. This has raised the possibility that one or more of these proteases might be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for chronic wounds. The purpose of this study was to examine several primarily neutrophil-derived proteases present in pressure ulcer tissues and to determine whether protease activity could be correlated with neutrophil levels. Biopsies of pressure ulcers were taken from consented subjects (n?=?13) and again after 3 months standard care. Mean wound volume decreased 2.4?cm3 per month; however, volumes of six wounds were increased at the end of the study. Levels of extractable myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and gelatinase (MMP-9) activities were determined. Mean levels of MPO (n?=?11) at study initiation and after 3 months were nearly identical (2945 and 2845 milliunits per mg extract, respectively). Interestingly, these levels were similar to that previously found in healing open dermal wounds at 4 days postwounding. MPO levels increased in the extracts obtained from three subjects and declined in five subjects. Elastase (corr. 0.265 p?=?0.233) and MMP-8 (corr. ?0.05 p?=?0.835) activities correlated poorly with MPO. This is likely a reflection of differences in the access of protease inhibitors (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin, TIMP, and alpha2?macroglobulin) to these wounds. As expected, a greater correlation level was observed between the proteases (MMP-8 vs. elastase corr. 0.362 p?=?0.097; MMP-8 vs. MMP-9 corr. 0.55 p?=?0.009). The results from this study highlight the high degree of variability that can be observed in the pressure ulcer environment. This further suggests that a combination of biomarkers will be required for making accurate diagnostic assessments of chronic wounds. This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - The Thermage system is a radiofrequency (RF) device designed to treat human skin. The Thermage ThermaCool TC? is a noninvasive, nonablative, nonlaser system that combines cryogen cooling and radiofrequency (RF) energy to volumetrically heat dermal and subdermal tissue. Thermage treatment causes collagen contraction resulting in immediate skin tightening. It has also been clinically shown to tighten skin over time. This long-term tightening effect is believed to result from the body?s wound healing response. We performed studies in a juvenile pig to characterize the wound healing response after ThermaCool treatment in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular events resulting from treatment. Histological markers of the wound healing process were examined over a 1-month period. Collagen gene expression was examined by quantitative PCR. Macrophages and mast cells are important inflammatory cell types that stimulate fibroblast recruitment, collagen synthesis and blood vessel growth. Three to 5 days following treatment, macrophages and mast cells were present in the dermis. By 28 days, both increased dermal blood vessel density and epidermal thickness was observed. Collagen I and collagen III genes were expressed at elevated levels by 21 days posttreatment. ThermaCool? treatment stimulates dermal remodeling by initiating a wound-healing response. This study demonstrates that thermage treatment results in the recruitment of important cellular mediators of wound healing and increased collagen synthesis in an animal model. These events are presumed to be responsible for dermal remodeling and skin tightening over time in human subjects. Because the Thermage device noninvasively delivers heat energy, it may be a unique tool for the examination of aseptic thermally induced wound models.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.
