AB  - Objective:? The use of fibrin as an injectable cell carrier to repair osseous defects has been reported with varying degrees of success. This study investigates fibrin formulational dependence on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) proliferation and differentiation. Methods:? 2???104?hMSCs (Bio Whittaker) per fibrin gel were suspended in fibrin formulations with varied fibrinogen (5, 17, 50?mg/ml) and thrombin (250, 167, and 1?U/ml); and cultured in 24-well plates at 37?°C, 5% CO2 for up to 2 weeks. Formulational influences on clot structure were evaluated by confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. hMSC proliferation and morphology were monitored by calcein staining. hMSC-conditioned medium was assayed using zymography (MMP-2, MMP-9), fibrin overlay (uPA), and reverse overlay (PAI-1) to examine the effect of fibrin formulation on protease activity and fibrinolysis. Results/Discussions:? Confocal and electron microscopy revealed formulation dependence on three-dimensional fibrin structure, with lower fibrinogen concentrations yielding more open, homogeneous microstructures. Although hMSCs are viable in all fibrin formulations investigated, proliferation rates varied with fibrinogen concentration, with lower fibrinogen concentrations (i.e., 5?mg/ml) promoting greater hMSC proliferation. Protease levels and activities were sensitive to culture time and fibrin formulation. PAI-1 expression was elevated in hMSCs inside fibrin gels, while uPA activity was low. Both the pro and active form of MMP2 was detected by gelatin zymography, but no MMP9 was detected. This study suggests that fibrinogen:thrombin ratio can significantly influence hMSCs proliferation and interactions, and should be carefully considered when developing formulations for optimal delivery of hMSCs.

AB  - It is expected that by 2030, 20% of the American population will be over 65 years of age. Forty percent of Americans are expected to die in nursing homes in the near future. Pressure ulcer prevalence rates of 13% are reported at long-term care units but healing rates are infrequently published from these settings. Current wound protocols fail to consider patients goals of care. The possibility that a wound will not heal is rarely communicated to the patient or family. Palliative care focuses on the relief of suffering and improvement in the quality of life. It can be the sole focus of care or can be delivered parallel to aggressive curative treatments. This presentation describes a case history of an unfortunate 40-year-old patient suffering from multiple sclerosis who developed a stage 4 pressure ulcer during a pregnancy. Postpartum, the patient underwent flap coverage of the wound. Her MS worsened, the flap broke down and a family conference resulted in the decision to provide palliative wound care and involve hospice. Wound care continued with a silver impregnated absorptive dressings and ultraviolet light therapy to control bioburden, diminish odor and dressing frequency, which improved quality of life. Palliative wound protocols will be reviewed along with details of the above-mentioned case. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Aim:? To determine the viability/effects of incorporating Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT )/V.A.C.? Therapy as an adjunct in the treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum. Material and Methods:? A 74-year-old white female presented with clinical evidence of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). The wound exhibited pathergy and therefore aggressive debridement remained contraindicated. The patient applied topical Elidel cream to the periwound. With meticulous wound management, the lesion remained free of infection. Clinicians utilized various systemic treatment regimes including Minocycline 100?mg twice daily, Dapsone 50?mg daily, Cyclosporine 150?mg twice daily, and ultimately Infliximab 5?mg/kg every 2 months. The latter drug created a significant positive response; however, the wound continued to ?wax and wane.? Researchers began NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy to facilitate granulation tissue, epithelization, and ultimate wound closure. Results:? The researchers observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue with the addition of NPWT/V.A.C.? therapy. Conclusions:? NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy appears to augment healing in a patient with Pyoderma Gangrenosum and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgments:? KCI?, San Antonio, TX

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

AB  - Hypothesis:? The use of Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy will stimulate the development of angiogenesis in the subjacent tissues underlying and surrounding the wound base to a greater degree than can be achieved with standard wound healing efforts. Study Background:? The presence of tissue ischemia and hypoxia due to compromised arterial blood flow is a primary factor compromising wound healing. Wounds that are compromised by impaired angiogenesis will have poor blood supply and are unlikely to progress through the stages of healing in an orderly and timely fashion. The VAC is a subatmospheric pressure system utilizing medical grade polyurethane foam wound dressing that is fitted at the bedside to the appropriate size for each patient?s wound, and then covered with an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. The VAC enhances wound healing by stimulating granulation tissue. The etiology of this granulation is thought to be increased blood flow to the wound base and stimulation of angiogenesis, but the physiologic tissue changes due to VAC therapy that lead to the development of angiogenesis has not been proven or documented. A recent clinical observation demonstrated angiographic evidence of subadjacent angiogenesis in a patient with a wound that was managed successfully with VAC therapy. However, to date no randomized controlled trials have been performed to document wound angiogenesis. We propose that subatmospheric pressure dressings applied to lower extremity ulcers will promote angiogenesis more effectively than moist wound therapy dressings.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars are a resultant of a fibroproliferative disorder observed at the time of the wound healing of large surface, like burns. In normal wound, the process of healing begins with the invasion in the wound of microvascular cells and by the migration of myofibroblasts to form the granulation tissue. There, myofibroblasts play an important role since they synthesize the extracellular matrix and are responsible for the contraction of the wound. At the end of the healing process, the myofibroblasts disappear by apoptosis via unknown stimuli. In the case of hypertrophics scars, there is persistence of a high density of cells and collagen in comparison with normal granulation tissue. Scientists associate this disorder with a problem in the regulation of apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that endothelial cells play an important role in the persistence of myofibroblasts in wound healing. We have compared the apoptotic rates of human myofibroblasts from normal wounds (Wmyo) with those from hypertrophic scars (Hmyo) when exposed with supernatants from microvascular cells isolated from normal skins (CEMV) or hypertrophic scars (CEMVH). The first results showed a significative reduction of apoptosis for Hmyo while Wmyo were not found to respond to the microvascular supernatant. There were, however, no difference in the apoptotic rates of both populations of cells when exposed to CEMV or CEMVH supernatants. These results suggest that endothelial cells secrete one or many factors that inhibit Hmyo apoptosis, thus preventing the disappearance of those cells and inducing the formation of hypertrophic scars. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the formation of hypertrophic scars will open the way to new treatments. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract Bone tissue engineering is extremely promising for regenerating large bone defects in orthopedic or maxillofacial surgery. It consists of harvesting, culturing and differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells in combination with scaffolds. Different cell sources, such as bone marrow or adipose tissue, have been studied. Biomaterials resembling bone extracellular matrix have been used for scaffolding cells. However, these macroporous calcium phosphate ceramics or biodegradable polymers are two dimensional structures at the cellular level and have low osteogenesis properties in vivo. In this paper, several biomimetic approaches involving hydrogels or particles for 3-dimensional (3D) cell cultures are reviewed. High numbers of cells for low amounts of material induced abundant extracellular matrix formation in vitro and relatively large amounts of bone tissue formation in vivo. In addition, the 3D culture of several cell populations should make it easier for bone tissue constructs to vascularize, thus lifting the limits of current clinical applications.
