AB  - Abstract We describe a 62-year-old male patient with an extensively ossified venous malformation within the mylohyoid muscle. Phleboliths and calcifications are characteristic of venous malformations, while massive ossification is rare. To our knowledge, no extensive ossified venous malformation within the mylohyoid muscle has been reported. Intramuscular vascular lesions occur with an incidence of 0.8 in 10, occurring in the head and neck region in 15% of cases. Most are venous malformations. The diagnosis is rarely made before surgery and requires a definitive histological analysis, as there are no pathognomonic clinical or radiographic findings, especially with extensive ossification. Spontaneous regression does not occur, and treatment must be based on aesthetic and functional disturbances. We reviewed the classification of vascular anomalies, focusing on differentiating between venous malformations and haemangiomas, which are frequently confused in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, among which coronary artery diseases (CAD) are the most common type of CVD. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using autologous vein and artery grafts is the typical surgical intervention for CAD patients. However, for patients whose autologous grafts are not available, there are no appropriate substitutes for vascular grafts. Investigation of tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG) has persisted over decades with significant advancement, utilizing different types of biomaterials. In the past two decades, a great number of studies based on cell-seeding strategies were reported. However, limitations of cell-based strategies made clinical application difficult. With the understanding of stem cells and tissue remodeling process, strategies without cell-seeding emerged as potential methods to achieve in situ regeneration. A cell-free graft may recruit host cells and guide their participation in vascular remodeling. The grafts modified by bio-active molecules showed good results in promoting in situ regeneration and exhibited potential to make the vascular grafts off-the-shelf. In this review, the strategies for cell-free TEVG manufacturing were discussed, including the materials for fabricating TEVGs, the methods of functionalization to promote in situ regeneration, the challenges researchers faced in TEVG investigation, and finally the prospects in TEVG design.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The microenvironmental niche plays the key role for maintaining the cell functions. The stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) are important for tooth development and regeneration. However, there is limited knowledge about the key factors in niche for maintaining the function of SCAPs. In this study, we analyse the gene expression profiles between apical papilla tissues, SCAPs and SCAPs cell sheet to identify the key genes in SCAPs niche. Materials and methods Microarray assays and bioinformatic analysis were performed to screen the differential genes between apical papilla tissues and SCAPs, and SCAPs and SCAPs cell sheet. Recombinant human BMP6 protein was used in SCAPs. Then CCK-8 assay, CFSE assay, alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red staining, quantitative calcium analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were performed to investigate the cell proliferation and differentiation potentials of SCAPs. Results Microarray analysis found that 846 genes were up-regulated and 1203 genes were down-regulated in SCAPs compared with apical papilla tissues. While 240 genes were up-regulated and 50 genes were down-regulated in SCAPs compared to in SCAPs cell sheet. Moreover, only 31 gene expressions in apical papilla tissues were recovered in cell sheet compared with SCAPs. Bioinformatic analysis identified that TGF-?, WNT and MAPK signalling pathways may play an important role in SCAPs niche. Based on the analysis, we identified one key growth factor in niche, BMP6, which could enhance the cell proliferation, the osteo/dentinogenic, neurogenic and angiogenic differentiation potentials of SCAPs. Conclusions Our results provided insight into the mechanisms of the microenvironmental niche which regulate the function of SCAPs, and identified the key candidate genes in niche to promote mesenchymal stem cells-mediated dental tissue regeneration.
