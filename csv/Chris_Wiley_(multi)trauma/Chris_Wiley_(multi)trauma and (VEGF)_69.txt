AB  - Abstract Cataract surgery is the most common ophthalmological surgical procedure, and it is predicted that the number of surgeries will increase significantly in the future. However, little is known about the recovery after surgery. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, severity and duration of pain and other ocular discomfort symptoms experienced after cataract surgery. The other objectives were to identify the factors associated with lower postoperative patient satisfaction and to measure the effect of cataract surgery on patients? health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and visual function in everyday life. The study design was a prospective follow-up study. The course of the recovery and the presence of ocular symptoms were evaluated by interviewing the patients via a questionnaire at 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks and one year after surgery The visual functioning in everyday life was measured with Visual Functioning Index VF-7 and Catquest-9SF-questionnaires and furthermore the HRQoL was measured with the 15D-instrument before surgery and at 12 months after surgery. The patients returned the questionnaires by mail and were interviewed in the hospital on the day of the surgery. The same patients filled-in all the questionnaires. The patient reports were used to collect the data on medical history. A total of 303 patients were approached at Kuopio University Hospital in 2010?2011 and of these 196 patients were eligible and willing to participate, with postoperative data being available from 186 (95%) patients. A systematic review article was included in the study procedure and it revealed the wide range in the reported incidence of postoperative ocular pain. Some of the identified randomized controlled studies reported no or only minor pain whereas in some studies significant pain or pain lasting for several weeks has been described in more than 50% of the study patients. In the present study setting, pain was reported by 34% during the first postoperative hours and by approximately 10% of patients during the first six weeks after surgery. During the early recovery in the hospital, only a minority of the patients reporting pain were provided with pain medication. The ocular discomfort symptoms such as itchiness, burning, foreign-body sensation and tearing were common both before (54%) and after surgery (38?52%). These symptoms can also be described as painful symptoms and are often difficult to distinguish from ocular pain. The symptoms are also typical of ocular surface disease, and some patients may benefit from the postoperative administration of tear substitutes. The patients reporting postoperative ocular symptoms were less satisfied with the treatment outcome at 12 months after surgery (p = 0.001) compared to the patients who experienced no symptoms. Those patients reporting less disability in visual functioning before surgery were more satisfied than patients with more reported disability. The HRQoL improved significantly after cataract surgery (p = 0.002). However, when compared to an age-and gender-standardized control population, in cataract subjects the HRQoL remained slightly worse both before and at 12 months after surgery.

AB  - Abstract Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a paracrine-acting epithelial mitogen produced by cells of mesenchymal origin, that plays an important role in protecting and repairing epithelial tissues. Pre-clinical data initially demonstrated that a recombinant truncated KGF (palifermin) could reduce gastrointestinal injury and mortality resulting from a variety of toxic exposures. Furthermore, the use of palifermin in patients with hematological malignancies reduced the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis experienced after intensive chemoradiotherapy. Based upon these findings, as well as the observation that KGF receptors are expressed in many, if not all, epithelial tissues, pre-clinical studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of palifermin in protecting different epithelial tissues from toxic injury in an attempt to model various clinical situations in which it might prove to be of benefit in limiting tissue damage. In this article, we review these studies to provide the pre-clinical background for clinical trials that are described in the accompanying article and the rationale for additional clinical applications of palifermin.

AB  - Part I was an overview of the role and function of proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the pulpo?dentin complex; part II will focus on enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors. This review will discuss current knowledge regarding matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, serum proteins, and growth factors in dentin and the related dentin?pulp complex in an attempt to better understand their nature, role, and function in the dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Dentin formation in physiological and pathological conditions has been widely studied. However, the regulation and involvement of non-collageneous enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors are still not completely elucidated. MMPs, a family of 23 endopeptidases in humans, are collectively capable of degrading virtually all ECM components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases) participate in organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover, and pathological tissue destruction. Similarly, the lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) are capable of degrading ECM proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. These enzymes are implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue re-modeling states. Dentin also contains serum-derived proteins (such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and transferrin), and a variety of growth factors in the mineralized ECM are available for release during demineralization or other injury. A detailed description of the components of the above-mentioned dentin non-collageneous proteins will be summarized in this literature review.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the key inflammatory pathways that are activated in the peripheral and CNS compartments at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Methods A cross-sectional study of patients with clinical and biomarker characteristics consistent with MCI-AD in a discovery cohort, with replication in the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Inflammatory analytes were measured in the CSF and plasma with the same validated multiplex analyte platform in both cohorts and correlated with AD biomarkers (CSF A?42, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) to identify key inflammatory pathway activations. The pathways were additionally validated by evaluating genes related to all analytes in coexpression networks of brain tissue transcriptome from an autopsy confirmed AD cohort to interrogate if the same pathway activations were conserved in the brain tissue gene modules. Results Analytes of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (KEGG ID:4668) in the CSF and plasma best correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau levels, and analytes of the complement and coagulation pathway (KEGG ID:4610) best correlated with CSF A?42 levels. The top inflammatory signaling pathways of significance were conserved in the peripheral and the CNS compartments. They were also confirmed to be enriched in AD brain transcriptome gene clusters. Interpretation A cell-protective rather than a proinflammatory analyte profile predominates in the CSF in relation to neurodegeneration markers among MCI-AD patients. Analytes from the TNF signaling and the complement and coagulation pathways are relevant in evaluating disease severity at the MCI stage of AD.

AB  - Abstract Background Mesotherapy is a procedure that involves the injection of active substances into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in order to treat several local medical and cosmetic conditions. Despite being considered as a relatively safe method, a series of adverse reactions can occur due to its wide application and lack of standardization processes. Objectives The aim of this paper is to summarize all the mesotherapy-related complications published so far, and to provide an insight into their management. Patient/Methods Articles derived from the databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, and published between 1992 and 2018, were analyzed for this review. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results In this literature, there is a number of case series and isolated case reports describing various side effects of different severities. The therapeutic management of these complications is?in most cases?individualized. Conclusions Larger systematic studies are needed in order to adequately evaluate the safety profile of mesotherapy, and in order to determine standardized therapy parameters, so as to minimize the risk of potential adverse reactions.
