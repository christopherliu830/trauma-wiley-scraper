AB  - Background:?? The lower abdominal wall provides ideal autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction. Pedicled TRAM flap is associated with significant flap complication rates and donor site morbidity especially in bilateral reconstruction. Free TRAM flap, muscle sparing free TRAM and DIEP flaps have been used to reduce abdominal wall weakness. Aim:?? To document abdominal wall function following breast reconstruction using pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM, and DIEP flaps. Methods:?? Consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction with pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM or DIEP flaps were culled from our prospective breast reconstruction database 2004?2007. Each reconstructive technique used was favoured exclusively by individual surgeons within our unit. Patient demographics, the type/timing of reconstruction, and flap and donor site complications were recorded. Abdominal wall function was assessed pre-operatively and at 6 and 12?months post-operatively using the Lacote evaluation test. DASH and patient questionnaires were administrated to assess the effect of surgery on daily activities and patient satisfaction. Results:?? s34 pedicled TRAM flaps were performed in 29 (24 unilateral, 5 bilateral) patients. There were 38 muscle sparing free TRAM flaps in 29 (20 unilateral, 9 bilateral) patients and 7 DIEP flaps in 7 patients. Abdominal wall function and complications will be presented.

AB  - Cosmetic tourism has been enjoying unprecedented public attention of late. Enticing New Zealanders with the promise of low cost, overseas travel and the advertised exotic adventure, its popularity grows steadily amongst consumers. We report four cases of complications that had arisen from cosmetic tourism presented to our unit within the last 18?months. With each case presentation, we aim to identify the pitfalls of such practice and thus reasons that lead to these devastating and costly complications for the consumers and health system. Finally, a literature review on the impacts and responses to cosmetic medical tourism from our region and other developed countries including the UK and the US will be presented. In summary, outsourcing health care in our current climate subject our patients to uncertain quality of care, which could seriously threaten their wellbeing. If legislation is to be proposed to limit agents in the advertising and purveyance of medical tourism in New Zealand, it is imperative that accurate account of the adverse events and cost to the taxpayer are recorded. The cost and challenge this global phenomenon poses to our practice warrant prompt study of its extent and impact to the New Zealand plastic surgical community.

AB  - Aim:?? To determine what transmissible resources are available to Plastic Surgery Registrars to provide advice and direction to Surgeons outside of the four New Zealand Regional Burn units needing to perform escharotomies on burn patients. To produce a simple transmissible resource to provide assistance for surgeons performing escharotomies outside of a plastic surgery centre. Methods:?? Regional Burn unit's in New Zealand were contacted via the on call Plastic Surgery registrar and asked to provide advice supported by diagrams in order to safely perform extremity and trunk escharotomy. Review of the available Burn, Plastic Surgery, General Surgery and Emergency Medicine text-books was also undertaken. Results:?? Readily transmissible guidelines are not currently in use and are not available in the majority of plastic surgery or burn text-books. Conclusions:?? Escharotomies will usually be performed in a Burn or Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Centre. At times however, these will need to be performed outside of these centres by Surgeons with little or no experience with the procedure, under the distant guidance of the receiving centre. This can safely be achieved, and with the use of appropriate instructions the comfort and effectiveness with which they are performed can be optimised. A concise single A4 sheet indicating locations, indications and precautions for escharotomy incisions is not currently in use. The adoption of this simple resource would be a valuable supplement to telephone consultation and guidance to safely perform this potentially life and limb saving procedure where delay in transfer necessitates its performance.

AB  - Patients on long-term aspirin and warfarin are not infrequently encountered in local anaesthetic cutaneous surgeries, which could potentially give rise to bleeding related problems post operatively. Encounters with a newer generation of antiplatelets, such as clopidogrel, may also become more prevalent with their use in cardiology and following endovascular procedures. While recommendations from studies in timing or even the need for preoperative discontinuation of aspirin in local anaesthetic procedures have been numerous, they continue to be questioned and the practices can vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon. The study is designed to retrospectively review peri-operative management for aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel in the local anaesthetic cutaneous surgical cases performed at Waikato Hospital Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit, and to gauge their impact on post-operative complications. Case records from the plastic surgery local anaesthetic operating unit and clinics between January and December 2008 are reviewed. Information on the management of long-term aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are gathered along with other significant co-morbidities and coagulopathies, the type of surgical procedure, and significant complications necessitating further interventions in the hospital. We wish to report our experiences in Waikato Hospital on the management of aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel peri-operatively for local anaesthetic cutaneous procedures and their impact on complications with comparisons to findings in the available literatures.

AB  - Introduction:?? The closure of abdominal wall defect after tumour ablation can be a challenging problem. The component that requires reconstruction may only consist of skin or fascia; or it could consist of a combination of these. The pedicled tensor fascia lata flap is a useful option as it could be harvested as either a fascial or fasciocutaneous flap. When the size of the defect is significant, bilateral TFL flaps could be utilised. Methods and Results:?? To illustrate the flexibility provided by the pedicled TFL flap in abdominal wall reconstruction, two cases are presented in which the nature of abdominal wall defect were different. The first patient had a large fascial defect in the lower abdominal wall and bilateral pedicled TFL fascial flaps were used for reconstruction. The second patient had a full thickness defect and the TFL was harvested as a fasciocutaneous flap for reconstruction. Both defects were repaired satisfactorily without herniation. Conclusion:?? TFL is a versatile flap and should be the method of choice for lower abdominal wall reconstruction.

AB  - Purpose:?? To present a review of biofilms and their significance in surgical practice. Aim:?? To better understand the role biofilms play in in-vivo infection, implantable medical device infection and transmission of infections by patient-ready instruments. Methodology:?? A review was of the biofilm literature was conducted using UNSW, USYD and RACS search engines. Studies were examined for a definition of biofilm and approaches to detection and removal. Subjects of particular relevance to surgical practice were considered to be the role of instrument cleaning in biofilm control and biofilm as a risk factor in viral and prion transmission and infection of implantable medical device. The standardisation of hospital cleaning protocols for medical devices is considered for biofilm control. Results:?? From a medical perspective, biofilms may form on living tissues such as wounds, sinuses, native heart valves. Biofilms may also infect implantable and surface medical devices such as indwelling catheters, breast implants, prosthetic joints, as well as central lines and cannulas. Biofilms may also cause inter-patient transmission of infections through inadequate cleaning regimes of endoscopes, nasoscopes, and surgical instruments particularly cannulated and hinged. Currently there are Australian Standards for disinfection and sterilisation, but no Australian Standard for removal of biofilm. Conclusions:?? There needs to be an increased recognition of the role biofilms play in infections. Methods for assessment of biofilm removal need to be developed and adequate cleaning regimes implemented in the health care setting.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study was designed to explore the pathogenesis of psoriasis and to identify potential bio-targets. Genome array technology was used to analyze the gene expression profiles of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin samples and normal skin samples. Methods Gene expression profile GSE14905 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. This included skin biopsy samples from normal healthy donors (n = 21), lesional skin biopsy samples from psoriasis patients (n = 33), and non-lesional skin biopsy samples from psoriasis patients (n = 28). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Limma package in R language. Functions of specific DEGs were predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. A protein?protein interaction network was constructed to display the interactions among common DEGs. Finally, DAVID and WebGestalt were used to achieve a functional analysis of common DEGs. Results Totals of 1020, 562, and 643 genes, respectively, were identified as being differentially expressed in normal versus lesional, normal versus non-lesional, and lesional versus non-lesional samples. The specific DEGs in the three groups were enriched for several GO terms, including mitotic cell cycle, immune response, and response to organic matter. The 40 common DEGs in the three groups may be involved in the defense response pathway in the development of psoriasis. Furthermore, three genes (RGS1, SOCS3, and NAMPT) may play key roles in distinguishing lesional and non-lesional tissues from normal tissues, and 10 genes (PTRRC, ALDH1A3, SAMSA1, C15orf48, ZC3H12A, SOD2, IL8, LTF, RHCG, and IL7R) may play key roles in distinguishing non-lesional from normal and lesional samples. Conclusions These genes may be considered as potential diagnostic markers and targets of therapeutics in psoriasis.

AB  - Sepsis due to Candida is a rare but significant cause of death in burns patients. Indications for prophylaxis against invasive Candida infection are unclear in patients with thermal injury. Consensus statements do not specifically include this cohort. We conducted a ten year review of burns patients to the Victorian Adult Burns Service, to identify the extent and clinical significance of Candida infection in a specialist burns unit. Our aim was to define predictive factors for Candidaemia, in order to guide protocols for prevention and early treatment. Between July 1, 1998 and December 31, 2007, 1933 patients were newly admitted with acute burns; of these 143 patients had Candida or Yeast isolated at any site. The most common species was C.albicans. Twelve patients developed 13 episodes of Candidaemia. Prior colonisation was an important risk factor for Candidaemia, and the risk increased substantially with increased number of colonised sites. Other risk factors for Candidaemia were: higher percent TBSA (total burn surface area); increased number of visits to the operating theatre; colonisation of particular sites and prior treatment with TPN and certain antibiotics. The attributable mortality of Candidaemia was 15% (n = 2). Initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy was often delayed. Our results justify early empirical anti-fungal therapy in septic burns patients who are colonized, before the results of cultures become known. The role of prophylactic antifungals is less clear, but should be strongly considered for high risk patients colonized at multiple sites.

AB  - Purpose:?? To demonstrate the early postoperative outcomes of Spring-assisted cranioplasty in brachycephaly. Spring-Assisted Cranioplasty has become the first-line treatment option for non-syndromic sagittal synostosis in many centres. Although the use of springs has been documented in the management of bicoronal synostosis, the postoperative results have not been measured. Methodology:?? Between July 2008 and December 2008, three patients (2 Apert's, 1 Crouzon's) underwent Spring-assisted cranial vault expansion. A retrospective review of patient's operative time and blood loss, hospital time, changes in cephalic index (CI) and intracranial volume, postoperative results (aesthetic results) and complications was undertaken. Results:?? Six springs were inserted in each case. The average age of the patients was 6?months, operative time averaged 76?minutes, operative blood loss was less than 50?ml, however two of three cases required blood transfusion day 1 postoperatively. Average hospital stay was four days, the preoperative CI was 91%, the 3-month postoperative CI was 95.5%. The change in intracranial volume was 312?ml and 3-month postoperative photographs are demonstrated. Conclusion:?? The Spring-assisted cranioplasty offers an effective treatment of brachycephaly with reduced operative time and comorbidities. It requires less extensive operation compared to the conventional technique of cranial vault expansion. It is useful for brachycephalic patients with high risk of developing increased intracranial pressure.

AB  - Purpose:?? The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) in Northern Queensland. Methodology:?? All histopathology confirming non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) during 2006 that was examined by the pathology department at Cairns Base Hospital and private pathology services were collated to determine the incidence of NMSC in this population. Using this data, information including type of NMSC (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma or intraepidermal carcinoma) sex, age at histological diagnosis and anatomical location were deduced. This information was then used to calculate the incidence of the types of NMSC in North Queensland as well as the age and sex distribution to ascertain those most at risk. Population statistics were provided by the 2006 census. Results:?? The overall incidence of NMSC in Northern Queensland was 1356 per 100?000 people in 2006. Males had a greater incidence of non-melanocytic skin cancer overall. When the data was adjusted into age-standardised populations consistent with the 2006 census data the group found to be most at risk in both sexes were those over 65. The incidence of BCCs in males was 5.1%, SCC 2% and IEC 0.38%. In females the incidence was slightly lower, BCC 2.3%, SCC 1.31% and IEC 0.36%. Conclusion:?? North Queensland, Australia, has a high incidence of NMSC. The group in this study identified most at risk are men greater than 65?years of age. The burden of disease in this instance is not insignificant and further attention must be drawn to the need for greater public awareness on the incidence of skin cancer in this region. NB: Data from one of the private pathology service in QLD is still awaiting inclusion in the paper.
