AB  - A 35?year old man presented to clinic having lost the central two thirds of his left helix and lateral scapha following a human bite. A switch procedure using the root of the opposite helix and adjacent scaphoid cartilage was considered and performed secondarily. The right helix was harvested with a long pedicle length on the superficial temporal (ST) vessels. The vascular pedicle emerged posteriorly from the graft at its transferred site and was tunnelled under the ear to the preauricular ST vessels for anastomosis. Primary donor site defect was closed with a postauricular flap. Postoperatively leech therapy was commenced on day one for a total duration of 4?days. The patient was discharged and followed up in clinic with no complications. Ear reconstruction remains one of the most challenging aspects of reconstructive surgery. Here, we report of a novel alternative ear switch procedure for reconstruction of the helical rim.

AB  - Purpose:?? To review the clinical and histological differences between atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and malignant fibrohistiocytoma (MFH). Methodology:?? Cases of MFH and AFX were identified and histologically reviewed from our non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) database 1996?2007 for the Central Region of New Zealand. Medline search and recent pathology textbooks were reviewed to determine current opinion and evidence for the diagnostic differentiation between AFX and MFH. Results:?? Of the 54,002 cases of NMSC, 103(0.2%) were histologically reported as AFX and 14(0.03%) MFH, with a mean age of 77 (range 51?93) and 74 (28?88) years respectively. The mean size of AFX was 16.3 (5?70) mm occurring on the head & neck (n = 97), limb (n = 3), trunk (n = 2). 15 (14.7%) lesions were incomplete excised. 12 (11.7%) cases developed local recurrence and 1 metastasis. The mean size of MFH was 20.9 (range 7?50) mm occurring on the head & neck (n = 10), trunk (n = 2), groin (n = 1) and limb (n = 1). 3 (21.4%) lesions were incompletely excised. 2(14.3%) patients developed local recurrence and 2 metastases. Local recurrence occurred in 12 (11.7%) cases of AFX and 2 (14.3%) cases of MFH. The literature states clinical and histological differences between AFX and MFH, but no immunohistochemical (IHC) stain reliably differentiates between them. Conclusion:?? Differentiating AFX from MFH based on histology and IHC is difficult and our cases did not conform to the typical presentation indicated in the literature. AFX and MFH are likely to belong to a spectrum of soft tissue sarcomas with variable aggressiveness.

AB  - Purpose:?? To show that ambulatory non-mechanical negative pressure dressing results in equivalent graft take and survival compared with commercially available mechanical vacuum dressings. Methodology:?? Twenty-four patients, both males and female, between 18 and 95?years of age in the Australian population requiring skin grafting of the lower limb from July 2008 were randomized consecutively into commercial vacuum assisted ambulatory dressing group, KCI Freedom VAC, [VAC] and non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing group using 14 gauge drain [Belovac]. Patients were discharged on the same day of surgery and reviewed at 5 or 6?days post-operatively. Both groups were treated equally in all other facets of care. The dressings remained intact until outpatient review. A photo of the graft was taken upon removal of the dressing. Graft take/survival was measured from these photographs by an experienced plastic surgeon blinded to treatment group. Results:?? Graft take was found to be equivalent in both groups. All twelve patients in the VAC group were judged to have >95% graft take at five/six days post-op. In the Belovac group all twelve were judged to have >95% graft take at 5/6?days. The cost for VAC group was $AUD413.50/478.50 [5/6?days] compared to $AUD55.93 for the Belovac dressing group. Conclusion:?? We conclude that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressings are equally effective as commercially available VAC dressings in for the treatment of lower limb skin grafts. We recommend that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing is an acceptable, cheap and safe alternative to commercially available dressings for day surgery patient.

AB  - Purpose:?? The Cook-Swartz Implantable Doppler has been used to provide continuous feedback on the vascular status of free flaps and has been reported to improve flap salvage. We review our experience of this device, its efficacy and suitability for ongoing use in free flap monitoring. Methodology:?? All patients who were monitored following free flap reconstruction using the Cook Swartz Implantable Doppler in two Hospitals in Christchurch, NZ were retrospectively reviewed from its first use in December 2006 to December 2008. Results:?? In total 43 probes were used on 23 flaps (4 buried, 7 intraoral) in 21 patients (range 17?83?yrs). The probes were placed on the artery in all cases and the vein in 21 cases. 21 (91.3%) flaps survived. 20 flaps had reliable Doppler signals. Overall there were 2 flap failures (8.7%) and these were not salvageable. There were no technical difficulties with application or removal of the probes and it was well received by junior medical/nursing staff. It provided peace of mind to surgeons performing free flap surgery outside the base hospital (6 cases). Conclusion:?? The implantable Doppler probe is a useful tool in monitoring free flaps where clinical evaluation is difficult especially when flaps are buried. Our current experience supports its ongoing use as a free flap monitoring tool at our institution.

AB  - Background:?? The lower abdominal wall provides ideal autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction. Pedicled TRAM flap is associated with significant flap complication rates and donor site morbidity especially in bilateral reconstruction. Free TRAM flap, muscle sparing free TRAM and DIEP flaps have been used to reduce abdominal wall weakness. Aim:?? To document abdominal wall function following breast reconstruction using pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM, and DIEP flaps. Methods:?? Consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction with pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM or DIEP flaps were culled from our prospective breast reconstruction database 2004?2007. Each reconstructive technique used was favoured exclusively by individual surgeons within our unit. Patient demographics, the type/timing of reconstruction, and flap and donor site complications were recorded. Abdominal wall function was assessed pre-operatively and at 6 and 12?months post-operatively using the Lacote evaluation test. DASH and patient questionnaires were administrated to assess the effect of surgery on daily activities and patient satisfaction. Results:?? s34 pedicled TRAM flaps were performed in 29 (24 unilateral, 5 bilateral) patients. There were 38 muscle sparing free TRAM flaps in 29 (20 unilateral, 9 bilateral) patients and 7 DIEP flaps in 7 patients. Abdominal wall function and complications will be presented.

AB  - Cosmetic tourism has been enjoying unprecedented public attention of late. Enticing New Zealanders with the promise of low cost, overseas travel and the advertised exotic adventure, its popularity grows steadily amongst consumers. We report four cases of complications that had arisen from cosmetic tourism presented to our unit within the last 18?months. With each case presentation, we aim to identify the pitfalls of such practice and thus reasons that lead to these devastating and costly complications for the consumers and health system. Finally, a literature review on the impacts and responses to cosmetic medical tourism from our region and other developed countries including the UK and the US will be presented. In summary, outsourcing health care in our current climate subject our patients to uncertain quality of care, which could seriously threaten their wellbeing. If legislation is to be proposed to limit agents in the advertising and purveyance of medical tourism in New Zealand, it is imperative that accurate account of the adverse events and cost to the taxpayer are recorded. The cost and challenge this global phenomenon poses to our practice warrant prompt study of its extent and impact to the New Zealand plastic surgical community.

AB  - Aim:?? To determine what transmissible resources are available to Plastic Surgery Registrars to provide advice and direction to Surgeons outside of the four New Zealand Regional Burn units needing to perform escharotomies on burn patients. To produce a simple transmissible resource to provide assistance for surgeons performing escharotomies outside of a plastic surgery centre. Methods:?? Regional Burn unit's in New Zealand were contacted via the on call Plastic Surgery registrar and asked to provide advice supported by diagrams in order to safely perform extremity and trunk escharotomy. Review of the available Burn, Plastic Surgery, General Surgery and Emergency Medicine text-books was also undertaken. Results:?? Readily transmissible guidelines are not currently in use and are not available in the majority of plastic surgery or burn text-books. Conclusions:?? Escharotomies will usually be performed in a Burn or Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Centre. At times however, these will need to be performed outside of these centres by Surgeons with little or no experience with the procedure, under the distant guidance of the receiving centre. This can safely be achieved, and with the use of appropriate instructions the comfort and effectiveness with which they are performed can be optimised. A concise single A4 sheet indicating locations, indications and precautions for escharotomy incisions is not currently in use. The adoption of this simple resource would be a valuable supplement to telephone consultation and guidance to safely perform this potentially life and limb saving procedure where delay in transfer necessitates its performance.

AB  - Patients on long-term aspirin and warfarin are not infrequently encountered in local anaesthetic cutaneous surgeries, which could potentially give rise to bleeding related problems post operatively. Encounters with a newer generation of antiplatelets, such as clopidogrel, may also become more prevalent with their use in cardiology and following endovascular procedures. While recommendations from studies in timing or even the need for preoperative discontinuation of aspirin in local anaesthetic procedures have been numerous, they continue to be questioned and the practices can vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon. The study is designed to retrospectively review peri-operative management for aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel in the local anaesthetic cutaneous surgical cases performed at Waikato Hospital Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit, and to gauge their impact on post-operative complications. Case records from the plastic surgery local anaesthetic operating unit and clinics between January and December 2008 are reviewed. Information on the management of long-term aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are gathered along with other significant co-morbidities and coagulopathies, the type of surgical procedure, and significant complications necessitating further interventions in the hospital. We wish to report our experiences in Waikato Hospital on the management of aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel peri-operatively for local anaesthetic cutaneous procedures and their impact on complications with comparisons to findings in the available literatures.

AB  - Introduction:?? The closure of abdominal wall defect after tumour ablation can be a challenging problem. The component that requires reconstruction may only consist of skin or fascia; or it could consist of a combination of these. The pedicled tensor fascia lata flap is a useful option as it could be harvested as either a fascial or fasciocutaneous flap. When the size of the defect is significant, bilateral TFL flaps could be utilised. Methods and Results:?? To illustrate the flexibility provided by the pedicled TFL flap in abdominal wall reconstruction, two cases are presented in which the nature of abdominal wall defect were different. The first patient had a large fascial defect in the lower abdominal wall and bilateral pedicled TFL fascial flaps were used for reconstruction. The second patient had a full thickness defect and the TFL was harvested as a fasciocutaneous flap for reconstruction. Both defects were repaired satisfactorily without herniation. Conclusion:?? TFL is a versatile flap and should be the method of choice for lower abdominal wall reconstruction.

AB  - Purpose:?? To present a review of biofilms and their significance in surgical practice. Aim:?? To better understand the role biofilms play in in-vivo infection, implantable medical device infection and transmission of infections by patient-ready instruments. Methodology:?? A review was of the biofilm literature was conducted using UNSW, USYD and RACS search engines. Studies were examined for a definition of biofilm and approaches to detection and removal. Subjects of particular relevance to surgical practice were considered to be the role of instrument cleaning in biofilm control and biofilm as a risk factor in viral and prion transmission and infection of implantable medical device. The standardisation of hospital cleaning protocols for medical devices is considered for biofilm control. Results:?? From a medical perspective, biofilms may form on living tissues such as wounds, sinuses, native heart valves. Biofilms may also infect implantable and surface medical devices such as indwelling catheters, breast implants, prosthetic joints, as well as central lines and cannulas. Biofilms may also cause inter-patient transmission of infections through inadequate cleaning regimes of endoscopes, nasoscopes, and surgical instruments particularly cannulated and hinged. Currently there are Australian Standards for disinfection and sterilisation, but no Australian Standard for removal of biofilm. Conclusions:?? There needs to be an increased recognition of the role biofilms play in infections. Methods for assessment of biofilm removal need to be developed and adequate cleaning regimes implemented in the health care setting.

AB  - Perforator flaps such as the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator flap is used increasingly for breast reconstruction. This is often preferred to traditional transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps where sparing of muscle significantly reduces the risk of abdominal wall weakness. Perforators however are often small (diameter of less than 1?mm) and travel substantial longitudinal and transverse distances within the rectus abdominus muscle. Some surgeons therefore, may find the DIEA perforator flap technically more difficult to dissect than the traditional TRAM flap. Pre-operative CT angiography (CTA) plays an integral part in mapping the size and location of these perforators. We describe a simple intra-operative technique, commonly used in plastic and ophthalmic surgery, which is invaluable in assisting the surgeon in the dissection of these perforators. This technique has been performed successfully on over 12 patients in the last 2?years.

AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal and posterior vaginal wall reconstruction following abdominoperineal and local cancer resection requires replacement of dead space and restoration of function. Ideal reconstructive options include those which avoid muscle sacrifice, do not interfere with colostomy formation, and avoid the use of irradiated tissue. Methodology:?? We present our experience with a new technique for perineal and vaginal reconstruction: superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP or IGAP) flaps. We describe the operative technique and outcome in 14 consecutive patients. Six cases were performed as primary reconstruction and 8 cases were delayed, with all receiving preoperative radiotherapy. Results:?? Immediate reconstructions underwent preoperative imaging with ultrasound only, while delayed reconstructions underwent preoperative CTA. Postoperatively, patients were ambulated immediately, with all bed rest and sitting performed on the contralateral buttock or side for 4?weeks. There were no flap failures or partial flap losses, and no postoperative hernias. Four patients developed early minor wound dehiscence that was resutured in three cases. Revisional surgery was performed for reduction of three bulky flaps. All female patients reported resumption of sexual intercourse following this procedure. Conclusion:?? Gluteal artery perforator flaps are good options for perineal reconstruction, avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with rectus abdominis or gluteus maximus muscle harvest.

AB  - There has been anecdotal evidence that patients undergoing abdominoplasty have had improvements in their voiding dysfunction postoperatively. To date, there have been three case reports in which correction of urinary incontinence (UI) following abdominoplasty has been described (Widgerow 1992, Mast 1999 & Guneren 1999). However no study has evaluated the influence of abdominoplasty on voiding dysfunction. This prospective study aimed to confirm the anecdotal reports, objectively substantiate the subjective improvements and attempt to explain why abdominoplasty may result in resolution of UI. Methodology:?? Twenty consecutive abdominoplasty patients were assessed by a standardised questionnaire pre and postoperatively. Pelvic floor measurements (resting tone & maximal strength) were also obtained. Procedures included either radical or sub-umbilical abdominoplasty. Results:?? The study involved 20 patients aged between 25 and 62?years. 14 were found to have stress urinary incontinence. Postoperatively 10 patients described improvement in their symptoms, 3 had no change, whilst 1 patient had worsening of her symptoms. 16 patients were found to have improved pelvic floor strength, 2 remained unchanged and 2 had reduced pelvic floor strength. Conclusion:?? Improvement in UI following abdominoplasty was clearly demonstrated. We suggest that this may be attributable to a better bladder neck and urethral angle position, as well as increased pelvic floor tone secondary to reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. Patients reporting UI should be carefully assessed preoperatively. Aim for the future is to predict who simply requires an abdominoplasty to solve the problem and who requires a combined procedure with a urologist.

AB  - Background:?? While autologous breast reconstruction is frequently sought, donor sites providing versatility in volume with low donor site morbidity other than the abdominal wall are limited. Gluteal artery perforator flaps have been described in this role, however variations in individual vascular anatomy have resulted in the difficult planning of flaps, and particularly selection of whether superior or inferior gluteal artery perforators should be utilized. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a gluteal artery perforator flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging of the gluteal artery vasculature was undertaken with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Both superior and inferior gluteal artery perforators were mapped on imaging, and the dominant system selected preoperatively. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and select the optimal perforators supplying the gluteal integument. Either a superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) or inferior gluteal artery perforator (IGAP) flap was planned, and undertaken successfully in each case. There was a 100% flap survival, with low donor site morbidity. Conclusion:?? With the use of preoperative planning, selection of either an SGAP or IGAP flap can be reliably made based on individual vascular anatomy. With low donor site morbidity and good aesthetic outcomes, gluteal artery perforator flaps are a good option in cases where the abdominal wall is not appropriate.

To (1) assess the accuracy with which acute plastic surgical caseload is predicted; (2) identify key factors which influence operating times; and (3) determine whether services are delivered in a timely manner. Methodology:?? Data was collected prospectively for 200 patients presenting acutely to the Auckland Regional Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery Unit between 26 November and 22 December 2008. Recorded variables included procedure type, predicted and actual theatre time, level of surgeon and anaesthetist experience and triage category. Results:?? Of the 200 patients enrolled in the study, 9 were excluded due to incomplete data. Average time spent in the operating theatre was 81?minutes. This was over-estimated on the pre-operative booking form by 17% (R = 0.65, p < 0.001). The intra-operative time was significantly longer when the procedure was performed by a consultant surgeon compared to a trainee (mean = 115?min versus 76?min, p < 0.001) or when regional anaesthesia was used (median = 116?min versus 72?min, p = 0.02). Intra-operative time was not affected by anaesthetist seniority (p = 0.18). The procedure was correctly identified on the pre-operative booking form in 75% of cases. Only 59% of cases were performed within their allotted triage time. Conclusion:?? Acute Plastic Surgical Services were not delivered in a timely manner for a significant number of patients. This occurred despite a consistent over-estimation of theatre time requirements. Methods for improving service efficiency need to be investigated, with a view to reducing the social and economic cost of delays.

AB  - Purpose:?? Orbital floor blow out fractures can produce diplopia and enophthalmos that require correction by reconstituting the orbital floor defect with implants. The type of implant used has evolved from bone to various synthetic materials. The choice of implant depends upon surgeon, the institution and experience. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the evidence for the implants available for orbital floor reconstitution. Methodology:?? This study is a literature review of the available evidence for use of implants in orbital floor reconstruction. An evidence based medicine, Cochrane database and Medline search was performed specifically at articles dealing with orbital floor fractures and the type of implant used. The outcomes included diplopia, enophthalmos, re-operation, infection and imaging. Results:?? There were a total of 19 articles specifically looking at orbital floor fractures and type of implant. Only two of which were comparative trials comparing bone with biodegradable mesh and titanium (Al-Sukhun and Lindqvist 2006 and Ellis and Tan 2003, respectively). These studies suggested not using bone due to operative duration and bone resorption seen on scanning. The remaining articles were case series on outcomes of specifically used implants such as titanium, bone, silicone, and polyethylene. These articles demonstrated that either of the implants is safe and effective to use in orbital floor fractures with the exception of silicone where Laxenaire et al., (1997) demonstrated a 20% extrusion rate. Conclusions:?? It is safe to use either bone autograft or the various available synthetic materials such as titanium or polyethylene in orbital floor reconstitution.

AB  - Aims:?? The mainstay treatment for problematic proliferating haemangioma is pharmacologic with high dose steroid being the first line treatment. A dramatic response occurs in 30% of cases, equivocal in 40% and continued growth is observed in the remainder cases. Steroid therapy is associated with significant side effects. We report our experience in treating proliferating haemangioma with Propranolol, discovered serendipitously by Léauté-Labràze et al recently. Methodology:?? A 9-week old boy was referred with a steroid-resistant proliferating haemangioma involving the upper lip and nose causing feeding and breathing difficulties. The patient was commenced on Propranolol at 0.5?mg/kg twice daily for 24?hours increasing to 1?mg/kg twice daily. The treatment was administered as an inpatient with 4-hourly heart rate and blood pressure and postprandial (30?minutes) blood glucose level monitoring, for the first 48?hours. The second patient was a 3-month old boy with a similar rapidly proliferating lesion on the upper lip and nose. He was commenced on similar Propranolol regimen. Both patients were maintained on the original total daily dose of Propranolol. Results:?? In both cases rapid reduction of the size and softening of the lesion was noted within 48?hours of treatment with on going accelerated regression observed during the follow-up period of 4 and 2?months respectively. No cardiovascular or metabolic side effects were observed in both patients. Conclusion:?? Accelerated regression is observed in 2 infants with problematic haemangioma following Propranolol therapy with no observed side effect. The possible mechanism of action of beta-blocker on cell proliferation is discussed.
