AB  - Purpose:?? To present a review of biofilms and their significance in surgical practice. Aim:?? To better understand the role biofilms play in in-vivo infection, implantable medical device infection and transmission of infections by patient-ready instruments. Methodology:?? A review was of the biofilm literature was conducted using UNSW, USYD and RACS search engines. Studies were examined for a definition of biofilm and approaches to detection and removal. Subjects of particular relevance to surgical practice were considered to be the role of instrument cleaning in biofilm control and biofilm as a risk factor in viral and prion transmission and infection of implantable medical device. The standardisation of hospital cleaning protocols for medical devices is considered for biofilm control. Results:?? From a medical perspective, biofilms may form on living tissues such as wounds, sinuses, native heart valves. Biofilms may also infect implantable and surface medical devices such as indwelling catheters, breast implants, prosthetic joints, as well as central lines and cannulas. Biofilms may also cause inter-patient transmission of infections through inadequate cleaning regimes of endoscopes, nasoscopes, and surgical instruments particularly cannulated and hinged. Currently there are Australian Standards for disinfection and sterilisation, but no Australian Standard for removal of biofilm. Conclusions:?? There needs to be an increased recognition of the role biofilms play in infections. Methods for assessment of biofilm removal need to be developed and adequate cleaning regimes implemented in the health care setting.

AB  - Aim:?? To identify the experience, expectations and accessibility of breast reduction and otoplasty for current trainees and how this compares to the experiences and expectations of current practising Plastic Surgeons. Methods:?? All New Zealand advanced Plastic Surgery trainees and vocationally registered Plastic Surgeons in New Zealand were emailed or posted a questionnaire regarding their experience performing otoplasty and breast reduction surgery. Trainee questionnaires were repeated at an interval of three years. Participants were asked to quantify the number of procedures trainees should perform to become proficient and their view as to whether conditions exist at present to achieve this. A review of the number of cases performed within the four Plastic Surgery units was also undertaken. Results and Conclusions:?? Training in Plastic Surgery has no quotas for any procedures as exists in other specialty programs. This means that with changes in waiting list pressures and health priorities there is no safeguarding of procedures for trainees or the community alike. The results of these questionnaires will be presented in an attempt to formalise current opinion on these important issues. The Plastic Surgery community has an obligation to provide a service to the community and also to train its future providers and hence has a responsibility to be actively involved in addressing these topical and important issues.

AB  - Background:?? The middle-third of the patellar tendon (PT) is well-established as a potential graft for cruciate ligament reconstruction, but there is little anatomical basis for its use. While studies on PT vascular anatomy have focussed on risk to tendon pedicles from surgical approaches and knee pathophysiology, the significance of its blood supply to grafting has not been adequately explored. This investigation explores both the intrinsic and extrinsic arterial anatomy of the PT, as relevant to the PT graft. Methods:?? Ten fresh cadaveric lower limbs underwent angiographic injection of the common femoral artery with radio-opaque lead oxide. Each tendon was carefully dissected, underwent plain radiography and subsequently schematically reconstructed. Results:?? The PT demonstrated a well-developed, consistent vascularity from three sources: antero-proximally, mainly by the inferior-lateral genicular artery; antero-distally via a choke-anastomotic arch between the anterior tibial recurrent and inferior medial genicular arteries; and posteriorly via the retro-patellar anastomotic arch in Hoffa's fat pad. Two patterns of pedicles formed this arch: inferior-lateral and descending genicular arteries (Type-I); superior-lateral, inferior-lateral and superior-medial genicular arteries (Type-II). Both types supplied the posterior PT, with vessels descending to its middle-third. Conclusion:?? The middle-third PT has a richer intrinsic vascularity, which may enhance its ingrowth as a graft, and supports its conventional use in cruciate ligament reconstruction. The pedicles supplying the PT are endangered during procedures where Hoffa's fat pad is removed including certain techniques of PT harvest and total knee arthroplasty.

AB  - The two World Wars left in their wake a generation of disfigured former soldiers- playing a key role in the evolution of both plastic and maxillofacial surgery during the first half of the 20th century. Sir Henry Simpson Newland and Sir Benjamin Rank are widely considered to be the talented surgeons who helped pioneer plastic and reconstructive surgery to ?combat? the horrifying wounds. Sir Henry Newland was a surgeon in the heroic tradition. As with many other surgeons, his skills were enhanced by World War I during which he did remarkable work in transforming battered faces. He served with the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt, Lemnos, Gallipoli and France, gaining experience of military surgery at Ypres and Passchendaele. He was lieutenant-colonel commanding the Australian section of Queen Mary Hospital, Sidcup, where pioneer work in plastic surgery was carried out. Reconstructive surgery of the skull and the face had its foundations at Sidcup. Sir Benjamin Rank's life was transformed as a young surgeon in uniform during World War 2. He was only 30 when he found himself heading a new maxillofacial and plastic surgery unit established to reconstruct the limbs, faces and bodies of wounded sailors, soldiers and airmen in Egypt. He spent time overseas and then returned to Australia in 1942 to set up the plastic and facio-maxillary unit at Heidelberg Military Hospital in Victoria. He spent much time overseas teaching and demonstrating his skills and was instrumental in the establishment of plastic surgery as a speciality in India for which he received the Commander of St Michael and St George.

AB  - Purpose:?? The nerve to masseter has long been used as a recipient to innervate free muscle flaps for facial nerve reconstruction in adults and children alike. This presentation demonstrates the effectiveness and utility of the masseter nerve to directly re-innervate the native muscles forming a natural smile in an elderly population. Methodology:?? Twelve patients aged 40 to 92?years underwent facial nerve resection for malignant disease. There were 11 immediate and one delayed reconstructions utilising the masseter nerve for reconstruction of the smile. The nerve to masseter was dissected and transposed to achieve a direct neurorrhaphy to the nerve to zygomaticus major without the necessity of a nerve graft. Results:?? The earliest movement of the commissure of the mouth was detected at 10?weeks postoperatively. All patients reviewed at 6?months showed dynamic movement and were graded cosmetically as either good or excellent. Conclusion:?? This is a fast, simple and reliable technique which achieves good cosmetic outcomes for facial reanimation in an elderly population and dispels the myth that dynamic reanimation of the smile is not achievable in patients over 50?years old.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process that involves the mediation of many initiators effective during the healing process such as cytokines, macrophages and fibroblasts. In addition, the defence mechanism of the body undergoes a step-by-step but continuous process known as the wound healing cascade to ensure optimal healing. Thus, when designing a wound healing system or dressing, it is pivotal that key factors such as optimal gaseous exchange, a moist wound environment, prevention of microbial activity and absorption of exudates are considered. A variety of wound dressings are available, however, not all meet the specific requirements of an ideal wound healing system to consider every aspect within the wound healing cascade. Recent research has focussed on the development of smart polymeric materials. Combining biopolymers that are crucial for wound healing may provide opportunities to synthesise matrices that are inductive to cells and that stimulate and trigger target cell responses crucial to the wound healing process. This review therefore outlines the processes involved in skin regeneration, optimal management and care required for wound treatment. It also assimilates, explores and discusses wound healing drug-delivery systems and nanotechnologies utilised for enhanced wound healing applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103:2211?2230, 2014

AB  - Perforator flaps such as the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator flap is used increasingly for breast reconstruction. This is often preferred to traditional transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps where sparing of muscle significantly reduces the risk of abdominal wall weakness. Perforators however are often small (diameter of less than 1?mm) and travel substantial longitudinal and transverse distances within the rectus abdominus muscle. Some surgeons therefore, may find the DIEA perforator flap technically more difficult to dissect than the traditional TRAM flap. Pre-operative CT angiography (CTA) plays an integral part in mapping the size and location of these perforators. We describe a simple intra-operative technique, commonly used in plastic and ophthalmic surgery, which is invaluable in assisting the surgeon in the dissection of these perforators. This technique has been performed successfully on over 12 patients in the last 2?years.

AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal and posterior vaginal wall reconstruction following abdominoperineal and local cancer resection requires replacement of dead space and restoration of function. Ideal reconstructive options include those which avoid muscle sacrifice, do not interfere with colostomy formation, and avoid the use of irradiated tissue. Methodology:?? We present our experience with a new technique for perineal and vaginal reconstruction: superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP or IGAP) flaps. We describe the operative technique and outcome in 14 consecutive patients. Six cases were performed as primary reconstruction and 8 cases were delayed, with all receiving preoperative radiotherapy. Results:?? Immediate reconstructions underwent preoperative imaging with ultrasound only, while delayed reconstructions underwent preoperative CTA. Postoperatively, patients were ambulated immediately, with all bed rest and sitting performed on the contralateral buttock or side for 4?weeks. There were no flap failures or partial flap losses, and no postoperative hernias. Four patients developed early minor wound dehiscence that was resutured in three cases. Revisional surgery was performed for reduction of three bulky flaps. All female patients reported resumption of sexual intercourse following this procedure. Conclusion:?? Gluteal artery perforator flaps are good options for perineal reconstruction, avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with rectus abdominis or gluteus maximus muscle harvest.

AB  - There has been anecdotal evidence that patients undergoing abdominoplasty have had improvements in their voiding dysfunction postoperatively. To date, there have been three case reports in which correction of urinary incontinence (UI) following abdominoplasty has been described (Widgerow 1992, Mast 1999 & Guneren 1999). However no study has evaluated the influence of abdominoplasty on voiding dysfunction. This prospective study aimed to confirm the anecdotal reports, objectively substantiate the subjective improvements and attempt to explain why abdominoplasty may result in resolution of UI. Methodology:?? Twenty consecutive abdominoplasty patients were assessed by a standardised questionnaire pre and postoperatively. Pelvic floor measurements (resting tone & maximal strength) were also obtained. Procedures included either radical or sub-umbilical abdominoplasty. Results:?? The study involved 20 patients aged between 25 and 62?years. 14 were found to have stress urinary incontinence. Postoperatively 10 patients described improvement in their symptoms, 3 had no change, whilst 1 patient had worsening of her symptoms. 16 patients were found to have improved pelvic floor strength, 2 remained unchanged and 2 had reduced pelvic floor strength. Conclusion:?? Improvement in UI following abdominoplasty was clearly demonstrated. We suggest that this may be attributable to a better bladder neck and urethral angle position, as well as increased pelvic floor tone secondary to reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. Patients reporting UI should be carefully assessed preoperatively. Aim for the future is to predict who simply requires an abdominoplasty to solve the problem and who requires a combined procedure with a urologist.

AB  - Background:?? While autologous breast reconstruction is frequently sought, donor sites providing versatility in volume with low donor site morbidity other than the abdominal wall are limited. Gluteal artery perforator flaps have been described in this role, however variations in individual vascular anatomy have resulted in the difficult planning of flaps, and particularly selection of whether superior or inferior gluteal artery perforators should be utilized. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a gluteal artery perforator flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging of the gluteal artery vasculature was undertaken with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Both superior and inferior gluteal artery perforators were mapped on imaging, and the dominant system selected preoperatively. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and select the optimal perforators supplying the gluteal integument. Either a superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) or inferior gluteal artery perforator (IGAP) flap was planned, and undertaken successfully in each case. There was a 100% flap survival, with low donor site morbidity. Conclusion:?? With the use of preoperative planning, selection of either an SGAP or IGAP flap can be reliably made based on individual vascular anatomy. With low donor site morbidity and good aesthetic outcomes, gluteal artery perforator flaps are a good option in cases where the abdominal wall is not appropriate.

AB  - Purpose:?? To (1) assess the accuracy with which acute plastic surgical caseload is predicted; (2) identify key factors which influence operating times; and (3) determine whether services are delivered in a timely manner. Methodology:?? Data was collected prospectively for 200 patients presenting acutely to the Auckland Regional Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery Unit between 26 November and 22 December 2008. Recorded variables included procedure type, predicted and actual theatre time, level of surgeon and anaesthetist experience and triage category. Results:?? Of the 200 patients enrolled in the study, 9 were excluded due to incomplete data. Average time spent in the operating theatre was 81?minutes. This was over-estimated on the pre-operative booking form by 17% (R = 0.65, p < 0.001). The intra-operative time was significantly longer when the procedure was performed by a consultant surgeon compared to a trainee (mean = 115?min versus 76?min, p < 0.001) or when regional anaesthesia was used (median = 116?min versus 72?min, p = 0.02). Intra-operative time was not affected by anaesthetist seniority (p = 0.18). The procedure was correctly identified on the pre-operative booking form in 75% of cases. Only 59% of cases were performed within their allotted triage time. Conclusion:?? Acute Plastic Surgical Services were not delivered in a timely manner for a significant number of patients. This occurred despite a consistent over-estimation of theatre time requirements. Methods for improving service efficiency need to be investigated, with a view to reducing the social and economic cost of delays.
