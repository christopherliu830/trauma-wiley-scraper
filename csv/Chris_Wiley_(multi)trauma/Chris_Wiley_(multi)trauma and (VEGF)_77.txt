AB  - Summary The adrenal glands are chiefly responsible for releasing hormones in response to stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol and catecholamines such as epinephrine, and in response to plasma osmolarity changes through the secretion of aldosterone. The adrenal cortex is divided into functional zones, including zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. The outermost layer, the zona glomerulosa, is the main site for production of mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone, which is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure by affecting the functions of the kidneys. The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing glucocorticoids, chiefly cortisol. Whereas the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II, both the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis are regulated by corticotropin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Both these zones become hypofunctional and atrophic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is deficient; on the other hand, they become hypertrophic and hyperplastic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is secreted in excess.

AB  - Purpose:?? To demonstrate chronological changes of spring expansion in the treatment of scaphocephaly and brachycephaly. Spring-assisted cranioplasty has become the first-line treatment option for patients less than one year-old with scaphocephaly and in some cases with brachycephaly. The speed of spring expansion and its in-situ expansile behaviour has not been previously demonstrated in humans. Methodology:?? From January 2008 to December 2008, five patients underwent spring-assisted Cranioplasty (4 scaphocephaly, 1 brachycephaly). The cephalic index, head circumference was measured chronologically until 3-month postoperatively. Postoperative intracranial volume was calculated in one centre with post-spring removal head CT. Prospective review of patient's operative time and blood loss, hospital time, changes in cephalic index (CI) and intracranial volume. Results:?? The average age of the patients were 5.2?months, operative time was averaged 70?minutes, operative blood loss was less than 50?ml, however three of five cases required blood transfusion day 1 postoperatively. Average hospital stay was 3?days, the preoperative CI was 70% for scaphocephalic patients and 83% for the brachycephalic patient. The 3-month postoperative CI was 76% and 79%, respectively, the changes in intracranial volume was 356?ml. Conclusion:?? 30% of its total expansion occurs during the operation. The remaining spring's expansion capacity takes place in the first postoperative month as the skull lengthening occurs. Spring-assisted cranioplasty is useful in increasing intracranial volume in patients with craniocerebral disproportion and high risk of developing increased intracranial pressure.

AB  - Purpose:?? Currently there are no standards for testing efficacy of medical device cleaners. With fears of prion transmission, reliable protein on medical devices needs to be minimised. Aim:?? To develop a reliable test to detect efficacy of biofilm removal which can be used as an industry standard. Methodology:?? A bioreactor model was used to grow a characterised Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain on Teflon coupons. The coupons were subjected to various cleaners. Residual biofilm was detected by either a crystal violet assay (CV) or protein assay (PA). The % reduction of biofilm was compared to controls including analysis of variance and student t-tests. Each experiment was repeated three times. Inter and intra-experimental comparisons were made. Visual confirmation of the results was by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results:?? NaOH 1% 40C for 30?min: CV 87.3% ± 5.4, PA 92.0% ± 2.3; NaOH 0.01N 70C for 5?min: PA 28.4% ± 2.7; Tween20 40C for 30?min: CV 25.1 ± 2.7, PA 14.5 ± 5.7 (not significant). Some representative commercial cleaners were tested. Matrix: CV 10.5% ± 3.7, PA 27.9% ± 3.0; RMEC 70500: CV 69.0% ± 4.5, PA 85.9% ± 2.9; Zen: PA 105.8% ± 1.5 (i.e. treatment coupons were cleaner than background coupons). All treatments were significant p < 0.05 except for Tween20, which was not consistently significant. There was no significant inter-experimental difference for % reduction. Conclusions:?? We have developed a reproducible method for testing efficacy of cleaning products against biofilm incorporating the use of crystal violet or protein assay to measure residual biofilm protein.

AB  - Background:?? Cadaveric research has widely influenced our understanding of clinical anatomy. However, while many soft-tissue structures remain quiescent after death, other tissues undergo structural and functional changes that may influence their use in predicting living anatomy. In particular, our understanding of vascular anatomy has been based upon cadaveric studies in which vascular tone and flow do not match the living situation. Methods:?? An angiographic analysis of the abdominal wall vasculature was performed using plain-film and computed tomography (CT) angiography in 60 cadaveric and 140 living (70 patients) hemi-abdominal walls The deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) and all of its perforating branches larger than 0.5?mm were analysed for number, calibre and location. Results:?? Both large, named vessels and small calibre vessels show marked differences between living anatomy and cadaveric specimens. The DIEA was of larger diameter (4.2?mm vs. 3.1?mm, p < 0.01) and had more detectable branches in the cadaveric specimens. Perforators were of greater calibre (diameter 1.5?mm vs. 0.8?mm, p < 0.01) and were more plentiful (16 vs. 6, p < 0.01) in cadaveric specimens. However, the location of individual vessels was similar. Conclusions:?? Cadaveric anatomy displays marked differences to in-vivo anatomy, with the absence of living vascular dynamics affecting vessel diameters in cadaveric specimens. Blood vessels are of greater measurable calibre in cadaveric specimens than in the living. Consequently, cadaveric anatomy should be interpreted with consideration of post-mortem changes, while living anatomical studies, particularly with the use of imaging technologies, should be embraced in anatomical research.

AB  - The main indication for free flap reconstruction in the head and neck is malignancy. As the world's population ages, we will be presented with more elderly patients with head and neck cancers requiring free flap reconstruction. However, the older population does have a significantly higher incidence of multisystem disease which can cause some concern when considering a potentially long and complex surgical procedure. Do these co-morbidities translate into actual risk regarding flap success and post-operative mortality? This presentation reviews our ten year experience with microvascular reconstruction in the elderly at Waikato Hospital, New Zealand. A synopsis of key considerations in improving success rates in this type of surgery will also be offered.

AB  - Purpose:?? To compare our Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patients and their respective management with current national and international standards. Methodology:?? Retrospective descriptive audit at Waikato Hospital between the years 2000 and 2008. Patients identified by Hospital's Pathlab database. Data included demographics, speciality involvement, tumour biology, tumour stage, treatment modalities and MDM involvement. All patients placed into the updated Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) staging system for MCC to aid in analysis of management. Results:?? 22 patients identified (?10% of all reported cases in NZ over this period). Majority were head and neck cases (55%) in elderly European patients. Plastic Surgery was the Primary speciality for 58% of cases. MSKCC stages were 27.3% stage 1; 18.2% stage 2; 45.5% stage 3; 9.1% stage 4. Stage I & 2 patients had variable WLE margins (4?mm?50?mm) and only 50% referred for radiotherapy. Stage 3 patients mainly treated with lymph node dissection (70%), radiotherapy (100%), and occasionally chemotherapy (30%). MDM involvement accounted for 54% of Head and Neck MCC cases and 0% for other anatomical locations of MCC. Conclusion:?? Waikato Hospital lacks consistency in management of patients at all stages for MCC. It is crucial to have clear excision margins, advise minimal margins of 11?mm. All stage 2 and 3 patients should be referred for radiotherapy. Multimodality treatment is required in the vast majority of these cases. Hence a multidisciplinary TEAM approach to management is recommended.

AB  - Background:?? Autologous reconstruction with the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator (DIEP) flap is increasingly utilized for breast reconstruction. However, situations arise in which the DIEP flap is not an appropriate option, including the presence of a midline abdominal scar or an inadequate volume of abdominal tissue. While other donor sites may be considered, the stacked DIEP flap, in which the perforators of both hemi-abdominal walls are utilized in a single vascular pedicle, provides a safe technique to utilize the integument of both hemi-abdominal walls. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a stacked DIEP flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the abdominal wall was undertaken, with each DIEA, its branching pattern, and all musculocutaneous perforating branches mapped using three-dimensional software reconstructions. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and guide planning for a stacked DIEP flap. Unique anatomy between individuals required a range of variations in flap anatomy, with the contralateral DIEA, SIEA, or perforators each used to perfuse the contralateral hemi-abdominal wall. There was a 100% flap survival, with no donor site morbidity reported. Conclusion:?? The stacked DIEP flap is a safe and reliable technique for augmenting the perfusion of the abdominal wall in cases where the single pedicle DIEP flap is limited. The anatomical basis of the flap can be planned preoperatively with CTA, facilitating faster operating times and good outcomes.

AB  - Aim:?? To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intralesional and systemic steroid therapy in treating problematic proliferating haemangioma. Methods:?? 233 patients with haemangioma were culled from our vascular anomalies database. Indications for treatment, treatment regime, response, side effects and the need for other treatment were recorded. Intralesional Triamcinolone up to 4?mg/kg/injection was preferred for small, localised lesions and oral Prednisolone 2?2.5?mg/kg/day was used for larger lesions, especially around the periorbital region. The mean follow-up was 29.7?months. Results:?? 46(36%) of the 129 patients with proliferating haemangioma required active treatment with 24 receiving steroid therapy. 5 patients received intralesional steroid with 4 needing 2 injections and 2 requiring other treatment modality. All but 1 lesion underwent accelerated regression with no complications. 19 patients received Prednisolone at a mean age of 10 (range, 4?29) weeks. Dramatic response in 10 (53%), stabilisation in 5 (26%) and continued growth occurred in 4 (21%) patients, 3 of whom required debulking surgery. Rebound growth occurred in 9 patients during dose tapering, requiring reintroduction of high dose steroid in 6. Vision dysfunction resolved completely in all affected patients. 3 patients developed growth retardation during treatment but this normalised 3?10?months following cessation of steroid therapy. No other major complications were noted. Conclusion:?? Intralesional and systemic steroid are relatively safe and effective in treating problematic proliferating haemangioma. Systemic steroid therapy is associated with few short-term side effects, hence a multidisciplinary management is essential.

AB  - Introduction:?? Large defects of the lower trunk after cancer resections pose a challenge for a reconstructive surgeon. Pedicled flaps based on the deep inferior epigastric artery provide a very simple but an effective way to cover them. Methodology:?? 9 patients from 24?58?yrs of age were studied at 2 hospitals over a period of 2?yr (2007&2008). Soft tissue defects after resections of SCCs, melanomas etc ranged from 6 ? 10?cm to 15 ? 28?cm. All were reconstructed with an inferiorly based Rectus abdominus flap. Results:?? Almost all the patients had excellent results with no total flap loss. The average operative time was 2.5?hrs. Had a partial flap loss in one case and the average hospital stay being 7?days. Conclusion:?? The rectus flap with skin is quite reliable and a simple option for such complex defects. It provides enough bulk and skin pliability needed in these areas and are pretty fast to learn and do.

AB  - The deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) provides a dependable option for use as an osteo-musculo-cutaneous flap, particularly in mandibular reconstruction. Modifications to flaps based on DCIA perforators have been sought in order to prevent donor site morbidity as a consequence of muscle cuff harvest. Previous studies have been inconsistent in their descriptions of perforator anatomy, and means of assessing these preoperatively have not been widely described. A clinical anatomical study was undertaken, with a cohort of 44 hemi-abdominal walls in 22 consecutive patients undergoing preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) prior to free flap surgery. The feasibility of CTA and the regional vascular anatomy were both assessed. The use of CTA was shown to demonstrate DCIA perforators with high resolution and to be able to assess vessel size and location. In 44 hemi-abdominal walls, there were 44 perforators of >0.8?mm diameter. There were no suitable perforators in 40% of sides, with 32% of sides having 1 perforator >0.8?mm diameter, 16% having 2 perforators, <10% had 3 perforators, and only 1 side had over 4 perforators. Perforators emerged from the deep fascia on average 5.1?cm cranial and 3.9?cm posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Of 44 perforators identified, 82% of perforators were located within a 4?cm by 4?cm area, 3?cm superior and 2?cm posterior to the ASIS. The current study has demonstrated the utility of preoperative CTA for identifying DCIA perforators, and for selecting patients who may be suitable for a DCIA perforator flap given the variable perforator anatomy.
