AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Regenerative medicine has sparked interest in potential strategies for bone repair. Bone defects are widespread and could be caused by trauma, congenital malformations, infections, and surgery. Although bone has a large self-healing capacity, some defects or fractures are too big to regenerate. To regenerate bone structures which can be used for treatment of patients, bone growth must be induced by a number of bioactive implantable materials, cell types and intracellular, and extracellular molecular signaling pathways. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation during remodeling processes have important roles in bone regeneration, it is believed that understanding molecular signaling pathways involved is crucial to the development of bone implants, bone substitute materials, and cell-based scaffolds for bone regeneration. In this review, we briefly introduce concepts in fracture repair and regeneration following bone injuries, and then discuss the current clinical methods in bone regeneration. In the next section, we review the involvement of the various key signaling pathways in bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Sorafenib is the first multi-kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) and is increasingly being used to treat patients with well-differentiated radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib demonstrates targeted activity on several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of cancer. Sorafenib treatment results in long-term efficacy and low incidence of life-threatening toxicities. Although sorafenib has demonstrated many benefits in patients, the adverse effects cannot be ignored. The most common treatment-related toxicities include diarrhoea, fatigue, hand?foot skin reaction and hypertension. Most of these toxicities are considered mild to moderate and manageable to varying degrees; however, cardiovascular events might lead to death. In this MiniReview, we summarize the adverse effects of sorafenib that commonly occur in patients with advanced cancers.

AB  - Abstract Sealed osteons are unusual variants of secondary osteons that have received little attention, especially in non-human bones. Sealed osteons are characterized by central canals that are plugged with bone tissue. As with other variants of secondary osteons (e.g. drifting, dumbbell, multi-canal), understanding how and why sealed osteons form can shed light on the mechanisms that regulate normal bone remodeling and how this process can be perturbed with aging and some diseases. In a recent microscopic evaluation of human tibiae obtained after traumatic amputations, 4?5% of the osteons were sealed. It is suggested that this high prevalence reflects occasional localized microscopic ischemia from normal osteonal remodeling; hence sealed osteons are implicated in human skeletal fragility. Therefore, osteon prevalence would be expected to correlate with the bone remodeling seen with aging; for example, showing positive relationships between sealed osteons and the population density of typical secondary osteons (OPD). We evaluated the prevalence of partially sealed (80?99% sealed) and fully sealed osteons with respect to age and variations in OPD in 10 adult human femora (34?71 years) and in various non-human appendicular bones of mature animals that were not of advanced age, including deer calcanei, equine radii and equine third metacarpals. An additional sample of 10 bilateral human femora with unilateral non-cemented total hip replacements (F,+HR) and non-implanted contralateral femora (F,?HR) were evaluated (10 patients; 52?94 years). In non-human bones, sealed + partially sealed osteons were rare (~0.1%) even when having relatively high OPD. When considering sealed + partially sealed osteons in femora from patients without any HR, results showed that 1.6% of the osteons were sealed or partially sealed, which was much lower than anticipated, but this is 10- to 20-fold more than in any of the non-human bones. Additionally, in all bones, sealed + partially sealed osteons were significantly smaller than typical secondary osteons (mean diameters: 125 vs. 272 ?m; P < 0.005). In the patients with HR, the percentage of sealed + partially sealed osteons: (i) did not correlate with age, (ii) showed no significant difference between F,?HR and F,+HR (1.9 vs. 2.1%; P = 0.2), and (iii) was positively correlated with OPD (r = 0.67, P = 0.001), which differs from the very weak or lack of correlations in the non-human bones and the other human femur sample. The lack of an age-related relationship, in addition to the very low prevalence of sealed + partially sealed osteons are inconsistent with the idea that they contribute to reduced bone quality seen in aging humans. The small size of sealed and partially sealed osteons, regardless of species affiliation, suggests that they represent closing cones at the termini of some osteons. Available evidence suggests that osteons of primates might have a greater capacity for branching that is associated with closing cones, which might explain the 10?20 times higher prevalence of sealed + partially sealed osteons in the human bones examined in this study.

AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process, which is not yet completely understood. Satellite cells, the skeletal muscle stem cells, become activated after trauma, proliferate, and migrate to the site of injury. Depending on the severity of the myotrauma, activated satellite cells form new multinucleated myofibers or fuse to damaged myofibers. The specific microenvironment of the satellite cells, the niche, controls their behavior. The niche contains several components that maintain satellite cells quiescence until they are activated. In addition, a great diversity of stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-?1 regulate their activity. Donor-derived satellite cells are able to improve muscle regeneration, but their migration through the muscle tissue and across endothelial layers is limited. Less than 1% of their progeny, the myoblasts, survive the first days upon intra-muscular injection. However, a range of other multipotent muscle- and non-muscle-derived stem cells are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. These stem cells can occupy the satellite cell niche and show great potential for the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the niche factors, growth factors, and other stem cells, which are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Knowledge about the factors regulating satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle regeneration can be used to improve the treatment of muscle injuries and diseases. J. Cell.

AB  - Some male seasonal breeders are known to undergo testicular growth and regression throughout the year. The periodic and fast physiological development and regression processes, with simultaneous fast changes in blood flow, appears to be stimulated by angiogenic substances and inhibited by anti-angiogenic factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of season on microvascularization and production of angiogenic factors by testicular tissue, using the male cat as a model. Monthly, testes were collected post mortem from domestic stray cats, for histology and for tissue culture. Testis explants were cultured for 18h and conditioned media were tested for their ability to stimulate mitogenesis of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used as a positive control. Proliferative response of BAEC to samples was evaluated by determining the number of cells in each well using a Neubauer chamber. Vascular density was assessed by a computerized image analysis (?Scion Image, NIH, USA?) based on the total histological area occupied by the vascular lumen. Percentage data subjected to arcsine transformation were analysed by one-way ANOVA and post-comparison tests. There was a significant increase in microvascular areas in November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the remaining months (LSD test). All cat testicular tissue showed the capability to increase BAEC proliferation, when compared to negative controls, throughout the study. However, there was an increase in BAEC mitogenesis in February (P?<?0.05) and November (P?<?0.001), when compared to the other months. Our data show that cat testicular tissue from different periods of the year stimulates angiogenic factor(s). Furthermore, changes in angiogenesis may play a role on vascular growth and regression of the testes during the breeding and non-breeding season in the male cat.

AB  - Summary Many of the topical products noted can be considered ?natural?, such as chitosan, collagen, and alginates. This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Comparative surgical audit is increasingly important, although fraught due to the difficulty of risk adjusted analysis. The surgical risk score was developed to provide surgeon-independent risk-adjusted mortality in general surgery using readily available clinical indices (CEPOD grade of operative urgency, BUPA grade of operative magnitude and ASA grade of patient comorbidities). Methods: Prospective data collection from 4308 patients admitted under the care of three general surgeons (May 1997?October 1999) created an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was scored by summation of linear scales allocated to CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grades to devise a surgical risk scale (SRS) ranging from 3 to 14. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and uni-variate analysis of the SRS scores were undertaken. Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons (November 1999?December 2000). Results: Uni-variate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death (? = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SRS score did not over predict mortality for low risk procedures. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.931 for the initial data set and 0.951 for the validation set. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret. It has been validated as a tool for risk-adjusted comparative audit in a population of general surgical patients.

AB  - Background Anlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit). In the phase III ALTER-0303 trial (Clinical Trial Registry ID: NCT 02388919), anlotinib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had received at least two previous chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase targeted therapy regimens. This study summarized adverse event management in this trial. Methods Patients were randomized (2:1) to anlotinib or placebo up to progression or intolerable toxicity. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and managed by investigators. Key strategies for preventing and managing the most common adverse events included patient education, supportive care, and dose modification. Results Between February 2015 and August 2016, 294 patients received anlotinib. A total of 170 (57.8%) patients received antihypertensive medications for hypertension, 53 (18.0%) patients received levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, 24 (8.2%) patients received fibrates for hypertriglyceridemia, 11 (3.7%) patients took cortisone cream for hand-foot syndrome, and 38 (12.9%) patients received anti-diarrheal medications for diarrhea. Dose reduction and drug discontinuation were required in 24 (8.16%) and 31 (10.54%) patients in the anlotinib group, respectively. Conclusion Anlotinb-related adverse events could be controlled by patient education, prophylactic measures, early and active intervention, and dose modification.

AB  - Abstract Several stem cell-based therapeutic tools are currently being investigated for the regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) injuries. This review focuses on innovative approaches for CNS tissue repair via the use of implantable cellular devices. These devices are supported by biopharmaceuticals and conventional physiotherapy for the restoration of lost neuronal circuits and CNS function. This paper further reviews new and promising tools currently in pre-clinical and clinical tests for the treatment of CNS diseases where substantial loss of cellular and extracellular components of neural tissue has occurred such as stroke, encephalopathy and traumatic neural injuries. We also discuss selected 3D bioscaffolds co-cultured with clinically applicable human mesenchymal stem cells. Recent advances in neural tissue engineering and stem cell differentiation methods have shown promise for their clinical application in treating yet incurable CNS deficits.

AB  - Abstract Ideal material characteristics for tissue engineering or regenerative medicine approaches to volumetric muscle loss (VML) include the ability to deliver cells, growth factors, and molecules that support tissue formation from a system with a tunable degradation profile. Two different types of human hair-derived keratins were tested as options to fulfill these VML design requirements: (1) oxidatively extracted keratin (keratose) characterized by a lack of covalent crosslinking between cysteine residues, and (2) reductively extracted keratin (kerateine) characterized by disulfide crosslinks. Human skeletal muscle myoblasts cultured on coatings of both types of keratin had increased numbers of multinucleated cells compared to collagen or MatrigelTM and adhesion levels greater than collagen. Rheology showed elastic moduli from 102 to 105 Pa and viscous moduli from 101 to 104 Pa depending on gel concentration and keratin type. Kerateine and keratose showed differing rates of degradation due to the presence or absence of disulfide crosslinks, which likely contributed to observed differences in release profiles of several growth factors. In vivo testing in a subcutaneous mouse model showed that keratose hydrogels can be used to deliver mouse muscle progenitor cells and growth factors. Histological assessment showed minimal inflammatory responses and an increase in markers of muscle formation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center's clinical study, using allogeneic CDS are proceeded in 30 hospitals as the Millennium Project of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The clinical trial in our hospital was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of refractory skin ulcers. Methods: The application of CDS on the debrided wound was repeated at an interval of 3 to 5 days. The evaluation was performed according to the protocol, especially focused on granulation tissue formation, wound size reduction, and epithelialization. Results: The clinical trials were conducted in 6 cases, including 5 cases with various complications, i.e., diabetes (2 cases), collagen diseases (1 case), renal failure (1 case), and skin defect after resection of tumor (1 case). According to the comprehensive judgement, 5 cases were evaluated as achieving excellent, and 1 case was evaluated as achieving good. Conclusion: The successful application of CDS is dependent on the control of wound conditions free from infection. Appropriate debridment was necessary prior to application of CDS.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering scaffolds are designed to influence the physical, chemical and biological environment surrounding a cell population. In this review we focus on our own work and introduce a range of strategies and materials used for tissue engineering, including the sources of cells suitable for tissue engineering: embryonic stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we emphasize the developments in custom scaffold design and manufacture, highlighting laser sintering, supercritical carbon dioxide processing, growth factor incorporation and zoning, plasma modification of scaffold surfaces, and novel multi-use temperature-sensitive injectable materials.
