AB  - Summary Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal body movements (chorea) associated with cognitive and motor dysfunctions, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and striatal damage. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) triggers cellular energy deficit, nitric oxide (NO) mechanisms, and oxidative stress (OS)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the activity of mitochondrial complex II enzyme and succinate dehydrogenase in irreversible fashion. Chronic systemic administration of 3-NP to animals produces preferential degeneration of the striatum, leading to motor and cognitive deficits, closely resembling HD. Besides 3-NP model of striatal neurodegeneration, a number of transgenic animal models expressing mutant proteins are routinely used in preclinical trials exploring anti-HD therapeutics. In this review, the roles of a number of plant extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds investigated in various neurotoxic animal models and transgenics are discussed, highlighting on their ability to influence signaling pathways, leading to neuromodulation and probable neuroprotection. Since mitochondrial involvement and OS are also common phenomena in etiopathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), a few plant-based anti-HD natural products have been found efficacious against such diseases. Therapeutic advancement in screening of natural products against HD suffers from constraints such as limited animal models and giving maximum emphasis on cellular models during experimentations. However, recent progress in animal HD transgenic models expressing mutant proteins may reveal the therapeutic efficacy of natural products against HD, a disease with less elucidated pathogenesis and inadequate treatment strategies.

AB  - Summary Bone diseases, and their causes and treatments, are only recently starting to be understood in a modern physiological sense and are often not discussed as such in traditional medicine texts. To use the ethnopharmacological literature to identify useful agents for bone and joint disorders, it is therefore necessary to understand how they are viewed in the context of traditional medicine. Clues to identifying bone active properties may be found by looking at medicinal plants described in the TCM literature as ?nourishing kidney? and in the Ayurvedic literature as ?pacifying the vata dosha?. At present, Asian systems of herbal medicine are more likely to document medicinal plants with anti-osteoporotic effects, but the Western herbal literature contains many phytoestrogenic plants, used to treat menopausal symptoms, which may yield selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) suitable for therapeutic use. However, medicinal plants used to treat gout and related inflammatory conditions are much more common, especially in the western literature. Although most have not been investigated for specific blood uric acid-lowering effects, anti-inflammatory effects are important in treating all bone and joint diseases to relieve pain and swelling, and many more plants than those discussed here are used in this type of disorder.

AB  - Abstract Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been known to play an important role in pathological conditions, specifically in response to inflammation, infection and injury to cells. Recently, several research teams have been interested in investigating its association with cognition during the progression of pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that LCN2 is not correlated with cognitive function under normal physiological conditions, although LCN2 has been negatively associated with cognition and some neuropathologies. Increasing LCN2 production is associated with reduced cognitive performance in a rodent model. However, further studies are needed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms of LCN2 on cognitive dysfunction, as well as its clinical relevance. This review aims to summarise the evidence available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies concerning the possible role of LCN2 on cognitive function following the onset of pathological conditions. Any contradictory evidence is also assessed and presented.
