AB  - Abstract Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are soluble proteins produced by leukocytes and other cell types, which act as chemical communicators between cells and tissues within the body. These proteins mediate a number of functions, ranging from effects on cell growth, differentiation, survival, and a number of effector activities. The main purpose of this unit is to provide an easy-to-use reference summarizing some of the current information on well-established cytokine, growth factore, and chemokine ligands. The information provided is confined largely to alternative names, protein properties, genetic chracteristics, chromosomal localization, cellular expression patters, cellular-tissue targets, stimuli regulating expression, functional properties, expression analysis, and clinical utility.

AB  - Hypoxia is a normal and essential part of embryonic development. However, this state may leave the embryo vulnerable to damage when oxygen supply is disturbed. Embryofetal response to hypoxia is dependent on duration and depth of hypoxia, as well as developmental stage. Early postimplantation rat embryos were resilient to hypoxia, with many surviving up to 1.5 hr of uterine clamping, while most mid-gestation embryos were dead after 1 hour of clamping. Survivors were small and many had a range of defects, principally terminal transverse limb reduction defects. Similar patterns of malformations occurred when embryonic hypoxia was induced by maternal hypoxia, interruption of uteroplacental flow, or perfusion and embryonic bradycardia. There is good evidence that high altitude pregnancies are associated with smaller babies and increased risk of some malformations, but these results are complicated by increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Early onset pre-eclampsia itself is associated with small for dates and increased risk of atrio-ventricular septal defects. Limb defects have clearly been associated with chorionic villus sampling, cocaine, and misoprostol use. Similar defects are also observed with increased frequency among fetuses who are homozygous for thalassemia. Drugs that block the potassium current, whether as the prime site of action or as a side effect, are highly teratogenic in experimental animals. They induce embryonic bradycardia, hypoxia, hemorrhage, and blisters, leading to transverse limb defects as well as craniofacial and cardiovascular defects. While evidence linking these drugs to birth defects in humans is not compelling, the reason may methodological rather than biological.

AB  - Abstract The inherent plasticity and resiliency of fibroblasts make this cell type a conventional tool for basic research. But where do they come from, are all fibroblasts the same, and how do they function in disease? The first fibroblast lineages in mammalian development emerge from the ooze of primary mesenchyme during gastrulation. They are cells that efficiently create and negotiate the extracellular matrix of the mesoderm in order to migrate and meet their developmental fate. Mature fibroblasts in epithelial tissues live in the interstitial spaces between basement membranes that spatially delimit complex organ structures. While the function of resident fibroblasts in healthy tissues is largely conjecture, the accumulation of fibroblasts in pathologic lesions offers insight into biologic mechanisms that control their function; fibroblasts are poised to coordinate fibrogenesis in tissue injury, neoplasia, and aging. Here, we examine the developmental origin and plasticity of fibroblasts, their molecular and functional definitions, the epigenetic control underlying their identity and activation, and the evolution of their immune regulatory functions. These topics are reviewed through the lens of fate mapping using genetically engineered mouse models and from the perspective of single-cell RNA sequencing. Recent observations suggest dynamic and heterogeneous functions for fibroblasts that underscore their complex molecular signatures and utility in injured tissues.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors??? Lyngstadaas SP, Wohlfahrt JC, Brookes SJ, Paine ML, Snead ML, Reseland JE Emdogain? (enamel matrix derivative, EMD) is well recognized in periodontology, where it is used as a local adjunct to periodontal surgery to stimulate regeneration of periodontal tissues lost to periodontal disease. The biological effect of EMD is through stimulation of local growth factor secretion and cytokine expression in the treated tissues, inducing a regenerative process that mimics odontogenesis. The major (>95%) component of EMD is Amelogenins (Amel). No other active components have so far been isolated from EMD, and several studies have shown that purified amelogenins can induce the same effect as the complete EMD. Amelogenins comprise a family of highly conserved extracellular matrix proteins derived from one gene. Amelogenin structure and function is evolutionary well conserved, suggesting a profound role in biomineralization and hard tissue formation. A special feature of amelogenins is that under physiological conditions the proteins self-assembles into nanospheres that constitute an extracellular matrix. In the body, this matrix is slowly digested by specific extracellular proteolytic enzymes (matrix metalloproteinase) in a controlled process, releasing bioactive peptides to the surrounding tissues for weeks after application. Based on clinical and experimental observations in periodontology indicating that amelogenins can have a significant positive influence on wound healing, bone formation and root resorption, several new applications for amelogenins have been suggested. New experiments now confirm that amelogenins have potential for being used also in the fields of endodontics, bone regeneration, implantology, traumatology, and wound care.

AB  - Summary: The complement system has once again come into prominence in the therapeutic development arena. The recent approval of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, eculizumab, which is directed against complement component C5 for the disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has provided the initial validation of this system as a therapeutic target. Preclinical studies using animal models and human-derived samples demonstrate that inhibition of complement ameliorates many inflammatory and autoimmune disease manifestations. Major efforts continue to define the most optimal means to block complement activation in a cost-effective manner. Because the system is initiated through three pathways and generates at least six immunoregulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators, there is substantial complexity to this problem. One pathway, designated the alternative pathway, has recently been shown to play a particularly important role in preclinical disease models. Further evidence of the importance of the alternative pathway has been provided by studies of human diseases, where mutations or dysfunctional polymorphisms that promote activation of this pathway are highly associated with the diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, dense deposit disease, and age-related macular degeneration. This article reviews evidence in support of the essential role of the alternative pathway in the generation of tissue injury and the rationale for development of therapies that modulate its activity.

AB  - Aggrecan is a high molecular weight proteoglycan that plays a critical role in cartilage structure and the function of joints, providing intervertebral disc and cartilage with the ability to resist compressive loads. Aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage is a significant event in early-stage osteoarthritis (OA). Currently, no effective treatment exists for OA other than pain relief. Dextrose (D-glucose) prolotherapy has shown promising activity in the treatment of different musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the glucose effect in OA and on the regulation of chondrogenesis. We show for the first time that glucose upregulates aggrecan expression and subsequent chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. Moreover, we found that glucose-induced aggrecan expression is mediated through the protein kinase Cα (PKCα)- and p38-dependent pathway. As demonstrated by microRNA (miR) and luciferase analyses, the glucose-induced PKCα/p38 signaling axis is responsible for downregulating miR141-3p which targets to the 3?untranslated region of aggrecan. In summary, we show that glucose enhances chondrogenesis by upregulating aggrecan expression via the PKCα-p38-miR141-3p signaling pathway. This result provides new insights into the mechanism of glucose on chondrogenesis.
