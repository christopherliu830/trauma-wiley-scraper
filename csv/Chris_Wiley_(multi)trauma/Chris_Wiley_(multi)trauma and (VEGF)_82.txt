Conclusion and future directions Abstract Since the first cell therapeutic study to repair articular cartilage defects in the knee in 1994, several clinical studies have been reported. An overview of the results of clinical studies did not conclusively show improvement over conventional methods, mainly because few studies reach level I of evidence for effects on middle or long term. However, these explorative trials have provided valuable information about study design, mechanisms of repair and clinical outcome and have revealed that much is still unknown and further improvements are required. Furthermore, cellular and molecular studies using new technologies such as cell tracking, gene arrays and proteomics have provided more insight in the cell biology and mechanisms of joint surface regeneration. Besides articular cartilage, cartilage of other anatomical locations as well as progenitor cells are now considered as alternative cell sources. Growth Factor research has revealed some information on optimal conditions to support cartilage repair. Thus, there is hope for improvement. In order to obtain more robust and reproducible results, more detailed information is needed on many aspects including the fate of the cells, choice of cell type and culture parameters. As for the clinical aspects, it becomes clear that careful selection of patient groups is an important input parameter that should be optimized for each application. In addition, the study outcome parameters should be improved. Although reduced pain and improved function are, from the patient's perspective, the most important outcomes, there is a need for more structure/tissue-related outcome measures. Ideally, criteria and/or markers to identify patients at risk and responders to treatment are the ultimate goal for these more sophisticated regenerative approaches in joint surface repair in particular, and regenerative medicine in general.

AB  - Aggrecan is a high molecular weight proteoglycan that plays a critical role in cartilage structure and the function of joints, providing intervertebral disc and cartilage with the ability to resist compressive loads. Aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage is a significant event in early-stage osteoarthritis (OA). Currently, no effective treatment exists for OA other than pain relief. Dextrose (D-glucose) prolotherapy has shown promising activity in the treatment of different musculoskeletal disorders, including OA. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the glucose effect in OA and on the regulation of chondrogenesis. We show for the first time that glucose upregulates aggrecan expression and subsequent chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. Moreover, we found that glucose-induced aggrecan expression is mediated through the protein kinase Cα (PKCα)- and p38-dependent pathway. As demonstrated by microRNA (miR) and luciferase analyses, the glucose-induced PKCα/p38 signaling axis is responsible for downregulating miR141-3p which targets to the 3?untranslated region of aggrecan. In summary, we show that glucose enhances chondrogenesis by upregulating aggrecan expression via the PKCα-p38-miR141-3p signaling pathway. This result provides new insights into the mechanism of glucose on chondrogenesis.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 212?219 For many years, the focus of attention in the study of semen has been on spermatozoa, its major cellular component, given their importance in the process of reproduction, and the role of the seminal fluid as their transport medium. More recently, evidence has accumulated of the complexity of seminal fluid, its components that perturb the female reproductive tract in ways promoting both survival of spermatozoa there-in and facilitating the implantation of embryos within the endometrium, hence initiating pregnancy. These same factors, however, may also make the female reproductive tract susceptible to invasion not only by spermatozoa but viruses, playing a significant role in the male-to-female transmission of HIV. Knowledge of the histology, anatomy, and immunology of the male reproductive tract is essential in understanding its role in HIV pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering is rapidly progressing from a research-based discipline to clinical applications. Emerging technologies could be utilized to develop therapeutics for a wide range of diseases, but many are contingent on a cell scaffold that can produce proper tissue ultrastructure. The extracellular matrix, which a cell scaffold simulates, is not merely a foundation for tissue growth but a dynamic participant in cellular crosstalk and organ homeostasis. Cells change their growth rates, recruitment, and differentiation in response to the composition, modulus, and patterning of the substrate on which they reside. Cell scaffolds can regulate these factors through precision design, functionalization, and application. The ideal therapy would utilize highly specialized cell scaffolds to best mimic the tissue of interest. This paper discusses advantages and challenges of optimized cell scaffold design in the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm for clinical applications in tracheal transplant, cardiac regeneration, and skin grafts, respectively.

AB  - Summary Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that is induced in response to cellular stress and stabilizes client proteins involved in cell cycle control and proliferative/anti-apoptotic signalling. HSP90 is overexpressed in a range of cancers, and may contribute to tumour cell survival by stabilizing aberrant signalling proteins and by interfering with apoptosis. Tanespimycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, reduces tumour cell survival in vitro. In multiple myeloma (MM), HSP90 inhibition affects multiple client proteins that contribute to tumour cell survival, including the IGF1 receptor and the IL-6 receptor, and elements of the PI3/Akt, STAT3, and MAPK signalling pathways. HSP90 inhibition also abrogates the protective effect of bone marrow stromal cells and inhibits angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Tanespimycin acts synergistically with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in MM cells and tumour explants, possibly reducing their ability to resist bortezomib-induced stress to the endoplasmic reticulum. The combination of tanespimycin and bortezomib has demonstrated significant and durable responses with acceptable toxicity in a phase I/II study in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory MM. HSP90 inhibition is a promising strategy in MM especially in combination with bortezomib; additional studies will further evaluate optimal dosings of candidate drugs and schedules, as well as confirm efficacy in comparative phase III trials.

AB  - Summary The close relationship between malignancy and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is well established, with malignancy increasing VTE risk and accounting for a substantial proportion of presentations with VTE. Moreover, VTE impacts significantly on morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Anticoagulation for prevention and treatment of VTE requires a patient-centred approach due to the heterogeneous patient population and inherent increased thrombotic and bleeding risks. In recent years, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injections have come to be the mainstay for treatment and prevention of cancer-related VTE. For treatment, this is usually administered for at least 6 months and continued in patients with active cancer or those receiving treatment for cancer. The use of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised cancer patients is also well accepted, but out-of-hospital prophylaxis remains contentious. The development of risk assessment models may help identify the patients at highest risk. The role of the new oral factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors in this setting remains to be determined.
