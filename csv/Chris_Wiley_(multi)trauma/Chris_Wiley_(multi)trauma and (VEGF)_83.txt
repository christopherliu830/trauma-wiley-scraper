AB  - Abstract Objective: To investigate the response of subcutaneous tissue oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) tensions to hyperbaric oxygenation. Design: Experimental study. Setting: University hospital, Finland. Subjects: 10 Wistar rats. Intervention: Subcutaneous tissue PO2 and PCO2 were directly measured with an implanted Silastic tube tonometer and capillary sampling technique while breathing air and exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) at 2.5 or 2.8 ATA pressure. Hyperbaric exposures were carried out in a large multiplace chamber pressurised with air. Main outcome measures: Subcutaneous tissue PO2 and PCO2. Results: The mean subcutaneous PO2 rose from the baseline of 8 kPa (60 mmHg) to 16 kPa (112 mmHg) when rats breathed room air during pressurisation to 2.8 atm. When the rats breathed oxygen at 2.5 ATA the maximal mean tissue PO2 was four times higher than the mean starting value. During the HBO treatment at 2.8 ATA the tissue PO2 rose to a value about five times above baseline. The tissue PCO2 values almost doubled during the exposure to HBO at 2.5 ATA, probably because elimination of carbon dioxide was impaired. Conclusion: Measurements of tissue PO2 and PCO2 with an implanted Silastic tonometer and a capillary sampling technique can successfully be adapted to hyperbaric conditions. The method yielded reproducible results and is applicable to clinical use in hyperbaric medicine. Copyright ? 1999 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this article is to review the process of permanent tooth eruption and primary tooth resorption in the context of the major theories of tooth eruption. This review will also focus on diagnostic criteria including radiographic, clinical, and genetic analysis to help distinguish between eruption anomalies such as isolated ankylosis of primary or permanent teeth versus eruption failure. Our studies of eruption failure have revealed that a much greater number of cases than previously suspected account for a hereditary form of eruption failure versus an isolated ankylosis. The importance of distinguishing eruption failure from isolated ankylosis (in primary and especially permanent teeth) is that the resultant management and prognosis differs greatly between the two. Management of isolated ankylosis is definitively treated by extraction of the offending tooth while eruption failure from a genetic defect may result in no treatment at all or multiple single tooth osteotomies. A complete understanding of the clinical presentation and biological mechanisms underlying eruption and eruption disorders will facilitate the best diagnosis and patient management of difficult clinical cases.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of 3D bioprinting technology is to design and create functional 3D tissues or organs in situ for in vivo applications. 3D cell-printing, or additive biomanufacturing, allows the selection of biomaterials and cells (bioink), and the fabrication of cell-laden structures in high resolution. 3D cell-printed structures have also been used for applications such as research models, drug delivery and discovery, and toxicology. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to fabricate tissues and organs by using various 3D printing techniques. However, challenges such as vascularization are yet to be solved. This article reviews the most commonly used 3D cell-printing techniques with their advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, up-to-date achievements of 3D bioprinting in in vivo applications are introduced, and prospects for the future of 3D cell-printing technology are discussed. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that is induced in response to cellular stress and stabilizes client proteins involved in cell cycle control and proliferative/anti-apoptotic signalling. HSP90 is overexpressed in a range of cancers, and may contribute to tumour cell survival by stabilizing aberrant signalling proteins and by interfering with apoptosis. Tanespimycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, reduces tumour cell survival in vitro. In multiple myeloma (MM), HSP90 inhibition affects multiple client proteins that contribute to tumour cell survival, including the IGF1 receptor and the IL-6 receptor, and elements of the PI3/Akt, STAT3, and MAPK signalling pathways. HSP90 inhibition also abrogates the protective effect of bone marrow stromal cells and inhibits angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Tanespimycin acts synergistically with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in MM cells and tumour explants, possibly reducing their ability to resist bortezomib-induced stress to the endoplasmic reticulum. The combination of tanespimycin and bortezomib has demonstrated significant and durable responses with acceptable toxicity in a phase I/II study in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory MM. HSP90 inhibition is a promising strategy in MM especially in combination with bortezomib; additional studies will further evaluate optimal dosings of candidate drugs and schedules, as well as confirm efficacy in comparative phase III trials.

AB  - A severe sensory neuropathy, mostly involving large myelinated sensory fibers, characterizes Friedreich ataxia since the early onset. Recently, an involvement of unmyelinated nerve fibers has been observed studying cutaneous innervation by means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. Quantification of epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs) by skin biopsy has been extensively used in the last decade to evaluate small-fiber neuropathies. This minimally invasive procedure, repeatable over time, allows to monitor a neuropathic process. An even less invasive technique is the biopsy of the only epidermis, obtained removing the roof of suction skin blister, sparing basal membrane and vessels. Skin blister, beside a diagnostic tool in sensory neuropathies, is a wound model to study nerve regeneration in human epidermis. The aim of our research was to define the regenerative capability of cutaneous nerve fibers in patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia evaluating time-course and patterns of nerve fibers regeneration. Six patients (4F, 2M, age 19?34) affected by genetically determined Friedreich ataxia were included in our study. In each subject we induced 5 couples of 2?mm blisters on the forearm. At different time points (1?2?3?4 weeks after blister induction) one blister was removed by 3?mm punch skin biopsy and one was reblistered (3-mm blister) and the roof removed. The larger size of these biopsies and blisters allowed at including normal skin immediately adjacent to the blister wound. Epidermal nerve fibers were visualised using antibodies to the pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) on frozen sections from skin biopsies and on the whole blister roofs. Quantification of ENFs was performed on skin sections using digitised images acquired by confocal microscopy (CARV) and Neurolucida software. Blister allowed to have a panoramic and global view of the regenerative process especially of the collateral extension of axons from adjacent normal epidermis, while biopsy allowed to observe the sprouting from the subepidermal neural plexus. Both these phenomena resulted markedly evident in all FA subjects indicating a normal capability of nerve fibers to regenerate. Blister wound probably induces the release of nerve growth factors stimulating nerve regeneration as in normal subjects. At least for the short period of observation (four weeks) nerve fibers maintained this capability challenging the noxa patogena that leads to their loss.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetic neuropathy characterized by a length-dependent degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers. Whereas all authors agree that weakening starts from the intrinsic foot muscles, there is still controversy whether the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) is weak or not in the early stages of the disease. To know this could be important either to understand how the cavus deformity develops or, consequently, to adopt surgical (tendon transfers) and conservative (orthotics, physiotherapy) strategies for prevention or early correction. We measured the power of TA in 110 feet of 62 patients (41 CMT1A, 1 CMT1B, 9 CMT1 without genetic evaluation, 5 CMTX, and 6 CMT2) fitting in the first two stages of the functional classification proposed by Vinci and Perelli. Thirty-one feet were at stage 1 (forefootdrop or mild footdrop: leg-sole angle?>90<?=?100) and 79 at stage 2 (same as stage 1 plus foot rotation on the longitudinal axis: heel angle <0 or >10). Muscle strength was measured by the manual muscle testing and scores according to the Medical Research Council scale. TA power graded 5/5 in 87 (79.1%) feet, 4/5 in 17 (15.5%) and 2/5 in 6 (5.4%). TA was strong (MRC 4/5 and 5/5) in the large majority (94.6%) of the feet in the two earlier stages of the disease. Interestingly, the 6 patients with weaker TA had CMT2. These results support our hypothesis that, in the earliest phase of CMT, foot rotation is due to a stronger and hyperactivated TA, which compensates the footdrop caused by the deficit of the metatarsophalangeal joint stabilization and, in many cases, is not balanced by the weak peroneal muscles.

AB  - Manente and coll. have recently developed an innovative soft hand brace called Manu for conservative treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS); a randomised controlled study showed that this hand brace, if worn at night for one month, is highly efficient in relieving symptoms and functional loss in CTS patients. This study aims at evaluating, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the changes of carpal tunnel in CTS patients and controls wearing Manu, the innovative soft hand brace for CTS. Thirteen subjects (9 with CTS and 4 controls) were enrolled in the study. T1 and STIR sequences were performed using a 0.2 T E-Scan. Some morphologic parameters (tunnel diameters and area, carpus length and nerve signal intensity) were measured at three different scanning levels. Evaluation was carried out before and after the application of the brace. Remarkable differences were recorded in the measurements performed before and after the application of the brace, particularly in the constant increase of front-rear diameter and tunnel shape rounding. These data could explain the lighter symptoms after using the brace. The Manu hand brace increased the carpal tunnel front-rear diameter rounding the tunnel shape, hence the clinical efficacy in CTS.

AB  - Transthyretin-derived familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is the most common form of hereditary amyloidosis, often associated with multisystemic involvement and a poor prognosis. We studied four patients, aged between 43 and 68?yrs, with TTR-FAP. A severe somatic and autonomic polyneuropathy was seen in three patients, whereas one was at onset of the disease. In addition 2/4, aged 43 and 63 years old, had a mild central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Neurophysiological studies showed an axonal polyneuropathy and amyloid deposits were found in all sural nerve biopsies. Combined conventional MRI and proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) were performed in our patients and in 14 age-matched normal controls. Conventional MRI was normal in two patients and showed minimal white matter and subcortical lesions in the other two, who were 63 and 68 years old. Proton MRSI of the periventricular brain regions showed a large reduction in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) resonance intensity (mean NAA/Cr in patients: 2.45?±?0.04; mean NAA/Cr in normal controls: 2.9?±?0.1; p?<?0.003). Our findings suggest that, despite minimal or no abnormalities on conventional MRI, evidence of diffuse axonal damage can be demonstrated in brain of patients with TTR-FAP by proton MRSI examination, even in patients with no or mild CNS involvement.

AB  - In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection there is high prevalence of numerous extrahepatic manifestations. Peripheral neuropathy (PN), in the form of symmetric polyneuropathy, asymmetric polyneuropathy, and multineuropathy, may be associated also with HCV infection and is usually related to mixed cryoglobulinemia (CG). However, some HCV+ patients with PN without CG were recently reported, suggesting a possible direct role of HCV in the pathogenesis of PN. From January 2000 to December 2002 we studied 50 HCV+ patients: 21 with symptomatic CG and 29 with chronic HCV without symptomatic CG (23 without CG, 5 with asymptomatic CG). Particular care was taken to exclude other possible causes of PN. Patients without symptomatic CG were examined before starting combined therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin, if needed. Fifteen patients with symptomatic CG had axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, 6 axonal sensorimotor multineuropathy or asymmetric polyneuropathy. Six HCV+ patients had other causes of PN (1 CIDP, 2 diabetes, 1 CIDP and diabetes, 1 alcoholism, 1 paraneoplastic with anti-Hu antibodies). No HCV+ patients without (symptomatic) CG or other possible causes of PN showed clinical and electrophysiological evidence of PN. Our study casts doubts on the existence of a PN directly caused by HCV and suggests that finding a PN in a HCV+ patient without CG should prompt to search for a different cause of PN.

AB  - We describe a 75-year-old woman affected by ichthyosis since childhood who developed bilateral lower limb distal muscle weakness resulting in foot deformities and gait disturbances during the last decade. Neurological examination showed equinovarus deformity with pied en griffe, distal motor and sensory impairment and areflexia at lower limbs. On upper limbs mild distal motor impairment and atrophy were present. EMG study revealed an axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe, predominantly axonal, neuropathy with many clusters of small myelinated fibers and some degree of chronic demyelination with small onion bulbs. Both her sister and the mother have a clinically similar peripheral neuropathy, but in the absence of ichtyosis. Familial history, prevalent motor lower limbs involvement, middle life onset with slow evolution, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT 2). Nevertheless, biochemistry and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were performed to rule out known causes of axonal peripheral neuropathy. Ichthyosis has been reported to be associated with some neurological disorders characterized by the presence of peripheral neuropathy such as Krabbe leucodystrophy, Refsum disease, and Rud syndrome. To our knowledge no association has been described between CMT2 and ichthyosis. We believe interesting to point out the presence in our family of CMT2 and ichthyosis. Further studies are ongoing to better elucidate this association.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman was referred because of bilateral foot drop, pes cavus and distal muscular atrophy. Electrophysiological studies showed prolonged distal motor latencies and conduction velocities ranging from 33 to 42?m/s in upper limb nerves. A conduction block (P/D area?=?0.4) was present in the wrist elbow segment of median nerve. Her 42-year-old daughter was asymptomatic and neurological examination revealed only absent deep tendon reflex. The 35-year-old son complained of positional paresthesias and had normal examination. The 13-year-old nephew was completely normal. There was no history of pressure palsies. All three proband's relatives showed: 1) normal or slightly slowed motor conduction velocities; 2) slowing of conductions in the above-below elbow segment of both ulnar nerves (difference of velocity with the below elbow-wrist segment ranging from 16 to 25?m/s). Sural nerve biopsy in the proband showed at light microscopy a chronic demyelinating and remyelinating process. On teased-fiber examination virtually all fibers showed myelin thickenings or classical tomacula. Molecular analysis showed neither deletion of the 17p11.2 segment nor mutation of the PMP 22 gene. The sequence of MPZ/PO revealed a 306delA at codon 102 in the proband and three relatives. The mutation was of non-sense type and causes a frameshift with a premature stop codon (Val102fs). Motor conduction velocities in CMT1B are usually <?20?m/s although a predominantly axonal variant with intermediate range conduction velocities has been also reported. Focally folded myelin has been reported in a few CMT1B patients usually, as in our cases, harboring a mutation in the extracellular domain of P0. In conclusion this CMT1B family is electrophysiologically peculiar because of the coexistence of intermediate-normal motor conduction velocities with segmental slowing and conduction block. Focal conduction abnormalities may be pathophysiologically related to tomacula at the paranodal region.
