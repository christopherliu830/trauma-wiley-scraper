AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a monophasic illness. Early nadir and lack of multiple relapses have differentiated it from the chronic form (CIDP). We present a case whose unusual course overlaps both disorders. A 71-year-old man presented with paresthesiae and weakness evolving over 1-week period, 2 weeks after an upper respiratory infection. Spinal fluid analysis and electrophysiologic findings supported the clinical diagnosis of GBS. He was treated with a 5-day course of IVIG with rapid, almost complete recovery over the following 10 days. Four weeks later, his symptoms recurred. Another dose of IVIG produced rapid but transient improvement. He was started on oral steroids but continued to deteriorate. Clinical and laboratory reevaluation confirmed the presence of an inflammatory polyradiculopathy; IVIG was resumed. Over the following 3 months, his clinical course was characterized by 3 increasingly severe deteriorations, the last one to quadriplegia, severe bulbar dysfunction requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement, ophthalmoplegia and autonomic dysfunction. Transient improvements occurred between these relapses. Aggressive treatment, which included IVIG, plasma exchange, IV steroids and IV cyclophosphamide, did not produce sustained benefit. He remained pseudo-locked-in for 10 days. Another 5-day IVIG course was completed; he began to improve and continued to do so over the following 5 weeks. The nadir of GBS is usually reached within 4 weeks. Treatment fluctuations usually occur within the first weeks, and relapse during the recovery phase is often limited and isolated. Multiple relapses until a defined nadir are highly uncommon. The bulbar and cranial nerve involvement, rapidity of the relapses, dysautonomia, need for mechanical ventilation, and improving electrophysiology all argue against the diagnosis of CIDP. It remains unknown whether repeated doses of IVIG could change the natural course of this disease leading to such an unusual temporal profile.

AB  - Nerve injuries associated with surgical operations are well recognized and described in literature. Ulnar neuropathy, brachial plexus, and lumbosacral roots injuries are the most frequent as shown by two large reviews on anesthesia-related nerve damage from the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed claims study (Kroll DA 1990, Cheney FW 1999). Several factors such as section, compression, traction, and ischemia, contribute to the nerve injuries but the exact mechanism(s) in an individual case often is unclear. We describe a case of perioperative bilateral median neuropathy at the distal forearm, an uncommon site of nerve injury, which we ascribe to demyelinative conduction block secondary to nerve compression. Nerve conduction studies precisely localized the area of abnormality. There is a limited understanding of the relationships between conventional perioperative care and the genesis of peripheral nerve lesions. As a result, there is a lack of agreement in literature on the correct standards for positioning the patient during anesthesia. In selected cases nerve conduction studies at the onset of symptoms may provide insights into localization, mechanism and prognosis of nerve lesions. We believe that a timely and proper electrophysiological study may be helpful for understanding the perioperative nerve injuries as well as for determining the best preventive strategies.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in patients with ischemic stroke. We investigated its efficacy in preventing and reversing established nerve disorders in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes. After STZ injection (60?mg/kg/ip), EPO (5000 units/kg b.w. i.p. three times a week) was started in a group of rats and continued for five weeks (prevention schedule). In another group of diabetic rats, EPO was started six weeks after STZ, continued for five weeks (therapeutic schedule). Groups of non-diabetic control rats were similarly treated. Antidromic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the tail was assessed at five weeks for all groups and at 11 weeks for the therapeutic schedule. Compared to non-diabetic rats, NCV was 21% lower (P?<?0.001) at five weeks in the STZ group, EPO partially prevented this decrease (14% lower than with non-diabetic controls), with a significant difference from the untreated-diabetic group (P?<?0.01). After six weeks of uncontrolled diabetes, at the beginning of therapeutic EPO, NCV was reduced by 23% and after 11 weeks by 40%, EPO efficacy was confirmed. Thermal (hot plate method) and mechanical (Randall-Selitto method) nociceptive thresholds were monitored weekly throughout the study. In addition, in all groups, the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers, which reflects possible degeneration of somatic unmyelinated fibers, was assessed in the hindpaw using protein-gene-product 9.5 immunostaining. Rats developed mechanical hyperalgesia within two weeks after STZ injection. Both the prevention and therapeutic schedules of EPO reduced diabetic hyperalgesia after two weeks of treatment, reaching statistical significance at fur, and five weeks of treatment, with no such effect in non-diabetic controls. Hindpaw thermal response latencies were significantly (P?<?0.001) increased in untreated diabetic rats compared with untreated controls. EPO had no effect on these latencies in control rats but partially prevented the increase in diabetic rats, so the values were still different from controls, but significantly different from untreated diabetics at four and five weeks in both the prevention and therapeutic studies (P?<?0.05). These observations extend the therapeutic utility of EPO and highlight its potential for treating established diabetic neuropathies.

AB  - Several effective antineoplastic drugs are severely neurotoxic and induce the onset of disabling peripheral neuropathies. The clinical presentation of this side effect depends on the type of antineoplastic agent administered. The signs and symptoms shown are predominantly motor (e.g. in the case of vinca alkaloids), sensorimotor (e.g. with the taxanes) or sensory (e.g. using platinum-derived drugs). The pathogenesis of these antineoplastic drug-induced peripheral neuropathies is still poorly understood, although a relationship has been suggested between some neuronal growth factors (neurotrophins) and the toxic action of cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel. In this study we correlated the changes in the circulating levels of Nerve Growth factor (NGF) in a series of 24 women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy with the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) as assessed by the Total Neuropathy Score (TNS). After informed consent, blood samples were drawn before chemotherapy and after treatment and NGF circulating levels were determined by ELISA (EmaxTM ImmunoAssay System, Promega, USA; plasma working dilutions NGF 1:80) following the manufacturer protocols. The results obtained in this series of patients evidenced a significant correlation between the severity of CIPN and the reduction in the circulating levels of NGF (r?=???0.480, p?=?0.017 by two-tailed Spearman correlation test, 95% CL ?0.745 to ?0.082), thus confirming similar results previously obtained in a rat model of CDDP peripheral neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our data suggest that a relationship exists between CIPN and NGF circulating levels in patients treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel. Therefore, this preliminary observation support the need for further studies in order to explore the possibility of reducing the severity of platinum-drug sensory neurotoxicity with treatments aimed at increasing the circulating levels of NGF.

AB  - To our knowledge there are no evidence of other multientrapment neuropathy related to growth hormone (GH) administration. We observed the case of a 45 year-old bodybuilder complaining of paraesthesias and dysaesthesias in hands and feet after self-administration of high-dose of recombinant GH therapy. The patient complained of these transitory symptoms after each cycle of GH therapy. Electrodiagnostic studies showed: 1)?moderate? right CTS and ?minimal? left CTS; 2)?mild? right ulnar entrapment at elbow; 3) decrease in left ulnar motor nerve conduction in the segment across the elbow; 4) decrease in left ulnar sensory nerve action potential amplitude; and 5) bilateral absence of ulnar nerve F-wave from abductor digiti minimi. Our data suggested multiple nerve entrapment at upper limbs. Moreover, basing on the history of feet paraesthesia, we hypothesized a mild involvement of distal sensory fibers in the legs, which was not assessed by neurophysiological studies. The anecdotal history and neurophysiological findings of this case suggest that more attention should be paid to the adverse effects of GH on peripheral nerves.

AB  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been transferred with third generation lentiviral vectors, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the human PGK promoter, and transplanted in wild type mice. Transplanted mice have been sacrificed at 6, and 9 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to study the timing and extent of migration of BM derived transduced cells into peripheral nervous system (PNS). Starting from 6 months after BMT cells have been found in the PNS, such as in the acoustic ganglion, the dorsal root ganglions (DRG) and the sciatic nerve. At 9 months from transplant GFP positive cells represented the 50?60% of the F4/80 (a microglial marker) positive population of sciatic nerve sections and the 65?75% of F4/80?+ cells of the acoustic ganglion and DRG. At these sites, GFP positive cells were found between nerve fibers and neurons, they expressed F4/80, and were negative for GFAP, neuronal and myelin markers. Autologous BMT coupled with HSC transduction with high efficiency vectors could provide therapeutic benefit to several disorders affecting the PNS such as many lysosomal storage disorders. In these patients clinical evidence confirms the relevance of PNS involvement in the prognosis of the disease.

AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Behçet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.

AB  - Platinum compounds are very effective anti-cancer agents and act forming adducts with DNA and cytoplasmic proteins. Their main dose-limiting side effect is peripheral neurotoxicity. Cisplatin neurotoxicity has been studied in many in vitro and in vivo models but little information is available for oxaliplatin. In this study we evaluated and compared the effect of cisplatin and oxaliplatin (a gift from Debiopharm S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in an in vitro model of neurotoxicity using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which may be considered as neuroblasts. Both platinum compounds are toxic and induce cellular death by apoptosis. Oxaliplatin is less neurotoxic than cisplatin. Concentrations of oxaliplatin 3?4 times higher than those of cisplatin are necessary to induce the same percentage of cellular death. We analyzed the activation/inactivation of specific molecules involved in the apoptotic transduction pathway. After exposure to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and thus could not exert its anti-apoptotic action. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, caspase 3, and caspase 7 were activated. In our experiments in SH-SY5Y cells treated with cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the amount of p53 protein was markedly increased. In treated cultures, both caspase 3 and 7 were cleaved with the appearance of their active fragments which induced PARP cleavage. Our results suggest that neurotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin share a similar pathway. Neurotoxicity induced by platinum compounds is due not only to DNA damage but also to the activation of specific molecular pathways committing cells to apoptosis.

AB  - A 69-year-old right-handed man was recently referred to our institution with a two-month history of diplopia and ptosis in his left eye: the ocular symptoms typically fluctuates during the day, being least severe in the morning and worsening as the day progress or while reading or driving. Neostigmine injection produced a clear improvement of weakness. The serum concentration of anti-AChR antibody was elevated >?8.4?nmol/L (NV?<?0.4); a chest CT scan was unremarkable with no evidence of mediastinal mass. The clinical picture and laboratory tests support the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia. His past medical history was insignificant until the age of 59. At that time, he complained with a diffuse, slightly asymmetrical muscle weakness both in the upper and lower limbs and sensory symptoms of glove and stocking distribution (numbness). A progressive course over months was seen with hand and anterior leg muscles hypertrophy becoming evident. Strength was decreased distally greater than proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. The cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a protein level of 72?mg/dl (NV?<?45?mg/dl). Nerve conduction study showed a multifocal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with both conduction block/temporal dispersion of the C-MAP and slowing of the velocity. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered and the patient was treated with steroids, plasmapheresis and azathiaprine: after a slight improvement, the condition has been stabilized. Both MG and CIDP have been individually associated with disorders of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis. Their concurrence is rarely found (less than 10 cases to the best of our knowledge): although the existence of this syndrome can be strongly supported by the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory data, a common basic abnormality of immune regulation is still unknown.

AB  - Progressive brachial and lumbosacral radiculoplexopathies are well known, though infrequent, delayed complications of local irradiation. They present as slowly progressive, generally bilateral but asymmetric, limb weakness mainly affecting distal muscles. The pathogenesis is unknown although some authors supposed an autoimmune process or radio-induced DNA changes. No treatment for this disease is currently available even if some benefits, though transient, have been reported after steroid treatment and more recently, high-dose immunoglobulins (IVIg), suggesting a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis. We previously reported on the beneficial effect of immunotherapies in two patients with postirradiation motor radiculoplexopathy. The first patient had a severe motor lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy starting 20 years after local radiotherapy for seminoma. He became able to walk and run with less waddling and to climb stairs without support after treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. The other patient had severe left brachial and bilateral lumbosacral plexopathies presenting 12 years after toracoascellar and lumbar irradiation for a Hodgkin lymphoma. She improved her right leg strength after one course of IVIg. After one year of continuous steroid therapy the first patient started to progressively deteriorate notwithstanding the subsequent administration of IVIg, resumed courses of steroids, plasma exchanges and azathioprine. The second patient, after one year of continuous IVIg treatment which led to stabilization without further improvement, was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and plasma exchange, with a marginal and transient amelioration followed by progressive worsening that was not halted by the resumption of IVIg. Both patients now suspended any therapy. In conclusion, in both our patients, immune therapies only induced a transient and short-term benefit but did not affect the overall progression of the disease. These findings suggest that even if an immune or inflammatory component, possibly triggered by radiation, may be present in this condition, it does not probably represent the bulk of the pathological process.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to toxic substances may induce peripheral and central neurological complications but no cases of acute cranial nerve involvement are reported after single, although massive, exposure to toxic agents. Cranial multineuropathy is an uncommon occurrence. We observed two atypical cases of multinevritis of cranial nerves with mild sensory symptoms at limbs. Both patients had many common features: acute onset, occurrence of neuropraxic block in cranial nerves, and rapid clinical and neurophysiological recovery after corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, the strict time correlation between substance inhalation and acute onset of symptoms suggested a toxic origin of the disease. We emphasize that multinevritis of cranial nerves could be related to acute exposure of toxic substances. Missing this diagnosis could lead to a delay in treatment.

AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.
