AB  - Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, characterized by rimmed vacuoles and cytoplasmic or nuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions. Clinical features are proximal and/or distal weakness, frequent muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia and poor responsiveness to steroid treatment. The involvement of peripheral nerve in both sporadic and familial IBM is a debated issue. Among six cases (five men; age range: 65?82?yrs.) of muscle biopsy proven sporadic IBM, we found variable neuropathic changes. Myogenic/neurogenic mixed EMG pattern was detected in four patients. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies showed abnormalities consistent with axonal multiple mononeuropathy in three and with axonal polyneuropathy in two patients, whereas one subject had no neurogenic findings. However, the degree of peripheral nerve impairment was usually mild and not related to severity of myopathy. Sural nerve biopsy was performed in the case with more prominent clinical and electrophysiological polyneuropathy. Moderate homogeneous loss of myelinated fibers, with recurrent regeneration clusters and atrophic/degenerating axons were observed. No segmental demyelination was present. In spite of marked inflammatory changes in muscle, neither mononuclear cell infiltrates nor filamentous inclusions were detected in nerve. Similarly, whereas paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions were observed in muscle, minor but recurrent mitochondrial changes were detected in nerve. Muscle mitochondrial abnormalities have been reported about twice in IBM compared with other inflammatory myopathies. A relation of this finding with high incidence of associated peripheral neuropathy in IBM and mitochondrial myopathies has been hypothesized. On the other hand, the follow-up of our patients shows improvement of nerve conduction values in clinically responders to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, suggesting a significant role of immune processes for the pathogenesis of nerve damage in IBM.

AB  - Demyelination and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation are hallmarks of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies, of which Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 A (CMT1A) neuropathy is the typical example. In CMT1A, an altered dosage of the PMP22 gene determines a defect of myelination and an abnormal SC phenotype, characterized by hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family of proteins, including EGF and neuregulins, and their receptors, namely EGFr and the erbB family, control growth and development of SC. Their expression in mature SC is down-regulated but, during Wallerian degeneration or chemical myelinolysis, these receptors are transiently over-expressed, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. On the other hand, neuregulin 1 inhibits SC myelination and induces demyelination and SC dedifferentiation and proliferation. These effects might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies. We have therefore immunolocalized EGF, EGFr and the erbB receptors (erbB 2, 3 and 4) in sural nerve biopsies from patients with CMT1A as compared to chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) nerve biopsies and to normal nerves, in order to evaluate if the expression of these molecules is up- or down-regulated in these disorders. Among CMT1A nerves, immunoreactivity for EGF, EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 was moderately to markedly increased in SC, particularly in onion bulbs, in most cases, while a mild to moderate expression of erbB 4 in SC cytoplasm was observed in a few cases. On the other hand in CIDP, which shares with CMT1A histopathological features such as de-remyelination and SC hyperplasia, only the expression of erbB 3 was up-regulated in a minority of cases. Since in SC the functional neuregulin receptor is a heterodimer, composed by erbB2 and erbB3, the parallel up-regulation of these two molecules in CMT1A may bear a functional significance. This would be confirmed if an overexpression of neuregulins could be demonstrated, along with our finding of an increased expression of EGF and its receptor. In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that, in CMT1A, a persistent activation of neuregulin signaling pathways not only is indicative of SC dedifferentiation but also may contribute to demyelination and onion bulb formation or maintenance.

AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - Implant-related chronic osteomyelitis is a serious complication of orthopedic surgery requiring implant removal and radical debridement. Extracorporeal shockwave (ESW) have demonstrated significant bactericidal effectiveness in vitro and effectiveness and safety were evaluated in an animal model of osteomyelitis. In this experimental study, we aimed to test our hypothesis that the use of ESW together with systemic antibiotic treatment will provide synergy for the treatment of implant-related chronic osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The proximal tibia of 32 rats was contaminated with 108?CFU/ml methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA-ATCC 29213) and Kirschner-wires were placed into the medulla of the tibia. After 4 weeks, Kirschner-wires were removed and the rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I, untreated contaminated control group; group II, receiving only ESW therapy; group III, receiving only systemic teicoplanin; group IV, treated with a combination of ESW and systemic teicoplanin. ESW was applied twice to the infected limbs and all rats were sacrificed at the end of 8th week. The degree of tibial osteomyelitis was assessed by quantitative culture analysis. Bacterial counts in groups III and IV were significantly reduced relative to the control (p?=?0.002 and 0.001, respectively). The decrease in bacterial counts was more pronounced and significant in group IV compared to group III (p?=?0.024). In group II, bacterial counts also decreased, but the differences were in significant (p?=?0.068). Our experimental model suggests that ESW provides significant synergy for systemic antibiotic treatment. However, further clinical trials are required in order to use this treatment modality safely in patients, even though our study demonstrated successful results in the treatment of implant-related chronic osteomyelitis in rats. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.

AB  - Laminin is required for normal peripheral nerve development, as mutations causing absence of laminin-2 cause hereditary peripheral neuropathies (neuropathy of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and dystrophic mouse). We study the laminin receptors, integrins and dystroglycan, that link laminin in the basal lamina to the Schwann cells cytoskeleton. This linkage is defective in an animal model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F, in which the Periaxin/Dystrogycan/DRP-2 complex is disrupted. To study the role of laminin receptors in these peripheral neuropathies, we inactivated the gene for beta1 integrin and dystroglycan specifically in Schwann cells of transgenic mice. alpha6beta1 integrin is present in Schwann cells and their precursors before myelination, the absence of beta1 integrin causes a severe peripheral neuropathy due to the failure of Schwann cells to interact with axons during axonal sorting. Although more severe, this neuropathy is morphologically similar to that of dystrophic mice. In contrast, dystroglycan first appears in Schwann cells after axonal sorting and just prior to myelination (pro-myelinating Schwann cells). In the absence of dystroglycan, mice develop a neuropathy with abnormally folded myelin sheaths, slow conduction velocity and loss of DRP-2, similar to that of periaxin-null mice. These data show that alpha6beta1 integrin and dystroglycan subserve different roles during nerve development, and that they are involved at different steps in the pathogenesis of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F.

AB  - The present study was performed with the aim to compare different clinically-based neurotoxicity scales with a more extended composite scale (Total Neuropathy Scale) already validated in diabetic patients, in order to improve the grading of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity. The features of CIPN were evaluated in a series of women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel? based chemotherapy by clinical examination, neurophysiology and quantitative sensory testing of vibration threshold (VDT); the ECOG, Ajani and NCIC-CTC grades were assessed by a neurologist after clinical examination and the TNS was calculated after additional instrumental examination. At the same time, the treating oncologist, who was blinded as regards the results of the neurological examination, assessed the NCIC-CTC sensory neurotoxicity grade. The correlation existing between the different evaluations was evaluated with the Spearman test on a total of 97 visits. Our results indicate for all the neurotoxicity scales commonly used by oncologists and evaluated in this study a significant correlation with TNS; the interexaminer agreement comparison evaluation evidenced that in several cases the neurologist attributed a higher grade in the NCIC-CTC scale than the oncologist, and this discrepancy was mainly due to a different evaluation of the sensory impairment. In conclusion, the TNS can be used to assess effectively the severity of CIPN and the results of this evaluation can be reliably correlated with the oncological grading of sensory peripheral neurotoxicity; the wider range of TNS values, however, can allow a more accurate grading of the sensory impairment, a feature which can improve the estimate of CIPN changes, particularly in clinical trials; finally, the use of standardized methods of examination of the sensory function (e.g. the semiquantitative measure of vibration sensibility using the 128?Hz tuning fork) may reduce the interexaminer disagreement.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.

AB  - A 38-year-old man begun to have paresthesias in the last three fingers of the left hand followed in few months by paresthesias in the right hand, weakness of distal muscles in upper limbs and paresthesias of lower limbs. HCV positivity was discovered by routine blood test. Neurological examination, 18 months after onset, showed asymmetric weakness and sensory loss with a nerve distribution more on the right side. Electrophysiological examination showed a sensory-motor demyelinating neuropathy with motor conduction blocks and or excessive temporal dispersion of proximal compound muscle action potential in five nerves. Coexistence of focal motor and sensory conduction blocks at the same sites was demonstrated in three nerves. CSF examination showed increased protein content (66?mg/dl) and no cells. Cryoglobulins were absent. Active HCV-RNA replication was detected in the serum by RT-PCR. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis. Sural nerve biopsy showed fiber loss, prevalently of large diameter fibers, asymmetrical between fascicles and few clusters of regeneration. There were no demyelinating features, onion bulbs or inflammatory infiltrates. Weakness and electrophysiological findings worsened after high doses intravenous immunoglobulins but improved after intravenous methylprednisolone and interferon alpha treatment with resolution of conduction blocks in two months. Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), as in the patient we describe, is a rare disorder considered an asymmetric variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). HCV infection is usually associated with a multineuropathy due to vasculitis or a symmetric sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. CIDP has been described but never MADSAM. It is difficult to be sure of a pathogenetic link between a dysimmune demyelinating neuropathy and HCV infection, nonetheless the coexistence of hepatitis makes the choice of treatment problematic in these patients.

AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.
