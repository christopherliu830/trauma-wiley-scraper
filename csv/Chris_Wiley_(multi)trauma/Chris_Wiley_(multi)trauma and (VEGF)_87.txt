AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1991, five sets of electrophysiological criteria for CIDP have been reported. However, until now, receiver operator characteristic (ROC), such as sensitivity and specificity, of only AAN criteria were investigated, showing a high specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. The application of these criteria may be useful in clinical trials, but is inadequate in clinical practice, since they preclude immunomodulating treatment in patients who do not meet them. OBJECTIVE: 1) to evaluate the ROC and predictive value of five different electrophysiological criteria for CIDP (AAN, INCAT, Rotta et?al, Nicholas et?al. and Saperstein et?al.); 2) to identify the most informative electrophysiological features indicative of demyelination by mean of the likelihood ratio; 3) to determine, in our series of cases, a set of minimal electrophysiological criteria (albeit aspecific) enough sensitive for CIDP diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, progressive for at least 2 months, with weakness in least two limbs and documented improvement in strength in response to immunotherapy. Other potential causes were excluded, including diabetes and IgM paraproteinemia with or without anti-MAG reactivity. Twelve patients with axonal polyneuropathy associated with diabetes and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were included as controls. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated according to all five sets of NCS criteria and ROC was calculated. Likelihood ratio for CIDP was evaluated for each set of NCS criteria and for presence of each of the following features in different number of nerves: motor conduction velocities (MCV), conduction blocks/temporal dispersion, distal motor (DML) and F-wave latencies (FWL). MCV, DML and FWL were considered indicative of demyelination if decreased or increased as suggested by AAN criteria. Results will be discussed.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to report changes in muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) and other cardiovascular variables during central apnea occurring during a relaxed wakefulness. We describe a 47-year-old man with a five-year history of apnea. Polysomnographic recording showed repeated central apnea, without an obstructive peripheral component, during sleep or relaxed wakefulness. Neuromuscular disease was excluded by EMG investigation. During relaxed wake, MSA was evaluated by a microneurographic recording from the left peroneal nerve in association with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), thoracoabdominal respiration and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Microneurographic polygraphic recording was performed during normal respiration (5 minutes) and during repeated apnea episodes (4 consecutive episodes with mean duration of 26.2?s; range 18?45). During normal respiration, MSA was 39.5 burst/min and 64.7 bursts/100 heartbeats, the heart rate was 61.1 beat/min. During the apnea episodes, both MSA (29% and 27%: 50.9 burst/min e 82.1 bursts/100 heartbeats respectively; mean values) and HR (1%: 61.9 beat/min; mean values) increased. The maximum MSA and HR increase was reached at the end of apnea and was followed by a BP increase. Spontaneous SSR were absent during apnea episodes whereas sporadic responses were recorded after the apnea episodes when the breathing acts were wide and prolonged. In conclusion, central apnea caused an increase in MSA and minor increase in HR leading to a BP increase following the apnea episode.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are successfully used as immunomodulatory therapy in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) but their mechanism of action remains unknown. An anti-idiotypic block of pathogenic autoantibodies has been often postulated even if other possible mechanisms, including a modulation of the release of various cytokines, have been proposed. To evaluate the expression of cytokines in patients with MMN and their possible modulation by IVIg, we determined circulating levels of TNFŒ±, INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12 by ELISA in serum samples of 17 patients with MMN and compared them with 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 with multiple sclerosis (MS), 6 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 5 with myasthenia gravis (MG) and 12 healthy controls (NS). Comparable levels of INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10 and IL12 were detected in patients? sera and controls. Even if TNFŒ± levels did not differ significantly among patients? groups, they were higher than in any healthy control (mean?¬±?SD 1.2?¬±?0.5?pg/ml, range 0.7?2.4?pg/ml), in 12 (70%) MMN patients (mean?¬±?SD 3.6?¬±?1.9?pg/ml; range 0.2?7.5?pg/ml), all ALS, 3 MS (25%), 2 CIDP (40%) and 2 MG (40%). We then measured the concentration of TNFŒ± before and after IVIg therapy in 9 MMN and 2 ALS patients. In all but one MMN patients, circulating levels of TNFŒ± slightly increased after treatment with IVIg (mean values 4.3 vs. 7.2?pg/ml) and decreased 3 weeks after therapy while in both ALS patients they decreased or remained unchanged. No detectable level of TNFŒ± was found in IVIg preparation. This study shows that, similarly to what previously reported in other autoimmune neuropathy as GBS and CIDP, TNFŒ± serum levels are slightly increased in MMN but, at odds with what reported in these disease, their concentration tend to increase parallel to clinical improvement after IVIg therapy. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenetic implication of this finding and in particular whether a possible deviation from a presumably Th2 to a Th1 immune response may help explaining the effect of IVIg in MMN.

AB  - We studied the effect of chronic compression of median nerve at wrist on cutaneous innervation. Two-mm punch biopsies were obtained from third fingertip in 40 patients (32 female and 8 male, age range 30?74 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with diabetes and other metabolic or endocrinological disorders or with electrophysiological findings of a diffuse neuropathy were excluded. By means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy we counted epidermal nerve fibers, Meissner corpuscles and myelinated papillary endings. All patients underwent electrophysiological study and quantitative sensory testing using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for tactile threshold and Medoc TSA II Neurosensory analyzer for thermal threshold evaluation. Morphological and functional data were compared with age and sex matched controls. We observed abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers, mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents in all patients. These abnormalities ranged from mild to marked and appeared more severe in patients with a longer disease duration and a slower conduction velocity along the median nerve.

AB  - The pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the progressive death of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to a clinical pictures mainly characterized by weakness, muscle wasting, brisk reflexes and Babinski sign. Routine electromyographic and electroneurographic studies are mandatory to a correct diagnosis but are unable to precisely quantify the pathological changes in the motor unit. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is a recent neurophysiological technique that allows to estimate number and amplitude of motor units in single muscles in order to assess the severity of ALS and to follow-up the progression of the disease. We applied this technique in 15 patients (12 male and 3 female; mean age?¬±?SD: 65.7?¬±?9.5?yrs, range 45?82), affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria, and in 11 healthy subjects (4 male and 7 female; mean age?¬±?SD: 63.7?¬±?8.2?yrs, range 50?76), in order to assess changes in motor unit features of abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in the mean number of motor units between the two groups: 75 in ADM and 51,8 in TA in the ALS cohort vs. 283,5 in ADM and 96,9 in the healthy subjects. Conversely, the differences in the mean and maximal area between the two groups did not reach the statistical significance (ALS patients: max area 34.7?mVms, mean area 1.9?mVms; healthy subjects: max area 18.2?mVms, mean area 0.9?mVms). Our preliminary results confirm that MUNE is able to quantify the pathological changes in motor unit parameter and represents an adequate follow-up tool for disease progression and effectiveness of pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN) is a well-recognized subacute painful asymmetric proximal and distal lower limb neuropathy. DLRPN may be associated with thoracic and upper limb involvement. The latter may appear as compression mononeuropathies and as a more diffuse disorder consistent with cervicobrachial radiculoplexus neuropathy (DCRPN). We performed a multiperspective study of patients, seen between 1999?2002, with diabetes and acute or subacute onset and progression of unilateral or asymmetric bilateral proximal and/or distal weakness in lower and/or upper limbs. We excluded patients who had compression mononeuropathies or radiculopathies, multineuropathies or asymmetric poly(radiculo)neuropathies, motor neuron disease as suggested by clinical, electrophysiological, laboratory or MRI findings. During the study period we observed 18 patients with diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. Most patients were middle-aged or elderly and male preponderance was noted. Ten patients had DLPRN, 6 both DLPRN and DCRPN, 2 isolated DCRPN. DCRPN affected prevalently hands and forearms, unilaterally in 3 patients, bilaterally in 5, and improved spontaneously but incompletely in most patients in several months. Pain was not a prominent feature except for one patient. We conclude that diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy may involve the cervicobrachial regions not only in association with DLRPN but also alone.

AB  - We report a case of peripheral both demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy in a patient affected from intestinal aganglionosis with high dose intermittent metronidazole therapy. Intestinal aganglionosis is a myenteric plexus disorder with lack of innervation concerning the whole digestive tract from the rectum to the esophagus. The familial incidence of this condition seems to be high and a recessive autosomal transmission is likely. In the pathogenesis of this disorder aberrant neural crest migration seems to be implicated: indeed frequent neurologic signs resembling dysautonomic ones, deafness and rare peripheral demyelinating or axonal neuropathies are associated. The patient was a 12 years old female child affected by intestinal aganglionosis and underwent to chronic intermittent Metronidazole treatment, with daily doses of 500?mg for 15 day every month. She was admitted to our Hospital for inability to walk, dysesthesias and pain at lower limbs, acutely started and progressively worsening. At the admission neurological examination showed ataxic gait with bilateral foot drop, severe distal weakness, bilateral tibialis anterior muscle atrophy, absent deep tendon reflexes, rapidly worsening. CSF was normal. Antibodies against to peripheral nerve (antigangliosides, sulfatide, MAG, glycosaminoglycans) resulted negative. Spinal cord MRI revealed increased roots size and increased epidural space. EMG showed denervation spontaneous activity with neurogenic MUAP modification on distal muscles. Nerve conduction study showed severe slowing of motor velocity on right and left peroneal nerves with reduced amplitude of CMAP. Sensory conduction was mild slowing on both sural nerves with reduced amplitude of SAP. Metronidazole therapy was discontinued; desametazone, high dose vitamin and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was established in addition to rehydration and parenteral nutrition. Clinical conditions progressively improved and at two months follow up the girl was able to walk with mild ataxia. The authors emphasize in described case the difficulty to differentiate toxic or vitamin deficiency or autoimmune pathogenesis.

AB  - Peripheral neurotoxicity is a severe side effect of several effective antineoplastic drugs. Different attempts have been previously performed in order to reduce the neurotoxicity of antineoplastic compounds, but so far an effective neuroprotective treatment is not available. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a natural occurring compound with a neuroprotective activity in several experimental paradigms and in clinical use for the treatment of painful neuropathies. In this study we have tested in two rat models the hypothesis that ALC may have a protective role on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments in different tumor systems indicated the lack of interference of ALC in the antitumor effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel. ALC co-treatment was able to significantly reduce the neurotoxicity of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in well-established rat models and this effect was correlated with a modulation of the plasma levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cisplatin model. The protective effect of ALC was confirmed also in in vitro studies on differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where ALC treatment counteracted the paclitaxel and cisplatin-induced cell damage, as measured by reduction of neurite elongation. In a search for the mechanism(s) of ALC neuroprotection, the transcriptional profile of gene expression in PC12 cells determined by microarray analysis indicated that ALC, in the presence of NGF, was able to modulate various genes relevant in the tissue-specific toxicity, such as NGFI-A. Moreover, we observed that labeled acetyl groups derived from ALC were transferred into histones and that cells co-treatment with NGF and ALC increased the level of histones H4 acetylation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of genes implicated in the protection against specific damage induced by neurotoxic agent may be the result of modulation of histone acetylation mediated by transfer of ALC acetyl groups. Overall, these results provide the first evidence that ALC is a neuroprotective agent acting through a novel mechanism that appears to be important for counteracting the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity secondary to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Inflammatory vasculopathy is observed in 20 to 66% of nerve biopsies in diabetic neuropathy, especially in patients with proximal diabetic neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy) or with other patterns of multifocal neuropathy. Moreover there is growing evidence that diabetic patients have an increased predisposition to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). Many authors suggest that there is a more pervasive contribution of inflammatory and immuno-mediated damage to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy than had previously been imagined. In these patients, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated. However differentiating CIDP in diabetic patients from diabetic neuropathy (DNP) may be difficult. We tried to differentiate immuno-mediated and inflammatory neuropathies in diabetic patients with polyneuropathy revealing the presence of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the endoneurium. MMPs are calcium-dependent zinc endopeptidases which are able to degrade the basement membrane and thus contribute to tissue destruction and cell invasion. Sural nerve biopsies were taken from 10 diabetic patients with CIDP and 5 patients with DNP. Immunohistochemistry was performed for T-cells, macrophages, von Willebrand factor and MMP-9. Endoneurial and epineurial immunoreactivity was evaluated and quantified separately. Small epineurial T-cells infiltrates were present in 5 out of 10 CIDP patients and in none of DNP patients. In CIDP patients 53% of endoneurial vessels were immunoreactive for MMP-9 against only 12% in DNP patients and this difference reached a statistical significance. In conclusion we demonstrated that immunoreactivity of MMP-9 is strongly enhanced in diabetic patients with CIDP but not in patients with DNP. The pattern of immunoreactivity may help to select patients for a trial with immunosuppressant drugs.

AB  - Implant-related chronic osteomyelitis is a serious complication of orthopedic surgery requiring implant removal and radical debridement. Extracorporeal shockwave (ESW) have demonstrated significant bactericidal effectiveness in vitro and effectiveness and safety were evaluated in an animal model of osteomyelitis. In this experimental study, we aimed to test our hypothesis that the use of ESW together with systemic antibiotic treatment will provide synergy for the treatment of implant-related chronic osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The proximal tibia of 32 rats was contaminated with 108?CFU/ml methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA-ATCC 29213) and Kirschner-wires were placed into the medulla of the tibia. After 4 weeks, Kirschner-wires were removed and the rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I, untreated contaminated control group; group II, receiving only ESW therapy; group III, receiving only systemic teicoplanin; group IV, treated with a combination of ESW and systemic teicoplanin. ESW was applied twice to the infected limbs and all rats were sacrificed at the end of 8th week. The degree of tibial osteomyelitis was assessed by quantitative culture analysis. Bacterial counts in groups III and IV were significantly reduced relative to the control (p?=?0.002 and 0.001, respectively). The decrease in bacterial counts was more pronounced and significant in group IV compared to group III (p?=?0.024). In group II, bacterial counts also decreased, but the differences were in significant (p?=?0.068). Our experimental model suggests that ESW provides significant synergy for systemic antibiotic treatment. However, further clinical trials are required in order to use this treatment modality safely in patients, even though our study demonstrated successful results in the treatment of implant-related chronic osteomyelitis in rats. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.
