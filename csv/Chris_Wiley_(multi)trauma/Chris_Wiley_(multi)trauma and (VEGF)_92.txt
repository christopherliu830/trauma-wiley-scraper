AB  - Abstract The clinical application of the fetal membranes dates back to nearly a century. Their use has ranged from superficial skin dressings to surgical wound closure. The applications of the fetal membranes are constantly evolving, and key to this is the uncovering of multiple populations of stem and stem-like cells, each with unique properties that can be exploited for regenerative medicine. In addition to pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties of the stem and stem-like cells arising from the fetal membranes, the dehydrated and/or decellularized forms of the fetal membranes have been used to support the growth and function of other cells and tissues, including adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. This concise review explores the biological origin of the fetal membranes, a history of their use in medicine, and recent developments in the use of fetal membranes and their derived stem and stem-like cells in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Summary As we live longer, our final years are often ravaged by diseases like Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) or stroke, and we suffer all the psychiatric manifestations and indignities that are part and parcel of these diseases. Early attempts to therapeutically replace damaged brain tissue, either by regeneration or by transplantation, were disappointing. However, since those first trials 20 years ago, we have developed an appreciation of the microenvironment within which neurons normally develop and the role that alterations in this milieu play in neurodegeneration. Combining this newfound understanding with recent advances in gene therapy and stem-cell biology, legitimately raises hope that near-future clinical trials will be successful. This chapter should serve as a primer to the current thinking in the field of neural repair and will comprise three sections (1) Historical perspective on previous repair trials (2) Regenerative capacity of the adult brain and the stem-cell niche (3) current and emerging tools for neural repair.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal diseases are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Among them, tendon and ligament injuries represent an important aspect to consider in both athletes and active working people. Tendon and ligament damage is an important cause of joint instability, and progresses into early onset of osteoarthritis, pain, disability and eventually the need for joint replacement surgery. The social and economical burden associated with these medical conditions presents a compelling argument for greater understanding and expanding research on this issue. The particular physiology of tendons and ligaments (avascular, hypocellular and overall structural mechanical features) makes it difficult for currently available treatments to reach a complete and long-term functional repair of the damaged tissue, especially when complete tear occurs. Despite the effort, the treatment modalities for tendon and ligament are suboptimal, which have led to the development of alternative therapies, such as the delivery of growth factors, development of engineered scaffolds or the application of stem cells, which have been approached in this review.
