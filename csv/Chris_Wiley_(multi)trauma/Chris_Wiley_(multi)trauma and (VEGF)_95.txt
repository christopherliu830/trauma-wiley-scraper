AB  - Abstract Peri-implantitis is an infection of the tissue around an implant, resulting in the loss of supporting bone. Risk factors for peri-implantitis consist of a history of periodontitis, dental plaque, poor oral hygiene, smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes. A clinical diagnosis indicates inflammatory signs including bleeding on probing with or without suppuration and a peri-implant pocket depth ≥5?mm. A radiograph shows images of marginal bone loss ≥2?mm. A differential diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, occlusal overload, retrograde peri-implantitis and inflammatory implant periapical lesions suggests the appropriate treatment in each case. The non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, including a mechanical treatment alone or combined with antiseptics or antibiotics can improve clinical parameters in the short term but residual defects may still persist. Surgical treatment such as guided bone regeneration results in a gain of clinical attachment level and bone reconstruction in the long term. The limited effect of laser-assisted therapy needs to be further evaluated. The concept of prevention based on early detection and regular maintenance plays a principal role in reducing the occurrence of peri-implantitis.

AB  - Summary Ocular administration of drugs is a challenge in the field of drug delivery due to the unique characteristics of the eyeball. This chapter provides a general overview of ocular anatomy and routes of administration. It covers recent advances and strategies to overcome ocular drug delivery challenges. Eyes are the extension of the central nervous system (CNS) and are responsible for converting light signals into electrochemical signals to the CNS via the optic nerve. When developing an ophthalmology product, one of the key attributes of the target product profile concerns the choice of the ocular route of administration. Ocular bioavailability is a key challenge for successful ophthalmic product development. Among different physiological factors affecting corneal penetration, a few can directly be influenced during the drug administration. Several active-penetration technologies such as iontophoresis, electroporation, sonotophoresis, or microneedle arrays are currently being investigated in preclinical studies as well as in clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Bmi-1 is involved in the development of several human cancers; however, its significance in glioma progression remains largely unknown. We report that downregulation of Bmi-1 clearly reduces glioma cell migration and invasion. Downregulation of Bmi-1 promotes the expression of the tumor suppressor p16, which is important in glioma cell motility. Reduction in glioma cell invasion due to downregulation of Bmi-1 could be rescued by p16 downregulation. These results show that Bmi-1 contributes to the motility of glioma cells by regulating the expression of p16.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - ABSTRACT The fields of developmental biology and tissue engineering have been revolutionized in recent years by technological advancements, expanded understanding, and biomaterials design, leading to the emerging paradigm of ?developmental? or ?biomimetic? tissue engineering. While developmental biology and tissue engineering have long overlapping histories, the fields have largely diverged in recent years at the same time that crosstalk opportunities for mutual benefit are more salient than ever. In this perspective article, we will use musculoskeletal development and tissue engineering as a platform on which to discuss these emerging crosstalk opportunities and will present our opinions on the bright future of these overlapping spheres of influence. The multicellular programs that control musculoskeletal development are rapidly becoming clarified, represented by shifting paradigms in our understanding of cellular function, identity, and lineage specification during development. Simultaneously, advancements in bioartificial matrices that replicate the biochemical, microstructural, and mechanical properties of developing tissues present new tools and approaches for recapitulating development in tissue engineering. Here, we introduce concepts and experimental approaches in musculoskeletal developmental biology and biomaterials design and discuss applications in tissue engineering as well as opportunities for tissue engineering approaches to inform our understanding of fundamental biology. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Studies showed that co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) offered greater therapeutic effects but little is known regarding the effects of human Wharton's jelly derived MSCs on HSC expansion and red blood cell (RBC) generation in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on HSC expansion and differentiation. HSCs were co-cultured with MSCs or with 10% MSCs-derived conditioned medium, with HSCs cultured under standard medium served as a control. Cell expansion rates, number of mononuclear cell post-expansion and number of enucleated cells post-differentiation were evaluated. HSCs showed superior proliferation in the presence of MSC with mean expansion rate of 3.5???108?±?1.8???107 after day 7 compared to the conditioned medium and the control group (8.9???107?±?1.1???108 and 7.0???107?±?3.3???106 respectively, P?<?0.001). Although no significant differences in RBC differentiation were observed between groups at passage IV, the number of enucleated cell was greater compared to earlier passages, indicating successful RBC differentiation. Cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs can be greatly expanded by co-culturing with MSCs without affecting the RBC differentiation capability, suggesting the importance of direct MSC-HSCs contact in HSC expansion and RBC differentiation.

AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.
