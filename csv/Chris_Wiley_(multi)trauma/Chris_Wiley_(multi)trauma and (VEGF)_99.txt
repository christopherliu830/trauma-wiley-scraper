AB  - Glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages are referred to as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Transgenic (TG) rats expressing v-erbB, which is a viral form of the epidermal growth factor receptor, under transcriptional regulation by the S100-? promoter, develop brain tumors. This study was designed to clarify the pathological characteristics of TAMs in these experimental tumors. We carried out immunohistochemical and morphometrical analyses of microglia/macrophages in brain tumors (5 malignant glioma, 4 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 4 astrocytoma) that developed in TG rats. TAMs with ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) positivity and morphology of activated, non-phagocytic microglia increased within and around the tumors in malignant gliomas and anaplastic astrocytomas. The Iba1-positive TAMs of the tumor core were significantly more activated than Iba1-positive microglia of non-neoplastic brain tissue in intraparenchymal anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Iba1 expression showed a significant positive correlation to Ki-67 expression in all the gliomas. Most TAMs showed no or little expression against CD68, CD163 or CD204, although CD204-positive TAMs were observed in necrosis as well as in the proliferating vascular wall. In conclusion, S-100?-v-erbB?TG rats may serve as a useful animal model for further analysis of TAMs in terms of tumor cell proliferation, microvascular proliferation and phagocytosis, and as a tool for therapeutic use in malignant gliomas, although it should be noted that the polarization of TAMs toward the M2 phenotype remains unclear.

AB  - Transversal, horizontal and sagittal sections of the brain were stained by the ancient but efficient Mulligan method, a procedure that establishes a clear macroscopic difference between the white and grey substances. Different structures of each section were studied and most of the details were identified and named according to the NAV. All sections were projected onto the whole brain. By means of this easy and basic procedure the students increase their understanding of (1) the size and/or the form and/or the topography of several prominent structures of the brain, (2) the general distribution of the substancia alba and grisea, and they begin to understand the complexity of the brain.

AB  - One hundred and twenty years ago, Camillo Golgi described reticular or fenestrated sheaths of extracellular matrix (ECM), enwrapping the cell bodies, axon initial segments and proximal dendrites of certain pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system. Such structures, currently termed perineuronal nets (PNs), are preferentially associated with GABAergic, parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking inhibitory types of cells, and mostly expressing the Kv3.1 subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Although some neuroanatomists validated the existence of the PNs on selected neurons in the adult brain, there was a lack of agreement concerning their origin, composition and function. Recent data suggest that PNs result from the visualization of ECM molecules that are confined to the space interposed between glial processes and the nerve cells that they outline. The substance confined to these spaces could be visualized selectively by antibodies directed to glycoproteins, proteoglycans, markers for hyaluronan, some plant lectins recognizing N-acetylgalactosamine or by monoclonal antibodies directed to epitopes on unknown molecules. The PNs appear only after birth, which they could serve as recognition molecules between certain neurons and their surrounding cells. Other putative roles include stabilization of synapses, maintenance of cellular relationships in the adult brain, concentration of growth factors around certain neurons, generation of a polyanionic ion-buffering microenvironment, as well as prevention of extracellular-space occlusion and the formation of certain link with the intracellular cytoskeleton.

AB  - The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) has attracted growing interest due to its highly regulated spatiotemporal expression during development and maturation of central nervous system. The present study deals with the post-natal appearance and transformation into adult distribution patterns of the ECM components related to proteoglycans (PGs) and glycoproteins (GPs) in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of albino rats at birth (P0), 1?week (P1), P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8. The differentiating PGs and GPs components of the ECM were shown to make their appearance as early as 1?2?weeks post-natally. At this developmental stage, these components of the ECM appeared in association with some neurons and glia cells or diffusely localized at the neutrophill. Interestingly, Golgi complexes of labelled neurons were usually stained with lectin VVA or WFA, and this labelling dramatically disappeared on reaching P4. During P2?3, the pericoated neuronal cells underwent a progressive increment in number, and presented an inside-out pattern of migration and differentiation (toward the V-II cortical layers). On reaching P4, most of the coated neurons appeared distributed into the cortical layer IV and II. At a later stage (P5?8), the overall density and intensity of labelled neurons progressively increased and apparently reached the adult stage of development. They also displayed the usual differential labelling characteristics, after using the cationic iron colloid/lectin staining, for the first time at this juncture. The present findings indicated that the perineuronal ECM components are significantly correlated with age and suggest a possible developmental or biological significance including promotion of migration, as well as functional maturation of the retrosplenial neurons.

AB  - Morphology subjects taught by our department are very important parts of the veterinary medical studies. Functional anatomy, concluded with a final exam, provides knowledge of classical anatomy and is taught for three semesters. The lectures are followed by the plenary sessions where the dissection is done under a camcorder, which shows the students the methods used. Topographical anatomy is taught in the fourth semester ? mostly demonstrated on live animals ? the visible, palpable structures and the projections of the inner organs on the surface of the body. Introduction to biology summarizes the study of cell biology and also the general knowledge of developmental anatomy. Histology is also given in the second and third semesters, ending with a final exam. However, for the 25?years I have been teaching the anatomy and the subjects taught by our department, I always had the feeling that the students do not pay enough attention or show much appreciation of these studies after the initial enthusiasm. Anatomical knowledge should also be well known during the later year studies at our university. Until recently our teaching program lacked the repetition of systemic anatomical studies that is mostly for applied science. The very recently introduced elective courses, such as radiological anatomy, surgical anatomy, organogenesis and the anatomy of birds are all scheduled for the late evening hours, but the lecture hall are still always full with students of all grades. The enquirers could find the needed anatomical information in special books and atlases until now. However, practising vets say it takes a lot of time and making uncomfortable difficulties to analyse the books. Because of forgetting the details that are less important for the vet's everyday work it can be hard to find solutions for small but urgent problems. That is why we decided to picturise and make a summary in an edition for demonstrating different elements of certain species of animals. The multimedia CD-ROM was made based on clinical view providing the opportunity for the vet to analysing and studying the part that is the actually subject of his work. After 30?years long break, today there is no graduate or continuing education program without teaching anatomy, which means to give the knowledge to our colleagues applying to their needs also to their everyday work.

AB  - Introduction:? The interactions occurring between nervous and immune systems are well documented. These interactions involve several types of chemical messengers including hormones, cytokines, classic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It has been observed that the lymphoid organs receive a dense peptidergic innervation and immune cells produce neuropeptides. Neuropeptides, in turn, are involved in the regulation of the inflammatory processes and in the maturation of the lymphoid organs. Several studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory neuropeptides and their receptors are expressed in the thymus and bursa of fabricius. PACAP is a glucagon/VIP/secretin family peptide. It was originally isolated from the ovine hypothalamus and then it was found in the autonomic nervous system. PACAP is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary function, neurotransmission and neuromodulation. In the immune system, PACAP is expressed in lymphoid tissues of the rat and in the lymphocytes of the duck GALT. PACAP, therefore, could be a messenger of the dialogue between nervous and immune system. It may have a role in the regulation of the inflammatory processes by stimulating histamine and serotonin and modulating the production of the cytokines in immune cells. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of thymus and bursa of fabricius of the duck of different ages by using an antibody anti-PACAP38. Results and Discussion:? In the thymus, PACAP-immunoreactivity was found in lymphoid cells and, with a lesser extent, in epithelial reticular cells. The immunoreactive lymphocytes were primarily observed in the interlobular septa in close vicinity to the interlobular veins. The number of positive lymphocytes increased with ageing. In the bursa of fabricius, PACAP-IR was found in nerve fibres and in a few lymphoid cells. These results suggest that PACAP could play a role in the maturation and involution of these organs and in the immune functions.

AB  - Cell culture offers a specifically good understanding of single factors during complex signal transduction pathways, and cell?cell interactions can be examined in small scale. In the bovine synepitheliochorial placenta the peculiarity of ?restricted? trophoblast invasion is found as non-polarized trophoblast giant cells migrating into the uterine epithelium. Specific expression patterns of integrin receptors in trophoblast cells have already been shown in relation to the differentiation of the haemochorial placenta of humans and rodents. For evaluation of integrin function during the precisely controlled trophoblast invasion in cow, it is important to develop a model system, where primary cell cultures from cotyledons are compared to in vivo trophoblast cells. Uteri of pregnant cows were gathered during routine slaughtering. In parallel, placentomes were snap-frozen for the production of cryosections, and other placentomes were manually separated into fetal cotyledon and maternal caruncle. Dissociation of the cotyledonary cells was accomplished with collagenase I, and cells were cultivated in Quantum 286 (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz), a special medium for epithelial cells, containing 10% fetal calf serum. A population of mainly epitheloid cells was achieved by controlled trypsin/EDTA treatment, because of different adhesive forces of fibroblasts and epithelial cells to the substrate. Both, confluent growing cells and tissue sections, were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies against cytokeratin, integrin subunits α6, ?1, α and ?, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) components laminin and fibronectin. The epithelial character of the propagated cells was proven by their distinct immunostaining for cytokeratin. In vivo expressed integrin subunits α6 and ?1 were found colocalized along cell-cell borders and towards the flask ground. The corresponding ECM ligand laminin occurred in both, cells and tissue. In tissue sections fibronectin and subunits α and ?3 were not detected in trophoblast cells, however, in vitro these cells displayed a weak immunoreactivity. Summarizing, a method for the cultivation of bovine trophoblast cells was successfully established. The comparison of in vivo and in vitro expressed integrins and ECM showed that the cells in part maintained their in vivo attributes, and therefore are suitable for the study of cell?cell interactions.

AB  - Introduction:? Leg weakness causes high economic losses in commercial poultry. The unspecific term includes, amongst others, diseases of the skeletal system caused by genetic, nutritional or microbiological factors. The analysis of computed tomography images may be a new tool to discriminate and evaluate skeletal abnormalities in turkeys and can therefore provide valuable hints in the treatment of turkey stocks suffering from leg weakness. Material and Methods:? Legs of healthy turkeys and those showing clinical signs of leg weakness were examined using a Tomoscan M/EG/Compact (Philips Medical Systems) CT system. The slice thickness and distance were set to 2?mm. In addition to the evaluation of the obtained images, the software system 3D-Doctor was used to create three-dimensional objects of the investigated samples. Results:? Differences between physiological and abnormal parts of the leg bones are distinguishable in the CT-images and three-dimensional reconstructed objects. Bone density can be calculated and thus provides a base to estimate possible nutritional demands or deficiencies. The three-dimensional reconstruction compensates for the difficulties in understanding the detailed anatomical CT cross-sections by which the examiner is confronted while studying the CT images. Conclusion:? Although computed tomography of poultry is too expensive for routine herd diagnosis, and far less for single-animal diagnosis, it is a valuable tool for investigating skeletal abnormalities and is very useful in examining samples related to leg weakness.

AB  - The study in Wistar rats attempted to improve the occlusion technique of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) as a precise method for initiating stroke. In a first part it was necessary to study the exact anatomy of blood vessels of the brain in seven rats of 170-410 g body weight by corrosion cast. The lengths and diameters of defined locations of the blood vessels were measured. The temporary as well as the permanent methods were refined or replaced. The first one was completed in main training the physiological blood flow after temporary occlusion, while the permanent occlusion was performed by positioning a silicone cap in the MCA. A filament guide was introduced from the common carotid artery (CCA) via internal carotid artery (ICA) to guide the silicon cap at the branch of the MCA. Histological sections of the brain of rats showed 24 h after the permanent occlusion a reproducible infarct in the brain. This area corresponded very well with the supply of the MCA. The new occlusion method with a silicon cap was compared with the occlusion methods of CCA route and external carotid artery (ECA) route. The total infarct volume was significantly larger in the CCA route and ECA route groups than in the silicon cap group (means: CCA route 261?mm3; ECA route 191?mm3 vs. 128?mm3 silicon cap group; P?<?0,05). It could be demonstrated that the new silicon cap occlusion technique imitates the pathological situation of a cerebral infarct in man. Moreover it is less invasive for the animals and more precise and reproducible regarding the infarcted area in comparison to the other occlusion methods. Based on anatomical measurements of the blood vessels the described silicon cap method can be recommended for rats of a body weight between 340?370?g.

AB  - The anatomical and clinical studies of computed tomography (CT) in the dog are still scarce. Particularly, there are few CT studies combining the use of rapid apparatus of the latest generation, the supply of contrast medium (digestive or intravenous) and the application of regional specific CT windows with different window width (WW) and window level (WL). The use of this CT methodology is particularly recommended in the evaluation of mediastinal masses, heart pathologies, etc. In this work the mediastinum of the dog was studied by using a sixth generation spiral CT scanner (Toshiba Ex Vision), belonging to the private Medical Institute of Radiology ?Irion? of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Four mixed-breed mature dogs (4?6?years, 15?20?kg) were used, two males and two females. The dogs were anaesthetized and kept at a maximum inspiration when getting the images. Previously, the urografin? contrast had been injected by peroral and intravenous (cephalic vein) via. Dogs were placed in a stretcher in sternal recumbency. Different CT windows were applied in order to increase the quality of the images and to obtain detailed attenuation shades of the mediastinum organs: soft tissue window (WW 652; WL -34), pulmonary window (WW 928; WL -680) and mediastinal-vascular window (WW 352; WL 220). The mediastinal space was studied craniocaudally from the level of the cranial cava vein, brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery, to the caudal end of the lumbodiaphragmatic recess. The obtained images allowed a very good tomographic evidence of the great vessels, the heart, the thoracic portion of the trachea, the principal bronchi, the thoracic portion of the oesophagus, etc.

AB  - The location, size and histological structure of the ovine paraepiglottic tonsils were determined in 20 sheep. Macroscopic examination of the pharyngeal tonsils was performed in 10 sheep of 9 months of age, of which the heads were fixed in acetic acid 2% for 24?h, and in non-fixed heads of five sheep aged between 6 and 9?months. The paraepiglottic tonsil is located lateral to the epiglottis in the ventromedial segment of the pharyngeal sidewall, i. e. at the floor of the piriform recess. The tonsil appears as a cluster of small nodular elevations, which are white after fixation in acetic acid and are called hereafter tonsillar nodules. The number of these nodules per tonsil ranged from 1 through 8. The length of the tonsil varied from 5 till 14?mm, and the width ranged from 2 till 5?mm. The tonsils of 5 sheep aged between 6 and 9?months and of five sheep aged between 9 and 12?months were excised and fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde. The blocks were processed routinely for histology and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (8??m thick) were stained with eosin and haematoxylin. Histology revealed that each tonsillar nodule consisted of several lymphoid follicles (noduli lymphatici) surrounded by parafollicular tissue. Most lymphoid follicles were secondary follicles consisting of a germinal centre, a dark zone and a mantle zone. Primary follicles devoid of germinal centres were most obvious at the periphery of the tonsillar nodules. The stratified squamous pharyngeal epithelium covering the lymphoid tissue was frequently infiltrated by numerous lymphocytes, forming a follicle-associated epithelium. Crypts were absent, but in some cases the pharyngeal epithelium was slightly infolded into the lymphoid tissue. The tonsillar nodules were almost completely encapsulated by dense connective tissue from which septa extended into the larger nodules. Acknowledgement:?

Physiotherapeutic exercises, also called physical therapies, are the golden standard of rehabilitation in human orthopaedics. In dogs and cats, such supportive therapies following surgery are rarely performed. Presently, physical therapeutic exercises, which are well established in man, are transferred to companion animals. However, there is no generally accepted scheme of procedures adequate to cats and dogs. Furthermore there is no study dealing with the exact effects of the various exercises performed with these species. Due to this paucity of information, the effect of several physical exercises concerning the lumbar spinal nerve roots transferred from man to the dog were assessed macroscopically. In ten euthanized healthy beagles up to eight years of age, the lumbar spine was surgically separated from adhering dorsal muscles. The lumbar nerve roots were visualized by removing the connective tissues surrounding the foramen intervertebrale. Nerve roots, i.e. spinal ganglia, were marked immediately outside the vertebral column applying a dot of yellow paint while the cadaver was in lateral recumbency. In man, for maximal sciatic nerve root movement the straight leg raising (SLR) (Maitland, 1986) exercise is applied on the patient lying on the back. For nervus femoralis movement the passive knee bending exercise is performed. In the dog, however, performing only the transferred SLR has a poor effect on L7. It can greatly be enhanced by a supplemental inward rotation of the hip joint by fixing the stifle joint and moving the lower leg medially. Concerning L4-L6 nerve roots, the hip joint is maximally extended and the effect can be improved by an outward rotation of the leg. The results of the present study indicate that the simple transfer of physical exercises from man to companion animals does not result in identical results in the latter species. Modifications considering different anatomical conditions should be kept in mind if clinical results are poor. Reference?

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNs) of condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) have been shown to characterize the microenvironment of individual neurons and the chemoarchitecture of some brain regions. In the present study, PNs in the hippocampus were visualized with a cationic iron colloid method for sulphated proteoglycan content and a plant lectin from Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) for N-acetylgalactosamine containing glycoconjugates. The ECM molecules were organized in reticular coats (PNs) around non-pyramidal cells in the Ammons horn (Corneu Ammons, CA) and subicular region, in addition to pyramidal neurons located in CA2 and CA3 regions. CA2 stratum pyramidale exhibited the most intense staining of its PNs and a diffuse intervening neutrophil labelling, while CA3 region showed a graded fashion of staining intensity. The subiculum displayed intensely stained perineuronal coats. Notably, the hippocampal perineuronal nets revealed overlapped staining characteristics with both staining methods. However, cell coats of the subicular neurons showed various degrees of labelling characteristics with both markers. It is suggested that the PNs in the hippocampus are correlated with the fast spiking inhibitory GABAergic neurons and their target pyramidal cells, and this is important to keep the excitatory elements under control and therefore control the information processes within the hippocampus.
