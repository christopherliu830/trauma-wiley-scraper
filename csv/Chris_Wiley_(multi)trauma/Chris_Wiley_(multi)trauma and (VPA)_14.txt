AB  - Aim To analyze the clinical outcome and neuroimaging over a long duration follow-up in the currently largest series of acute encephalopathy after status epilepticus in patients with Dravet syndrome. Method Clinical and neuroimaging data of patients with Dravet syndrome with a history of acute encephalopathy (coma >24h) after status epilepticus from February 2005 to December 2016 at Peking University First Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Results Thirty-five patients (15 males, 20 females) with a history of acute encephalopathy were enrolled from a total of 624 patients with Dravet syndrome (5.6%). The median onset age of acute encephalopathy was 3 years 1 month. The duration of status epilepticus varied between 40 minutes to 12 hours. Thirty-four patients had a high fever when status epilepticus occurred, and only one had a normal temperature. Coma lasted from 2 to 20 days. Twelve patients died and 23 survived with massive neurological regression. The median follow-up time was 2 years 1 month. Neuroimaging of 20 out of 23 survivors during the recovery phase showed diverse degrees of cortical atrophy with or without subcortical lesions. Interpretation Acute encephalopathy after status epilepticus is more prone to occur in patients with Dravet syndrome who had a high fever. The mortality rate is high in severe cases. Survivors are left with severe neurological sequelae but often with either no seizure or low seizure frequency. What this paper adds Acute encephalopathy is more prone to occur in patients with Dravet syndrome with a high fever. The mortality rate is high for acute encephalopathy after status epilepticus in patients with Dravet syndrome. Survivors have neurological sequelae.

AB  - Background and Purpose (R,S)-ketamine produces rapid and significant antidepressant effects in approximately 65% of patients suffering from treatment-resistant bipolar depression (BD). The genetic, pharmacological and biochemical differences between ketamine responders and non-responders have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to employ a metabolomics approach, a global, non-targeted determination of endogenous metabolic patterns, to identify potential markers of ketamine response and non-response. Experimental Approach Plasma samples from 22 BD patients were analyzed to produce metabolomic patterns. The patients had received ketamine in a placebo-controlled crossover study and the samples were obtained 230?min post-administration at which time the patients were categorized as responders or non-responders. Matching plasma samples from the placebo arm of the study were also analysed. During the study, the patients were maintained on either lithium or valproate. Key Results The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate, irrespective of response to ketamine. In the patients maintained on lithium, 18 biomarkers were identified. In responders, lysophosphatidylethanolamines (4) and lysophosphatidylcholines (9) were increased relative to non-responders. Conclusions and Implications The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial ?-oxidation of fatty acids. These differences were not produced by ketamine administration. The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy.
