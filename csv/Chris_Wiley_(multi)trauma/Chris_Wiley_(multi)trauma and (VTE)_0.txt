AB  - Summary This chapter discusses real-world experiences of implementing venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention strategies, and ways to overcome common challenges. It examines the broad structure of a successful VTE prevention strategy, followed by discussion of two fundamental elements of VTE prevention; risk assessment and appropriate thromboprophylaxis. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the USA recommends 'assembling an effective team' as an essential first step in ensuring success in VTE prevention. The AHRQ suggest that gaining support from the institution is another essential first step. Practice experience has shown that support from key leaders in an organisation is vital in enabling meaningful changes to practice to be embedded. It aids access to financial and knowledge resources, provides senior leadership, and allows for alignment of goals within an organization. Empowering patients by educating and supporting them to be involved in thromboprophylaxis decisions is another key part of any VTE prevention programme.

AB  - The concept rested on several components that many of us have now tried to adopt or improve on, inclusive of a multidisciplinary team, a multimodal approach to anesthesia and preoperative preparedness, evidence-based approach to care protocols; and a change in management using interactive and continuous audit prior to and post-procedure. This article describes the development of ERAS protocols relative to checklist implementation, antibiotic use, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, how these ideas are developed and operationalized as well as how they are evolving and spreading across the care continuum to achieve sustained outcome improvements.

AB  - This review is focused on the epidemiology of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), associated with pregnancy. Superficial vein thrombosis, a less hazardous and less studied type of thrombosis in pregnant women, is beyond the scope of this review. This study discusses the VTE incidence rate in women from developed countries for both antepartum and postpartum periods and for subpopulations of women affected by additional risk factors, such as thrombophilias, circulatory diseases, preeclampsia of varying degrees of severity, and Caesarean section. To minimize bias due to historical changes in medical and obstetric practices, lifestyle, diet, etc., this review is generally limited to relatively recent studies, i.e., those that cover the last 35 years. The absolute risk or incidence rate was used to ascertain risk of VTE associated with pregnancy. For the studies where the direct incidence rates of VTE were not reported, we calculated an estimate of the observed but not reported absolute incidence rates using the data presented in respective articles.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Objective To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma. Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

AB  - Abstract Background Clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolic events (uVTE) detected during routine imaging pose a management challenge due to limited knowledge about their clinical significance. Unsuspected VTE are often referred as ?asymptomatic?, ?incidental? or ?clinically silent/occult? VTE. Objective Understand the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of uVTE in children. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The search criteria included controlled vocabulary and keywords for VTE, incidental findings, and children (ages ≤21 years). Results Among 10,875 articles, 51 studies (7597 children with 758 uVTE) were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, I2 96%; p <.0001. Unsuspected VTE were diagnosed in two settings: first, asymptomatic VTE (aVTE) diagnosed through surveillance imaging for VTE [45 studies; n=5869; aVTE: 715, pooled frequency:19%, 95% CI:13- 24%]; second, incidental VTE (iVTE) diagnosed during imaging performed for indications without primary suspicion for VTE [6 studies; n=2460; iVTE: 43]. Majority (94%) of aVTE were associated with central venous lines (CVL). Non-CVL settings included post-spinal surgery, post-splenectomy, trauma, nephrotic syndrome and newborns. In general, aVTE were reported to have a benign clinical course, were mostly transient, and resolved without intervention and with few immediate or long-term functional complications. Incidental VTE were primarily detected in children with cancer and ranged from tumor-associated thrombi to pulmonary embolism (PE) with insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions about their management. Conclusion Clinically uVTE were predominantly diagnosed with CVL and their outcomes were generally favorable implying limited benefit of routine surveillance and thromboprophylaxis. Prospective research is needed to clarify the optimal management of iVTE.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the risk factors reported to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The most important risk factors for VTE are a history of previous VTE, recent surgery, hospital in-patient stay and cancer. Pulmonary embolism remains the most widely reported preventable cause of death in patients undergoing surgery. It is the most common cause of death within 30 days of surgery, with 40% of VTE events occurring later than three weeks post operatively. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery are among the highest risk patients (odds ratio?>?10), and this includes total hip and knee arthroplasty, hip/leg fractures, major orthopaedic trauma and spinal surgery. Lower limb immobilisation in casts, with or without surgery, increases the risk of VTE. Approximately 70-80% of fatal hospital-acquired thrombosis (HAT) occurs in medical patients. Venous thrombosis is increased in most acute medical conditions, necessitating hospital admission.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly common problem. We hypothesized that VTE occurs most commonly in tertiary care settings and that the pattern of associated illnesses may have changed from earlier reports. Methods The Kids' Inpatient Database 2006 was utilized to identify children ≤18 years old with in-hospital VTE. Children were identified by the presence of thrombosis specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure codes. Remaining ICD-9-CM codes were utilized to categorize patients by acute or chronic illness. The incidence of in-hospital VTE by hospital type, age, gender, race, and disposition were estimated. Results Over 4,500 children met the inclusion criteria (188/100,000 discharges). Most VTE discharges (67.5%) were from children's hospitals (RR 5.09; 95% CI 4.76; 5.44). Underlying chronic illnesses were associated with most VTE (76.2%), most commonly: cardiovascular (18.4%), malignancy (15.7%), and neuromuscular disease (9.9%). VTE not associated with chronic illness were most often idiopathic (12.6%), followed by infections (9.5%), and trauma (9.1%). The greatest proportions of children with VTE were infants (23.1%) and adolescents (37.8%). However, when standardized against the entire database of discharges, infants were least likely to develop VTE (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.43; 0.52), while adolescents were at highest risk (RR 1.89; 95% CI 1.73; 2.07). Hospitalizations ending with death were more likely to include VTE (RR 6.16; 95% CI 5.32; 7.13). Conclusions Pediatric VTE is most commonly seen in tertiary care. Adolescents are at greatest risk to develop in-hospital VTE. Patients whose hospitalization ended with death are at much greater risk to develop VTE.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multi-factorial disease. Extensive thrombophilia screening is costly and often inconclusive. Simple laboratory methods are required to predict the risk of recurrence. Objective:?To assess if measurement of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) allows stratification of patients with VTE into high- and low-risk categories with regard to recurrence. Patients and methods:?We prospectively followed 918 patients with a first unprovoked VTE and studied the relationship between recurrence and an APTT after discontinuation of anticoagulation. APTT was expressed as a ratio of test to reference coagulation times. Study endpoint was symptomatic recurrent VTE. Results:?Venous thromboembolism recurred in 101 (11%) patients. Patients without recurrence had a greater APTT ratio than those with recurrence (0.97?±?0.09 vs. 0.93?±?0.09, P?=?0.001). After 4?years, probability of recurrent VTE was 8.5% (95% CI: 5.5?11.5%) among patients with a ratio equal to or >?0.95 and 15.6% (95% CI: 11.4?19.9%) among patients with a lower ratio (P?=?0.005). Compared with patients with an APTT ratio <?0.95, the relative risk (RR) of recurrence among patients with a ratio equal to or >?0.95 was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.38?0.84, P?=?0.005) before and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.39?0.87, P?=?0.009) after adjustment for sex, age, factor V Leiden, and factor II G20210A. Conclusions:?Measurement of APTT allows stratification of patients with VTE into high- and low-risk categories with regard to recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is not rare, which would affect the patient?s prognosis. Objectives To examine the prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of AECOPD patients with VTE. Methods We performed this multi-center, prospective, observational study that involved 16 hospitals in China. Patients admitted to hospital due to AECOPD were consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics, VTE risk factors, symptoms, signs and auxiliary examination results were collected. Lower limb venous ultrasound and computed tomography pulmonary angiography were examined. Results Between June 2009 and October 2010, a total of 1144 AECOPD patients (the average age 72.0 ± 9.1 years, 761 males) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-eight (6.8%) were diagnosed with VTE, including 24 PE, 64 DVT, 10 combined PE and DVT. VTE patients were older than non-VTE patients. History of venous thromboembolism and lower extremity varicose vein, and presence of longer immobility (≥3 days), lower limbs problems of swelling, pain and walking difficulties, diuretics use, fever, syncope, higher d-dimer and lower hemoglobin were more common in VTE patients than in non-VTE patients. After adjusting the covariates, venous thrombosis history, prolonged immobility (≥3 days), lower limb pain before hospitalization, higher d-dimer independently associated with VTE development. Regular glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risk of VTE in this set of patients. Conclusion VTE is relatively common among hospitalized AECOPD patients. Conventional prophylactic anticoagulant therapy may be considered for those hospitalized AECOPD patients with risk factors.
