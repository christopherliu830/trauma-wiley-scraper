AB  - Abstract Background/Objectives Higher resting heart rate is a risk factor for arterial cardiovascular diseases. We assessed whether higher heart rate is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods In a prospective epidemiologic cohort, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we associated resting heart rate by electrocardiogram with physician-validated incident hospitalized VTE through 2015. We also examined whether lower heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic imbalance, might be a risk factor for VTE. Results Resting heart rate at Visit 1 (1987-1989), when participants were 45 to 64 years old (mean, 54 years), was not associated with incidence of VTE (n = 882 cases). However, heart rate at Visit 4 (1996-1998; mean age, 63 years) was associated positively with VTE (n = 557 cases). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of VTE across Visit 4 heart rate categories of <60, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 bpm were 1 (reference), 1.22 (1.01-1.49), 1.39 (1.09-1.78), and 1.44 (1.01-2.06), respectively, and when evaluated continuously 1.11 (1.02-1.21) per 10 bpm greater heart rate. For the most part, HRV indices were not associated with VTE or associations were explained by inverse correlations of HRV indices with heart rate. Conclusion We found a significant positive and independent association of resting heart rate at ARIC Visit 4 with incidence of VTE. The reason why high heart rate is a risk marker for VTE warrants further exploration.

AB  - Accessible summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important safety issue in the inpatient mental health care of older people. In a survey of specialist mental health staff, knowledge of deep vein thrombosis was good. More variable awareness of the presentation and risk factors for pulmonary embolism indicates the need for training integrated into regular physical health care updates. Abstract Currently, failure to adequately screen and prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is estimated to cause between 25?000 and 32?000 potentially avoidable deaths annually in the United Kingdom. The authors aimed to assess the awareness of VTE in clinical staff working in Mental Health Services for Older People, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys National Health Service Foundation Trust. A questionnaire was devised to assess knowledge of VTE symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and treatment in clinical staff working in Mental Health Service for Older Peoples' inpatient units. Forty-nine nurses, 12 consultant psychiatrists, and 11 clinical pharmacists responded. A significant proportion of staff had previous involvement in VTE treatment. Staff had significantly more limited knowledge of pulmonary embolism compared to deep vein thrombosis with areas for improvement in presentation, risk factors, and prevention. The study confirms a need for improved awareness among all clinical staff including nurses, pharmacists, and doctors, which can be met by including VTE awareness in First Response training, and encouraging use of the Department of Health VTE e-learning tool.

AB  - Summary Background The optimal duration of anticoagulation for women who had venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with estrogen use is unknown. Objectives To test the hypothesis that women who had a first VTE while using estrogens have a low risk of recurrence. Methods A Prospective cohort study of 630 women (333 estrogen users, 297 non-users) with a first VTE, who were followed for an average of 69 months after anticoagulation withdrawal. Women with a previous or secondary VTE, coagulation inhibitor deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, cancer, pregnancy, requirement of long-term antithrombotic therapy or homozygosity or double heterozygosity for factor V Leiden and/or the G20210A prothrombin mutation were excluded. The endpoint was objectively documented symptomatic recurrent VTE. Results VTE recurred in 22 (7%) estrogen users and in 49 (17%) non-users. After 1, 2 and 5 years, the cumulative probability of recurrence was 1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0?2), 1% (95% CI, 0?2) and 6% (95% CI, 3?9) among estrogen users and 5% (95% CI, 2?7), 9% (95% CI, 6?13) and 17% (95% CI, 12?22) among non-users. Compared with non-users, estrogen users had an adjusted relative risk (RR) of recurrent VTE of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2?0.8). Compared with non-users in the respective age groups, the RR of recurrence was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2?0.8) among estrogen-containing-contraceptive users and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3?1.5) among women using estrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy. Conclusions Women who had their first VTE while using estrogens have a low risk of recurrent VTE. These women might not benefit from extended anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - Summary.? Background : The evidence on the optimal duration of treatment in patients with an idiopathic venous thromboembolic event (VTE) is inconclusive. d-dimer testing to predict recurrent VTE has been evaluated in several studies. Objectives: We performed a meta-analysis of studies of patients with idiopathic VTE treated with oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) to assess the prognostic value of elevated d-dimer levels 1?month after discontinuation of OAT for VTE recurrence. Patients/Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included patients with idiopathic VTE and in addition reported results for this group separately, had measured d-dimer approximately 1?month after discontinuation of OAT and had reported on recurrence of VTE. A random-effects model was used to pool study results. Results: Data from four studies (1539 patients) were included in the current analysis. All studies reported on the number of recurrent events in the normal and elevated d-dimer groups. Overall, 125 of 751 patients (16.6%) with elevated d-dimer levels experienced recurrent VTE during the period of follow-up compared with 57 of 788 patients (7.2%) with normal d-dimer levels. Elevated d-dimer levels were significantly associated with recurrent VTE (odds ratio , 2.36; 95% CI, 1.65 to 3.36). Conclusions: Elevated d-dimer levels measured 1 month after discontinuation of OAT identify patients with idiopathic VTE at higher risk of recurrence.

AB  - Summary In the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE studies, the primary outcome was a composite of symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death while the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. In the VTE treatment trials, initial parenteral heparin was given in the dabigatran and edoxaban studies, while apixaban and rivaroxaban were used from the start of treatment, without any bridging strategy. The direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were given at fixed doses, while vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were dose-adjusted to achieve an international normalised ratio (INR) target of 2.5. The extrapolation of results from DOAC trials to the general population should always take into account the stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria and underrepresented subgroups in the trial population. In the absence of clinical trials directly comparing the relative efficacy and safety of DOACs, simple indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) and, increasingly, adjusted indirect comparisons in the form of network meta-analyses (NMA), are performed.

AB  - Current prescribing practices for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment are suboptimal, particularly regarding the use of appropriate prophylaxis in accordance with evidence-based guidelines. Failure to prevent avoidable VTE is associated with a substantial clinical and economic burden, due not only to the initial event, but also to VTE recurrence and long-term sequelae. Quality improvement initiatives such as the Surgical Care Improvement Project, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Quality Forum, and The Joint Commission have developed performance measures to address the shortfall and improve adherence with best-practice recommendations. Several studies have highlighted the benefits of pharmacist-led anticoagulation services for reducing the occurrence of VTE and bleeding complications while reducing excess hospitalization and health care costs. By assuming responsibility for anticoagulation management, pharmacists can ensure that at-risk patients receive the correct drug at the correct dose for the correct duration, from initial presentation to outpatient follow-up. Increasing continuity of care in this manner will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Pharmacists can also play a key role in helping hospitals achieve performance measures by aiding in the development and implementation of local VTE guidelines, policies, and other quality improvement initiatives; by helping to establish critical pathways with protocols; and by providing valuable education for other health care professionals and patients alike. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to facilitate achievement of VTE-related performance measures and can thus substantially contribute to the much-needed improvement in current VTE prevention and care.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?The value of parental history as a risk indicator for venous thromboembolism (VTE) has not been determined in a nationwide setting. Objectives:?To perform the first nationwide study of age-specific and sex-specific familial VTE risks in offspring of parents hospitalized for VTE. Patients/Methods:?The Swedish Multigeneration Register of 0?75-year-old subjects was linked to the Hospital Discharge Register for 1987?2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for individuals whose parents were hospitalized for VTE as compared with those whose parents were unaffected. Results:?Among 45?362 hospitalized offspring cases with VTE, 4865 offspring of affected parents were identified with a familial SIR of 2.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94?2.05). Familial SIR was slightly higher for male offspring than for female offspring (2.08, 95% CI 2.00?2.16 vs. 1.91, 95% CI 1.84?1.99). The risk in offspring was further increased when both parents were affected (3.97, 95% CI 3.40?4.61), with high familial risks at ages 20?29 years (10.00, 95% CI 5.91?15.84). The familial risks for VTE among offspring were increased from the age of 10 years up to 75 years, with familial SIRs of 3.96 (95% CI 3.13?4.94) at age 10?19 years and 1.48 (95% CI 1.17?1.84) at ages 70?75 years. However, the absolute incidence rate increased with age. Conclusions:?Parental history is potentially useful for risk assessments of VTE, although age needs to be considered. Our results support the use of an age-dependent multicausal model to estimate the risk of VTE.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the association between perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric surgical patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric, a validated registry of 118 United States children's hospitals. Patients under 19 years of age undergoing a surgical procedure between 2012 and 2017 were included, with the main exposure being RBC transfusion in the perioperative period (48 hours prior to operation to 72 hours after operation). The primary 30-day outcome of interest was a postoperative VTE requiring therapy. Risk-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed across multiple surgical specialties. Sensitivity analyses were performed after (a) imputation for missing variables and (b) propensity score matching. Results During the study years, 482 867 pediatric patients (56.7% male; median age, 6 years [interquartile range, 1?12 years]) underwent an operation. Of these, 30 879 (6.4%) received at least one perioperative RBC transfusion. Postoperative VTE requiring therapy occurred in 618 patients (0.13%). After adjustment for multiple risk factors, perioperative RBC transfusion was associated with an increased risk of VTE (aOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9?3.0). The increased VTE risk persisted after imputation of missing demographic and clinical data as well as after 1:1 propensity score matching (29 811 matched pairs, aOR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7?2.8). Conclusions Perioperative RBC transfusion is associated with an increased, albeit still very low, risk of postoperative VTE in pediatric patients. Patients receiving blood in the perioperative period may benefit from additional monitoring or VTE prophylaxis.

AB  - Summary The prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses distinct gender-specific challenges. Women of childbearing age are at an increased risk of VTE secondary to the transient risk factors of combined hormonal contraception (CHC) and pregnancy. Cancers specific to women are associated with a significant burden of VTE; whilst the incidence of VTE in localised breast cancer is 5 per 1000 person-years, more cases are seen due to the prevalence of breast cancer. Treatment of VTE in women can be complicated by abnormal uterine bleeding, now increasingly reported with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as well as vitamin K antagonists. Divergence between international guidelines regarding the use of CHC following an oestrogen-associated VTE and appropriate withdrawal of such contraception requires clarification for clinicians. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether to consider such events provoked or unprovoked and, consequently, the optimal duration of treatment in these women remains unclear. During pregnancy and the puerperium, the traditional anticoagulants remain the agents of choice with no further advances in DOAC safety data, and similarly in lactation. Further studies evaluating the safety and optimal treatment strategies in these women are awaited.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and B vitamins deficiency are thought to be risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causality and independence of those associations are still questioned. Methods:?We measured fasting serum total homocysteine, folates, and vitamin B12 levels as well as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes in 467 patients hospitalized with a first well-documented deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism not related to a major acquired risk factor and 467 controls matched for gender and age. Results:?Mild hyperhomocysteinemia, low serum folates, and vitamin B12 were associated with VTE independently of each other. In multivariate analysis, odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) for VTE associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia (>15??mol?L?1), low serum folates (≤?4.9?nmol?L?1), and vitamin B12 (≤?253?pmol?L?1) were 1.48 (1.05?2.08), 3.14 (1.35?7.32) and 1.42 (1.03?1.98), respectively. An MTHFRC677T genotype was not significantly associated with VTE; OR (95% CI): 1.13 (0.70?1.81) Conclusions:?The current data provides further knowledge in the complex relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia, low vitamin levels, and VTE.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) are increasingly-recognized health conditions in children, with both acute and chronic sequelae. Risk factors for, and pathogenesis of, VTE are readily related to three principal factors, consisting of venous stasis, endothelial damage, and the hypercoagulable state (i.e. thrombophilia), termed the triad of Virchow. In children, greater than 90% of VTE are provoked by an overt clinical risk factor, the most common of which is a central venous catheter. Risk factors for childhood-onset (beyond the neonatal period) AIS include sickle cell disease, infection, cerebral arteriopathy, and congenital cardiac disease. In perinatal AIS, risk factors are less well-defined, and have been hypothesized to include maternal-fetal conditions. While some acquired and inherited thrombophilias have been associated with increased risk of incident and/or recurrent VTE and AIS, knowledge of other diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of VTE/AIS in children remains quite limited. To date, very few published studies have employed plasma mass spectrometry-based ?omics? approaches (proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics). Ongoing and future research efforts involving multicenter prospective study-derived plasma biobanks in pediatric VTE (such as the Kids-DOTT trial) and AIS (including VIPS) along with new multi-omics-compatible sample processing methods offer fertile opportunities for discovery and validation of both novel risk factors and prognostic markers, with great potential to achieve improved prognostic stratification in these diseases.

AB  - Summary Patients with thrombophilia and/or a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) exhibit a high risk of thrombosis during pregnancy. The present multicentre study prospectively assessed a prophylaxis strategy, based on a risk score, in pregnancies with increased risk of VTE. Among 286 patients included in the study, 183 had a personal history of VTE (63·98%) and 191 patients (66·8%) had a thrombophilia marker. Eighty nine (46·6%) thrombophilic women had a personal history of VTE. Patients were assigned to one of three prophylaxis strategies according to the risk scoring system. In postpartum, all patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis for at least 6?weeks. In antepartum, LMWH prophylaxis was prescribed to 61·8% of patients with high risk of VTE. Among them, 37·7% were treated in the third trimester only and 24·1% were treated throughout pregnancy. In this cohort, one antepartum-related VTE (0·35%) and two postpartum-related VTE (0·7%) occurred. No case of pulmonary embolism was observed during the study period. The rate of serious bleeding was 0·35%. There was no evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis. The use of a risk score may provide a rational decision process to implement safe and effective antepartum thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women at high risk of VTE.

AB  - Summary The close relationship between malignancy and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is well established, with malignancy increasing VTE risk and accounting for a substantial proportion of presentations with VTE. Moreover, VTE impacts significantly on morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Anticoagulation for prevention and treatment of VTE requires a patient-centred approach due to the heterogeneous patient population and inherent increased thrombotic and bleeding risks. In recent years, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injections have come to be the mainstay for treatment and prevention of cancer-related VTE. For treatment, this is usually administered for at least 6 months and continued in patients with active cancer or those receiving treatment for cancer. The use of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised cancer patients is also well accepted, but out-of-hospital prophylaxis remains contentious. The development of risk assessment models may help identify the patients at highest risk. The role of the new oral factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors in this setting remains to be determined.

AB  - Summary Although traditional anticoagulant regimens are highly effective and safe in most patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the aggressive natural history of VTE and the high risk of serious bleeding in cancer patients can complicate the management of VTE. In addition, because few clinical trials have focused on the prevention and treatment of VTE in this unique patient population, many clinical questions regarding the care of cancer patients with VTE remain unanswered. Currently, low-molecular-weight heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists are the most commonly used agents for the primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE in patients with or without cancer, but their use is associated with pharmacological and practical limitations. This review will provide an up-to-date summary of the clinical trials that have addressed the management of VTE in patients with cancer. A brief discussion of the potential application of novel anticoagulants in these clinical settings is also included.

AB  - Summary Cancer increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) recommends considering cancer screening in patients with unprovoked VTE. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including release of inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors by an underlying tumour, interaction between tumour cells and vascular endothelium leading to endothelial damage and platelet activation, and mass effect causing impaired venous return. On the basis of this association, it has become controversial as to how far to investigate someone presenting with unprovoked VTE for possible underlying cancer, and whether computerised tomography (CT) screening for occult malignancy in asymptomatic patients is of clinical benefit. The number of equivocal or false positive scans was very different in two influential studies in this area ? the SOMIT study and the Trousseau study. This chapter summarises and discusses these two studies, and a more recent larger randomised trial.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric critical care. The Transfusion Requirements in Pediatric Intensive Care Units study randomized to either transfusion threshold 9.5?g/dL or 7?g/dL using leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC). Deaths, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), adverse events, ventilator days, and nosocomial infections were not significantly different in the two groups. When split into subgroups of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and pediatric general surgery patients, the restrictive PRBC transfusion strategy showed no increase in MODS. PRBC transfusions appear to be independently linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critically ill pediatric patients. Pediatric intensivists have recognized that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children is different from ARDS in adults. Recurrent hypotension in a pediatric trauma patient occurs late and may be an ominous sign.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the key interventions that the practitioner is likely to meet in most orthopaedic and trauma settings. Three major interventions are the focus: casting, external fixation and traction. The chapter covers the basic principles of how each of these treatment modalities works and the main care issues that the practitioner needs to consider. Where available, evidence-based guidance for practice is provided. Expert, highly specialised care is required for all three interventions from practitioners with advanced knowledge and skills.

AB  - Summary. Background:?Clotting factor (F) VIII is an independent risk factor for primary and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causes for high plasma FVIII levels are not fully understood, but an involvement of genetic factors has been demonstrated. A multifunctional endocytic receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), mediates cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of FVIII and may contribute to variations in FVIII levels. Objective:?We assessed the association of a genetic variation of LRP1 (663C?>?T) with basal FVIII levels and the risk of venous thrombosis in a group of high-risk patients and in healthy controls. Patients and methods:?One hundred and fifty-two patients with a history of recurrent VTE (median age 56?years, 47% women) were compared with 198 age- and sex-matched controls (median age 53?years, 50% women). The LRP1 663C?>?T genotype was analyzed by mutagenic separated polymerase chain reaction assay and heterozygosity was confirmed by sequence analysis. Results:?LRP1 663C?>?T genotype distribution differed significantly between patients (663CC n?=?138, 663CT n?=?14) and controls (663CC n?=?190, 663CT n?=?8; P?=?0.048). In multivariable linear regression analysis including LRP1 663C?>?T, ABO blood group, von Willebrand factor antigen, C-reactive protein and age, LRP1 663CT was independently associated with FVIII activity (P?=?0.02). LRP1 663CT was also associated with increased odds for VTE following adjustment for blood group O, FV Leiden and the prothrombin variation 20210G?>?A in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3?8.5). Conclusions:?According to our data the LRP1 663C?>?T polymorphism influences plasma FVIII levels independently of blood group, C-reactive protein and von Willebrand factor and is significantly associated with the risk of VTE.
