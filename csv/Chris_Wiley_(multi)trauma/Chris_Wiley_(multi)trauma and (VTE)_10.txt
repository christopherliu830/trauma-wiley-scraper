AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Abstract Aim To characterize the most common causes and risk factors of maternal mortality in the USA and observe trends over the past 9 years. Methods We carried out a population-based retrospective cohort study using data from the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Women who were pregnant between 2003 and 2011 were identified. Baseline characteristics of pregnant women who died and those who lived were measured. ICD-9 codes for each cause of death were examined by up to three independent reviewers. Causes of death were categorized into the nine most common subgroups and trends were examined by tertiles of the period 2003?2011. Results During this 9-year period, there were approximately 7 million births and 1102 maternal deaths, for an overall incidence of 14.2 per 100 000 births. Primary causes of maternal death included sepsis (20.6%), cardiac disease (17.8%), hemorrhage (16.2%), venous thromboembolism (15.2%), and hypertensive disorders (9.4%). During the study period, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of sepsis from 33.2% to 10.0% and a non-significant decrease in venous thromboembolism from 19.1% to 12.9%. There were increases noted in all other groups, notably in terms of hemorrhage from 8.2% to 22.0% and hypertensive disorders from 2.1% to 16.4%. Conclusion Maternal mortality remains a rare event. Although sepsis was the overall predominant cause of mortality during the study period, frequency declined over time and it was surpassed by hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders as the leading causes of maternal mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an inexpensive therapy effective at minimizing perioperative blood loss and transfusion. However, it remains underutilized due to safety concerns. To date, no evidence-based guidelines exist identifying which patients should not receive TXA therapy. This study determined patient groups for whom safety information regarding TXA is lacking due to common exclusion from perioperative TXA trials. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic review searching the databases Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) administering systemic TXA perioperatively to elective or emergent surgery patients were eligible. Our primary outcome was to describe exclusion criteria of RCTs, and the secondary outcome was TXA safety. A descriptive synthesis of exclusion criteria was performed, and TXA safety was assessed by meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 268 eligible RCTs were included. Meta-analysis showed that systemic TXA did not increase risk of adverse events compared to placebo or no intervention (relative risk, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.12). Patient groups commonly excluded from perioperative TXA trials, and thus potentially lacking TXA safety data, were those with major comorbidities, a history of thromboembolism, medication use affecting coagulation, TXA allergy, and coagulopathy. Exclusion of patients with major comorbidities may not be necessary; we showed that the risk of adverse events was similar in studies that excluded patients with major comorbidities and those that did not. CONCLUSION Sufficient evidence exists to develop perioperative guidelines for TXA use in many populations. Further studies evaluating perioperative TXA use in patients with a history of thromboembolism are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND The AABB compiles an annual synopsis of the published literature covering important developments in the field of transfusion medicine. An abridged version of this work is being made available in TRANSFUSION, with the full-length report available as Appendix S1 (available as supporting information in the online version of this paper). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Papers published in late 2017 and 2018 are included, as well as earlier papers cited for background. Although this synopsis is comprehensive, it is not exhaustive, and some papers may have been excluded or missed. RESULTS The following topics are covered: ?big data? and ?omics? studies, emerging infections and testing, platelet transfusion and pathogen reduction, transfusion therapy and coagulation, transfusion approach to hemorrhagic shock and mass casualties, therapeutic apheresis, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. CONCLUSION This synopsis may be a useful educational tool.
