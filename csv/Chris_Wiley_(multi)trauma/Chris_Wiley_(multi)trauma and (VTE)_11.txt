AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the role of high-performing team-based care and the use of standardized protocols, particularly in the setting of obstetrical emergencies. There are two clinical scenarios used to illustrate the utility of multidisciplinary team care, one involving the evaluation and management of pulmonary embolism, and the second involving cardiac arrest during pregnancy. The goal is to explore the role of high-reliability, team-oriented care specifically in the setting of obstetrical emergencies. The chapter examines whether normal physiologic and hematologic changes in the pregnant patient alter the evaluation in working up a patient for pulmonary embolism. It explores whether the Wells' criteria of assessment of pretest probability of pulmonary embolism is useful. The chapter also inquires whether healthcare teams perform better during obstetrical emergencies, such as cardiopulmonary arrest if they undergo simulation training compared to controls.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe and effective procedure but concerns have been raised that the operation has taken appendicectomy away from the basic surgical trainee (BST) and into the hands of more senior surgeons (HST). We assessed the impact of laparoscopic appendicectomy as a trainee operation. Methods: This was a prospective audit of 185 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis who were referred to a major teaching hospital over a 7-month period. Outcome measures included operative time, conversion from laparoscopic to open, complications, and length of stay. Results: Of the 120 patients who underwent surgical intervention by trainees, six had formal laparotomies, 40 patients successfully had a laparoscopic appendectomy, nine were converted (18.3 per cent), 24 patients had a diagnostic laparoscopy and 41 underwent open appendectomy. The performance of BSTs and HSTs is shown below. No significant difference was found in operative time for laparoscopic appendicectomy between trainees (BST median 65 min, HST median 60 min). The duration of laparoscopic appendectomy was significantly longer (median 60 min versus 40 min for open (P < 0.0001)). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared to open (49 h versus 72 h (P < 0.01)). There was no difference between the two groups of trainees. The complication rate was lower in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. Conclusion: In our experience laparoscopic appendectomy may fulfil a role in the training of laparoscopy that open appendectomy has traditionally provided for laparotomy.

AB  - Abstract Aims: We studied the effect of binge drinking on surgical dexterity immediately after and the morning after alcohol intake. Methods: Five surgeons (all males, age 31?42 years) were trained on laparoscopic surgical simulator (MIST-VR) to reach a desired standard of performance. Three sets of experiments were a control with no alcohol and full night's sleep, a sham night out (sleep deprived) without alcohol and a night out with alcohol ad libitum. Parameters recorded were average time taken to perform task, error rate, average diathermy time and diathermy (damage) time to main object. Comparisons between baseline readings, those in the middle of night and those of following morning were made with Wilcoxon signed ranks test (all two tailed, significance at P < 0.01). Results: The candidates consumed on an average 10.33 (range 6?15) units of alcohol and had 0.86 per cent (range 0.71?1.1 per cent) of breath alcohol levels and had an average of 3.75 (range 3?5 h) hours of sleep after a typical night out. The morning-after breath alcohol levels were 0 per cent. There was significant deterioration in the performance indicators in all the parameters immediately after alcohol consumption. The time taken to complete task and the time when the diathermy was used were still significantly worse the morning after the typical night out. The sham night out showed deterioration only on time parameters with control night out showed no changes. Conclusions: A typical night out deteriorates performance on a surgical simulator, which persists till the following morning as compared to just a ?nonalcoholic? night out.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Blood transfusion has often been shown to reduce cancer survival, however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We have measured antiangiogenic agent endostatin, the proangiogenic growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in various blood products and assessed their effect upon tumour and endothelial cell growth to attempt to explain this clinical finding. Methods: Blood products as supplied by the blood bank were maintained at 4 C and every 72 h was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min, the supernatant underwent measurement of endostatin, bFGF and VEGF by ELISAs. A standard MTS assay measured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and colorectal cancer cell (Caco-2) proliferation from incubated stored blood supernatant compared to control and cancer patients plasma. Results: Endostatin in packed red blood cells (2100 pg/mL Â± 810) became undetectable within one week of storage, during which time platelets increased bFGF levels by fourfold (4.4 Â± 1.9 versus 17.4 Â± 4.5 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Plasma from whole blood contained significantly more VEGF (73.6 pg/mL Â± 5.0) than leucodepleted packed cells (22.6 pg/mL Â± 1.2, P < 0.01). HUVECS and Caco-2 cells increased proliferation upon incubation with stored blood supernatant compared to patient plasma (P < 0.05); an effect inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody (P < 0.05). Conclusions: During storage, blood products become proangiogenic stimulating both cancer cells and endothelial proliferation in vitro. These findings may have clinical significance in terms of the detrimental effects blood products contribute to cancer patients survival.

AB  - The ABH and Lewis antigens were among the first of the human red blood cell polymorphisms to be identified and, in the case of the former, play a dominant role in transfusion and transplantation. But these two therapies are largely twentieth-century innovations, and the ABH and related carbohydrate antigens are not only expressed on a very wide range of human tissues, but were present in primates long before modern humans evolved. Although we have learned a great deal about the biochemistry and genetics of these structures, the biological roles that they play in human health and disease are incompletely understood. This review and its companion, which appeared in a previous issue of Vox Sanguinis, will focus on a few of the biologic and pathologic processes which appear to be affected by histo-blood group phenotype. The first of the two reviews explored the interactions of two bacteria with the ABH and Lewis glycoconjugates of their human host cells, and described the possible connections between the immune response of the human host to infection and the development of the AB-isoagglutinins. This second review will describe the relationship between ABO phenotype and thromboembolic disease, cardiovascular disease states, and general metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Aims: To assess the effects of surgery and ANH on coagulation. Methods: A total of 33 patients randomized to ANH (n = 17)/no ANH (n = 16), undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery, were prospectively studied. Coagulation tests included aPTTR, INR, platelets, fibrinogen and thromboelastography (TEG). Results: There was no significant difference between groups at entry. In ?no ANH?, as operation progressed, there was a decrease in platelet count (P < 0.001) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increase in aPTTR (P = 0.002) and INR (P = 0.001). The TEG confirmed this; decrease in alpha angle (P = 0.006), MA (P = 0.003) and G (P = 0.001), increase in K (P = 0.008). Prior to knife to skin, ANH reduced platelet count (P = 0.003) and fibrinogen (P = 0.001), and increased aPTTR (0.003) and INR (P = 0.001). R time was shortened (P = 0.001) but MA (P = 0.001) and G (P < 0.001) decreased. Re-transfusion of autologous blood increased platelet count (P = 0.03) and fibrinogen (P = 0.004), decreased aPTTR (P = 0.017) and INR (P = 0.002), without affecting the TEG. Between the groups, at the time of knife to skin, the ANH group had a lower platelet count (P < 0.001), increased INR (P = 0.006), reduced MA (P = 0.010) and G (P = 0.011), but shortened R time (P = 0.004). At 1 h into operation, the platelet count remained lower (P = 0.002), the INR (P = 0.005) and aPTTR (P = 0.008) significantly prolonged. Immediately prior to re-transfusion the only difference was a prolonged INR (P = 0.023). By the end of the operation there was no difference between groups. In addition there was no difference in estimated blood loss. Conclusions: Coagulation is significantly impaired as operation progresses. Acute normovolaemic haemodilution impairs coagulation; this remains significantly impaired throughout operation.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Tissue repair of primary inguinal hernia using mesh relies on scar tissue bonding the mesh to give a sound repair. Collagen has the theoretical advantage of using natural collagen which will be incorporated into the repair and not be a permanent foreign body. Methods: A total of 140 patients were prospectively randomized to receive either polypropylene or collagen mesh. Performance was compared at operation, postoperatively, 3 months, 12 months. Patient's perceptions and quality of life were measured. Patients and researchers were blinded and analysis was undertaken at a separate institution. Results: A total of 78 patients received collagen and 62 received polypropylene mesh, with no difference in handling, insertion and suturing at operation. Postoperatively there was an increase in haematoma in the polypropylene group (P = 0.048). Infection and inflammation were similar postoperatively and at 3 months. There was one recurrent hernia in each group at 1 year. Activity and pain scores postoperatively were similar and were normal by 4 weeks. Quality of life was reduced in both groups at 4 weeks: Euroqol P = 0.002, SF 36: physical function P = 0.016, social function P = 0.003. At 3 months there was reduced physical function in the polypropylene group (P = 0.037). Conclusions: Initial results showed that collagen mesh is an effective method of providing tissue repair in primary inguinal hernia. The collagen mesh produced fewer haematomas postoperatively and patients recovered physical activity more quickly. Otherwise it produced results comparable to polypropylene without the risks of a permanently implanted foreign body. It is proposed to recruit 200 patients to the study and undertake follow-up for 2 years postoperatively.
