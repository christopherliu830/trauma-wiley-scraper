AB  - Abstract Aims: A radical shift in management of abdominal sepsis from surgery to radiological drainage occurred in 20 years. This is safe and in majority it avoids the need for conventional surgery. When surgery is indicated it provides the roadmap by showing the exact nature of the abscess and its contents. This is a retrospective study from single centre to look at the outcome of management of localized intra-abdominal sepsis by using radiological guided drainage. Methods: All the patients who underwent radiological intervention for abdominal sepsis between 1995 and 2001 were included in the study. These were scanned and drains were inserted under radiological guidance under local anaesthetic. All these patients were followed up with antibiotics and drainograms when appropriate. Results: These patients were between ages of 14 and 84 years. A total of 216 procedures were performed. Twenty-four of them were diagnostic in that the patients were subjected to laparotomy or conservative management. A total of 192 patients had therapeutic aspiration or drainage. One hundred and forty-five patients had catheters inserted for continuous drainage and the rest had therapeutic aspiration. These patients included pelvic abscess (15 per cent), perinephric collections (12.4 per cent), subdiaphragmatic abscess (12 per cent), liver abscesses (8 per cent), pseudocysts (7 per cent), pericolic abscess (7.5 per cent), sub-hepatic abscess (5 per cent), psoas abscess (3.4 per cent), appendicular abscess (3.4 per cent), empyema gall bladder and pancreatic abscesses. Complications were minimal including transient sepsis, residual collection, haemorrhage into the cavity and persistent sinus. Our results include bacteriological studies of aspirates, which will be presented in detail at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Percutaneuos guided aspiration and drainage is a safe and effective alternative to conventional open surgical drainage. We recommend this as the first line of management.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Hyperhidrosis substantially impairs quality of life. Sympathectomy is often ineffective for axillary hyperhidrosis and carries a significant risk of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injection offers a temporary but effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the value to patients of this treatment as judged by their voluntary, self-initiated re-attendance for further treatment. Methods: A prospective database of all patients attending for Botulinum toxin injections for hyperhidrosis has been kept since October 1997. After treatment no routine review is arranged. Patients who want further injections must self refer to the clinic when they think it is necessary. Results: From October 1997 to January 2002 60 patients have received Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis (54 axillary, 6 plantar). 45 received their first injections more than 12 months ago and of these 31 (69 per cent) have initiated re-attendance for further treatment at a median of 10 months (IQR 7?13 months) after initial treatment. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin injection for hyperhidrosis is of sufficient value to at least 69 per cent of patients that they self-initiate repeated therapy. The median duration of efficacy is 10 months.

AB  - Abstract Aims: The high morbidity (28.5 per cent readmission rate) experienced whilst waiting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after an index admission with acute cholecystitis (AC) has been reported. Since this report a provision for emergency LC service has been made available in the same DGH. This study performed over a 12-month period (October 2000?September 2001) reports the impact of those changes on the management of AC and allows comparisons between these results and those achieved in the previous study (the control period). Methods: During the study 146 patients presented as emergency with AC. Emergency cholecytectomy was performed in 75 and the rest were waitlisted. GI surgeons performed 76 per cent of the LC whilst the non-GI surgeons listed the majority of their cases for delayed LC. Seventy-one per cent of the LC was done laparoscopically with an 18.8 per cent conversion rate; 59 per cent (44/75) cholecystectomies were performed by trainees under supervision. The number of emergency LC, conversion rates, complications, median length of total (TLOS) and postop hospital stay (PLOS) were used as end points. Results: There was a seven-fold (Table) increase in the number of cholecystectomies during their index admission in the study group. Major complications and conversion rates of LC performed in the study period (5.3 and 18 per cent) were similar to those of delayed LC in the control period (6.2 and 12 per cent). Although the TLOS was less in the study group compared to the control (table), patients with AC still had a median wait of 5 days between their admission and their cholecystectomy. Conclusions: These results document that emergency cholecystectomy service can be provided with minimal complications and a shorter hospital stay. Further improvements to reduce inhospital stay require prompt ultrasound examination and rostering of laparoscopically competent surgeons.

AB  - Abstract Background: Robotic-enhanced surgery has emerged as a solution to some of the drawbacks of traditional minimal access surgery. Master?slave telemanipulator systems have been extensively used in surgical interventions, but the learning curve in this technology has not been objectively assessed. Aims: Delineate the learning curve of surgeons for a robotic task in a complex bench model. Find if there is a quantifiable learning process in a short period of exposure to the Da Vinci system. Methods: Nine surgeons completed five synthetic small bowel anastomoses (Limbs and things, UK) using the Da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, CA) in standardized conditions. All procedures were digitized and quality scored independently by three surgeons employing the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to compare the first and last attempts. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Cronbach's-alpha was used to measure interrater reliability. Results: A learning curve was constructed using time and OSATS score of every task. Both variables showed a rapid and progressive learning process. Mean times for the first and last attempt were 3507 s and 2287 s (P < 0.008) and mean OSATS scores were 17 and 24 (P < 0.012), respectively. A high interobserver reliability was found (α = 0.894). Conclusions: This study clearly shows a significant reduction in the time taken (34 per cent) and improvement in quality (29 per cent) between the first and fifth attempt in a bench model. Therefore, we conclude that Da Vinci system allows fast adaptation and short learning process regardless previous surgical experience.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives This was a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study to investigate the risk of developing deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with a pneumococcal pneumonia. Methods We analysed data from 1998 to 2010 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. The follow-up period was extended to the end of 2011. We identified patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and selected a comparison cohort matched for age, sex and diagnosis year at a ratio of one pneumococcal pneumonia patient to four control patients. We analysed the risks of DVT and PE by using Cox proportional hazards regression models, including gender, age and comorbidities. Results In total, 18?928 pneumococcal pneumonia patients and 75?712 controls were included in the study. The risks of developing DVT and PE were 1.78-fold (95% CI: 1.39?2.28) and 1.97-fold (95% CI: 1.43?2.72), respectively, in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia compared to the control cohort after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. The increased risks of DVT and PE were significant in patients who exhibited any comorbidity. The incidences of DVT and PE were highest in the first 4 weeks after pneumonia and remained slightly elevated from 13 weeks to 2 years after acute infection. Conclusion Pneumococcal pneumonia should be considered a risk factor for DVT and PE, even after the patient has recovered from the acute infection.

AB  - Summary Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon cause of stroke that mainly affects young adults and children. In contrast to venous thromboembolism, women are affected three times more often than men. Baseline symptoms can vary considerably between patients, but most present with headache, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. Patients can be diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography-venography, or catheter angiography, although the latter is rarely required anymore. Approximately 30?50% of patients have an intracerebral hemorrhage, which can range from a small juxtacortical hemorrhage to large space-occupying lesions. Based on limited evidence from clinical trials, the primary therapy for CVT is anticoagulation with heparin. Uncontrolled studies have shown promising results for the use of endovascular treatment in severely affected patients, but these studies require confirmation in prospective clinical trials. In patients who develop clinical and radiological signs of impending herniation decompressive surgery can be both life saving and result in a good functional outcome.
