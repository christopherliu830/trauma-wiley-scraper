AB  - Summary.? Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. Systemic VTE are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. The epidemiology of systemic VTE has been studied in international registries. In children older than 3?months, teenagers are the largest group developing VTE. The most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. Clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system VTE are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. However, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system VTE and pulmonary embolism (PE) have not been established. Treatment studies for VTE consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The long-term outcome of systemic VTE, post-thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. The etiology of CSVT includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. Estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood CSVT have recently become available through the Canadian Pediatric Ischaemic Stroke Registry. Clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. There have only been case-series studies carried out in the treatment of CSVT. Properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic VTE/PE and CSVT to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long-term management.

AB  - Summary Numerous studies have established that hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but an association of endogenous oestrogen exposure with the incidence of VTE is not fully established. Using a prospective design combining the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort, we studied the 12-year risk of VTE in relation to hormone replacement therapy use, age at menopause, parity number, and type of menopause in 8236 post-menopausal women. There were no significant associations of age at menopause, parity number, or type of menopause with incidence of VTE. Women currently using hormone replacement had a 1·6-times higher multivariate-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of VTE compared with those without hormone use in the time-dependent model (RR?=?1·60, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1·06?2·36; Population attributable fraction?=?6·7%, 95%CI, 1·0?10·3). When we excluded women with 1-year or more duration of hormone therapy at baseline, the association was stronger (RR?=?2·02, 95%CI, 1·31?3·12). The multivariate-adjusted RRs of VTE for current users tended to be higher in those with idiopathic VTE (RR?=?2·40, 95%CI, 1·40?4·12) than those with secondary VTE (RR?=?1·08, 95%CI, 0·63?1·85). Hormone replacement therapy is associated with increased risk of VTE, but reproductive history markers of endogenous oestrogen exposure were not associated with VTE.

AB  - Elevated plasma concentrations of coagulation factor XI may increase risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but prospective data are limited. We studied prospectively the associations of plasma factor XI and a key F11 genetic variant with incident VTE in whites and African-Americans. We measured factor XI in 16,299 participants, initially free of VTE, in two prospective population cohorts. We also measured the F11 single nucleotide polymorphism rs4241824, which a genome-wide association study had linked to factor XI concentration. During follow-up, we identified 606 VTEs. The age, race, sex, and study-adjusted hazard ratio of VTE increased across factor XI quintiles (P?<?0.001 for trend), and the hazard ratio was 1.51 (95% CI 1.16, 1.97) for the highest versus lowest quintile overall, and was 1.42 (95% CI 1.03, 1.95) in whites and 1.72 (95% CI 1.08, 2.73) in African-Americans. In whites, the F11 variant was associated with both factor XI concentration and VTE incidence (1.15-fold greater incidence of VTE per risk allele). In African-Americans, these associations were absent. In conclusion, this cohort study documented that an elevated plasma factor XI concentration is a risk factor for VTE over extended follow-up, not only in whites but also in African-Americans. In whites, the association of the F11 genetic variant with VTE suggests a causal relation, but we did not observe this genetic relation in African-Americans. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Aim Periodontal disease is a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor but few studies have considered the relationship between periodontal disease and venous thromboembolism (VTE). We hypothesized that periodontal disease is independently associated with increased risk of incident VTE. Materials and methods We used data from 8,092 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to examine periodontal disease in 1996?1998 and incident VTE through 2011. Periodontal disease was determined using self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease and dental examinations. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for VTE and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for relevant confounders. Results and conclusions Participants were on average 62.7 years old at baseline and 13.9% self-reported tooth loss from gum disease. Over a mean of 12.9 years of follow-up, there were 313 incident VTE events. Self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease was associated with 30% higher VTE risk (HR = 1.29 (0.96, 1.73) after adjusting demographic factors, SES, periodontal risk factors, oral hygiene, and access to dental care variables. No statistically significant associations between clinical measures of periodontitis and VTE were observed after adjustment. Further research is needed to elucidate whether a relationship between periodontal disease and VTE exists.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading preventable cause of death within hospitals. Among all the inpatients, those in the intensive care units (ICU) represent a high-risk category due to the severity of their illnesses, immobility which is often prolonged and iatrogenic factors such as central venous catheters. In many respects, the ICU patients differ from others who develop VTE. Symptoms like leg swelling, seen with VTE, are often present in these patients due to other reasons, while self-reporting of complaints related to VTE like chest or leg pain are not likely in severely ill patients. In addition, patients are often perceived to have a bleeding risk that outweighs their thrombosis risk; as such, thromboprophylaxis may be delayed by several days or even omitted altogether with a significant impact on mortality. In summary, patients in ICU are complex and present multiple challenges to clinicians in relation to the prevention and treatment of VTE. Thrombosis prevention should be a high priority for every patient and is only achieved with a careful daily assessment of their clinical condition.

AB  - Essentials Mild antithrombin deficiency may increase the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). In a cohort study, we stratified patients with VTE to various cut-off antithrombin levels. A 1.6?3.7-fold increased risk of recurrent VTE was observed in the lowest antithrombin categories. Mild antithrombin deficiency (activity < 5th percentile of normal) increases recurrent VTE risk. Summary Background Mild antithrombin deficiency (previously defined as antithrombin activity below 70% or 80%) has been associated with a 2.4?3.5-fold increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). This finding may have implications for duration of antithrombotic therapy in VTE patients with mild antithrombin deficiency. Objectives To externally validate whether mild antithrombin deficiency is a risk factor for recurrent VTE. Methods In a population-based cohort study, patients with a first VTE (n = 2357) were stratified according to percentile cut-off antithrombin levels (< 5th [< 87%], 5?10th [87?92%], > 10th percentile [> 92%]) and functional antithrombin levels (< 70%, 70?80%, > 80%). Results During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 361 recurrent events occurred (incidence rate, 2.5/100 patient-years). We observed an increased risk of recurrent VTE in the lowest antithrombin activity category (< 5th percentile; < 87%) as compared with antithrombin activity that was > 10th percentile (> 92%), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.5 (95%CI, 1.0?2.3). When analyses were stratified to antithrombin cut-off criteria of< 70% vs. patients with antithrombin activity > 80%, the adjusted HR for venous recurrence was 3.7 (95% CI, 1.4?9.9). Mild antithrombin deficiency was able to predict recurrent VTE over at least 8 years of follow-up and the association remained present when the population was stratified to the presence or absence of thrombosis risk factors. Restriction analyses, where patients who used anticoagulation at time of blood draw and those who reported drinking ≥ 5 glasses alcohol daily were excluded, did not materially affect these outcomes. Conclusion This study confirms that mild antithrombin deficiency is a risk factor for recurrent VTE.

AB  - Abstract We sought to examine prospectively the association of serum homocysteine and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We studied these relationships in a nested case?control study of 303 VTE cases and 635 matched controls from a population-based cohort of 21,680 adults from six U.S. communities. The highest quintile of serum homocysteine carried a non-statistically significant adjusted odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 0.93?2.58) compared to the lowest quintile in the overall cohort but a significant association among adults aged 45?64 years (OR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.10?3.83) and an inverse association in those ≥65 years of age. Carriers of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism were not at higher risk for VTE than those with normal genotype (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56?0.98). Our prospective data showed, at most, a weak relationship between homocysteine and VTE risk, with associations larger among younger participants. MTHFR C677T was not a risk factor for VTE. Am. J.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Numerous case?control studies have reported higher prevalence of non-O blood type among venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients than controls, but potential mechanisms or effect modifiers for the association are not fully established. Patients/methods:?Using a nested case?control design combining the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort, ABO blood type and other VTE risk factors were measured on pre-event blood samples of 492 participants who subsequently developed VTE and 1008 participants who remained free of VTE. Results:?A total of 64.4% of cases and 52.5% of controls had non-O blood type. Among controls, mean values of factor VIIIc (FVIIIc) and von Willebrand factor among the non-O blood type group were higher than among the O group. Compared with O blood type, the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of VTE for non-O blood type was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.32?2.05) and was similar for the two parent studies and race groups. Further adjustment for sex, race, body mass index, diabetes mellitus and FVIIIc reduced the OR: 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02?1.68). Factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) appeared to modify the non-O blood type association with VTE in a supra-additive fashion, with an age-, sex- and race-adjusted OR of 6.77 (95% CI, 3.65?12.6) for having both risk factors. Conclusions:?Non-O blood type was independently associated with risk of VTE, and added to the risk associated with FV Leiden.

AB  - Summary Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the number one safety issue in hospitals and is estimated to cause more preventable deaths than the more publicized hospital-acquired infection. There has been a failure of implementation of thromboprophylaxis (TP), mainly because of lack of awareness among health professionals, despite the large number of evidence-based studies available. The situation in the UK is gradually changing because of tireless campaigning by politicians, a charity and key opinion leaders. In response, the Department of Health has issued a national risk assessment tool, and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the prevention of VTE in all hospitalised patients, which will be available in August 2009. Although NICE guidelines are only applicable in England, it is to be hoped Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland will also follow. Despite this, the consensus of expert opinion is that TP needs mandating to prevent pockets of non-adherence. Low molecular weight heparins are currently the gold standard pharmacological agent for TP; but are likely to be superseded within the next 5?years by new classes of oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and rivaroxiban, which are already licensed for TP after orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Whether atherosclerotic disease predisposes to venous thrombosis is uncertain. Objective:?To determine whether subclinical atherosclerosis, manifested as increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) or presence of carotid plaque, is associated with increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients and methods:?The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study is a prospective cohort of adults aged 45?64?years, examined at baseline (1987?89) and followed for cardiovascular events. Bilateral carotid ultrasound for IMT measurements was done at baseline for portions of the common and internal carotid arteries, and carotid bifurcation and also to detect the presence of carotid plaque. Exclusion criteria included baseline anticoagulant use, history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or VTE, and incomplete data. First VTE during follow-up was validated using abstracted medical records. Results:?Among 13?081 individuals followed for a mean of 12.5?years, 225 first VTE events were identified. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of VTE across quartiles of baseline IMT were 1.0, 1.16 (0.77?1.75), 1.64 (1.12?2.40), and 1.52 (1.03?2.25). However, this association disappeared after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (HRs: 1.0, 1.06, 1.40, and 1.18). Further adjustment for body mass index and diabetes weakened the relative risks even further. Presence of carotid plaque at baseline also was not associated with VTE occurrence; adjusted HR?=?0.97, 95% CI?=?0.72?1.29. Conclusion:?Increased carotid IMT or presence of carotid plaque was not associated with an increased incidence of VTE in this middle-aged cohort, suggesting subclinical atherosclerosis itself is not a VTE risk factor.

AB  - Summary The use of thrombolysis in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) began with the use of systemic thrombolytic therapy, but has evolved substantially to include both pharmacological and mechanical methods, of which some are delivered via a small catheter. The goal of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in most patients with extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is to remove the thrombus and restore physiological and anatomical venous flow, to decrease the inflammatory changes, increase the likelihood of vessel patency, preserve venous valvular function and, ultimately, limit post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) development. In recent years, the use of ultrasound-accelerated CDT for patients with massive or sub-massive pulmonary embolism (PE) has been studied with somewhat more rigour. With this method, a specialised catheter that emits low-power ultrasound is used to achieve the intra-thrombus drug delivery and to enhance thrombolysis via ostensibly improved drug dispersion.

AB  - Summary.? Introduction:?The diagnostic value of clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) is uncertain in the elderly, who often have concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases that may mimic PE. The aim of our study was to assess the differential value of risk factors, symptoms and clinical signs of venous thromboembolism, results of electrocardiogram and chest X-ray for the diagnosis of PE in suspected patients according to age. Methods:?We analyzed data from two outcome studies which enrolled 1721 consecutive patients presenting in the emergency department with clinically suspected PE defined as acute onset of new or worsening shortness of breath or chest pain without any other obvious etiology. All patients underwent a sequential diagnostic work-up and a 3-month follow-up. Results:?The proportion of confirmed PE was 24.2% (416 of 1721). Strength of the association with PE did not differ according to age group for history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), recent surgery, tachypnea at admission or right ventricular strain on electrocardiogram. Active malignancy, hemoptysis, tachycardia, hemidiaphragmatic elevation and pleural effusion at chest X-ray were no more associated with PE in the patients aged of 75?years or more. Finally, symptoms and signs of deep venous thrombosis, and an alternative diagnosis less probable than PE were associated with PE in all age groups, but the strength of this association decreased significantly with advancing age. Conclusion:?Some risk factors, symptoms and signs of VTE are less strongly or even not at all associated with PE in the elderly. Physicians should take this into account when attending elderly patients suspected of PE and when assessing their clinical probability of PE.

AB  - Summary Over the last decades, important advances have been made in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Current diagnostic strategies rely on the sequential use of non-invasive diagnostic tests, based on the pretest clinical probability of disease. Diagnostic tests include D-dimer measurement, leg vein compression ultrasonography, chest computed tomography pulmonary angiography, or ventilation perfusion (V/Q) lung scan. The safety and cost-effectiveness of these strategies have been extensively validated. They have been widely implemented in clinical practice and have replaced the historical gold standard diagnostic tests (venography and pulmonary angiography). However, new challenges arise, including a lower clinical suspicion threshold and concerns on potential over-diagnosis of VTE. Moreover, the diagnostic management remains suboptimal in many subgroups of patients with suspected VTE: patients with prior VTE, pregnant women, or elderly patients.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Heparins and warfarin are currently used as venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in surgery. Inhibition of factor (F) Xa provides a specific mechanism of anticoagulation and the potential for an improved benefit?risk profile. Objectives:?To evaluate the safety and efficacy of apixaban, a potent, direct, oral inhibitor of FXa, in patients following total knee replacement (TKR), and to investigate dose?response relationships. Patients/methods:?A total of 1238 patients were randomized to one of six double-blind apixaban doses [5, 10 or 20?mg?day?1 administered as a single (q.d.) or a twice-daily divided dose (b.i.d.)], enoxaparin (30?mg?b.i.d.) or open-label warfarin (titrated to an International Normalized Ratio of 1.8?3.0). Treatment lasted 10?14?days, commencing 12?24?h after surgery with apixaban or enoxaparin, and on the evening of surgery with warfarin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of VTE (mandatory venography) and all-cause mortality during treatment. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Results:?A total of 1217 patients were eligible for safety and 856 patients for efficacy analysis. All apixaban groups had lower primary efficacy event rates than either comparator. The primary outcome rate decreased with increasing apixaban dose (P?=?0.09 with q.d./b.i.d. regimens combined, P?=?0.19 for q.d. and P?=?0.13 for b.i.d. dosing).A significant dose-related increase in the incidence of total adjudicated bleeding events was noted in the q.d. (P?=?0.01) and b.i.d. (P?=?0.02) apixaban groups; there was no difference between q.d. and b.i.d. regimens. Conclusions:?Apixaban in doses of 2.5?mg b.i.d. or 5?mg q.d. has a promising benefit?risk profile compared with the current standards of care following TKR.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Summary Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) represent two expressions of a similar clinical pathological process, often referred to as venous throm-boembolism (VTE). It has long been recognized that, as clinical signs and symptoms of PE and DVT are not specific for the diagnosis, objective diagnosis in both patients presenting with leg symptoms and those with chest symptoms is mandatory. Since the last review on this subject in this journal in 2009, several large trials have been performed that shed new light on all aspects of the diagnostic management of suspected VTE, especially in the field of simplified clinical decision rules, age-dependent D-dimer cut-offs and magnetic resonance imaging. A literature search covering the period 2007?2012 was performed using the Medline/PubMed database to identify all relevant papers regarding the diagnostic management of acute PE and DVT. Established concepts and the latest evidence on this subject will be the main focus of this review.

AB  - Summary Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is increasingly recognized in paediatric practice. Few clinical trials have been performed in this area in children and management is largely extrapolated from adult practice where there is a considerable evidence base. This is likely to be unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are significant differences in epidemiology and potential differences in the mechanisms for VTE in this age group. Secondly, many aspects of haemostasis are age-dependant, which has implications for the use of anticoagulants in the paediatric population. Thirdly, there are very limited data available on the safety and efficacy of anticoagulants to manage specific indications in paediatric practice, often with limited paediatric formulations available. In addition, children may survive for a prolonged period following these events so that long-term consequences may be highly significant in this age group. The aim of this guideline is to provide a rational basis for the investigation and management of children aged 1 month?16?years with VTE, including cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). The guideline is targeted at healthcare professionals involved in the management of children and adolescents with VTE, particularly paediatric haematologists.

AB  - Summary What is known and objective:? Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are new oral anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis after elective orthopaedic surgery. We aimed to systematically compare their relative benefits and harms through meta-analysis, and adjusted indirect comparison. Methods:? We searched PubMed, EMBASE, trial registries and regulatory documents through May 2009 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dabigatran (150 and 220?mg daily) and rivaroxaban (10?mg daily) compared with enoxaparin (40?60?mg daily) in elective orthopaedic surgery. We used random effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the outcomes of total venous thromboembolism, VTE (deep venous thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality), and haemorrhagic adverse events (major and clinically relevant non-major bleeds). Adjusted indirect comparison was used for the pooled RRs of dabigatran and rivaroxaban with enoxaparin as the common control. Results:? Rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromoboembolism (RR 0·56, 95% CI 0·43?0·73, P?<?0·0001), with a trend for increased haemorrhage (RR 1·26, 95% CI 0·94?1·69, P?=?0·13). Dabigatran was not superior to enoxaparin for prevention of VTE (RR 1·12, 95% 0·97?1·29, P?=?0·12), and did not reduce haemorrhage risk (RR 1·10, 95% 0·90?1·35, P?=?0·32). Adjusted indirect comparison showed that rivaroxaban was superior to dabigatran in preventing VTE, RR 0·50 (95% CI 0·37?0·68), but with a slight trend towards increased haemorrhage RR 1·14 (95% CI 0·80?1·64). What is new and conclusion:? Rivaroxaban may be more effective than dabigatran for prevention of VTE after elective orthopaedic surgery but might also slightly increase the risk of haemorrhage.

AB  - Summary Background Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment have been challenged by unsubstantiated design assumptions and/or poor accrual. Pilot/feasibility (P/F) studies are critical to future RCT success. Methods The Kids-DOTT trial is a multicenter RCT investigating non-inferiority of a 6-week (shortened) versus 3-month (conventional) duration of anticoagulation in patients aged < 21 years with provoked venous thrombosis. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints are symptomatic recurrent VTE at 1 year and anticoagulant-related, clinically relevant bleeding. In the P/F phase, 100 participants were enrolled in an open, blinded-endpoint, parallel-cohort RCT design. Results No eligibility violations or randomization errors occurred. Of the enrolled patients, 69% were randomized, 3% missed the randomization window, and 28% were followed in prespecified observational cohorts for completely occlusive thrombosis or persistent antiphospholipid antibodies. Retention at 1 year was 82%. Interobserver agreement between local and blinded central determination of venous occlusion by imaging at 6 weeks after diagnosis was strong (k-statistic = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48?1.0). The primary efficacy and safety event rates were 3.3% (95% CI 0.3?11.5%) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.03?7.4%). Conclusions The P/F phase of the Kids-DOTT trial has demonstrated the validity of vascular imaging findings of occlusion as a randomization criterion, and defined randomization, retention and endpoint rates to inform the fully powered RCT.
