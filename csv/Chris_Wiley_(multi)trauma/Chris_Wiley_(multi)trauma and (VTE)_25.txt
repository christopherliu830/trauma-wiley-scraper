AB  - ABSTRACT Background. Darexaban (YM150) is a potent direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor developed for the prophylaxis of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. This drug is rapidly and extensively metabolized to darexaban glucuronide (YM-222714), which is a pharmacologically active metabolite. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of ascending multiple oral doses of darexaban in healthy non-elderly Caucasian and Japanese subjects. Methods. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose-escalating study of healthy Caucasian and Japanese male and female subjects was performed. The tested doses were 20, 60, 120 and 240?mg of darexaban. Results. Plasma concentrations of darexaban glucuronide increased with dose, and Cmax and AUC increased dose-dependently after both single and repeated doses in both Caucasians and Japanese. Cmax was about 17%?19% lower in Caucasians than in Japanese, although AUC appeared to be similar. The time-profiles of prothrombin time reported as the international normalized ratio (PT-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and FXa activity closely followed the time?concentration profile of darexaban glucuronide, and no clear differences were observed in ethnicity. Overall, 38 of the 82 enrolled subjects reported a total of 57 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Fifty-five TEAEs were of mild intensity and two were of moderate intensity. Conclusion. It is concluded that single and multiple doses of darexaban are safe and well tolerated up to 240?mg with predictable PK and PD profiles in both Caucasians and Japanese, and that ethnicity does not affect its PK, PD or tolerability.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Infrared thermal imaging (IRTI) is a new technique for detecting deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on DVT's infrared presentation and distribution characteristics (PDCs). A method that is singularly sensitive to DVT is needed. They, therefore, enrolled 157 subjects with suspected lower extremity DVT in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial using IRTI, and Doppler compression ultrasonography (CPUS) to verify the clinical value of IRTI. Methods An IRTI system could precisely measure and store real-time thermal images. A double-blind, controlled clinical study using IRTI and detection on 157 patients with suspected DVTs, evaluating the following parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive prescreening, negative prescreening, false positivity, false negativity, and diagnostic accordance of IRTI with CPUS for detecting DVT were conducted. Results Of 140 subjects who underwent screening both IRTI and CPUS detect were included for analyses. According to their IRTI DVT's presentation and distribution characteristics, patients were divided into IRTI- negative (n?=?59) and IRTI-positive (including suspicious IRTI positive) (n?=?81) groups. CPUS identified 80 DVT-negative and 60 DVT-positive patients. The sensitivity of IRTI for detecting DVT was 88.33%, specificity 65.00%, false-positive diagnosis 11.67%, false-negative diagnosis 35.00%, positive prescreening 65.43%, negative prescreening 88.14%, diagnostic accordance rate 75.00%. IRTI results accorded with CPUS results (P = .001) except for the positivity incidence (?2?=?39.997, P?<?.001). Conclusions IRTI could be used to supplement CPUS detection for detecting DVTs and adjunctive diagnostic screening.

AB  - PURPOSE: A prospective cohort study was conducted to test our ability to identify chronically ill patients at near term risk of death by asking their primary care physician (PCP) the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of CHF or COPD?' METHODS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if 1) their clinic chart problem list carried a diagnosis of CHF or COPD, 2) they had been hospitalized within the past two years with primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF or COPD, or 3) direct identification by their PCP. Chart review was used to exclude patients erroneously carrying these diagnoses (e.g. coding errors), inactive patients (deceased or changed providers) and those patients with normal ejection fractions or not requiring scheduled ?-2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodialator therapy. Patients were then stratified on the basis of their PCP's response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD?' All patients screened and stratified by the question were followed for the primary endpoint of death. RESULTS: The initial data query identified 190 patients with CHF and/or COPD. A chart review excluded eight inactive patients and thirty-one patients who did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria for significant disease. Of the remaining 151 patients, there were 72 whose PCP answered that he/she would not be surprised if the patient died from CHF and/or COPD in the next year. Within nine months, nine of these patients have died from complications of their CHF or COPD. There have been no deaths in the 79 patients whose PCP answered that they would be surprised if their patient died in the next year from CHF or COPD. (p-value < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Patients with CHF and/or COPD at risk of near term death can be differentiated from those who are not at high risk by the PCPs'response to the question, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died within the next year of their CHF and/or COPD?' Such screening may be useful to more efficiently target palliative services and end of life care planning to patients with advanced CHF and/or COPD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Physical activity (PA) has been shown to prevent many conditions and treat many others. While it is an effective treatment for peripheral vascular disease (PVD), no studies have analyzed the effect of PA in preventing PVD. METHODS: Men and women in the Framingham Heart Study have been examined biannually since 1948 for the presence of PVD and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as well as for CVD risk factors (smoking, Metropolitan weight, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy). PA was assessed in 1956?58 using the previously validated Framingham Physical Activity Index. Subjects were ranked based on weighted PA levels, then grouped into quartiles. We examined the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up, adjusting for baseline levels of CVD risk factors and for the presence of other CVD. We included the 1745 men and 2220 women free of PVD and CVD at baseline who answered the physical activity questions and survived to at least the first follow-up. RESULTS: Among those free of other CVD, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 4.3% and 5.3% in men and 2.3% and 4.5% in women. Including those who developed other CVD first, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 6.6% and 11.1% in men and 3.9% and 7.9% in women. For both men and women, there was no difference in the incidence of PVD between the least active quartile and any of the three more active quartiles. This lack of a difference held up in both the analyses adjusted only for age and in those adjusted for CVD risk factors. There was also no difference whether or not patients with other CVD were included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that while PA may be an effective treatment for PVD, it does not appear to prevent PVD.
