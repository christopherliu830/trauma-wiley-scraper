AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent disease that has a major genetic component of risk. However, known identified genetic risk factors account for <30% of idiopathic (without any environmental origin) VTE cases. This article aims to review the lessons learnt during recent decades in the field of the genetics of VTE, describe the present state-of-art methods and discuss promising themes for finding new susceptibility loci.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Major general surgical operations, especially for malignancy, are associated with a high risk of venous thrombo-embolic (VTE) complications, of which about 40 per cent occur after discharge. In this systematic review we examine the value of extended thrombo-prophylaxis. Methods: Three randomized, controlled trials, which studied 1 week versus 4 weeks of thromboprophylaxis (TP) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), were included in the analysis. We used RevMan (Version 4.1.1, Oxford  P = 0.002). The risk of bleeding was 3.5 per cent in both groups (OR 0.99, 95 per cent CI 0.47?2.06; P = 1). Conclusions: Extended TP results in significant reduction of the risk of developing VTE in patients undergoing major general surgical operations without any increase in the risk of bleeding.

AB  - Summary. Introduction: Several outcome studies have ruled out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) by normal computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We performed a meta-analysis in order to determine the safety of this strategy in a specific group of patients with a strict indication for CTPA, that is, ?likely? or ?high? clinical probability for PE, an elevated D-dimer concentration, or both. Methods: Studies that ruled out PE by normal CTPA, with or without subsequent normal bilateral compression ultrasonography (CUS), in patients with a strict indication for CTPA, were searched for in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane dataset. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of (fatal) venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period. Results: Three studies were identified that excluded PE by CTPA alone (2020 patients), and three studies that performed additional CUS of the legs after normal CTPA (1069 patients). The pooled incidence of VTE at 3 months was 1.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8?1.8] based on a normal CTPA result as a sole test, and 1.1% (95% CI 0.6?2.0) based on normal CTPA and negative CUS findings, resulting in negative predictive values of 98.8% (95% CI 98.2?99.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.0?99.4), respectively. This compares favorably with the VTE failure rate after normal pulmonary angiography (1.7%, 95% CI 1.0?2.7). The risk of fatal PE did not differ between the diagnostic strategies (0.6% vs. 0.5%). Conclusion: A normal CTPA result alone can safely exclude PE in all patients in whom CTPA is required to rule out this disease. There is no need for additional ultrasonography to rule out VTE in these patients.

AB  - Summary In contrast with the extensive and uniform documentation dealing with the short-term outcome of the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities and of pulmonary embolism (PE), sparse and conflicting results are available concerning the long-term clinical course of these diseases. The natural history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the risk of death, which often complicates the evolution of patients with severe or misclassified PE; the risk of recurrent events, which is particularly common in patients with DVT involving the proximal vein system with or without contemporary manifestations of PE; the risk of long-term sequelae, namely the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT, and the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in those presenting with PE; the risk of subsequent overt cancer, which is particularly frequent in the first months following an episode of unprovoked VTE; and the risk of arterial cardiovascular events, which is more common in the first year after the thrombotic episode but persists, although to a lesser extent, for longer periods of time. In this chapter, factors than can help predict the development of these complications in patients with VTE are extensively analysed.

AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - Summary Multiple myeloma is associated with a significant risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), causing substantial levels of morbidity and mortality. The thrombogenicity of myeloma is multifactorial, with disease- and treatment-related factors playing important roles. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and high-dose dexamethasone, in particular, are known to enhance the thrombotic potential of myeloma. For this reason, assessment of the VTE risk has long been advocated prior to treatment initiation in patients with myeloma requiring IMiD-based regimens. However, despite routine use of thromboprophylaxis, these patients can still develop VTE and its sequelae. The optimum choice and dose of thromboprophylactic drug is not entirely clear, and with this, there is growing interest regarding use of the direct oral anticoagulants in this setting. In this review we discuss the pathogenesis of thrombosis in multiple myeloma, its relation to some of the commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens, current risk stratification and the evidence supporting the different anticoagulants used as thromboprophylaxis. We propose an amended risk stratification, and consider management of challenging patients, including those with renal impairment and recurrent thrombosis.

AB  - Summary Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) often occurs in patients with associated autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur in patients without other associated autoimmune disease. Studies of women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-related complications show that women with thrombotic complications of APS have higher rates of pre-term delivery. Women with APS need close monitoring throughout pregnancy. Uterine artery Doppler scanning is recommended at 20-24 weeks, to check for evidence of bilateral uterine arterial notching, which has been shown to be predictive of placental dysfunction in women with APS. If bilateral notching is detected, serial growth scans are performed to monitor for intrauterine growth restriction. Patients present with multi-organ failure due to widespread thrombosis, and there is an associated high mortality rate. They require aggressive management, usually in an intensive care setting, with a combination of steroids, anticoagulation and/or plasma exchange.

Effects of inhalable particulate matter on blood coagulation. This issue, pp 662?8. Summary.? Background:?Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. Objectives: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in a sample of the general population. Methods: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and VTE hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. Results: From a population of 5.4?million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for VTE per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4?p.p.b. increase in ozone (O3); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85?p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide (SO2); 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25??g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02??g/m3 increase in particulate matter ≤?2.5??m in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). For pulmonary embolism (PE) results were: 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for O3; 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) for SO2; 1.07 (1.04, 1.09) for NO2; and 1.05(1.03, 1.06) for PM2.5, respectively. Conclusion: Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis and PE, a disease with a significant fatality rate.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Historically, surgical intervention for liver trauma has been the accepted method of treatment with an associated high percentage of nontherapeutic laparotomies however, conservative management is now advocated in the haemodynamically stable patient. We report our experience of the management of patients admitted with liver trauma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 75 patients admitted with liver trauma over a 9-year period (1992?2001). Fifty-eight were men (median age 25 years; range 1?76 years). Injury severity was determined using the hepatic injury scale (HIS). Results: Sixty-three patients were referred from other hospitals. Seventy-two patients suffered blunt trauma. Six patients were classified as grade 5 on the HIS, 43 as grade 4, 17 as grade 3, 8 as grade 2 and 1 as grade 1. Fifteen patients underwent surgery at the referring hospital, which involved perihepatic packing in 80 per cent. Of the 48 patients treated conservatively at the referring hospital, 43 were successfully treated with further conservative management. In total 23 patients required laparotomy in our unit, 18 for liver related injuries. Procedures included 3 hepatic resections and 13 for hepatorrhaphy. Median blood requirement in our unit was 2 units. Four patients developed definite biliary complications treated with endoscopic stenting in three cases and percutaneous drainage in one. A further five intra-abdominal collections required percutaneous drainage. The mortality rate was 8 per cent. Conclusion: The majority of patients with liver trauma can be successfully treated with conservative management. In unstable patients initial surgical packing and transfer to a specialist unit is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism is a major public health issue, for it is responsible for an estimated 60,000 annual deaths in the United Kingdom. Up to 30% of those affected by deep vein thrombosis have post phlebitic syndrome. Of these 55% are hospital ? acquired, the majority of which can be prevented by appropriate thromboprophylaxis. The main risk factors for venous thromboembolism include immobility, venous perturbation and a prothrombotic state. This chapter covers the diagnosis and immediate management of acute venous thromboembolisms including in pregnancy and in those with an underlying malignancy. The principles of primary and secondary prevention are also discussed.

AB  - Summary In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Summary There has been an explosion of interest in the ability of tranexamic acid to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical and traumatic bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality due to traumatic bleeding by a third, without apparent safety issues. It is now clearly established that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in patients with surgical bleeding and the need for transfusion. It can also be used topically to reduce bleeding. Its use is being explored further in large pragmatic trials in traumatic head injury, postpartum haemorrhage and in upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. There are few side effects from the use of tranexamic acid except when administered in high dose where neurological events have been noted, possibly relating to tranexamic acid interfering with cerebral GABA and glycine receptors. However, clinical studies suggest that there is no increased efficacy in using a higher dose, and that a dose of 1 g intravenously in an adult patient has maximal efficacy, which is not increased by higher doses. The CRASH-2 trauma trial clearly showed no increase in thrombotic events after its use in trauma, indeed there was a significant reduction in myocardial infarction. However, trials of tranexamic acid in surgery have failed to adequately study its effects on the risk of postoperative venous and possible reduction in arterial thrombo-embolism, and this needs to be the subject of future research.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate: (1) the feasibility of MR microscopy T2* mapping by performing a zonal analysis of spatially matched T2* maps and histological images using microscopic in-plane pixel resolution; (2) the orientational dependence of T2* relaxation of the meniscus; and (3) the T2* decay characteristics of the meniscus by statistically evaluating the quality of mono- and biexponential model. Methods Ultrahigh resolution T2* mapping was performed with ultrashort echo time using a 7 Tesla MR microscopy system. Measurement of one meniscus was performed at three orientations to the main magnetic field (0, 55, and 90°). Histological assessment was performed with picrosirius red staining and polarized light microscopy. Quality of mono- and biexponential model fitting was tested using Akaike Information Criteria and F-test. Results (1) The outer laminar layer, connective tissue fibers from the joint capsule, and the highly organized tendon-like structures were identified using ultra-highly resolved MRI. (2) Highly organized structures of the meniscus showed considerable changes in T2* values with orientation. (3) No significant biexponential decay was found on a voxel-by-voxel?based evaluation. On a region-of-interest?averaged basis, significant biexponential decay was found for the tendon-like region in a fiber-to-field angle of 0°. Conclusion The MR microscopy approach used in this study allows the identification of meniscus substructures and to quantify T2* with a voxel resolution approximately 100 times higher than previously reported. T2* decay showed a strong fiber-to-field angle dependence reflecting the anisotropic properties of the meniscal collagen fibers. No clear biexponential decay behavior was found for the meniscus substructures.

AB  - Abstract Current published guidelines for perioperative pharmacy services have limited information on the development and implementation of a robust clinical pharmacy program across the surgical continuum of care. This publication defines the responsibilities and scope of practice of the Perioperative Clinical Pharmacist (PCPh), supporting the PCPh as a critical member of the interprofessional surgical patient care team. Opportunities for pharmacist role integration into perioperative medication management processes are described along with published examples of successful PCPh practice models, including those with interventions targeted toward Enhanced Recovery Pathways (ERP). Recommended training and competencies for future and practicing perioperative pharmacists, in addition to considerations for precepting and scholarly activities, are also outlined. Finally, future developments in perioperative pharmacy practice are discussed, including technological advancements, improved predictive models, and expansion of collaborative practice agreements.
