AB  - Summary Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) can cause complications, including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The majority of primary UEDVTs are caused by abnormalities of the costo-clavicular junction. Central venous catheter (CVC)/peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the most significant cause of secondary UEDVT, and are present in about half of all cases. Goals of therapy of UEDVT include reduction or elimination of symptoms, prevention of DVT progression, or embolisation and reduction of the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Anticoagulation, using the same approach as used for lower extremity DVT (LEDVT), is the mainstay of therapy for UEDVT. Anticoagulants do not result in fibrinolysis. Therefore, vein recanalisation depends on endogenous fibrinolytic processes. Various interventional therapies have been evaluated as a means of attempting to accelerate the process of recanalisation, with the goal of reducing the risk of PTS and, perhaps, the risk of DVT recurrence.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes several clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) rule was created to help emergency clinicians to determine whether PE should be part of the differential diagnosis when the clinician is really not sure whether testing is even merited. Patients investigated for PE in a hospital ward are likely to have a higher Wells score for PE, and a smaller proportion will score 'PE unlikely'. Rule application relies on accurate recall of individual components, a detailed understanding of each component definition, the conversion of positive and negative findings into points, and tallying of the total score. The clinician then has to convert the final score into a dichotomous category. Finally, a prospective study from France demonstrated that deviation from standardised diagnostic PE protocols resulted in a 6% increase in mortality when compared to those who had appropriate protocol driven investigation.

AB  - Summary.? Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important medical problem because of the high fatality rate from PE and the large number of cases not diagnosed before causing death. Over the last decade, there has been considerable research into the diagnostic process. It is widely accepted that venous ultrasound imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of DVT and is the imaging test of choice. For PE, computer tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is replacing ventilation perfusion lung scanning. Technology for CTPA is rapidly evolving and multi-row detector scans have quite reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Despite the accuracy of imaging tests, the post-test probability of disease is highly dependent on pretest probability. Clinical evaluation tools have developed that enable us to accurately categorize patients? risk prior to diagnostic imaging. One advantage of this characterization is an ability to exclude the diagnosis of DVT or PE if clinical probability is sufficiently low and when the D-dimer is negative. There are now a number of D-dimer assays that have well-defined specificities and sensitivities, which enable use in conjunction with clinical probability. A careful combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer and imaging enables safe PE rule out protocols without imaging, an ability to suspect false positive imaging results, and more accurate determination of true positive imaging. These integration strategies result in safer, more convenient and cost-effective care for patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Comparative surgical audit is increasingly important, although fraught due to the difficulty of risk adjusted analysis. The surgical risk score was developed to provide surgeon-independent risk-adjusted mortality in general surgery using readily available clinical indices (CEPOD grade of operative urgency, BUPA grade of operative magnitude and ASA grade of patient comorbidities). Methods: Prospective data collection from 4308 patients admitted under the care of three general surgeons (May 1997?October 1999) created an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was scored by summation of linear scales allocated to CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grades to devise a surgical risk scale (SRS) ranging from 3 to 14. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and uni-variate analysis of the SRS scores were undertaken. Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons (November 1999?December 2000). Results: Uni-variate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death (? = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SRS score did not over predict mortality for low risk procedures. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.931 for the initial data set and 0.951 for the validation set. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret. It has been validated as a tool for risk-adjusted comparative audit in a population of general surgical patients.

AB  - Summary This review is aimed at describing the unique challenges of anticoagulant prophylaxis and treatment in children, and highlighting areas for research for improving clinical outcomes of children with thromboembolic disease. The evidence presented demonstrates the challenges of advancing the evidence base informing optimal management of thromboembolic disease in children. Recent observational studies have identified risk factors for venous thromboembolism in children, but there are few interventional studies assessing the benefit?risk balance of using thromboprophylaxis in risk-stratified clinical subgroups. A risk level-based framework is proposed for administering mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. More research is required to refine the assignment of risk levels. The anticoagulants currently used predominantly in children are unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists. There is a paucity of robust evidence on the age-specific pharmacology of these agents, and their efficacy and safety for prevention and treatment of thrombosis in children. The available literature is heterogeneous, reflecting age-specific differences, and the various clinical settings for anticoagulation in children. Monitoring assays and target ranges are not well established. Nevertheless, weight-based dosing appears to achieve acceptable outcomes in most indications. Given the limitations of the classical anticoagulants for children, there is great interest in the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), whose properties appear to be particularly suitable for children. All DOACs currently approved for adults have Pediatric Investigation Plans ongoing or planned. These are generating age-specific formulations and systematic dosing information. The ongoing pediatric studies still have to establish whether DOACs have a positive benefit?risk balance in the various pediatric indications and age groups.

AB  - Summary.? Decreased levels of most coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia are the main haemostatic abnormalities of cirrhosis. As a consequence, this condition was, until recently, considered as the prototype acquired coagulopathy responsible for bleeding. However, recent evidence suggests that it should, rather, be regarded as a condition associated with normal or even increased thrombin generation. The bleeding events that occur in these patients should, therefore, be explained by the superimposed conditions that frequently occur in this setting. Due to elevated levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) in combination with decreased protein C (anticoagulant driver), which are typically found in patients with cirrhosis, a procoagulant imbalance, defined as a partial resistance to the in vitro anticoagulant action of thrombomodulin, can be demonstrated. Whether this in vitro hypercoagulability is truly representative of what occurs in vivo remains to be established. However, the hypothesis that it may have clinical consequences is attractive and deserves attention. The possible consequences that we discuss herein include whether (i) cirrhosis is a condition associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism or portal vein thrombosis; (ii) the hypercoagulability associated with cirrhosis has any other role outside coagulation (i.e. progression of liver fibrosis); and (iii) anticoagulation should be used in cirrhosis. Although apparently provocative, considering anticoagulation as a therapeutic option in patients with cirrhosis is now supported by a rationale of increasing strength. There may be subgroups of patients who benefit from anticoagulation to treat or prevent thrombosis and to slow hepatic fibrosis. Clinical studies are warranted to explore these therapeutic options.
