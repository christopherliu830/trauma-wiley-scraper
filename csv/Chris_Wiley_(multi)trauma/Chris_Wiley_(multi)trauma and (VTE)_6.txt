AB  - Summary This chapter describes minimally invasive treatments for thrombosis including a multimodality approach centered on interventional radiology, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs target the clot directly by accelerating fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase have been administered intravenously in cats and dogs with thrombosis with variable success. The chapter also talks about clinical signs, diagnostics, intervention, and long-term therapy of central venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, ischemia?reperfusion injury, and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs and cats. Treatment of venous thrombi must be based upon consideration of the overall clot burden and extent, the resulting clinical signs associated with the venous obstruction, and the ability to control the underlying cause of the clot if it is identified. Echocardiography is an easily accessible modality useful in confirming a thrombus in the proximal pulmonary artery. Angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are also useful modalities in confirming and locating the PTE.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes various abdominal vein thromboses, their clinical implications, and strategies of treatment. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, BCS), portal (PVT), splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). The optimal management of SVT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes hepatologists, experts on thrombosis, radiologists and surgeons. In the paediatric population, renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most prevalent non catheter-related thrombosis during the neonatal period. For patients with RVT, a medical therapy, instead of a surgical approach (thrombectomy or nephrectomy), is recommended. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition most commonly diagnosed in the post-partum period. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are generally recommended for 3-6 months in the presence of transient risk factors, whereas a prolonged duration is suggested for idiophatic OVT, cancer-related OVT, and in patients with severe thrombophilia abnormalities.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the Glasgow and Clyde Anticoagulant Service (GCAS) model and discusses the challenges and successes it has experienced in recent years. The overall aim of the Glasgow Anticoagulation Service (GAS) was to reduce the incidence of stroke, and to reduce hospital admissions of patients with high international normalised prothrombin time ratios (INRs). The service uses a capillary sampling system, termed Point Of Care (POC) testing, which improves productivity and provides a quicker and more direct level of patient care. In recent years, with the introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the number of referrals to GCAS of patients with venous thromboembolism has reduced significantly with these patients being treated with a DOAC rather than warfarin. Therefore, in the future, there is the potential for GCAS to become more involved in patient education with the use of DOACs. Overall, the service will continue to adapt to the ever-changing anticoagulant needs of the patients.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Patients medicated with clopidogrel who require orthopaedic surgery present a particular challenge. Whether in an emergency or elective situation the orthopaedic surgeon must balance the risks of ceasing clopidogrel versus the risk of increased bleeding that dual antiplatelet therapy generates. Method:? This paper reviews the current published evidence regarding the risks of continuing clopidogrel, the risks of discontinuing clopidogrel and associated considerations such as venous thromboprophylaxis. Results:? Little good quality evidence exists in regard to perioperative clopidogrel for orthopaedic surgery. Available evidence across non-cardiac and cardiac surgery were assessed and presented in regards to current practices, blood loss for orthopaedic operations, risks when continuing clopidogrel, risks of stopping clopidogrel and also the consideration of venous thromboembolism. Conclusions:? The patients at greatest risk, when discontinuing clopidogrel therapy, are those with drug eluting stents who may be at risk of stent thrombosis. Where possible, efforts should be made to continue clopidogrel therapy through the perioperative period, taking precautions to minimize bleeding. If the risk of bleeding is too high, antiplatelet therapy must be reinstated as soon as considered reasonable after surgery. In addition, patients on clopidogrel who sustain a fall or other general trauma need to be carefully assessed because of the possibility of occult bleeding, such as into the retroperitoneal space. Until more definitive evidence becomes available, this review aims to provide a guide for the orthopaedic surgeon in dealing with the difficult dilemma of the patient on clopidogrel therapy, recommending that orthopaedic surgeons take a team approach to assess the individual risks for all patients and consider continuation of clopidogrel therapy perioperatively where possible.

AB  - Background Application of evidence-based perioperative care protocols reduces complication rates, accelerates recovery and shortens hospital stay. Presently, there are no comprehensive guidelines for perioperative care for gastrectomy. Methods An international working group within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS?) Society assembled an evidence-based comprehensive framework for optimal perioperative care for patients undergoing gastrectomy. Data were retrieved from standard databases and personal archives. Evidence and recommendations were classified according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system and were discussed until consensus was reached within the group. The quality of evidence was rated ?high?, ?moderate?, ?low? or ?very low?. Recommendations were graded as ?strong? or ?weak?. Results The available evidence has been summarized and recommendations are given for 25 items, eight of which contain procedure-specific evidence. The quality of evidence varies substantially and further research is needed for many issues to improve the strength of evidence and grade of recommendations. Conclusion The present evidence-based framework provides comprehensive advice on optimal perioperative care for the patient undergoing gastrectomy and facilitates multi-institutional prospective cohort registries and adequately powered randomized trials for further research.

AB  - Essentials How best to quantify thrombosis risk with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) is unknown. Data from a registry were used to develop the Michigan Risk Score (MRS) for PICC thrombosis. Five risk factors were associated with PICC thrombosis and used to develop a risk score. MRS was predictive of the risk of PICC thrombosis and can be useful in clinical practice. Summary Background Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We developed a score to predict risk of PICC-related thrombosis. Methods Using data from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium, image-confirmed upper-extremity DVT cases were identified. A logistic, mixed-effects model with hospital-specific random intercepts was used to identify factors associated with PICC-DVT. Points were assigned to each predictor, stratifying patients into four classes of risk. Internal validation was performed by bootstrapping with assessment of calibration and discrimination of the model. Results Of 23Â 010 patients who received PICCs, 475 (2.1%) developed symptomatic PICC-DVT. Risk factors associated with PICC-DVT included: history of DVT; multi-lumen PICC; active cancer; presence of another CVC when the PICC was placed; and white blood cell count greater than 12Â 000. Four risk classes were created based on thrombosis risk. Thrombosis rates were 0.9% for class I, 1.6% for class II, 2.7% for class III and 4.7% for class IV, with marginal predicted probabilities of 0.9% (0.7, 1.2), 1.5% (1.2, 1.9), 2.6% (2.2, 3.0) and 4.5% (3.7, 5.4) for classes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The risk classification rule was strongly associated with PICC-DVT, with odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.19, 2.37), 2.90 (95% CI, 2.09, 4.01) and 5.20 (95% CI, 3.65, 7.42) for risk classes II, III and IV vs. risk class I, respectively. Conclusion The Michigan PICC-DVT Risk Score offers a novel way to estimate risk of DVT associated with PICCs and can help inform appropriateness of PICC insertion.

AB  - Summary As survival rates from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have improved dramatically with the introduction of anticoagulant medication, interest has developed in the long-term sequelae of DVT, namely the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Patients often present with lower limb swelling, aching and even venous claudication, six months to two years after having an episode of DVT. Patients with moderate PTS have quality of life scores which are worse than those for patients suffering from chronic lung disease or arthritis, and patients with severe PTS patients have scores similar to patients suffering from congestive heart failure or cancer. The diagnosis of PTS is a clinical one, with investigation used for characterisation of the lesion and detection of reflux, and also to aide with planning treatment. The CEAP classification (Clinical, Aetiology, Anatomy and Pathophysiology) is useful as a research tool to grade the pattern of disease in chronic venous disease patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess differences in the gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells between patients with early recurrent thrombosis vs. patients without recurrent events after withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (uDVT), to identify novel predictors of recurrence. Methods In the discovery population (NÂ =Â 32), a microarray RNA assay followed by RT-PCR confirmation were performed. In the validation population (NÂ =Â 44) a multiple RT-PCR-based strategy was applied to assess genes differentially expressed in the discovery population. Results The sex-adjusted Linear Model for Microarray Data analysis showed 102 genes differentially expressed (PÂ <Â 0.01) in the discovery population. Nineteen of them underwent further confirmation in the validation population. The gene encoding for Acyl-CoA Synthetase Family Member 2 (ACSF2) was underexpressed in recurrent DVT patients in both, the discovery (PÂ =Â 0.007) and validation populations (PÂ =Â 0.004). In the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the areas under the curve of ACSF2 expression were 0.77 and 0.80, respectively. Conclusions For the first time an association between ACSF2 expression and the risk of recurrent DVT is suggested. Should this association be confirmed in larger prospective studies, ACSF2 could become useful for the selection of patients requiring extended anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - Summary Bariatric surgery can facilitate weight loss and improvement in medical comorbidities. It has a profound impact on nutrition, and patients need access to follow-up and aftercare. NICE CG189 Obesity emphasized the importance of a minimum of 2 years follow-up in the bariatric surgical service and recommended that following discharge from the surgical service, there should be annual monitoring as part of a shared care model of chronic disease management. NHS England Obesity Clinical Reference Group commissioned a multi-professional subgroup, which included patient representatives, to develop bariatric surgery follow-up guidelines. Terms of reference and scope were agreed upon. The group members took responsibility for different sections of the guidelines depending on their areas of expertise and experience. The quality of the evidence was rated and strength graded. Four different shared care models were proposed, taking into account the variation in access to bariatric surgical services and specialist teams across the country. The common features include annual review, ability for a GP to refer back to specialist centre, submission of follow-up data to the national data base to NBSR. Clinical commissioning groups need to ensure that a shared care model is implemented as patient safety and long-term follow-up are important.
