AB  - Objectives Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to expand in nontraditional risk groups, and the prevalence of undiagnosed infection remains relatively high in the patient populations of urban emergency departments (EDs). Unfortunately, HIV testing in this setting remains uncommon. The objectives of this study were 1) to develop a physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing model, 2) to implement this model in a high-volume urban ED, and 3) to prospectively characterize the patients who were targeted by physicians for testing and determine the proportions who completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral; tested positive for HIV infection; and were successfully linked into medical and preventative care. Methods An interdisciplinary group of investigators developed a model for performing physician-based diagnostic rapid HIV testing in the ED. This model was then evaluated using a prospective cohort study design. Emergency physicians identified patients at risk for undiagnosed HIV infection using clinical judgment and consensus guidelines. Testing was performed by the hospital's central laboratory, and clinical social workers performed pretest and posttest counseling and provided appropriate medical and preventative care referrals, as defined by the model. Results Over the 30-month study period, 105,856 patients were evaluated in the ED. Of these, 681 (0.64%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60% to 0.69%) were identified by physicians and completed rapid HIV counseling, testing, and referral. Of the 681 patients, 15 (2.2%; 95% CI = 1.2% to 3.6%) patients tested positive for HIV infection and 12 (80%; 95% CI = 52% to 96%) were successfully linked into care. Conclusions A physician-based diagnostic HIV testing model was developed, successfully implemented, and sustained in a high-volume, urban ED setting. While the use of this model successfully identified patients with undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED, the overall level of testing remained low. Innovative testing programs, such as nontargeted screening, more specific targeted screening, or alternative hybrid methods, are needed to more effectively identify undiagnosed HIV infection in the ED patient population.

AB  - Purpose Healing, regeneration, and remodeling of the injured Achilles tendon are associated with notable changes in tendon architecture. However, assessing Achilles microstructural properties with conventional diffusion tension imaging (DTI) remains a challenge because of very short T2/ values of the tendon. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a novel Achilles tendon DTI protocol for a non-invasive investigation of the changes of microstructural integrity in tendinopathy. Methods A novel stimulated echo readout-segmented EPI (ste-RS-EPI) DTI sequence was proposed to achieve a TE of ?14?20 ms for typical b-values of 400?800 s/mm2 on clinical 3T MRI scanners. To further boost tendon MR signal, the Achilles was positioned at the magic angle (?55?°) with respect to the scanner B0 field. The sensitivity of the developed protocol was evaluated in 19 healthy participants and 6 patients with clinically confirmed tendinopathy. Results Compared to spin echo RS-EPI DTI protocol, ste-RS-EPI provided an ?100?200% increase in Achilles MR signal. Tendinopathic Achilles demonstrated a high degree of microstructural disruption based on DTI tractography analysis, with significantly lower (P?<?0.05) axial diffusivity (1.20?±?0.19 vs. 1.39?±?0.10???10?3 mm2/s), radial diffusivity (0.72?±?0.11 vs. 0.81?±?0.08???10?3 mm2/s), and mean diffusivity (0.87?±?0.14 vs. 1.00?±?0.07???10?3 mm2/s), but no significant difference in fractional anisotropy (0.38?±?0.04 vs. 0.38?±?0.05; P?=?0.86). Conclusion Achilles tendon ste-RS-EPI DTI can non-invasively detect the tendinopathy-induced changes to microstructural integrity, consistent with the disruption of collagen arrangement and increased cellularity. This study demonstrated the robustness and sensitivity of the proposed protocol in Achilles tendinopathy.

AB  - Background:? There is a strong recommendation for post-partum thromboprophylaxis following emergency caesarean sections, particularly in overweight women, and following prolonged labour. Aims:? To analyse the incidence and epidemiological factors associated with antepartum and post-partum venous thromboembolism in a large Victorian health service. Methods:? A retrospective study of all 6987 women delivering at Ballarat Health Services between March 1999 and June 2006. Case notes of women with confirmed venous thromboembolism during this period were subjected to detailed analysis. The data were analysed for possible risk factors, the timing of thromboembolism in relation to the pregnancy and any correlation with thromboprophylaxis, if administered. Results:? The rate of venous thromboembolism was 1.14 per 1000 deliveries, with risk factors of age > 30 (100%), obesity (75%), previous history of thromboembolism (62.5%) and caesarean section (37.5%). Majority of cases were diagnosed in first trimester (62.5%), and in the right lower limb (75%). None of the patients had been given thromboprophylaxis. Conclusion:? While the incidence and risk factors were similar to those generally quoted, a much higher incidence was found in early pregnancy, and in the right lower limb. The importance of meticulous screening for risk factors in early pregnancy cannot be overemphasised.

AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - Summary Anticoagulant therapy in obstetrics and gynecology is required in the management of venous thromboembolism, in women with mechanical heart valve replacement, thrombophilia, after prolonged surgeries and malignancies. Without anticoagulation therapy, these conditions carry a high morbidity and mortality. Management includes early mobilization, graduated compression stockings low dose heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression pumps. The most effective tools are thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or fondaparinux. The later agents are associated with higher risk of bleeding, cost and more laboratory monitoring. This chapter gives an overview of anticoagulant therapy in obstetrics and gynecology.
