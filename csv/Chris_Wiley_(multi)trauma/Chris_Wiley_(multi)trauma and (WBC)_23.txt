AB  - Summary Hypersensitivity syndrome associated with teicoplanin has rarely been reported. We report a case with a preceding episode of vancomyin-related neutropenia. A 47-year-old female with cervical spine infection was treated with vancomycin. Neutropenia occurred after 17?days of vancomycin therapy. Vancomycin was changed to teicoplanin, and the neutropenia resolved 4?days later. After 11?days of teicoplanin therapy, a new episode of hypersensitivity syndrome manifested as fever, bilateral neck lymphadenopathy, mild wheezing, hepatitis and increased CRP occurred. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed 3?days later. The patient?s symptoms settled over 1?week following withdrawal of teicoplanin. Naranjo?s ADR algorithm categorized the neutropenia associated with vancomycin and the hypersensitivity syndrome associated with teicoplanin as ?probable?.

AB  - Endothelial activation is pivotal in the development and escalation of sepsis. Central to endothelial activation is the endothelial up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) including E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and PECAM-1. Shed CAMs are also found in circulating soluble forms (sCAMs). We investigated whether sCAMs can be used as biomarkers for the differentiation between septic and non-septic patients. Furthermore, we investigated lymphocyte and monocyte expression of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) ligands for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. Twenty-one septic and 15 critically ill non-septic patients were included. All patients had an APACHE II score above 13 at ICU admission. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Flow cytometry was used to estimate levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sPECAM-1, and the cellular expression of CD11a and CD49d. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sPECAM-1 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls at admission and during the observation period. Lymphocyte and monocyte expression of CD11a and CD49d was suppressed or unaltered in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sPECAM-1 were able to discriminate between septic and non-septic patients, indicating that sCAMs may be potential diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis.

AB  - Background: Surgical intervention is considered an acceptable treatment for morbid obesity. Complications following bariatric surgery procedures (BSPs) may necessitate home parenteral nutrition (HPN). No studies have been published on patients receiving HPN following BSP complications. The study aim was to determine if hypocaloric HPN has an effect on body mass index (BMI), albumin, and HPN complications. Methods: A historic cohort of patients was identified from a clinical database. Obese patients (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) who underwent BSP and received HPN for an anastomotic leak/fistula or bowel obstruction were included. Comparisons for start and end of therapy were made for calorie and protein intake, BMI, white blood cell count, and serum albumin level. Readmissions and metabolic and infectious complications were recorded. Obese patients received hypocaloric feeds to promote weight loss and protein for wound healing. Results: Twenty-three patients were included for an average study length of 1.5 months. Patients received an average of 1.2 g of protein and a median of 13.6 kcal per kg actual body weight (ABW) per day. BMI decreased by 7.1% ± 5.2%, from a median of 39.8 to 37.1, and serum albumin increased by 12.5%, from 2.8 ± 0.5 to 3.2 ± 0.6 g/dL. Readmissions occurred in 52.2% of patients with 40.0% of complications related to HPN. Conclusions: Hypocaloric HPN is efficacious in maintaining adequate nutrition while allowing for weight loss in morbidly obese patients following complications of bariatric surgery. Frequency of HPN complications was comparable to those reported in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Background Accurate data about childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in low- and middle-income countries are lacking. Our study is designed to assess survival of childhood ALL at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) using modified St. Jude Children's Research Hospital protocols. Patients and methods We reviewed the medical records of children 1?18 years of age who were diagnosed with ALL and treated at KHCC from January 2003 through December 2009. Disease characteristics and outcome were analyzed. Results Over a 7-year period, 300 children with ALL were treated. One hundred and seventy-three (57.7%) were males and 127 (42.3%) were females. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years. One hundred and fifty-seven (52.3%) children were classified as low-risk, 118 (39.3%) were standard-risk and 25 (8.3%) were high-risk. Two hundred and sixty-two (88.5%) children had pre-B cell phenotype and 34 (11.5%) had T-cell phenotype. Two hundred and seventy-three (91.3%) children were classified as having CNS I disease, 24 (8%) had CNS II, and 2 (0.67%) had CNS III. Cytogenetic abnormalities included: t(12;21) in 30 (12%) children and t(9;22) in 18 (7.4%). Four (1.3%) children died in induction, 6 (2%) died in first remission and 27 (9%) relapsed. After a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range 0.32?84.5), the estimated 5-year event free survival and overall survival were 80% and 89%, respectively. Conclusion Treatment protocols developed by major cooperative groups and institutions to treat childhood ALL was successfully adapted and suggest that such an approach may be useful in other low- and middle-income countries.
