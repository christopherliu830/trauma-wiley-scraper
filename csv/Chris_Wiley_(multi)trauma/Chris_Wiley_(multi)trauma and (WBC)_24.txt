AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Abstract The complexity of providing adequate care after radiation exposure has drawn increasing attention. While most therapeutic development has focused on improving survival at lethal radiation doses, acute hematopoietic syndrome (AHS) occurs at substantially lower exposures. Thus, it is likely that a large proportion of such a radiation-exposed population will manifest AHS of variable degree and that the medical and socioeconomic costs of AHS will accrue. Here, we examined the potential of rBPI21 (opebacan), used without supportive care, to accelerate hematopoietic recovery after radiation where expected survival was substantial (42%-75%) at 30 days. rBPI21 administration was associated with accelerated recovery of hematopoietic precursors and normal marrow cellularity, with increases in megakaryocyte numbers particularly marked. This translated into attaining normal trilineage peripheral blood counts 2-3 weeks earlier than controls. Elevations of hematopoietic growth factors observed in plasma and the marrow microenvironment suggest the mechanism is likely multifactorial and not confined to known endotoxin-neutralizing and cytokine downmodulating activities of rBPI21. These observations deserve further exploration in radiation models and other settings where inadequate hematopoiesis is a prominent feature. These experiments also model the potential of therapeutics to limit the allocation of scarce resources after catastrophic exposures as an endpoint independent of lethality mitigation.

AB  - Objective Gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) because a single intraarticular injection can lead to long-term expression of therapeutic proteins within the joint. This study was undertaken to investigate the use of a helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd)?mediated intraarticular gene therapy approach for long-term expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) as sustained symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy for OA. Methods In mouse models of OA, efficacy of HDAd?IL-1Ra was evaluated by histologic analysis, micro?computed tomography (micro-CT), and hot plate analysis. In a horse OA model, safety and efficacy of HDAd?IL-1Ra were evaluated by blood chemistry, analyses of synovial fluid, synovial membrane, and cartilage, and gross pathology and lameness assessments. Results In skeletally immature mice, HDAd?IL-1Ra prevented development of cartilage damage, osteophytes, and synovitis. In skeletally immature and mature mice, treatment with HDAd?interleukin-1 receptor antagonist post?OA induction resulted in improved?albeit not significantly?cartilage status assessed histologically and significantly increased cartilage volume, cartilage surface, and bone surface covered by cartilage as assessed by micro-CT. Fewer osteophytes were observed in HDAd?IL-1Ra?treated skeletally immature mice. Synovitis was not affected in skeletally immature or mature mice. HDAd?IL-1Ra protected against disease-induced thermal hyperalgesia in skeletally mature mice. In the horse OA model, HDAd?IL-1Ra therapy significantly improved lameness parameters, indicating efficient symptomatic treatment. Moreover, macroscopically and histologically assessed cartilage and synovial membrane parameters were significantly improved, suggesting disease-modifying efficacy. Conclusion These data from OA models in small and large animals demonstrated safe symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment with an HDAd-expressing IL-1Ra. Furthermore, this study establishes HDAd as a vector for joint gene therapy.

AB  - Abstract With modern risk-adapted therapy, over 80% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in high-income countries (HICs) are cured. In countries with limited resources, however, therapy results for pediatric ALL are still not encouraging. We describe our experience in treating children with ALL using a risk-adapted protocol at a tertiary referral center in Lebanon. From May 2002 to August 2009, 111 consecutive patients 1?21 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL received the CCCL ALL protocol which was based on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV Study. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years 5 months. The male to female ratio was 1.5. Forty-six patients received the intermediate-/high-risk arm and 65 received the low-risk arm. Only one patient (0.9%) died during induction therapy. Relapse occurred in 8 (7.2%) patients. Eight (7.2%) patients died, 4 of whom were in remission. The median follow-up of the patients was 38 months. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were and 88.5% (95% CI: 77.1?94.4) and 78.7% (95% CI: 69.8?88.4), respectively. Our results are comparable to those in HICs in spite of the limited resources and the relatively low socioeconomic status of the Lebanese population. Children treated on this protocol experienced significant toxicity necessitating expert supportive care, but benefited from improved cure rates and prolonged survival. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Tibial plateau fractures are difficult to treat and more likely complicated by subsequent surgical site infection (SSI). There is limited information about its characteristics and related risk factors for SSI. This study was designed as a prospective and multicentre one to address this issue. From July to 15 November in 2014, 235 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and followed up with complete data. Twelve patients (5·1%, 12/235) developed SSI, with 2·1% for deep SSI and 3·0% for superficial SSI. Most of them (10/12) occurred during the hospital stays. The median occurrence time was 6 days after operation (range, 2?26 days). We use univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the potential risk factors. In the univariate analysis, open fracture, prolonged preoperative stay, smoking habitus and preoperative abnormal neutrophil (NEUT) count were significant risk factors for SSI occurrence. However, in multivariate analysis, only open fracture (OR, 3·31; 95%, 1·06?1·84) and current smoking status (OR, 5·68; 95% CI, 1·56?20·66) remained significant. We recommend that smoking cessation programme is introduced at the time of admission to the hospital and elaborative evaluation of fracture severity and soft-tissue damage is performed with an aim of reducing the risk of post-operative SSI.

AB  - Abstract In a 28-year period, 39 (7%) patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (median age 66?years, 64% male) underwent a splenectomy at our institution. Primary indications for splenectomy were refractory thrombocytopenia (36%), progressive spleen related symptoms (33%), emergent splenectomy for splenic rupture (21%), refractory anemia (8%), and prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant (3%). Eleven (28%) patients had anemia at the time of splenectomy, of which 3 (27%) were autoimmune. The median time to splenectomy from CMML diagnosis was 6 months (0-40); perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 43% and 13%, while the median postsplenectomy survival was 25?months (11-38). Durable remission in spleen related symptoms, thrombocytopenia, complications from splenic rupture, and anemia were achieved in 85%, 50%, 62%, and 21% of patients, respectively. Perioperative morbidity (n?=?30) included infections/sepsis in 6 (20%), intraabdominal bleeding in 4 (13%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 3 (10%), and acute lung injury in 2 (7%) patients. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (1-25), with 5 deaths occurring secondary to respiratory failure (n?=?2), multiorgan dysfunction (n?=?2) and hemorrhagic shock (n?=?1). There was no difference in overall survival between CMML patients that underwent splenectomy, in comparison to those that did not. Unlike in myelofibrosis, portal hypertension was not an indication for splenectomy and no patients developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis. In conclusion, apart from being a lifesaving emergent modality in the event of splenic rupture, splenectomy has an important palliative role in patients with CMML, with significant and durable improvements in spleen related symptoms and refractory cytopenias.
