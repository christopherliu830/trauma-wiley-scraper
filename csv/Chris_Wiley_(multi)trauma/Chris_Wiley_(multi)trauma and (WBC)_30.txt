AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

AB  - Abstract Spontaneous biloma and pneumobilia developed in a patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) who presented with acute abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. Bilomas are fluid-filled cysts that develop from a bile leak and are located outside of the biliary system. Pneumobilia is characterized by gas within the biliary system due to an abnormal connection between the biliary tree and adjacent organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. Although hepatobiliary complications are common in SCD, we report on biloma and pneumobilia in a young patient with this condition. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2008;51:288?290. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) consist of a diverse group of lymphoproliferative neoplasms with unique patterns of biology, behavior, and differing responses to therapy. A rare subtype of malignancy arising from cells of putative natural killer (NK) origin is being recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity. Viruses including hepatitis C have been reported in association with various types of NHL but not the NK-cell subtype. We hereby report a unique case of a patient with hepatitis C who developed hepatic NK-cell lymphoma and chronic NK-cell leukemia. Interestingly, we observed clinical and radiologic remission of the neoplasm following treatment with anti-hepatitis C therapy. Am. J. Hematol. 78:212?215, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Major surgery comes with a high risk for postoperative inflammatory complications. Preoperative risk scores predict mortality risk but fail to identify patients at risk for complications following cardiovascular surgery. We therefore assessed the value of preoperative red cell distribution width (RDW) as a predictor for pneumonia and sepsis after cardiovascular surgery and studied the relation of RDW with hematopoietic tissue activity. Methods RDW is an easily accessible, yet seldomly used parameter from routine haematology measurements. RDW was extracted from the Utrecht Patient Orientated Database (UPOD) for preoperative measurements in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic anuerysm repair (AAA)(N = 136) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)(N = 2193). The cohorts were stratified in tertiles to assess effects over the different groups. Generalized Linear Models were used to determine associations between RDW and postoperative inflammatory complications. Hematopoietic tissue activity was scored using fluor-18-(18F)-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography and associated with RDW using linear regression models. Results In total, 43(31.6%) and 73 patients (3.3%) suffered from inflammatory complications after AAA-repair or CABG, respectively; the majority being pneumonia in both cohorts. Postoperative inflammatory outcome incidence increased from 19.6% in the lowest to 48.9% in the highest RDW tertile with a corresponding risk ratio (RR) of 2.35 ([95%CI:1.08-5.14] P = 0.032) in AAA patients. In the CABG cohort, the incidence of postoperative inflammatory outcomes increased from 1.8% to 5.3% with an adjusted RR of 1.95 ([95%CI:1.02-3.75] P = 0.044) for the highest RDW tertile compared with the lowest RDW tertile. FDG-PET scans showed associations of RDW with tissue activity in the spleen (B = 0.517 [P = 0.001]) and the lumbar bone marrow (B = 0.480 [P = 0.004]). Conclusion Elevated RDW associates with increased risk for postoperative inflammatory complications and hematopoietic tissue activity. RDW likely reflects chronic low-grade inflammation and should be considered to identify patients at risk for postoperative inflammatory complications following cardiovascular surgery.
