AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare but important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity. Predicting the severity and outcome of AP in pediatric patients can be challenging because there are few validated severity scoring systems. Moreover, the etiology of pediatric AP in the Japanese population is different from that of Western populations. The performance of severity scores in pediatric AP with a high prevalence of severe cases is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of existing severity scoring systems when used for Japanese children at a tertiary care center. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of all children (≤18?years) treated for AP at between 2002 and 2012 at National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo. The modified Glasgow acute pancreatitis severity score (modified Glasgow), Ranson criteria (Ranson), Balthazar computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and pediatric acute pancreatitis severity (PAPS) score were assessed for their ability to distinguish severe pancreatitis from the milder forms. Results Thirty-three Japanese children with AP were identified. Among them, 37 episodes were analyzed for the performance of the scoring systems and 33 for the etiology. The most common etiology of AP was structural abnormality (n = 8). Sensitivity for the modified Glasgow, Ranson, PAPS, and CTSI was 42.9%, 52.4%, 81.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, while specificity was 81.3%, 81.3%, 37.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Conclusion We found PAPS to be the most reliable when used for discriminating the severe form of AP from the milder forms at a Japanese tertiary pediatric care center.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - Although myocardial injury can be a significant component of multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in association with septicemia in critically ill human patients, it is as yet an undefined clinical entity in equine septicemia. With septicemia as the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MODS will be important in further improving survival rates. We designed a prospective study to establish normal ranges for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), T (cTnT) and CKMB mass in healthy 24?48 hour old foals, as well as septicemic neonatal foals seen over a 2-year period in a teaching hospital. We also performed a comparison of these biomarkers in surviving and non-surviving septicemic foals. Sepsis was judged on the basis of the presence of any of the 3 following criteria: blood culture positive at admission, admission sepsis score ≥11, or 3 or more sites of infection during hospitalization in foals ≤14 days of age. cTnI was measured by the ACCESS? (Beckman Coulter), cTnT was measured using the Elecsys 2010? Immunoassay (Roche), and CKMB mass measurements were performed using the Elecsys 2010?. Each parameter was described using range and 95th and 50th percentile. Comparisons were made for each parameter between normal and septic foals as well as surviving and non-surviving septic foals using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was set at p<0.05. There were 52 control foals and 38 septic foals of which 22 survived. Significant differences were documented for CKMB between septicemic and normal foals, but not for cTnT or cTnI. However, CKMB and cTnT were significantly lower in surviving versus non-surviving septicemic foals. The 50th and 95th percentiles alongside the ranges for the normal foal population were 0.14, 0.49, (0.01?0.51)??g/L for cTnI, 0.009, 0.03, (0.009?0.04)??g/L for cTnT and 2.3, 7.4, (0.4?9.3)??g/L for CKMB. Our findings suggest that myocardial injury is a component of MODS during septicemia in foals, and that quantitatively significant increases in CKMB and cTnT are seen in non-surviving septicemic foals versus survivors.

AB  - While potent analgesic agents, opioids reduce intestinal transport in the intestine, thereby increasing transit times and the potential for impaction colic. Methylnaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, does not reverse the analgesic effects of morphine, and directly stimulates isolated smooth muscle strips in humans. Objective: To determine if N-methynaltrexone has an effect on contractile activity of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure. Study Design: In vitro investigation using isolated circular smooth muscle strips. Animals: 8 adult horses (n=200 muscle strips). Methods: Increasing concentrations of N-methylnaltrexone were added to tissue baths in the range of 1?10?9?M to 1?10?5?M, and contractile responses were recorded for 3 minutes. Data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with statistical significance as P<0.05. Results: The administration of N-methylnaltrexone significantly increased the contractile frequency and amplitude at all concentrations relative to baseline (P <0.0001) for the jejunum. The response was greatest at 1?10?7?M (P=0.0005) with a mean difference from baseline of 0.341?mg/cm2. The highest concentration evaluated (1?10?5?M) had a mean contractile strength of 0.206?mg/cm2 which was significantly greater than baseline activity (P=0.04). A significant increase in contractile activity for the colon was detected at 3?10?6?M (P=0.027) and 1?10?5?M (P=0.002). Clinical Relevance: Potentially, this agent could be used in conjunction with morphine to provide more potent and effective analgesia without compromising intestinal function.

AB  - The ischemia-reperfusion seen in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) could cause oxidative stress, decrease antioxidant capacity, and predispose patients to higher morbidity and mortality. Elevated lactate levels in dogs with GDV have been previously found to be a negative prognostic indicator. The purpose of this study was to serially evaluate oxidant and antioxidant concentrations in dogs with GDV and to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of antioxidant depletion and lactate levels. Dogs presenting to the Tufts Emergency Service that had not been treated with corticosteroids or fluids prior to admission and were not receiving antioxidant supplementation were eligible for the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of initial catheter placement pre-operatively (Time 0), and then 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of oxidants [malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radical trapping capacity (ORAC) and F2 isoprostanes] and antioxidants (α-tocopherol, ? -tocopherol, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate differences in the variables over the 48-hour period and Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 2 continuous variables. To date, 8 dogs have been enrolled in the study (1 female and 7 males, with a mean age of 8.0±2.2 years). All dogs have survived to discharge. The chart below indicates differences in parameters measured during hospitalization. Variable Time 0?median (range) 24 hours?median (range) 48 hours?median (range) P?Value MDA (nmol/L) 0.725 (0.532?1.250) 0.500 (0.423?0.870) 0.512 (0.388?0.890) 0.008 α-tocopherol (ug/ml) 16.350 (3.800?29.400) 11.300 (6.760?30.800) 12.950 (7.850?40.400) 0.000 ?-tocopherol (ug/ml) 0.402 (0.138?0.776) 0.293 (0.000?0.500) 0.300 (0.000?0.503) 0.501 Mean plasma lactate upon admission was 4.3?mmol/L (range 2.1?7.2?mmol/L). There was a positive correlation between ?-tocopherol and lactate (r=0.784, P=0.012) but there were no correlations between lactate and MDA or α-tocopherol. Additional dogs are currently being enrolled in the study and analyses of the other variables (ORAC, F2 isoprostanes, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase) are pending. These preliminary results support the hypothesis of alterations in oxidant and antioxidant parameters in dogs with GDV.

AB  - Objective: To determine if 1) administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) would result in alteration of heart rate and fractional shortening parameters and 2) if administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) prior to administration of a dissociative sedative combination (ketamine-diazepam) would blunt increases in heart rate and fractional shortening parameters previously reported with the use of dissociative-based sedation. Design: Single blinded, randomized, crossover design. Animals: Eleven privately owned healthy cats with normal echocardiograms. Procedure: All cats received each of the following injections with at least one week separating each treatment: Treatment A (TA) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) and hydromorphone (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment B (TB) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by ketamine (6?mg/kg IM) and diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment C (TC) ? diazepam and hydromorphone combined in the same syringe followed in 15?minutes by ketamine and diazepam combined in the same syringe. Echocardiograms were performed using the right parasternal position 15?minutes after the second injection. Heart rate (HR) and parameters to determine fractional shortening (FS) in the short axis view were recorded in triplicate for each treatment group. An analysis of variance for repeated measures with a Fisher's LSD protected t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Fractional shortening was significantly increased in each treatment group compared to baseline (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in FS between TA and TB (p<0.05), TA and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p=0.9). Heart rate was not significantly increased between baseline and TA. There was a significant increase in HR between baseline and both TB and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The increase in fractional shortening induced by dissociative-based chemical restraint in normal cats is not blunted by the prior administration of a neuroleptanalgesia combination. The increase in fractional shortening following administration of the neuroleptanalgesia combination may have been due to an indirect increase in sympathetic tone (stress response).

AB  - Improved options for the successful transport of horses trapped in inaccessible areas (floodwater, steep ravines, etc.) during a disaster or emergency are available to practitioners using helicopter assets and the Anderson Sling?. Horses present a particularly difficult problem to remove from the rescue environment of a wide flooded area, or difficult steep terrain far from access by vehicles or heavy equipment. Due to their fractious and fearful nature, they may fight any effort to walk, climb or swim them to safety, and those attempts are inherently very dangerous for the rescuer(s). Unfortunately, many disaster or emergency scenarios may occur in areas not conducive to the use of other options (barge, rescue glide, simple vertical lift sling). Veterinary practitioners on scene should have familiarity with helicopter sling-load operations. The use of cargo nets, inappropriate home-made slings, and inadequate equipment has contributed to disastrous efforts by well-intentioned rescuers. There have even been desperate attempts at sling loading of cattle by roping the horns or one leg and transporting them into a waiting truck for removal from public lands. The Anderson Sling? has been successfully used for helicopter operations in multiple emergencies and training demonstration flights, and is the only Equine Sling recommended for this purpose. Although it was originally intended for clinical use in long-term recovery cases, it has become the industry standard for helicopter operations with equines because of its demonstrated safety margin, design and strength. In clinical use, leg straps further distribute the animal's weight to the legs, but are not necessary in rescue lifts. In some states, there are Large Animal Rescue Teams associated with the Veterinary School, the State Emergency Management Association, or local private Equine Ambulance Services that may have equipment and personnel trained in helicopter sling-loading. This is a specialty interest that requires prior coordination, significant planning, and training of all personnel involved.
