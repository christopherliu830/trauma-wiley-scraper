AB  - Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA is a neuronopathic lysosomal storage disease, characterised by heparan sulphate and other substrates accumulating in the brain. Patients develop behavioural disturbances and cognitive decline, a possible consequence of neuroinflammation and abnormal substrate accumulation. Interleukin (IL)-1? and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression were significantly increased in both murine models and human MPSIII patients. We identified pathogenic mechanisms of inflammasome activation, including that disease-specific 2-O-sulphated heparan sulphate was essential for priming an IL-1? response via the Toll-like receptor 4 complex. However, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA primary and secondary storage substrates, such as amyloid beta, were both required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate IL-1? secretion. IL-1 blockade in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice using IL-1 receptor type 1 knockout or haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy over-expressing IL-1Ra reduced gliosis and completely prevented behavioural phenotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1 drives neuroinflammation, behavioural abnormality and cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA, highlighting haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy treatment with IL-1Ra as a potential neuronopathic lysosomal disease treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background Children and adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are reported to have increased relapse rates and therapy-related mortality (TRM). Treatment regimens for DS-ALL patients often include therapy modifications. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium protocols have used same risk-stratified treatment for patients with and without DS. Procedures We compared clinical and outcome data of DS (n = 38) and non-DS (n = 1,248) patients enrolled on two consecutive DFCI ALL trials 00?001 (2000?2004) and 05-001 (2005?2011) with similar risk adapted therapy regardless of DS status. Results There was no difference in demographic or presenting clinical features between two groups except absence of T-cell phenotype and lower frequency of hyperdiploidy in DS-ALL group. All DS-ALL patients achieved complete remission; four relapsed and one subsequently died. There was no TRM in DS-ALL patients. DS-ALL patients had significantly higher rates of mucositis (52% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), non-CNS thrombosis (18% vs. 8%; p = 0.036), and seizure (16% vs. 5%, p = 0.010). Compared to non-DS-ALL patients, DS-ALL patients had a higher incidence of infections during all therapy phases. The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates of DS-ALL patients were similar to non-DS-ALL patients (91% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81?100] vs. 84% [95% CI, 82?86]; 97% [95% CI, 92?100] vs. 91% [95% CI, 90?93]). Conclusion The low rates of relapse and TRM indicate that uniform risk-stratified therapy for DS-ALL and non-DS-ALL patients on DFCI ALL Consortium protocols was safe and effective, although the increased rate of toxicity in the DS-ALL patients highlights the importance of supportive care during therapy.

AB  - In order to determine the impact of chickenpox on the general population, we conducted a retrospective study in four medical centres in central Israel. Hospital records of 182 patients discharged with the diagnosis of varicella during a 3-y period were reviewed. The patients' mean age was 7.9 y. A total of 14 patients (8%) were immunocompromised. Bacterial skin or soft tissue infection was the most common complication (32%). Other complications included gastrointestinal manifestations (14%), pneumonia (12%), febrile seizures (10%) and CNS complications (9%). Twenty-one percent of patients were discharged with the diagnosis of uncomplicated varicella. One patient died, one underwent liver transplantation for liver failure and four had persistent neurological sequelae. Forty-four patients (24%) received acyclovir for an average duration of 5.7 d. The mean hospital stay was 4.3 d; it was significantly longer for patients with CNS complications (8 d). We estimate that the hospitalization rate in Israel is 1/285 cases of chickenpox. While mortality from varicella was found to be relatively rare, the economic burden of this infection in Israel is quite substantial.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.
