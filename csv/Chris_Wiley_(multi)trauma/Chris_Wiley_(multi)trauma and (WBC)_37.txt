AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Abstract A retrospective series of five cases of nontraumatic gross adrenal hemorrhage were identified in 800 consecutive forensic autopsies. All patients were males, of different ethnicities and with ages ranging from 2 to 48 years. All patients had a clinical history and autopsy findings suggestive of sepsis. Pre- or postmortem microbiological cultures were variably positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The fifth case was positive for yeast and a coagulase negative staphylococcus; contamination of this culture medium cannot be excluded. No cases had a culture positive for Neisseria meningitidis. We find that the reviewed patients with grossly or microscopically identifiable adrenal hemorrhage were otherwise healthy individuals who died suddenly as a consequence of bacterial infection. In each case, signs and symptoms compatible with premortem adrenal insufficiency were reported; in no instance was the adrenal hemorrhage clinically identified.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administration is the most prevalent treatment for acute ischemic within golden time. However, the effects of rt-PA on the kidney function in such patients remain unknown. This study determined long-term renal outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving systemic rt-PA. Methods We enroled patients who were hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke from January 2001 to January 2017. We applied 1:2 propensity score matching to eliminate various confounding variables. We defined surrogate renal outcomes as declining of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30% and 50%, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with eGFR less than 60?mL/min. We then compared the 1-year eGFR with paired t-test in patients treated with or without rt-PA. Results Overall, 343 of 1739 patients received rt-PA within golden time. After 1:2 propensity score matching, their baseline characteristics were grouped as treated with rt-PA (n?=?235) or not (n?=?394). rt-PA-treated patients exhibited slower renal progression, including the risk of eGFR declining greater than 30% (hazard ratio (HR), 0.72; P?=?0.03), risk of declining eGFR greater than 50% (HR, 0.63; P?=?0.046) and risk of CKD (HR, 0.61; P?=?0.005). After 1-year cohort, the rt-PA group exhibited an improved renal outcome by the paired t-test (propensity match: ?GFR?=?9.1 (95% confidence interval: 6.3, 11.8), P?<?0.001 in rt-PA group; ?GFR?=??1.1 (95% confidence interval: ?2.9, 0.7), P?=?0.23 in non-rt-PA group). In patients with eGFR less than 45?mL/min (n?=?34), intracerebral haemorrhage was not reported. Conclusion Patients receiving rt-PA for acute ischemic stroke exhibit favourable renal outcomes, and no increased incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage occurs in rt-PA patients with advanced CKD.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study was undertaken to determine whether intensive care unit nurses possess adequate knowledge to implement the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system and to understand nurses? attitudes towards this scoring system. Design.? A questionnaire, which contained 20 multiple-choice questions to test knowledge of the scoring system and 27 statements with a five-points Likert type scale to assess attitude, was developed by researchers for this study. Methods.? The participants consisted of 102 intensive care unit nurses working in adult, emergency, or coronary intensive care units in a large teaching hospital (Veterans General Hospital) in Taiwan, where the APACHE II scoring system is used routinely by nurses. Results.? On the knowledge section of the questionnaire, 76% of the questions were answered correctly. However, more than 50% of the nurses were uncertain about how to score a patient's chronic history status, only 44.1% of the nurses knew that APACHE II total scores range from 0 to 71, and only 37.3% understood that the value for bicarbonate in venous samples could replace the arterial pH value. The results of the attitude questionnaire revealed that nurses believed APACHE II was useful mainly for statistical purposes by the administration rather than for patient care, but acknowledged that the scores could provide a reference for more aggressive treatment. Conclusions.? The questionnaire answers indicated that greater knowledge concerning the APACHE II is needed. Relevance to clinical practice.? Information and training concerning the proper use and purpose of APACHE II needs to be provided, especially for those intensive care unit nurses using this evaluation tool to score patients? conditions routinely.

AB  - Abstract Sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients who develop ulcers appear to have a more severe haemolysis-associated vasculopathy than individuals who do not develop them, and manifest other complications such as priapism and pulmonary hypertension. SCLUs are slow to heal and often recur, affecting both the emotional and physical well-being of patients. Here we summarise what is known about the pathophysiology of SCLUs, describe available treatment options and propose a treatment algorithm.
