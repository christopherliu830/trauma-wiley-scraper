AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the neurologic deficits associated with profound hyponatremia in 2 critically ill foals. Series summary: A 4-month-old Thoroughbred colt and an 11-day-old Paint filly presented for acute diarrhea and depression. Severe neurologic deficits including blindness and head pressing were noted upon initial examination along with marked hyponatremia observed on biochemistry profile. Aggressive intravenous sodium replacement increased the serum sodium concentration to subnormal values with concurrent resolution of neurologic deficits. Intensive monitoring and fluid therapy were continued; the Thoroughbred colt was euthanized due to lack of response to the primary disease while the Paint filly was discharged clinically healthy without further complications. New or unique information provided: Mild hyponatremia (122?132?mEq/L) is a common clinicopathologic finding in equine medicine associated with a variety of diseases. The vast majority of horses with mild hyponatremia do not demonstrate direct clinical manifestations as a result of low serum sodium concentration. However, when severe acute hyponatremia occurs (<122?mEq/L), such as with acute enterocolitis, subtle to profound neurologic deficits may be observed and immediate and rapid treatment as well as serial evaluations of serum sodium concentration are warranted. Significant, and potentially permanent, neurologic deficits can occur if water balance and tonicity are not properly addressed. The cases presented here describe additional cases of a previously published disease in foals, acute hyponatremia and associated neurologic deficits, and describe the microscopic examination of the central nervous system in one foal that did not survive.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To describe a severe case of bacterial sepsis and disseminated candidiasis in a previously healthy dog. Case Summary ? Fungal sepsis was identified in a 2-year-old dog following intestinal dehiscence 4 days after abdominal surgery. Septic peritonitis was identified at admission and evidence of dehiscence at the previous enterotomy site was found during an exploratory laparotomy. Both gram-positive cocci and Candida albicans were cultured from the abdominal cavity. Candida sp. was also subsequently cultured from a central venous catheter. Euthanasia was performed due to failure to respond to therapy. Fungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida spp., were found in the lungs and kidney on postmortem histopathologic examination indicating disseminated candidiasis. New or Unique Information Provided ? Candida peritonitis is a well-recognized entity in humans and contributes to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Abdominal surgery, intestinal perforation, presence of central venous catheters, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are all considered to be suspected risk factors. This report describes the first known case of systemic candidiasis occurring secondary to Candida peritonitis and bacterial sepsis in a critically ill dog.

AB  - Background: The effect of an oral bile salt binder, cholestyramine, on parenteral nutrition-related hepatic dysfunction and lidocaine metabolism was studied in rats. Methods: Rats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: the PN group received infusions of dextrose and amino acids; the PNC group was treated the same as the PN group, but also received oral cholestyramine; CF group animals were fed rat food and water. Lidocaine metabolism was studied in livers isolated from animals after 7 days of parenteral nutrition. Results: No differences in liver function test values of PN and PNC groups were detected compared with group fed rat food. However, lidocaine metabolism was found to be significantly reduced in both the PN and PNC groups. Significant reductions were observed in the hepatic extraction ratio (23% and 15%) and in intrinsic clearance (61% and 53%) in PN and PNC animals, respectively (p <.05). Material balance at steady state showed that recovery of lidocaine was threefold higher in the PN group and twofold higher in the PNC group than the rat food group (p <.05). Metabolite-to-drug ratios were determined for each lidocaine metabolite and this revealed significant reductions in N-dealkylation (64% and 57%) and aryl methyl hydroxylation (92% and 86%) in PN and PNC animals, respectively (p <.05). Conclusions: Histologic fmdings suggest that cholestyramine feeding prevented liver dysfunction, possibly through interruption of secondary bile salt reabsorption. However, lidocaine metabolism was still impaired after cholestyramine ingestion; the impairment mechanism remains unknown. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 20:349?356, 1996)

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Abstract Women with antithrombin (AT) III deficiency are prone to pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism. We report 2 cases with genetically confirmed ATIII deficiency, one with a mutation in exon 3A and the other with an exon 4 deletion, in whom the pregnancies were successfully managed with prophylactic therapies for thrombosis. A 35-year-old pregnant woman was treated with intravenous infusions of ATIII concentrate alone, and the other 22-year-old pregnant woman was mainly treated with subcutaneous injections of heparin and oral low-dose aspirin therapy. Both pregnancies resulted in vaginal deliveries of healthy neonates. The literature concerning prophylactic therapies for thrombosis in ATIII deficiency-complicated pregnancy is reviewed, and the clinical problems, including the adverse effects of the therapies, are discussed.
