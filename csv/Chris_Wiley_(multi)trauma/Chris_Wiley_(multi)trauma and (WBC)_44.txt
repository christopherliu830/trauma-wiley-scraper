AB  - Aim: To evaluate prospectively the usefulness of routine drainage of the neck following thyroid surgery and its effect on patient comfort. Method: Consecutive patients who underwent elective thyroid surgery were randomized to receive suction drainage or no drainage of the neck at the end of the operation. Drains were removed on the first postoperative day and all patients underwent sonographic examination of the neck to determine the dimension of the remaining haematoma. Pain relating to the operation was assessed at 6 hours post operation and on Day 1 by visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain caused by drain removal was also assessed similarly. Postoperative complications and the lengths of hospital stay were also recorded. Results: 60 patients were recruited and randomized, an equal number of patients with similar demographic characteristics were present in each group. The table below shows a summary of the results. The mean pain score for pain caused by drain removal was 3.1 (range: 0?6). There was no difference for complication rate and the postoperative lengths of hospital stay for the two groups. Conclusion: Routinely draining the neck for thyroid surgery not only failed to reduce the amount of postoperative haematoma and complication but also resulted in greater patient discomfort. Drains should therefore not be used routinely following thyroid surgery.

AB  - Introduction: External ventricular drains (EVD) are used for intracranial pressure monitoring and temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage in neurosurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid infection is the major complication. Previous prospective epidemiological study from Mayhall (1) had recommended that the EVD should be changed every 5 days to reduce CSF infection. However, subsequent different retrospective series had yielded conflicting results. Hypothesis: The aim was to test whether the practice of exchange of EVD every five days could reduce the CSF infection rate and subsequently improve outcome in terms of ICU stay, hospital stay, 3-month outcome and mortality. Method: We carried out a randomized controlled clinical trial between 11/1998 and 11/2000. 103 patients who needed EVD for more than 5 days and had no evidence of CSF infection on presentation were included. The patients were randomized between change (every five days) and no change of external ventricular drain. Results: Conclusion: The practice of regular exchange of EVD did not reduce CSF infection rate and did not improve outcome. This is in agreement with the current thinking that CSF infection mainly originated from the procedure of ventriculostomy. The associated high cost with regular exchange of EVD (operations and new catheters) did not seem to be justified. Thus, the practice of regular exchange of EVD should be abandoned.

AB  - The objective of the study is to find out the efficiency of video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis and predisposing factors of postoperative complications. This is a retrospective study that those who had VATS pleurodesis from January 1994 to December 2000 were recruited. There were consecutive 306 VATS pleurodesis performed on 271 patients. These included 33 female and 238 male patients from 15 to 73 years old. 31 of them had bilateral procedures. 244 of them had primary spontaneous pneumothoraces and 27 of them had secondary pneumothoraces. Most of them had two or more episodes of pneumothoraces and persistent air leakage >14 days before operations. 15 patients had failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before VATS. There was no operative death. Usually they were discharged within five days after operations. There were 21 persistent air leakage >5 days (6.8%), 1 bleeding required surgical haemostasis (0.3%) and 4 infectious complications (1.3%). Follow up duration was up to 72 months. There was 12 recurrence (3.9%) after discharge. Absence of blebs, presence of pleural adhesion, prolonged chest tube placement before VATS pleurodesis, and failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before are the predisposing factors of complications.

AB  - Introduction: Image-detected breast lesion is becoming a concern in surgery. After triple assessment, a suspicious or indeterminate lesion will usually require excision to rule out malignancy. Vacuum-assisted biopsy is newly introduced as a minimally invasive alternative to operation in obtaining tissue for histological assessment. The early experience of this procedure in the Breast Centre of Kwong Wah Hospital is reviewed. Method: Vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed for image-detected breast lesions under local anaesthesia using the Mammotome. Lesions were either vaguely palpable or non-palpable but well seen on ultrasound scan with fine needle aspirated indeterminate cytology or benign cytology in a high risk patient. Definitive surgery was performed if the biopsy result showed malignancy or upon patient?s request. Other patients were followed up six monthly with clinical examination and ultrasound scan. Excision was indicated if there was any increase in size. The pathology was assumed to be benign if there was no change in six months time. Result: From September 1998 to May 2000, 49 female patients were included. One of them had 2 lesions making a total of 50 cases. The mean age of the patients was 45.5 (22?58). The mean size of the lesion was 10.8mm (4?19). The procedure took 5?55 min (mean 16.6). It was successful in 49 cases (98%). Four lesions were found to be malignant. Three patients had definitive operations with the pathology confirmed while one patient defaulted follow up. Amongst the 45 benign lesions, 3 were excised upon request. The pathology were all benign. For the remaining 42 patients. 23 were followed up for 12 months and 19 patients for 6 months. Three patients were found to have enlarging lesions and excisions were performed which revealed benign histology. The breast lumps of the remaining 39 patients either remained unchanged or diminished size. There were no major complications (wound haematoma, infection). The average linear pain score (minimum 1, maximum 5) was 2.0. Conclusion: Vacuum-assisted biopsy is an accurate diagnostic tool with the advantage of minimal morbidity.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of choice for breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy or in selected case breast conserving surgery. Typically, patient will have a long hospital stay after surgery due to the collection of lymph. Premature removal of drain will incur seroma formation and may predispose to wound infection. Review of literature shows that there has not been adequate address to this condition, particularly the use of pressure garment in reducing lymph output. We report our experience in an interim analysis of a randomized controlled study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of pressure garment on early removal of drains, shortening of hospital stay and reducing the incidence of seroma formation. Methodology: From September 1999 to November 2000, 44 consecutive patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer were invited to participate in this study. Our occupational therapist arranged for tailor made pressure garments. Soft foam mimicking the external mammary prosthesis was fashioned so that appropriate pressure was applied on to the operative site to prevent lymph accumulation. They were randomized into two groups (1) with pressure garment (2) without pressure garment. The single surgeon performing the mastectomy was blinded until the completion of surgery when the result of randomization was sought from the principal investigator. The occupational therapist inspected daily to ensure the vest was filled satisfactorily. OPD assessments were arranged at 2 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: (range in parentheses) Conclusion: Use of breast pressure garment did not prevent seroma formation but reduced the volume of drainage and facilitated early removal of drains resulting in a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay of 2.7 days. Such breast vest has great impact on the hospital economy.

AB  - The increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is higher for proximal than for distal tumors. As microsatellite instability (MSI) is a feature of proximal tumors, we hypothesize that an increase in MSI tumors may account for the age-related proximal shift in CRC. Methods: A representative sample of 230 CRCs from 3 age groups was selected from a CRC database. MSI was determined by PCR. MLH1 and MSH2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the methylation of the MLH1 gene promotor (PM) by methylation-specific PCR. Results: MSI tumors became more frequent (p < 0.01 chi square) and more proximal in distribution (p = 0.01 loglinear) in the oldest age group. MSI was associated with loss of expression of MSH2 in the young age group. PM and inactivation of MLH1 increased with age. Conclusion: MSI tumors became more frequent and proximal in older patients. This trend was associated with differences in the underlying mechanisms responsible for the MSI phenotype.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate prospectively use of the haemorrhoid circular stapler (HCS) in day case haemorrhoidectomy. Methods: Patients with prolapsing piles needing haemorrhoidectomy who met the criteria for day surgery were recruited. In addition to the standard practice, a comprehensive explanation regarding the procedure was given at the preoperative assessment clinic. All patients received lactulose 2 consecutive days before surgery and a prophylactic dose of intravenous metronidazole on induction of anaesthesia. Haemorrhoidectomy was performed with the circular stapler (HCS33-Ethicon Endosurgery) employing the Longo technique. A diclofenac suppository and absorbable anal dressing were administered at the end of the procedure. Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale prior to discharge on the same day. Patients were discharged with a bulking agent plus lactulose, oral diclofenac, TNG ointment and a telephone number to call for queries. Patients were seen at 1, 4 and 12 weeks after surgery during which time they would report on symptoms, duration of rest and overall satisfaction. Results: 20 patients underwent the procedure. Only 1 patient required hospital admission, due to side effects of general anaesthesia. The mean pain score on discharge was 3.8 (range: 0?8). All patients were able to take up normal activities within the first week and passed regular motions with relatively mild symptoms. Conclusion: Day case haemorrhoidectomy is not only feasible using the HCS, good patient satisfaction can also be achieved.

AB  - Background: Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are considered the two most important contributing factors in gastric carcinogenesis. It has been shown in a previous study that H. pylori also catalyzes N-nitrosation in vitro. Whether the N-nitrosating activity of H. pylori plays any role in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma has yet to be determined. Methods: H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different gastroduodenal pathologies were subcultured with the addition of morpholine (a nitrosable chemical) and sodium nitrite at a concentration of 25mM and 16mM, respectively. The bacteria were allowed to grow for 6 to 8 hours until OD600 of the culture media reached a value between 0.6 and 0.8. The culture-supernatants were then separated at 4°C, and the quantity of N-nitroso-morpholine formed was assayed using gas chromatography, as described by Suzaki and Mitsuoka. The nitrosating activity of individual H. pylori strain was calculated by adjusting the OD600 to unity. Bacterial genotypes, cagA, iceA and vacA of the H. pylori isolates were also determined by polymerase chain reaction based on published primer sequences. N-nitrosating activities of the H. pylori strains were compared with regard to the patient characteristics, the bacterial genotypes, and their related disease categories. Results: 20 strains from gastric cancer (GC), 27 from duodenal ulcer (DU) and 22 from non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) were studied. Though patients with GC were significantly older than those with DU and NUD, the 3 groups were comparable with regard to patient?s gender and bacterial genotypes. All 69 H. pylori strains expressed N-nitrosating activities with a uni-modal distribution (median 41.3 ?g/L; range: 9.2?152.3 ?g/L). Strains isolated from GC patients had a significantly higher mean N-nitrosating activity (65.3 ± 27.2 ?g/L) than those collected from patients with DU (43.8 ± 24.9 ?g/L) or NUD (33.8 ± 21.1 ?g/L) (p = 0.003, one-way ANOVA), but there was no difference between the DU and the NUD groups. Neither the patient characteristics (age and gender) nor the bacterial cagA, iceA and vacA subtypes had any association with the nitrosating activity. Conclusions: H. pylori-catalyzed N-nitrosation may be important in gastric carcinogenesis as strains isolated from stomach cancer patients express a higher level of N-nitrosating activity than those found in non-cancer patients.

AB  - Background & Objective: Patients undergoing elective rectal cancer surgery are usually given Fraxiparine based on recommended dosages from Caucasians? studies (0.2 ml if body weight <50 kg and 0.3 ml if body weight >50 kg) as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In our Chinese population, however, a number of cases of severe bleeding complications were observed with this standard dosage regimen. A prospective randomized study was therefore conducted to compare the anti-Xa activity and bleeding complications of this standard regimen and a reduced dosage regimen (0.1 ml if body weight < 50 kg and 0.2 ml if body weight > 50 kg). Methods: 29 patients with rectal cancer (standard : reduced = 14 : 15) were included in this study. Fraxiparine was given 4 hours prior to surgery and blood was taken just before surgery for measurement of anti-Xa activity. Postoperatively the patients were examined clinically for DVT. Perioperative blood loss, transfusion requirements and postoperative bleeding complications were also recorded and analyzed prospectively. Results: The mean anti-Xa activity was significantly higher in the standard dosage group (0.302 u/ml vs 0.219 u/ml, P = 0.029). There was no clinically overt DVT in the two groups. Total perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were not different in both groups. However, one patient in the standard dosage group has developed major intraoperative bleeding that necessitated packing and relaparotomy for haemostatsis. This patient finally died of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Gross haematuria was also observed in two patients in the standard dosage group. None of the patients in the reduced dosage group had developed any major or minor bleeding complications postoperatively. Conclusion: Fraxiparine as DVT prophylaxis in the Chinese population should be administered at a reduced dosage because it is shown in this study to be as effective as the standard dosage regimen in preventing DVT and yet it is associated with fewer bleeding complications.

AB  - Aim: Recurrent bleeding after initial haemostasis in peptic ulcer haemorrhage is an important factor that directly related to increased mortality. Conflicting reports have been published concerning the effectiveness of scheduled repeat endoscopy on ulcer rebleeding. We investigate the use of scheduled repeat endoscopy with subsequent further therapy in peptic ulcer bleeding. Method: From August 1999 to January 2001, we prospectively randomized patients who had endoscopically confirmed bleeding peptic ulcer with stigmata of acute bleeding, visible vessel or adherent clot into two groups. Endoscopic therapy was standardized to be adrenaline injection and heater probe application. One group received scheduled second endoscopy 16?24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis (Group A), and further therapy applied if endoscopic stigmata persist as above. The other group received close observations (Group B). Those patients in the two groups that develop rebleeding will receive operation if further endoscopic therapy failed. The outcome measures include ulcer re-bleeding, transfusion, length of stay, and mortality. Results: After initial endoscopic haemostasis, 196 patients were randomized to two groups. 2 patients were excluded after randomization as pathology confirmed carcinoma of stomach. The results were analyzed by using either Chi square or student t tests. Conclusion: A scheduled repeat endoscopy with appropriate therapy 16 to 24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis reduce the amount of peptic ulcer rebleeding siginificantly.
