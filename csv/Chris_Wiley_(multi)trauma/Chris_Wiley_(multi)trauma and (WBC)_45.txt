AB  - Aim: Recurrent bleeding after initial haemostasis in peptic ulcer haemorrhage is an important factor that directly related to increased mortality. Conflicting reports have been published concerning the effectiveness of scheduled repeat endoscopy on ulcer rebleeding. We investigate the use of scheduled repeat endoscopy with subsequent further therapy in peptic ulcer bleeding. Method: From August 1999 to January 2001, we prospectively randomized patients who had endoscopically confirmed bleeding peptic ulcer with stigmata of acute bleeding, visible vessel or adherent clot into two groups. Endoscopic therapy was standardized to be adrenaline injection and heater probe application. One group received scheduled second endoscopy 16?24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis (Group A), and further therapy applied if endoscopic stigmata persist as above. The other group received close observations (Group B). Those patients in the two groups that develop rebleeding will receive operation if further endoscopic therapy failed. The outcome measures include ulcer re-bleeding, transfusion, length of stay, and mortality. Results: After initial endoscopic haemostasis, 196 patients were randomized to two groups. 2 patients were excluded after randomization as pathology confirmed carcinoma of stomach. The results were analyzed by using either Chi square or student t tests. Conclusion: A scheduled repeat endoscopy with appropriate therapy 16 to 24 hours after initial endoscopic haemostasis reduce the amount of peptic ulcer rebleeding siginificantly.

AB  - There were 143 patients operated for facial fracture in the Prince of Wales Hospital during the period from February 1997 to December 2000. Out of 143 patients, 44 were operated for orbital floor fracture. The average age of the patients was 35. The male to female ratio is 5:1. Road traffic accident and assault are the main cause of injury. Diplopia was presented in 16% of all the cases. The average time lag between admission and operation is 92 hours. The average operating time is 75 minutes. All of them underwent orbital floor exploration with 86% had the orbital floor reconstructed with either titanium mesh, silastic-mesh or medpor. The mean hospital stay was 10.2 days. The timing of operation, indications of pre-op CT scan, surgical access and outcome will be presented.

AB  - Aim: To review the practice and implications of performing computed tomography (CT) for patients with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. Methods: Patients admitted for RIF pain between July 1998 to April 2000 were classified clinically as having appendicitis, equivocal appendicitis or other conditions. They would all undergo CT abdomen and then managed accordingly. The accuracy of clinical and CT diagnosis were compared, with histology of the resected appendix as gold standard. Results: There were 348 patients with RIF pain and 201 of them underwent CT abdomen. Appendicitis was diagnosed clinically in 45 patients, the remaining patients were either equivocal or suspicious of other conditions. From CT abdomen 82 were diagnosed to be appendicitis and 119 were found to be normal or having other pathology. For those with radiological appendicitis, 74 were proven on histology (sensitivity = 85%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 90% (74/82)). Within the clinical appendicitis group, 37 were confirmed by histology (PPV of clinical diagnosis = 82% (37/45)). Among the equivocal group, 50 patients turned out to be appendicitis. Conclusion: Although CT is useful in diagnosing appendicitis, we do not recommend routine CT abdomen for patients with RIF pain as no significant additional benefit is seen in the group of patients with clinical appendicitis. However, there may be a role for it in patients with equivocal clinical features but a randomized clinical trial is needed for further evaluation.

AB  - A consecutive series of 26 free fibular flaps in 25 patients performed by the Division of Plastic Surgery in Kwong Wah Hospital between 1995?2000 was presented. There were 15 male and 10 female patients. Age ranged from 11 to 84 years old (median 56). Pathology involving the mandible included 18 squamous cell carcinoma, five radiation-induced sarcoma, one radionecrosis and one ameloblastoma. After surgical ablation, all these oromandibular defects were reconstructed using free fibular flaps with closing wedge osteotomies and double-miniplates fixation. Concerning the fibular flaps, there were one straight osteal flap, 12 osteo-cutaneous flaps, and 13 composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps. Among the composite osteo-myo-cutaneous flaps, there were eight stacked bone flaps, three double skin islands composite flaps and two double muscles composite flaps. Hospital mortality of these advanced cancer patients was 7.7%. Success rate of free fibular graft was 96.2%. There was one total loss (3.8%), two flaps skin necrosis (7.7%) and three re-operations for major complications (11.5%). Minor complications that included wound infection and self-limited salivary fistula was 23%. The additional craftsmanship for the complex oromandibular reconstruction required careful three-dimensional planning and meticulous protection of individual components of the osteomyo-cutaneous flaps so as to restore the lower face with form and function.

AB  - Neurosurgical service requires team work and highly specialized resources. Acute neurosurgical emergencies are traditionally referred from district general hospital (DGH) to the Neurosurgical Unit (NSU) by telephone consultation. Initial experience had proved that tele-radiology could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary transfer but clinical outcome improvement was not demonstrated.(1) We compare the traditional telephone consultation with tele-radiology. Patients with acute neurosurgical conditions in a DGH need consultation to NSU were included. These patients were divided into Head Injury, Stroke and Miscellaneous groups. They were further randomized to telephone or tele-radiology consultation mode in different groups. There were totally 375 patients recruited and randomized from the period between 1 October 1998 to 30 June 2000. The time requested for referral to decision made were 35 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, but similar in head injury subgroup. The total numbers of patient needed transfer to PWH were fewer in tele-radiology group (telephone: 80 vs. tele-radiology: 61). The diagnostic accuracy was also higher in tele-radiology group due to the visual aids from the transferred image. The overall outcome assessed on 6 months and showed that patients in tele-radiology group have better outcome score. In summary, this is a first randomized control study to confirm clinical benefits of tele-radiology on managing inter-hospital neurosurgical patients.

AB  - Background: Active management of ruptured intracranial aneurysm in subarachnoid haemorrhage is commonly reserved for patient with favourable prognosis. Current clinical grading scales on outcome prediction are imprecise with low inter-observer reproducibility. We designed a prospective clinical study on the association between Apolipoprotein E genotype and the outcome of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Method: We conducted a prospective study on patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage admitted to our unit during a 2 years period. All patients were managed under a standard protocol. Patient?s characteristics, clinical grade, radiological grade and Apolipoprotein E genotype were documented. We focused on the 6 months neurological outcome for this group of patients after discharged. Results: 72 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage were recruited into the study. Unfavourable outcome was found with increasing age (62.2 years ± 17.2 vs. 55.7 years ± 12.9; P = 0.07; odds ratio, 1.03; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.07), poor Fisher?s grades (86 percent vs. 58 percent; P = 0.015; odds ratio, 4.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 15.20) and poor WFNS grades (48 percent vs. 14 percent; P = 0.002; odds ratio, 5.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.86 to 17.80). A higher distribution of Apolipoprotein E ?4 was found amongst those had unfavourable outcome (38 percent vs. 9 percent; P = 0.006; odds ratio, 5.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.67 to 21.29). Apolipoprotein E ?4 remains to be an independent outcome-predicting factor (P = 0.003) after adjusted with age, WFNS grading, and Fisher?s grading. Conclusions: Apolipoprotein E ?4 was found to be associated with an unfavourable outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

AB  - Aim: latrogenic injury at the time of gynaecological surgery, in particular hysterectomy, is the commonest cause of vesico-vaginal fistulae (VVF) in the developed world. This is a retrospective review to study the aetiology, treatment options and outcome of surgery in patients suffering from VVF in our hospital. Patients and Methods: The records of patients diagnosed to have VVF during the period July 1997 to December 2000 were reviewed. During that period 10 patients were diagnosed to be suffering from VVF. Their age ranged from 38 to 73 years old. The follow up period ranged from 5 to 42 months. Results: Hysterectomy was the commonest cause of VVF in our patients (6 cases). Two cases were due to pelvic irradiation for carcinoma of cervix. One was due to recurrent carcinoma of cervix whereas the other one was due to bladder stone which had eroded into the vagina. One fistula healed by conservative treatment whereas 9 required surgical intervention: transabdominal repair using omental interposition in 6 and ileal conduit in 2 patients. One patient refused surgical treatment and defaulted follow-up afterwards. During follow-up, one patient died from recurrent carcinoma of cervix whereas the rest of the patients were well and dry. Conclusions: Gynaecological surgery is the commonest cause of VVF in our locality. However, most of these fistulae are amendable to surgical repair. With the use of omental interposition graft, successful repair can be achieved in most patients.

AB  - Background: Long-term biliary complications after ES for bile duct stones are infrequent. In the elderly, the role of routine cholecystectomy after ES is unclear. Patients and Methods: Between September 1997 and December 2000, patients (age >60) with bile duct stones and gall stones presenting with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis or pancreatitis were randomized to receive early elective cholecystectomy (LC) or expectant management after clearance of bile duct stones with ERCP + ES. Exclusion criteria included severe co-morbidity, concomitant intrahepatic duct stones, recurrence pyogenic cholangitis, cholecystitis and failure to clear bile duct stones endoscopically. They were then seen at regular intervals. Outcome variables included further biliary complications defined as: cholangitis, pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, cholecystitis and severe biliary colic. Results: 165 patients, aged 60?89 years were randomized (85 in LC group  Difference in probability of complications = 13%, 95% C.I. = 4.8%, 21.2%) Conclusion: With higher incidence of biliary complications in the expectant group, cholecystectomy should be offered to patients whenever is possible after endoscopic clearance of bile duct stones.

AB  - Abstract Background Autoantibodies to apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-ApoA-1 IgG) were shown to predict major adverse cardiovascular events and promote atherogenesis. However, their potential relationship with clinical disability and ischaemic lesion volume after acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) remains unexplored. Materials and methods We included n = 76 patients admitted for AIS and we investigated whether baseline serum anti-ApoA-1 IgG levels could predict (i) AIS-induced clinical disability [assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)], and (ii) AIS-related ischaemic lesion volume [assessed by Computed Tomography (CT)]. We also evaluated the possible pro-apoptotic and pro-necrotic effects of anti-ApoA-1 IgG on human astrocytoma cell line (U251) using flow cytometry. Results High levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG were retrieved in 15·8% (12/76) of patients. Increased baseline levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG were independently correlated with worse mRS [? = 0·364; P = 0·002; adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1·05 (95% CI 1·01?1·09); P = 0·017] and CT-assessed ischaemic lesion volume [? = 0·333; P < 0·001; adjusted OR: 1·06 (95% CI 1·01?1·12); P = 0·048] at 3 months. No difference in baseline clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics was observed between patients with high vs. low levels of anti-ApoA-1 IgG. Incubating human astrocytoma cells with anti-ApoA-1 IgG dose dependently induced necrosis and apoptosis of U251 cells in vitro. Conclusion Anti-ApoA-1 IgG serum levels at AIS onset are associated with poorer clinical recovery and worse brain lesion volume 3 months after AIS. These observations could be partly explained by the deleterious effect of anti-ApoA-1 IgG on human brain cell survival in vitro and may have clinical implication in the prediction of poor outcome in AIS.
