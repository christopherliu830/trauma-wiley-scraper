AB  - SUMMARy Increasing evidence indicates that patients known to have cardiovascular risk factors who are anemic should be managed differently from patients not known to be at risk. Clinical studies of patients in critical care units, patients in cardiac care units with acute myocardial infarction, and in Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing surgical procedures have demonstrated that patients at risk suffer adverse clinical consequences with moderate to severe anemia. Studies in a number of clinical settings indicate that morbidity and mortality can be improved with aggressive management of anemia.

AB  - Summary Platelet transfusions can be essential to the management of dogs with severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia experiencing uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. While human blood banks maintain platelet concentrate (PC) in their inventories, fresh whole blood (FWB) is the only readily available platelet-containing product in many veterinary practices. Although there are few clinical indications for FWB, it might be appropriate in the management of dogs and cats with anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia or in those requiring massive transfusion. An alternative approach to preparation of PC from FWB is plateletpheresis. Fresh platelet products have a short shelf life. During the past several decades, platelet cryopreservation has been extensively investigated as a means to provide long-term storage and immediate availability of platelet products for transfusion. Due to the time limitation on storage of fresh PC and the cumbersome process of platelet cryopreservation, there has been considerable interest in the development of lyophilized platelet products.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been found to prolong survival in selected patients with peritoneal disease, but the extent of cytoreduction and chemoperfusion can result in systemic toxicities. We evaluate the incidence of perioperative hematological complications and its associated risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of CRS-HIPEC cases between April 2001 and October 2016 was performed. Patients were stratified based on the clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative incidence, grade, and duration of leukopenia (white blood cells < 4000/mm3), neutropenia (absolute neutrophils < 2000/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (platelets < 140 000/mm3). Results Two hundred and thirty-five CRS-HIPEC were performed in 220 patients with peritoneal metastasis of colorectal, ovarian, primary peritoneal, appendiceal, or mesothelioma origins. The incidences of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were 15.3%, 3.8%, and 37.9%, respectively. Median time to onset was 1 day (0-16 days), 0 day (0-2 days), and 1 day (1-2 days), respectively, after operation. Median duration of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was 1 day (1-3 days), 1 day (1-2days), and 3 days (range 0-16 days), respectively. Age > 60 (odds ratio [OR] 0.229 [95% CI: 0.105-0.502], P < .001) and the use of prior chemotherapy (OR 2.46 [95% CI: 1.24, 4.83], P = .010) were independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia on multivariable logistic regression. Conclusion Hematological toxicities are common after hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with thrombocytopenia being most common. Patients with age > 60, and who have undergone chemotherapy, are at risk of these toxicities and should be closely monitored post CRS-HIPEC.

AB  - Background The original equine sepsis score provided a method of identifying foals with sepsis. New variables associated with sepsis have been evaluated, but the sepsis score has not been updated. Objectives To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 2 updated sepsis scores and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in regard to detecting sepsis in foals. Animals Two-hundred and seventy-three ill foals and 25 healthy control foals. Methods Historical, physical examination, and clinicopathologic findings were used to calculate the original sepsis score and 2 updated sepsis scores. SIRS criteria were also evaluated. Sepsis scores and positive SIRS scores were statistically compared to foals with sepsis. Results One-hundred and twenty-six foals were septic and 147 sick-nonseptic. The original and updated sepsis scores were significantly higher in septic foals as compared to sick-nonseptic and healthy foals. The sensitivity and specificity of the updated sepsis scores to predict sepsis were not significantly better than those of the original sepsis score. One-hundred and twenty-seven of 273 (46.5%) foals met the original SIRS criteria and 88/273 (32%) foals met the equine neonatal SIRS criteria. The original SIRS criteria had similar sensitivity and specificity for predicting sepsis as did the 3 sepsis scores in our study. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The updated sepsis scores did not provide improved ability in predicting sepsis. Fulfilling the original SIRS criteria provided similar sensitivity and specificity in predicting sepsis as the modified sepsis score and might serve as a diagnostic aid in identifying foals at risk for sepsis.

AB  - HLA alloimmunization induced by pregnancy, multiple transfusions or transplantation is responsible for some of the serious complications seen in patients receiving blood and blood products. These complications are primarily the result of antibody and antigen triggering an acute immunological reaction, which in some cases can be fatal e.g. TRALI. Some adverse reactions are triggered by HLA antibodies present in the patient whereas others are initiated by antibodies or HLA reactive cells present in the transfused product. The introduction of universal leucodepletion for the prevention of vCJD transmission has resulted in a significant reduction in these reactions by eliminating the main source of alloimmunization, but residual cellular components or platelets are still able to activate the immune system and induce the development of HLA reactive antibodies or T cells. However, the use of more sensitive and specific techniques to detect HLA antibodies and antigens has not only improved the investigation of transfusion reactions and their subsequent diagnosis, but it has also facilitated the implementation of a number of measures such as the use of HLA antibody negative products to further reduce their development.
