AB  - Summary Several issues related to the risks, costs, and availability of allogeneic blood transfusions have fueled research into other blood substitutes. Artificial oxygen carriers increase the oxygen content of blood by providing additional chemically modified hemoglobin molecules or inert fluids capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen. Several such products have been developed and many have undergone extensive clinical investigation, demonstrating their efficacy in improving oxygen transportation and avoiding the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. Their clinical use, however, has been marred by the unresolved safety issues and significant numbers of complications. While further research is underway to improve the safety of artificial oxygen carriers, current products remain valuable assets as ?oxygen bridges? in the management of patients suffering from critically low hemoglobin levels at imminent risk of ischemia and death that cannot be transfused.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The need to measure reporting workload in teaching departments remains a current pertinent need. In Australia, the Pitman?Jones reporting RVUs have been in the public domain since 2003 (revised in 2009). These are expressed in arbitrary units. In New Zealand, single-site Christchurch Hospital reporting times have been validated and placed in the public domain. Concurrently, the RANZCR has been developing a formulaic descriptor lexicon for imaging studies (the Body System Framework). There is a need to bring these three strands of work together into a common public resource. In 2015, under the auspices of the Chief Accreditation Officer, RANZCR convened the Radiologist Workload Working Group. The goal of the group was to develop a robust method of measuring radiologist workload in teaching departments in Australia and New Zealand for the RANZCR accreditation processes of teaching departments as training sites. This paper concerns itself with one aspect of the group's work, namely reaching a consensus on radiologist study ascribable times for common imaging studies. Method The BSF examination descriptors were reduced to a smaller, generic dataset of descriptors at the expense of loss of specificity. BSF study ascribable times had been previously obtained by stopwatch observation. The dataset was harmonized with the Christchurch descriptors to ensure commonality of case mix. The two lead authors reached an approximate consensus study ascribable time for each descriptor in agreement with the BSF and Christchurch data. Specifically, the Christchurch reporting times were relied on extensively to validate the new dataset's study ascribable times. The first draft of descriptors and times was tabled at the meetings of the RANZCR Radiologist Workload Working Group, and was progressively refined by iterative consensus. Results The output of the Radiologist Workload Working Group comprises a simplified modality-based table of robust descriptors and ?best estimate? corresponding study ascribable times. These can be used with the extant Pitman?Jones methodology in order to estimate the reporting workload of a medical imaging teaching department in units of time. As a first for Australia and New Zealand, nuclear medicine and PET study ascribable times have been incorporated and balanced against radiology study ascribable times. Conclusion The RANZCR 2016 study ascribable times are ready for use by the Australian and New Zealand radiologist and nuclear medicine specialist community. We hope these times will also stimulate further data collection in our two countries towards a robust, bi-national study ascribable times database.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Summary One hundred and seventeen patients admitted to an intensive care unit were studied, to determine whether there is any relationship between laboratory data taken on admission to the unit and the final outcome (survival or non-survival) of the stay within the intensive care unit. Discriminant analysis of the data shows that patients could be allocated to one of two groups (survival or non-survival) using the two parameters of age and serum phosphate, and that this allocation proves correct in 70% of cases, irrespective of the admitting disease and treatment. The validity of this discriminant function was tested in a further 53 cases and the allocation of patients to survival or non-survival groups was found to be correct in 70% of cases, supporting the first estimate of the discriminant function.

AB  - Summary Although dental implants have been a successful option for replacement of lost dentition for nearly five decades, their use in the medical and dental treatment plan is still in its youth. Literature on the medical implications of dental implants is surprisingly sparse, with a need for organization. This chapter is an attempt to begin the process of documenting the science behind this complex, yet critical topic. Our understanding of the mechanisms of implant success, complications, and failure unfolds from documented case histories, medical data, and clinical research. Yet, as certain as the scientific facts are, there are contradictions and cases with unexpected outcomes yielding both good and bad results. Some cases exhibit outcomes that surprisingly cross the frontier of success, while others seem to head toward failure before the clinician realizes something is wrong. The later example may begin with a common systemic disorder or medical history, seemingly straightforward from the start, only to become bewildering and strenuous to manage. For these reasons we must be critical in case selection and customize treatment plans according to medical condition while managing all medical aspects with vigor, academic excellence, and due diligence. With patient selection being the critical factor for implant success or survival, the medical condition, pharmacologic implications, and overall health of the patient cannot be overemphasized. When medical conditions are managed wisely, most patients with diseases discussed in this chapter enjoy far better overall health if they enjoy the comfort and confidence of fixed prostheses rather than the struggle, discomfort, and self-awareness of dentures in an age where esthetics and self-esteem have never been more highly valued. Now more than ever, exceptional care must be exercised to ensure that every implant is placed and restored with the objective of being as successful and as safe as possible for each patient.
