AB  - Spontaneous papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare cardiovascular emergency. We present a 63-year-old male who presents with acute dyspnea who was found to have an anterior PMR, with no evidence of coronary artery disease, infection, or trauma. A review of cases of nonischemic spontaneous PMR published in 2000?2015 identified 11 additional cases of spontaneous PMR. Posterior and anterior papillary muscles involvement was identified in 54.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively. Rapid identification due to advances in imaging modalities and improved surgical management has led to optimal outcomes in patients with spontaneous PMR.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5?percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3?percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.
