AB  - Background and Objectives? G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells have long replaced marrow as the major source for allogeneic transplants. Conclusive evidence questioning the long-term safety of G-CSF for donors has not been provided, but the cumulative number of followed donors remains insufficient to rule out rare adverse events. A long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors was therefore performed. Patients and Methods? Two hundred and three successive donors were evaluated pre-apheresis, subjected to G-CSF-mobilization/apheresis, and actively followed for 5?years by the same physicians and laboratories. Follow-up laboratory work included standard biochemical/haematological tests and T-cell phenotyping. Results? Donor epidemiology was typical for reported stem cell donor cohorts. Acute adverse effects of G-CSF and apheresis were mild and transient, consistent with the previous reports. Mean circulating CD34+ cells after nine doses of G-CSF were 124 per ?l. Other biochemical/haematological parameters were also altered, consistent with G-CSF treatment. Spleen enlargement was modest. At first follow-up, all clinical and laboratory parameters had normalized. Leucocyte/lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were the same as during premobilization work-up and remained unchanged throughout. A single severe but likely unrelated adverse event, a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma, was reported. Conclusion? The studies add an observation time of almost 500 donor years to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogeneic donor stem cell mobilization.

AB  - Abstract This review will discuss several new drugs which were discovered and developed in recent years from traditional Chinese medicines by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica. Huperzine A was isolated from Huperzia serrata, a plant used for the treatment of contusion, strain, haematuria, and swelling in Chinese folk medicine. Pharmacological studies have indicated that huperzine A has powerful and reversible anticholinesterase activity. Y-maze methods have shown that huperzine A improves learning and retrieval processes, and facilitates memory retention. Huperzine A is used to treat patients with myasthenia gravis and Alzheimer's disease in China. Sarmentosin, a cyanogenic glucoside was isolated from the whole plant of Sedum sarmentosium. This plant has long been used to treat hepatitis by folk medicine. Sarmentosin significantly lowers the SGPT level of patients suffering from chronic viral hepatitis, and shows a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immune responses in mice. The root of Aconitum is well known in traditional Chinese medicine. Many Aconitum alkaloids have been isolated. Most show potent bioactivities, but with severe toxicity. Recently, some alkaloids such as 3-acetylaconitine, lappaconitine, have shown significant anesthetic activity and exhibit a higher therapeutic index. Guan-fu base A was isolated from the tuber root of Aconitum coreanum. Guan-fu base A has antiarrhythmic action and is now in clinical trials. Drug Dev. Res. 39:147?157. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion proteins directed towards cell surface targets make an important contribution to the treatment of disease. The purpose of this review was to correlate the clinical and preclinical data on the 15 currently approved mAbs and fusion proteins targeted to the cell surface. The principal sources used to gather data were: the peer reviewed Literature; European Medicines Agency ?Scientific Discussions?; and the US Food and Drug Administration ?Pharmacology/Toxicology Reviews? and package inserts (United States Prescribing Information). Data on the 15 approved biopharmaceuticals were included: abatacept; abciximab; alefacept; alemtuzumab; basiliximab; cetuximab; daclizumab; efalizumab; ipilimumab; muromonab; natalizumab; panitumumab; rituximab; tocilizumab; and trastuzumab. For statistical analysis of concordance, data from these 15 were combined with data on the approved mAbs and fusion proteins directed towards soluble targets. Good concordance with human pharmacodynamics was found for mice receiving surrogates or non-human primates (NHPs) receiving the human pharmaceutical. In contrast, there was poor concordance for human pharmacodynamics in genetically deficient mice and for human adverse effects in all three test systems. No evidence that NHPs have superior predictive value was found.

AB  - Background and purpose The influence of the immune system on seizures and epileptogenesis has been increasingly considered, in particular the role of autoantibodies. In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of intrathecal antibody synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment of patients with epilepsy. Methods In a retrospective cohort study trial in a university hospital neurology department, 164 well-characterized patients with different etiologies of seizures and epilepsies, and 77 control patients were included. Results CSF-specific immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and IgA) synthesis was significantly (P?<?0.0001) more frequent in patients with epilepsy (34.1%) compared with age- and sex-matched controls (2.6%). The highest incidence of intrathecal Ig synthesis was detected in patients with encephalitis-related acute symptomatic seizures (86.7%), but also in patients with focal epilepsy so far classified cryptogenic (45.2%). Antibody synthesis was not related to the number of CSF white blood cells. Conclusions Humoral immune activation in the CSF compartment was detected in one-third of patients with epilepsy, besides acute symptomatic seizures particularly frequent in cryptogenic epilepsy ? an etiology so far defined as not having a detectable cause. Systematic prospective clinical and experimental trials are required to identify antigenic targets and select appropriate patients for which immunotherapy might offer new causal therapeutic options.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring of patients' vital sign values (VSVs) during hemotherapy may have an important role in the recognition and mitigation of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Knowledge regarding VSVs and other patient characteristics in bedside-reported TACO or fluid challenge?suspected transfusion reactions (TACO/FC-STRs) is limited. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of cases of uncomplicated red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (UCTs) and reported suspected transfusion reaction (STR) cases investigated by our hospital's transfusion medicine service (TMS) from January 1, 2005, to February 29, 2008, using data obtained from TMS consult reports and quality improvement databases examining VSVs and patient characteristics in TACO/FC-STRs. RESULTS: The frequency of TACO/FC-STRs was 0.19% per all RBC units transfused (1:530 units transfused). Both clinically and statistically (p?≤?0.05) significant changes were encountered in all VSVs in patients experiencing TACO/FC-STRs either at the 15-minute time interval or at the end-of-transfusion time points. Measured and derived VSVs related to the patients' blood pressure in the peritransfusion period were consistently increased. Approximately two-thirds of TACO/FC-STR patients also exhibited inflammatory related signs and symptoms at STR bedside presentation. Differences (all p?≤?0.050) between UCT and TACO/FC-STR cohorts were seen for patient mean weights (80?kg vs. 72?kg), mean minutes to transfusion completion (121?min vs. 83?min), and mean storage age of suspected sentinel RBC unit (22.5 days vs. 25.2 days). CONCLUSION: Trend monitoring of peritransfusion VSVs, especially blood pressures, may aid in the bedside recognition of TACO/FC-STRs. A subset of these patients may also present with febrile and/or inflammatory signs and symptoms.
