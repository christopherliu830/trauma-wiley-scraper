AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of carbamazepine and placebo on measures of toxicity in frail nursing home patients. DESIGN: A nonrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. SETTING: Two nursing homes in Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five subjects (mean age 84.5 years) with dementia. INTERVENTION: Carbamazepine and placebo during two 5-week periods separated by a 2-week washout. The modal dose for each patient was 300 mg/day. MEASUREMENTS: Adverse experiences, comorbid events, and physical signs and symptoms were assessed continuously, and laboratory data were examined at the beginning and end of each treatment period. RESULTS: One subject died with a pneumonia (and elevated white blood cell count), and one subject developed probable carbamazepine-induced tics. There was a minimal drop in hematocrit and a slight elevation of liver enzymes, none of which was clinically significant. There was otherwise no excess of adversity or comorbid events on carbamazepine versus placebo, and there was no change in electrolytes or other laboratory measures. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that carbamazepine in this dose range was well tolerated for the 5-week treatment period in this frail sample. These data supplement the literature regarding carbamazepine toxicity, which is devoid of controlled studies in older subjects.

AB  - Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD), the commonest single gene disorder worldwide, is an inherited disease that has different clinical and hematological manifestations in different populations. The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of the Lebanese SCD population. This was a retrospective study that included information on 387 patients with either sickle cell anemia (SS) or sickle beta-thalassemia (ST). The mean (±SD) age was 17.9?years (±12.5), and the mean (±SD) follow-up was 9.3?±?6.9?years. Fifty percent of the patients were males and SS/ST distribution was 3?:?1. The disease was clustered in two geographic areas in North and South Lebanon. Nearly, all patients were Muslims and 56% were the offspring of consanguineous parents. The prevalence of splenomegaly beyond 6?years of age among SS patients was 28.9%. The prevalence rates of stroke, leg ulcers and priapism were 4.1%, 1.4%, and 0.8%, respectively. Comparing the SS and the ST patients, there were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of all clinical manifestations except for splenomegaly (SS: 28.9%, ST: 54.9%, P-value?<?0.001) and splenectomy (SS: 16.1%, ST: 35.7%, P-value?<?0.001). In contrast to Northern American populations and similar to some Mediterranean populations, Lebanese SCD patients have a higher prevalence of persistent splenomegaly. The relatively low incidence of thrombotic complications deserves further investigation. The study?s limitations include those of any other retrospective study and the fact that not all Lebanese centers caring for inherited hemoglobin disorders were included. However, the results of this first large scale national survey indicate that preventive efforts should target the Northern and Southern regions of Lebanon to decrease the number of new off springs afflicted with this disease similar to what has been successfully achieved with Thalassemia, another hemoglobinopathy that is highly prevalent in the country.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to determine the association between prenatal stress and immune function in human adults. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 34 healthy young women whose mothers experienced major negative life events during their pregnancy (Prenatal Stress, PS group, mean age 25, SD?±?4.34 years), and from a female comparison group (n?=?28, CG, mean age 24?±?3.40 years), were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and subsequent cytokine production was measured. A bias for T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production due to an overproduction of IL-4 relative to IFN-? after PHA stimulation was observed in PS subjects. In addition, IL-6 and IL-10 were also significantly elevated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a direct association between prenatal stress exposure and alterations in immune parameters in adult women. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Mesenteric ischaemia results from decreased blood flow to the bowel, causing cellular injury from lack of oxygen and nutrients. Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is an uncommon disorder with high morbidity and mortality, but outcomes are improved with prompt recognition and aggressive treatment. Five subgroups of AMI have been identified, with superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) the most common. Older age and cardiovascular disease are common risk factors for AMI, excepting acute mesenteric venous thrombosis (AMVT), which affects younger patients with hypercoaguable states. AMI is characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain; a benign abdominal exam may be observed prior to bowel infarction. Conventional angiography and more recently, computed tomography angiography, are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Correction of predisposing conditions, volume resuscitation and antibiotic treatment are standard treatments for AMI, and surgery is mandated in the setting of peritoneal signs. Intra-arterial vasodilators are used routinely in the treatment of non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) and also are advocated in the treatment of occlusive AMI to decrease associated vasospasm. Thrombolytics have been used on a limited basis to treat occlusive AMI. A variety of agents have been studied in animal models to treat reperfusion injury, which sometimes can be more harmful than ischaemic injury. Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI) usually is caused by severe obstructive atherosclerotic disease of two or more splanchnic vessels, presents with post-prandial pain and weight loss, and is treated by either surgical revascularization or percutaneous angioplasty and stenting.

AB  - Purpose To present the pathophysiology, differential diagnoses, assessment techniques, and treatment options for hepatic hydrothorax. Data Sources A case study is presented with supporting material from current medical literature. Conclusions Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion caused by the flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through an actual defect in the diaphragm. Successful outcomes depend on early detection and timely referral of often-subtle lung involvement. Implications for Practice Although incidence is reported to be as high as 12% in cirrhotic patients, standard medical references attach little importance to pul-monary risks in this population. Hepatic hydrothorax should always be considered in the cirrhotic patient with a pleural effusion.
