AB  - Abstract The holy grail of artificial tissue is currently limited by the absence of a viable vascular network to sustain it. Although a growing amount of interest exists in engineering such a construct, they are essentially in their infancy. In this chapter, the basic concepts of microcirculation are laid down, along with current state-of-the-art technology used to develop an artificial capillary bed. A major limitation is the poor patency rates, especially at low-flow states, of contemporary microvascular grafts. Newer options for microvessels including the use of nano-engineered materials are explored and tissue engineering biological microvessels are also discussed. At the lower end of the spectrum, biomedical researchers have also used angiogenic factors to stimulate capillary development. More recently, stem cell technology has also come into vogue with the potential to promote arteriogenesis. In the future, it is foreseen that all these factors would be synergized to bridge the ?missing link? between the arterial system and tissue-engineered scaffolds.

AB  - Summary Although the combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy is widely used for young adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL), the outcome and safety of this combination using intensive paediatric-based protocols has not been well described. The clinical course of 32 adults age 18?60 years with Ph+ ALL treated with a paediatric-based protocol plus imatinib was evaluated. The complete response rate was 94%. Grade 3?4 infections, neuropathy, myopathy and liver function abnormalities were common, resulting in major treatment delays and dose reductions, and declines in performance status (physical deconditioning), particularly in patients aged 41?60 years. Median and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 40·7 months and 53%, respectively, and median and 3-year even-free survival (EFS) was 30·1 months and 50%, respectively. OS and EFS were inferior in deconditioned patients. Of 16 patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission, six died of non-relapse complications. There was no significant difference in OS and EFS between transplanted and non-transplanted patients, based on an intention-to-treat and time-to-donor identification analysis. The combination of imatinib with a paediatric-based regimen in adults produced high response rates, but was associated with considerable toxicity and high non-relapse mortality post-HSCT.

AB  - Background: Glutamine (GLN) is the primary fuel for rapidly dividing cells, yet it is not a constituent of parenteral nutritional formulas administered to newborns. The aims of this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial were (1) to confirm the safety of glutamine supplementation for premature infants and (2) to examine the effects of glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition on length of stay, days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), days on the ventilator, and other clinical outcomes. Methods: Premature infants received either standard or glutamine-supplemented TPN and were monitored throughout length of stay for various health and biochemical indices. The group was examined as a whole (n = 44; birth weight range: 530 to 1250 g) and in two weight subgroups, <800 and ≥800 g. Results: Serum ammonia, blood urea nitrogen, and glutamate tended to be higher in the GLN groups, but the levels were well within normal limits. In the <800-g cohort (n = 24), glutamine-supplemented infants required fewer days on TPN (13 vs 21 days, p =.02), had a shorter length of time to full feeds (8 vs 14 days, p =.03), and needed less time on the ventilator (38 vs 47 days, p =.04). There was a tendency toward a shorter length of stay in the NICU (73 vs 90 days, NS). These findings were not observed in the infants ≥800 g (n = 20). Conclusions: Glutamine appears to be safe for use in premature infants and seems to be conditionally essential in premature infants with extremely low birth weights. Larger multicenter trials are needed to confirm these observations and further evaluate the efficacy of GLN in these high-risk premature infants.

AB  - Abstract We evaluated the concept that the vascular entrance of both bacterial and nonbacterial participate material could lead to hepatic parenchyma) cell injury, either due to post-phagocytic Kupffer cell activity or the margination of activated leukocytes in the liver. Injection of denatured, collagen-coated particles as well as heat-killed bacteria were used as particulate challenges. Hepatic parenchymal cell injury in vivo during postoperative sepsis was evaluated by plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) enzyme levels over 3-72 h. AST and OCT levels elevated following either laparotomy plus cecal ligation (mild sepsis) or laparotomy plus cecal ligation with puncture (severe sepsis), with the peak level at 24 h. In addition, the direct intravenous injection of either nonbacterial foreign particles or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa into normal rats also produced a dose-dependent elevation of AST and OCT. The plasma level of either AST or OCT actually increased 350-400% after injection of the non-bacterial particles. A similar dose related elevation in enzymes followed the intravenous injection of heat-killed Pseudomonas. To differentiate the potential contribution of activated hepatic Kupffer celts versus activated marginated neutrophils to the in vivo hepatic injury, we determined the release of the hepatic specific enzyme OCT by cultured hepatic parenchymal cells when they were exposed to isolated Kupffer cells or isolated PMNs that were activated by exposure to dead bacteria. Bacteria alone when added to cultured hepatocytes did not induce significant OCT release. In contrast, activated PMNs but not Kupffer cells induced a significant (p < 0.05) release of OCT from parenchymal cells into the culture media. Thus, in vivo transient hepatic parenchymal cell injury with post-operative sepsis may be mediated by the margination of activated PMNs in the liver.

AB  - Abstract Background? Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). Methods? We report the atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a 36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu?s arteritis. Results? Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole monotherapy. Conclusion? The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB  - Abstract Background Open splenectomy and devascularization are effective treatments for cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia and variceal bleeding. However, it remains controversial whether laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and devascularization (LSD) can be indicated and beneficial in these patients. Objectives A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of LS and LSD for patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension was undertaken to clarify controversy about their utilization in such patients. Methods A systematic search strategy was performed to retrieve relevant studies from PubMed and Embase.com. The literature search and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Results Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The methodology of the identified articles was poor. Six hundred and fifty-one patients, including 478 LS patients and 173 LSD patients, were involved in efficacy and safety evaluations. There was wide variability in the outcome measures between studies. There was only one death in the patients underwent LSD. Reported major complications included post-operative bleeding requiring re-surgery, pancreatic leakage and gastric perforation. Seven studies were identified with comparisons between laparoscopic and open procedures. No meta-analysis was possible because of heterogeneity between studies and lack of randomization. Conclusions The publications reviewed revealed LS and LSD to be safe and effective in the setting of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. From the comparison articles, laparoscopic procedures appear to be superior to open procedures regarding blood loss, hospital stay, complication rate and liver function impairment. However, it is difficult to draw firm statistical conclusions due to lack of high-quality evidence.
