AB  - Abstract Background Open splenectomy and devascularization are effective treatments for cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia and variceal bleeding. However, it remains controversial whether laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and devascularization (LSD) can be indicated and beneficial in these patients. Objectives A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of LS and LSD for patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension was undertaken to clarify controversy about their utilization in such patients. Methods A systematic search strategy was performed to retrieve relevant studies from PubMed and Embase.com. The literature search and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Results Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The methodology of the identified articles was poor. Six hundred and fifty-one patients, including 478 LS patients and 173 LSD patients, were involved in efficacy and safety evaluations. There was wide variability in the outcome measures between studies. There was only one death in the patients underwent LSD. Reported major complications included post-operative bleeding requiring re-surgery, pancreatic leakage and gastric perforation. Seven studies were identified with comparisons between laparoscopic and open procedures. No meta-analysis was possible because of heterogeneity between studies and lack of randomization. Conclusions The publications reviewed revealed LS and LSD to be safe and effective in the setting of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. From the comparison articles, laparoscopic procedures appear to be superior to open procedures regarding blood loss, hospital stay, complication rate and liver function impairment. However, it is difficult to draw firm statistical conclusions due to lack of high-quality evidence.

AB  - Summary This chapter facilitates the reader to grasp a foundational understanding of the agricultural processes and variables in exposures to enhance their abilities to ascertain an accurate occupational history leading to accurate recognition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. It describes chronic low-level concentrations (CLLC) and periodic acute massive and moldy (PAMM) exposures, and the resultant health outcomes of each. Examples of chronic low-level exposure include working in livestock or poultry confinement structures, mixing feed, feeding animals, and working in grain-handling facilities. The chapter describes respiratory illness conditions resulting from agricultural dusts and gas exposures. Oxides of nitrogen are produced during the ensilage process by bacterial action on nitrates stored in the plant material. Contact with certain pesticides and the chemical fertilizer anhydrous ammonia can have adverse respiratory affects on exposed agricultural workers. About 25 zoonotic infectious diseases are considered to be a significant occupational hazard to agricultural workers in western industrialized countries.

AB  - Abstract: A unique hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (IVOX) has been developed, which is inserted into the vena caval blood stream to transfer O2/CO2 to/from circulating blood in an intact subject without involving the natural lungs. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated that the device can transfer significant quantities of O2 and CO2 for up to 3 weeks without significant harmful sequelae or complications. Clinical trials are in progress under FDA supervision, in which IVOX has been utilized to date in 56 patients with ARDS. Preliminary findings indicate that risks and hazards from IVOX are nil, and evidence of benefit to the patient has been demonstrated in 86% of the patients. At this time, clinical utilization of IVOX is in the experimental, data collecting mode to determine its proper role or niche as a method for temporary augmentation of blood gas transfer in patients with advanced acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at an approximately 0.5% to 3% increased risk of thromboembolism during and immediately after catheter ablation. Treatment guidelines recommend periprocedural oral anticoagulation plus unfractionated heparin during ablation. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are the only non?vitamin K oral anticoagulants for which there are randomized controlled trials assessing uninterrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is noninferior vs warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less major bleeding in patients with nonvalvular AF. The ELIMINATE-AF (Evaluation of Edoxaban Compared With VKA in Subjects Undergoing Catheter Ablation of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation) trial is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily edoxaban 60?mg (30?mg in patients indicated for a dose reduction) vs vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing catheter ablation (http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02942576). A total of 560 patients are planned for randomization to edoxaban or VKA (2:1 ratio) to obtain 450 patients fully compliant with the protocol. Patients will complete 21 to 28?days of anticoagulation prior to the ablation and a 90-day post-ablation period. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, and major bleeding. The primary safety endpoint is major bleeding. A magnetic resonance imaging substudy will assess the incidence of silent cerebral lesions post-ablation. ELIMINATE-AF will define the efficacy and safety of edoxaban for uninterrupted oral anticoagulation during catheter ablation of AF.
