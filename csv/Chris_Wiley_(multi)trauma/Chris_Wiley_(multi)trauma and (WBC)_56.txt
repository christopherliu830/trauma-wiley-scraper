AB  - Summary Occupational health and safety in veterinary hospitals is a topic not always routinely considered but one that is of utmost importance. This chapter first gives an overview of common hazards and how to prevent them. Regular training, revision of safety procedures, plain old hand washing and common sense will help keep the workplace productive and healthy. The veterinary technician plays a very important role in the administration of medications. It is imperative that the veterinary technician has a full understanding of and the ability to relay information on; the indications for use, pharmacokinetics, contraindications, precautions, safety issues, adverse effects, drug interactions, and monitoring parameters of the medications they encounter in practice. Recognizing signs of pain and advocating pain management is a paramount element of patient care. It is well recognized that patients, both veterinary and human, suffer from longer hospital stays, greater complications, and increased mortality when pain is not controlled.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is uncommon in pregnancy but may have a serious impact on maternal and fetal wellbeing. A limited but expanding evidence base provides clinicians a clearer understanding and better management of this disease among the pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is caused by many different factors. While the list of etiologies is extensive, approximately 80 percent of cases are attributable to either biliary tract disease or alcohol abuse in the general population. Cholelithiasis is the most common etiology of pancreatitis in pregnancy, representing a larger percentage of cases than in the non-pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is subdivided into two types: interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. Treatment of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant individuals. However, additional measures during pregnancy include fetal monitoring and attention to positioning of the mother to avoid compression of the inferior vena cava.

AB  - Summary A system was developed for objective prediction of survival, which could be applied to all critically ill patients, regardless of disease, at an early stage of hospitaluation. Such a system would allow risk assessment of groups for experimental studies according to probability of survival and it might allow us to avoid expenditure of scarce clinical resources on animals with little chance of survival. The prospective study included 200 critically ill dogs: 93 females and 107 males, representing 62 breeds. With survival defined as alive 30 days after admisssion to ICU the overall mortality rate was 40.5% (81 of 200 dogs). Data collected included signalment and parameters that reflected vital organ function, the severity of physiologic derangement and the extent of physiologic reserve. We recorded the most abnormal value for each parameter within 24 hours of admission to ICU and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze four different weighting systems. The best model had a concordance 0f 86.5% with outcome, and it was then re-evaluated to determine whether individual variables could be eliminated without losing predictive accuracy. Fourvariables were eliminated, resulting in a final model with 18 variables which had 86.3% concordance with outcome. At a 0.5 cut-off for predicted risk, the model had sensitivity Of 69%, specificity ficity of 86% and positive predictive value of 77%. A Receiver Operating Curve was constructed using serial cut-offs for predicted outcome from 0.1 to 0.9, and the area under the curve was 0.89. Thus, an equation was generated that gives an estimate of the probability of survival.
