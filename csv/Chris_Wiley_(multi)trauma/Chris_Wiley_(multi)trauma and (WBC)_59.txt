AB  - CASE OF THE MONTH: ABSTRACT September 2004. Free-living amebas in the genera Naegleria, Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia are known to cause CNS infections. Here we report a case of fatal granulomatous amebic meningoencephalitis (GAE) caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris in a 6-year-old previously healthy girl who presented with headache and stiff neck. She was treated medically for brain abscess after a CT scan identified a ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporo-parietal area. A brain biopsy showed necrosis and granulomatous inflammation. Subsequently, multiple new lesions appeared in the brain bilaterally. A second brain biopsy revealed viable amebic trophozoites that were most abundant in perivascular spaces, accompanied by neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence study confirmed the amoeba as Balamuthia mandrillaris. This case demonstrates that making diagnosis of GAE pre-mortem requires a high index of suspicion. Amebic infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of any granulomatous lesion in CNS; and careful search for amebic parasites should be carried out especially when necrosis predominates in the pathological material.

AB  - Summary The role of the phagocytic function of monocytes and neutrophils in sepsis has been poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the impact of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Thirty-one patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and neutrophils was evaluated during 24?h after admission and the results were correlated to the expression of CD64 on neutrophils and monocytes, CD14 antigen on monocytes, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the patients' survival. A reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils during the first 24?h after admission was a negative predictor for survival. Increased expression of CD64 antigen on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes was favourably correlated to the patients' survival. In multivariate analysis the phagocytic activity of PMNs was the only independent predictor factor for survival. Patients with PMN phagocytic activity <37% had lower expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and worse outcome, while those with phagocytic activity >37% had higher expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and better outcome. Reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils may represent a state of neutrophil inactivation similar to that previously described for monocytes during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

AB  - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon but well-known complication after transplantation diagnosed by characteristic radiological features. As limited data on this complex syndrome exist we sought to better define the incidence, clinical presentation and risk factors for PRES in liver transplant (LTx) patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1923 adult LTx recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2010. PRES was diagnosed radiologically in 19 patients (1%), with 84% of cases occurring within 3 months post-LTX. We compared this cohort of PRES patients to 316 other LTx recipients also requiring radiographic imaging within 3 months after LTx for neurological symptoms. Seizure was the most common clinical manifestation in the PRES group (88% vs. 16%, p< 0.001) and 31% had an intracranial hemorrhage. Those with hemorrhage on imaging were more likely to be coagulopathic. PRES patients were significantly more likely to have had alcoholic liver disease and infection/sepsis. These factors may be related to a common pathway of vascular dysregulation/damage that appears to characterize this complex syndrome. Intracranial bleeding and seizures may be the end result of these phenomena. The relationship of these associated factors to the hypothesized pathophysiology of PRES is discussed.

AB  - Summary This paper describes the initial clinical experience of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) at the Fondazione Ca? Granda in Milan between January 2011 and May 2013. EVLP was considered if donor PaO2/FiO2 was below 300Â mmHg or if lung function was doubtful. Donors with massive lung contusion, aspiration, purulent secretions, pneumonia, or sepsis were excluded. EVLP was run with a low-flow, open atrium and low hematocrit technique. Thirty-five lung transplants from brain death donors were performed, seven of which after EVLP. EVLP donors were older (54Â Â±Â 9Â years vs. 40Â Â±Â 15Â years, EVLP versus Standard, PÂ <Â 0.05), had lower PaO2/FiO2 (264Â Â±Â 78Â mmHg vs. 453Â Â±Â 119Â mmHg, PÂ <Â 0.05), and more chest X-ray abnormalities (PÂ <Â 0.05). EVLP recipients were more often admitted to intensive care unit as urgent cases (57% vs. 18%, PÂ =Â 0.05); lung allocation score at transplantation was higher (79 [40?84] vs. 39 [36?46], PÂ <Â 0.05). After transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD72 grade 3, 32% vs. 28%, EVLP versus Standard, PÂ =Â 1), mortality at 30Â days (0% vs. 0%, PÂ =Â 1), and overall survival (71% vs. 86%, EVLP versus Standard PÂ =Â 0.27) were not different between groups. EVLP enabled a 20% increase in available donor organs and resulted in successful transplants with lungs that would have otherwise been rejected (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01967953).
