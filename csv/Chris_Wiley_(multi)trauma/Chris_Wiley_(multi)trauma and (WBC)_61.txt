AB  - Abstract Aim:? Therapeutic hypothermia after perinatal asphyxia decreases brain injury in newborns, whereas hyperthermia worsens the brain injury. We examined how different clinical practices influence regional brain temperatures during hypothermia. Methods:? Six newborn pigs, which have comparable physiology and brain maturation to human term infants, were maintained at hypothermia (33.5°C) or normothermia with a servo-controlled whole-body cooling device that is in clinical use. Pigs were anesthetized and fully instrumented for cardiovascular and temperature (rectal and regional brain) monitoring. Changes in brain temperatures were measured during four different paradigms to mimic different clinical practices. Results:? Inserting an insulating pillow between the head and the heated surface reduced cortex temperature by 1 or 2°C during normothermia (core temperature Tcore 37°C) or hypothermia, Tcore 33.5°C. Reducing ambient temperature from 28°C to 23°C reduced cortex temperature by 3.9?±?1.9°C. Without a hat and overhead heater at normothermia, cortex and deep brain temperatures were reduced by 1.2?±?0.8 and 0.7?±?0.7°C, respectively. Direct overhead heating abolished the normal cortex to deep brain temperature gradient that was maintained if using a head shield. Conclusion:? Brain temperature may differ from core temperature during therapeutic hypothermia influenced by different clinical practices.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.

There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - Urinary Tract Infection among Clean-Room Workers: Jian Nan Wang1, et al.1 Department of Family Medicine, Chie-Mei Foundation Hospital?Many high-tech industries do some manufacturing processes in clean-rooms to ensure high quality and yield. To prevent contamination, workers need to put on special clothing and go through certain cleaning procedures before entry. Therefore, some workers may limit their water intake and try not to go the bathroom, which are both risk factors of urinary tract infection (UTI). To assess the prevalence and risk factors of UTI among the workers, we conducted a study in an industrial park. We recruited workers who came to the clinic in the park for an annual health examination between September 1 and December 31, 2000. From each participant we collected a urine sample and obtained related information through a questionnaire. All the 1,054 qualified workers, including 416 men and 638 women, participated, and 693 (65.7%) were clean-room workers. Most clean-room workers were women (71.3%), and they tended to be younger and had lower frequencies of drinking water and going to the bathroom during the shift. A higher prevalence of UTI (6.2% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.008) was observed among clean-room workers. After adjusting for age, frequency of dinking water, and working in clean-rooms, female gender was a significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR] = 18.3, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 4.1 to 82.1) and going to the bathroom three times or more during a shift was a protective factor (OR = 0.3, 95% Cl: 0.1 to 1.0). In conclusion, UTI is prevalent among clean-room workers, and frequent voiding is recommended for prevention of the disease.
