AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

AB  - Background Rapid and precise measurement of total and differential nucleated cell counts is a crucial diagnostic component of cavitary and synovial fluid analyses. Objectives The objectives of this study included (1) evaluation of reliability and precision of canine and equine fluid total nucleated cell count (TNCC) determined by the benchtop Abaxis VetScan HM5, in comparison with the automated reference instruments ADVIA 120 and the scil Vet abc, respectively, and (2) comparison of automated with manual canine differential nucleated cell counts. Methods The TNCC and differential counts in canine pleural and peritoneal, and equine synovial fluids were determined on the Abaxis VetScan HM5 and compared with the ADVIA 120 and Vet abc analyzer, respectively. Statistical analyses included correlation, least squares fit linear regression, Passing?Bablok regression, and Bland?Altman difference plots. In addition, precision of the total cell count generated by the VetScan HM5 was determined. Results Agreement was excellent without significant constant or proportional bias for canine cavitary fluid TNCC. Automated and manual differential counts had R2 < .5 for individual cell types (least squares fit linear regression). Equine synovial fluid TNCC agreed but with some bias due to the VetScan HM5 overestimating TNCC compared to the Vet abc. Intra-assay precision of the VetScan HM5 in 3 fluid samples was 2?31%. Conclusions The Abaxis VetScan HM5 provided rapid, reliable TNCC for canine and equine fluid samples. The differential nucleated cell count should be verified microscopically as counts from the VetScan HM5 and also from the ADVIA 120 were often incorrect in canine fluid samples.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.

AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Summary Despite our growing knowledge of spermatogenesis and sperm function, the treatment options for male infertility remain limited. Semen analysis remains the cornerstone in evaluating male fertility. Men with abnormal semen analysis should undergo appropriate clinical work-up. First, lifestyle and potentially interfering female factors should be corrected. Then, whenever an evidence-based therapy is available, any specific cause interfering with sperm output or function should be treated. Finally, although they are not evidence-based, assisted reproductive techniques can be used to alleviate long-standing male infertility
