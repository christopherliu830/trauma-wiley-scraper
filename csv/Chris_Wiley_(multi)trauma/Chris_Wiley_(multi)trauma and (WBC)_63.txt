AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Summary Objective Febrile infection?related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy described as explosive onset of super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in previously healthy children. We describe electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities in the hyperacute phase of FIRES, with the aim of contributing to the diagnostic characterization of a syndrome otherwise lacking specific biomarkers. Methods This is a retrospective single-center, case series of seven children with FIRES. Cases were identified from a Neurocritical Care database. Patient characteristics and clinical course were obtained from electronic medical records. Electroencephalography recordings were reviewed in two segments: the initial 12 h of recording and the 12 h prior to initiation of a medically induced burst suppression (BS). Results Fourteen 12-h segments of video?electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were analyzed for commonalities. A beta?delta complex resembling extreme delta brush (EDB) occurred in at least one 12-h segment for all patients. In six patients, seizures were brief and relatively infrequent during the first recording, with a gradual evolution to status epilepticus by the second. We observed a characteristic electrographic seizure pattern in six of seven patients with prolonged focal fast activity at onset. Shifting seizures were seen in four of seven patients. Significance The diagnosis of FIRES is typically assigned late in a patient's clinical course, which has broad implications for clinical care and research. We retrospectively analyzed acute EEG features in seven patients with FIRES and discovered three common features: gradual increase in seizure burden, presence of a recurrent EDB, and a typical seizure pattern. Recognition of this pattern may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary The use of flow cytometry (FCM) in the study of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) is particularly important. It is able to reliably discriminate between true clonal proliferations and the reactive lymphocytosis seen as a response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Before any potentially clonal disorder can be categorized, it is important to have a basic understanding of T and B-cell lymphoid ontogeny. The pattern of surface cluster differentiation (CD) antigen expression indicates the degree of maturity, the possible relationship with the lymph node germinal centre and sometimes the function of the normal cell from which a malignant population is derived. Many lymphoproliferative disorders and exfoliating lymphoid lymphomas can be encountered in clinical practice. These disorders are extremely different in their biological basis, presentation, morphology and immunophenotype. An accurate diagnosis can only be made when all these characteristics are carefully considered together and not assessed in isolation.

AB  - BACKGROUND The AABB compiles an annual synopsis of the published literature covering important developments in the field of transfusion medicine. An abridged version of this work is being made available in TRANSFUSION, with the full-length report available as Appendix S1 (available as supporting information in the online version of this paper). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Papers published in late 2017 and 2018 are included, as well as earlier papers cited for background. Although this synopsis is comprehensive, it is not exhaustive, and some papers may have been excluded or missed. RESULTS The following topics are covered: ?big data? and ?omics? studies, emerging infections and testing, platelet transfusion and pathogen reduction, transfusion therapy and coagulation, transfusion approach to hemorrhagic shock and mass casualties, therapeutic apheresis, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. CONCLUSION This synopsis may be a useful educational tool.

AB  - Summary Acute meningitis may be caused by a wide variety of infectious pathogens as well as by non-infectious diseases. Given its frequency and clinical impact, this chapter focuses specifically on acute bacterial meningitis. Rapid recognition of meningitis is critical to ensure timely receipt of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Encephalitis is distinguished from meningitis by the presence of abnormal brain function, which may manifest as altered mental status, motor, sensory or speech deficits, movement disorders, or seizures. The chapter presents diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, other diagnostic modalities, preventive therapy and prognosis of meningitis and encephalitis. It focuses primarily on viral encephalitis in adults in the United States. There are a multitude of viral causes of encephalitis. Viruses may cause direct neuro-invasion and post-infectious autoimmune phenomenon, including anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis.

AB  - Summary Risk factors for invasive candidiasis in children with candidaemia are poorly defined. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all children with candidaemia at our tertiary children?s hospital from 2000 to 2006. Invasive candidiasis was diagnosed by review of the medical record and standardised EORTC/MSG criteria. A variety of risk factors for invasive candidiasis were explored. Of 194 episodes of candidaemia in the microbiology laboratory database, 180 clinical records were available. Evaluation for invasive candidiasis consisted of 174 (97%) echocardiograms, 167 (93%) dilated ophthalmological examinations, 136 (76%) chest CT scans and 108 (60%) abdominal ultrasounds (complete, hepatosplenic or renal). Of the 180 patients, 15 (8%) were identified with invasive candidiasis (4 proven, 1 probable, 10 possible). Prematurity <32?weeks (P?<?0.01), an underlying immunocompromising disorder (P?<?0.01), and ≥2?days of candidaemia (P?=?0.05) were significantly associated with invasive candidiasis. Invasive candidiasis, especially proven or probable, in the setting of candidaemia was not common in our hospital, but premature infants and immunocompromised children were at significantly higher risk. Based on our findings, extensive imaging and examination by an ophthalmologist were particularly low-yield for invasive candidiasis in immunocompetent children beyond infancy.
