AB  - A 49-year-old Japanese male first visited our clinic at May 13th, 2003. A bean-sized black macule had been noticed in the parietal region since childhood. The lesion had increased in size gradually and had become 30?mm in diameter. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant melanoma clinically and also dermoscopically. Sentinel node navigation using radioisotope revealed the metastases. We performed wide local excision and radical neck dissection, and the definite diagnosis of malignant melanoma and regional nodal metastases was made. TNM staging was stage?b, that is, pT4b, N2c, M0. The patient also had nine small black freckles on the trunk and extremities. All of them were excised, and eight lesions of them were diagnosed as malignant melanoma, because proliferation of atypical melanocytes and formation of abundant abnormal nests in epidermis were observed histopathologically. Chemotherapy was performed, but metastases of skin and visceral region were found in February, 2004. These lesions had put up strong resistance to chemotherapy and the patient died on June, 6th, 2004. Autopsy revealed multiple metastases including heart, kidneys, liver and large intestine and so on. No other family members suffered from malignant melanoma. The origin of this patient?s melanoma remained unclear.

AB  - Background: Nodular Hidradenoma (NH) is an uncommon neoplasm with controversial cell origin (myoepithelial, eccrine and more recently apocrine), and few cytogenetic and DNA flow Cytometry data. Material and Methods: We report a case of NH on the left ankle of a 77 year-old man. The tumor was located subcutaneously and measured 2.5???2.0?cm, with no throbbing, tenderness, edema, or groin lymphadenopathy. A wide local excision was performed. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA), S-100 protein, p63 and Calponin were examined. A fresh central portion of the tumor was examined for karyotyping and DNA flow cytometry. Six months later the patient was healthy without local recurrence. Results: The tumor was positive for SMA, Calponin and p63 with focal staining for S-100. The karyotype showed four aberrant, unrelated clones, t(1;8)(p22;p23), del(11)(q14q23), t(1;10)(p13;q22) and del (6)(q23q26). DNA flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis showed that the tumor is 100% diploid with 6.55% S-phase. Conclusions: Expression of SMA, p63, Calponin, and S-100, which are myoepithelial markers, support a myoepithelial origin of this tumor. The multiclonal pattern observed in this neoplasm seems to reflect cytogenetic divergence during neoplastic progression. DNA diploidy with a low S-phase predicts a benign clinical course.

AB  - Severe keratinocyte dysplasia (SKD) has been reported in the early post-transplant period of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCST) patients, with a frequency as high as 47.4%. In the period less than 3 weeks post-transplant it was associated with cyclophosphamide conditioning. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of SKD in a later post-transplant period, from 28 days to 84 days, and study the possible causes. The 2003 slide file (227 slides) of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance was examined for skin biopsies from patients who had undergone HCST. Twenty-two cases (9.7%) showed SKD. A control group of 22 biopsies matched for days post-transplant and age were selected from the remaining 205 biopsies. SKD was associated with a busulfan conditioning regimen, 72.7% in the SKD group and 36.3% in the control group (p?=?0.016). SKD was not associated with cyclophosphamide (p?=?0.174), fludarabin (p?=?0.263) or total body irradiation (p?=?0.50). Although active GVHD (grade 2 or 3) was more commonly seen in SKD group (45.5%) than the control group (22.2%), it did not show significant difference (p?=?0.052). Our study showed that SKD developed in 9.7% of the skin biopsies from days 28 to 84 post-transplant, and was associated with busulfan conditioning regimen.

AB  - Congenital erosive and vesicular dermatitis healing with reticulated scarring is a rare entity presenting in the early childhood. It is manifest as crusted erosions and vesicles that heal relatively rapidly forming unique reticulated scars. Cohen first reported this entity in 1985 and since then, only ten patients have been reported. We herein report an additional case of this extremely unusual disorder. A 23 month-old girl who was noted to have ?rashes? and sores over her body at birth. Her twin sister was unaffected. She was born preterm at 35 weeks gestation but her developmental milestones have been within normal range. On exam she had depressed and somewhat macerated erosions and erythema primarily on her trunk, axillae, and ears. No vesicles or bullae were present. The skin biopsy showed neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates with abundant crusting. Cultures were negative for infectious agents and direct immunofluorescent studies were also negative. Over the next two years she periodically developed erosions which healed quickly. However, the depressed reticulated scars have persisted and are more sensitive to sun exposure. This scarring disorder may be associated with mild ongoing blistering and must be distinguished from other congenital blistering disorders and immunobullous diseases. The pathophysiology remains unclear.

AB  - A 67-year-old Chinese man presented with a longstanding history of asymptomatic, brown-red macules that diffusely involved his trunk and the extremities and was associated with generalized lymphadenopathy. His serum protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. No monoclonal Bence Jones protein was detected in the urine. Flow cytometry of his peripheral blood revealed a normal polyclonal population of B and T cells. Histopathologic examination demonstrated a dense nodular infiltrate of lymphocytes and numerous mature plasma cells in the reticular dermis. Immunoperoxidase studies for kappa and lambda light chains failed to demonstrate clonality. In addition, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies failed to reveal a monoclonal band. A bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormality. Cutaneous and systemic plasmacytosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous infiltrates in which plasma cells predominate.

AB  - A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented with an eczematous patch on the left proximal inner arm of 12 years duration. She had previously been treated with emollients and topical steroids without complete resolution. The patient denied constitutional symptoms but did note eczematous patches on her buttocks of one-year duration and new eczematous patches on her inner left thigh and right inner upper arm. Upon exam, all lesions were slightly scaly without induration. The primary lesion was a poikilodermatous 4???10?cm rough plaque. No lymphadenopathy was noted. A total of five lesional biopsies were obtained. All of the biopsies demonstrated a superficial infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei and prominent epidermotropism including the formation of Pautrier?s microabcesses. The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was rendered. This case is significant for its onset at two years of age, the benignity of its course over a 12 year period and the long duration before definitive diagnosis was obtained. Mycosis fungoides needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of recalcitrant eczematous disease even in young children.

AB  - Cutaneous plexiform schwannoma is a rare multilobulated variant of benign schwannoma. When presenting as the cellular subtype with significantly increased proliferative rate, diagnostic consideration of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is prompted. However, follow up demonstrates a benign natural history with propensity for local recurrence and typical lack of association with neurocutaneous syndromes. These lesions most commonly occur as cutaneous and subcutaneous masses of the extremities in the first four decades. Only 9 cases of congenital tumors are reported. A case of congenital plexiform cellular schwannoma, presenting as a cutaneous mass measuring 3.5???2.5???2.0?cm, excised from the left upper arm of a 16 month old female is discussed. Regions of increased cellularity and proliferation co-localized and were unassociated with nuclear anaplasia. Mitotic figures numbered 7 per 10 400x fields. The tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for S-100 protein. The MIB-1index was multifocally 25% and p53 protein over expression was present in 50% of nuclei. Following excision with free margins the tumor locally recurred after 16 months. The recurrence was morphologically identical to the original lesion. Recognition of the clinical and morphological characteristics of this rarely encountered benign neoplasm will facilitate in diagnosing this entity.

AB  - A 50-year-old Peruvian man presented with a 4?5 years history of a 1,2???0,7?cm subungual verrucous mass that extended from the proximal nail fold to the hyponychium of the 2nd left toe. Histology of the nail bed showed a nodular tumour with multiple structures, similar to the infundibulum of the follicles, and germ like aggregations often joined to a follicular papilla. Few scattered neoplastic cells were necrotic. The stroma surrounding the nodular aggregations was made up of delicate fibrillary bundles of collagen associated with numerous oval fibrocytes. The histological findings remind us a neoplasm with follicular differentiation: trichoblastoma. A tumor with these histological aspects on the nail unit has never been reported. We name this benign neoplasm, which probably represents an hamartoma, onychoblastoma. Differential diagnosis of this case includes basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the nail unit which is rare and mostly localised in the nail folds. The main histopathologic findings of nodular BCC are asymmetry, ulceration and its poorly circumscription. The hair follicle and the nail share similar embryological and anatomical features and the occurrence of a tumor with follicular differentiation in the nail further demonstrates the common origin of these adnexal structures.

AB  - Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin is a rare tumor with a microscopic resemblance to lymphoepitheliomatous carcinoma of the nasopharynx. We present a 93-year-old man with papules on the left auricle to the cheek that were gradually enlarged. By the time of a biopsy, it grew to a 5.0???3.0???2.8?cm dark red mass, and necrotic debris was attached to the surface. Histologically, a relatively well-demarcated, dermal-hypodermic multiple lobules were composed of irregular islands of atypical epithelial cells. The uniform tumor cells had moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with one or two prominent nucleoli. A dense lymphocytic infiltrate was present within the neoplastic islands, obscuring the epithelial component. The neoplastic cells were unconnected to the overlying epidermis. Neither squamous nor glandular differentiation was present. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin, and negative for latent membrane protein 1. No Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) was detected by in situ hybridization. The negativity for Epstein-Barr virus may be a help in the differential diagnosis from metastatic undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is uniformly positive for EBER.

AB  - Hair erector muscle (HEM) is everywhere in dermatopathology but has been less studied than other smooth muscle systems in the skin. HEM disorders are passive and active, the former related to the involvement, as a bystander fascicle, by nearby conditions. The muscle can be permeated by nevus cells, infiltrated or destroyed by keratoacanthoma and other malignancies, encroached by hemangiomas, suffused by erythrocytes in purpura and pyocytes in an abscess, incorporated into scars and entrapped and deformed by a dermatofibroma. Less passively, HEM can participate in follicular processes, insect bites, collagen-vascular diseases, syphilis, solar elastosis and amyloid. More proper to the muscle yet rarely encountered are myositis (dermatomyositis), poorly understood myopathies (atrophy, vacuolar changes, eosinophilic globules), deposit diseases (glycogenosis) and, even, rare dystrophies (Duchenne/Becker). Finally, other than HEM tumors (leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma), hamartomatous conditions include disorganized/hypertrophic muscle in blue nevi, hyperplasia in Becker?s nevus, and more substantial muscle mass increase as in smooth muscle hamartoma (including similar changes in mature port-wine stain) and in the rare congenital midline hamartoma. This presentation outlines orderly features and, mainly, compiles disorders of HEM, few of them a disease on its own but still a supplement to a gamut of many more noticeable entities.

AB  - Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are classically associated with primary vasculitic syndromes, including Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and Wegeners granulomatosis. Recently, drug induced ANCA positive vasculitis has been reported, most frequently in association with propylthiouracil in Grave?s disease. Cocaine use is known to be associated with pulmonary and systemic eosinophilia as well as various vascular pathology, including vasospasm, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis. We report a case of cocaine associated perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) positive vasculitis. A 46-year-old man with a history of crack cocaine abuse presented with arthralgia, lower extremity edema, and multiple purpuric, tender papules and plaques over the hands and lower extremities. Peripheral blood studies revealed hypereosinophilia, and serologic tests demonstrated a p-ANCA titer of 1:2560. A skin biopsy demonstrated injured small dermal vessels with a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, karyorrhectic debris, erythrocytes, and abundant eosinophils. His symptoms and eosinophilia resolved with cessation of cocaine use and intravenous dexamethasone. Following a 2 year period of reported abstinence, the patient relapsed on cocaine and presented with similar clinical, serologic, and histologic findings. Although p-ANCA has been reported in patients with cocaine associated midline destructive lesions, to our knowledge, this is the first report of cocaine associated p-ANCA positive systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Background: There are only two reported cases of hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) associated with precocious puberty. Here we report a third case, and the first one to be autopsied. Design: A 5-year-old female with HI, intractable seizures and mental retardation presented with gray vaginal discharge and bacterial vaginosis. The patient subsequently died from neurologic complications and was autopsied. Results: Post-mortem examination revealed pigmentary mosaicism following the lines of Blaschko and advanced development of vulvar labia, pubic hair, and breast buds. Other significant autopsy findings included conical teeth, patchy alopecia, macrosomia (body weight and height above 95th percentile), and macrocephaly with megalencephaly (brain 1850?g). The uterus and ovaries were unremarkable. Epidermis had decreased melanocytes in hypopigmented areas. Skin fibroblast karyotype was normal. Conclusion: The two previous case reports indicate that the mechanism for precocious puberty in HI may be either biochemical, as in McCune-Albright Syndrome, or independent of GnRH. The mechanism of the precocious puberty in our case is most likely central.

AB  - Retinoic X receptor-b (RXR-b) is a heterodimerization partner for vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 activation of VDR leads to growth inhibition in numerous cell lines, including some melanoma lines. Evaluation of VDR and RXR-b expression in vivo in melanocytic neoplasms will increase our understanding of this pathways potential role in growth control. Previous studies in our laboratory showed decreased VDR expression in superficially invasive melanoma, and progressive loss of expression in deeply invasive melanomas and metastatic melanomas (MET). We next sought to evaluate RXR-b expression. Twenty-eight melanocytic neoplasms including 8 melanomas in situ (MIS), 9 primary invasive melanomas (PIM), and 11 MET were evaluated for RXR-b expression by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear labeling was assessed as 0 (0%), 1+(<5%), 2+(>5% but <50%), or 3+(>=50%). A significant increase in RXR-b expression from low (0?1+) to high (>1+) was found when comparing MIS to PIM and MET (chi2 p?<?0.05). These data suggest: 1) potential loss of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced growth inhibition during melanoma progression may be due to decreased VDR expression without concomitant loss of RXR-b; and 2) increased RXR-b expression during melanoma progression may offer selective advantage through alternative signaling pathways.

AB  - The inconsistent use of the term ?erythema annulare centrifugum? has created confusion, in that it has been applied to a group of distinct diseases as if they were a single condition. The literature becomes more ambiguous when different names are given to annular eruptions that have a similar pathogenesis. We present two neonates who presented at birth with similar diffuse erythematous annular eruptions, but differed in their serologic and histopathologic findings. The first child was otherwise healthy and had normal laboratories findings that excluded both infectious and autoimmune diseases. His biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate throughout the entire dermis that was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous eosinophils. The second neonate had elevated anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, thrombocytopenia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. His biopsy showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. There was a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate that extended throughout the dermis which consisted primarily of nuclear debris. Within the cytoplasm of the few intact histiocytes and neutrophils, were hematoxylin bodies, giving these cells the appearance of LE cells. We discuss the clinical and histopathological findings in these two neonates and attempt to clarify the nomenclature pertaining to the annular erythemas.

AB  - Introduction: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a low grade B cell lymphoproliferative disease with overlapping features with small lymphocytic lymphoma. The neoplastic cell is an autoreactive CD5 CD23 B lymphocyte. B-CLL may involve the skin, typically in the context of known disease. We present a case of subclinical B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. Results: A 73-year-old male developed a lesion on his right cheek in April 2003 compatible with basal cell carcinoma. The re-excision specimen contained a well differentiated atypical lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with B-CLL along with residual carcinoma. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed slight thrombocytopenia and mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. A diagnosis was made of stage 0 CLL. Chromosomal studies on peripheral blood showed a deletion at 13q14.3. Conclusion: This case represents a cutaneous presentation of subclinical B-CLL. There are two prior reports describing B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. In one case the infiltrates were incidental on a re-excision specimen. The second report suggests 16% of B-CLL patients have cutaneous manifestations as the first sign of disease. Data indicates that 13q14 deletion in B-CLL in early stage disease may portend a more aggressive course, possibly explaining its early presentation in the skin in our case.

AB  - Genetic identity analysis is a procedure that may be done on paraffin blocks to determine genetic identity or non-identity of tissues. On occasion biopsy specimens from different patients are mixed up. This becomes a major problem if the subsequent diagnoses require further therapy or have other significant medical implications. We recently had such a case in which three biopsy specimens from a middle age man were possibly mixed up with that from a pre-teen age boy. The biopsy from the pre-teen was originally reported as a malignant skin tumor. Initially, the three biopsy specimens from the middle age man were sent for genetic identity analysis, which showed that one biopsy specimen was genetically different. The biopsy specimen from the pre-teen was then sent, and found to be genetically similar to the two genetically identical specimens originally submitted for the middle age man. Further confirmation of genetic identity could have been obtained by obtain further samples from both patients, but was not felt necessary in this case. We review the procedure used for genetic identity analysis as well as its other applications for this procedure in clinical practice.

AB  - A 33-year-old African American woman presented with a 2 year history of skin lesions on her legs. Skin biopsy demonstrated interstitial and focally confluent reticular dermal histiocytic infiltrate consistent with granuloma annulare. She was treated with high-potency topical steroids and returned 14 months later with diffuse papular lesions, 80?lb. weight loss, and dyspnea. Repeat skin biopsy showed similar distribution of interstitial and sheet-like histiocytopathy, accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis, cell-poor lymphocytic interface dermatitis and thrombogenic vasculopathy. Stains for fungi (AB ? PAS and GMS) and mycobacterial species (Ziehl-Neelsen, Fite and auramine-rhodamine immunofluorescence) were negative. No foreign material was evident under polarized light. A diagnosis of cutaneous necrotizing sarcoidosis was made. Necrotizing sarcoidosis is a well-recognized pulmonary entity, but is rarely reported in the skin. Diagnostic features include granulomata with regional necrosis, often with a granulomatous vasculitis, in the absence of demonstrable microbial pathogens. Patients are typically adult women who present with pulmonary symptoms, fever, weight loss and fatigue. The etiology of sarcoidosis remains obscure. One proposed mechanism is an id reaction to an as yet unidentified pathogen, with circulating microbial antigens leading to an occlusive and infarctive vasculopathy. Such a mechanism could explain the pathologic changes seen with our patient.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - Case 1: A 38 year-old man presented with a painless right post auricular mass, slowly growing for ten years. Clinical impression was a salivary gland lesion. The excised mass measured 3?cm and was gelatinous. Case 2: A 28 year-old man presented with a lump in the region of the left heel, slowly growing for several years. Excision revealed a lobulated pink-gray mass measuring 2?cm. In both cases, histology demonstrated a circumscribed encapsulated proliferation of tumour cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma. There were almost exclusively hyaline cells with plasmacytoid features, arranged predominantly in nests and sheets with abundant pink cytoplasm and hyaline inclusions. Round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and rare mitotic figures were seen. Both cases stained strongly positive for low molecular weight cytokeratin, S 100 and vimentin and were negative for desmin, smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin. We describe two cases of hyaline cell-rich chondroid syringoma, a histologically benign entity. The importance in recognizing this entity is that these tumors can easily be confused with malignant neoplasms including malignant melanoma, myxoid chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Follow up for a year has shown no evidence of metastases or recurrence in both cases.

AB  - Atypical fibroxanthoma is a fairly common dermal neoplasm that is characterized histologically by infiltrating pleomorphic spindle cells and atypical giant cells with numerous mitoses. Clinically, the lesion most commonly presents as a solitary ulcerated papule on the head or neck of elderly males. We report a patient with a rare granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma. The patient was a seventy-five-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the left scalp treated by Mohs surgery two years prior. In the vicinity of the previous squamous cell carcinoma site, the patient presented with a slow growing, approximately 1.0 by 1.0?cm red, violaceous, firm nodule on the left scalp. The clinical impression was recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a dermal tumor composed of pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm with numerous typical and atypical mitoses. The tumor stained focally with Factor VIII, CD 68, and SMA and 30% of the neoplastic cells stained with Ki 67. Staining for Keratin cocktail, High Molecular Weight Keratin, Melan A and S100 were negative. PAS strongly stained the granules. These features are consistent with a granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma.
