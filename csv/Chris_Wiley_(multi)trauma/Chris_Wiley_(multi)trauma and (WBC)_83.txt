AB  - Hair erector muscle (HEM) is everywhere in dermatopathology but has been less studied than other smooth muscle systems in the skin. HEM disorders are passive and active, the former related to the involvement, as a bystander fascicle, by nearby conditions. The muscle can be permeated by nevus cells, infiltrated or destroyed by keratoacanthoma and other malignancies, encroached by hemangiomas, suffused by erythrocytes in purpura and pyocytes in an abscess, incorporated into scars and entrapped and deformed by a dermatofibroma. Less passively, HEM can participate in follicular processes, insect bites, collagen-vascular diseases, syphilis, solar elastosis and amyloid. More proper to the muscle yet rarely encountered are myositis (dermatomyositis), poorly understood myopathies (atrophy, vacuolar changes, eosinophilic globules), deposit diseases (glycogenosis) and, even, rare dystrophies (Duchenne/Becker). Finally, other than HEM tumors (leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma), hamartomatous conditions include disorganized/hypertrophic muscle in blue nevi, hyperplasia in Becker?s nevus, and more substantial muscle mass increase as in smooth muscle hamartoma (including similar changes in mature port-wine stain) and in the rare congenital midline hamartoma. This presentation outlines orderly features and, mainly, compiles disorders of HEM, few of them a disease on its own but still a supplement to a gamut of many more noticeable entities.

AB  - Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are classically associated with primary vasculitic syndromes, including Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and Wegeners granulomatosis. Recently, drug induced ANCA positive vasculitis has been reported, most frequently in association with propylthiouracil in Grave?s disease. Cocaine use is known to be associated with pulmonary and systemic eosinophilia as well as various vascular pathology, including vasospasm, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis. We report a case of cocaine associated perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) positive vasculitis. A 46-year-old man with a history of crack cocaine abuse presented with arthralgia, lower extremity edema, and multiple purpuric, tender papules and plaques over the hands and lower extremities. Peripheral blood studies revealed hypereosinophilia, and serologic tests demonstrated a p-ANCA titer of 1:2560. A skin biopsy demonstrated injured small dermal vessels with a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, karyorrhectic debris, erythrocytes, and abundant eosinophils. His symptoms and eosinophilia resolved with cessation of cocaine use and intravenous dexamethasone. Following a 2 year period of reported abstinence, the patient relapsed on cocaine and presented with similar clinical, serologic, and histologic findings. Although p-ANCA has been reported in patients with cocaine associated midline destructive lesions, to our knowledge, this is the first report of cocaine associated p-ANCA positive systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Background: There are only two reported cases of hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) associated with precocious puberty. Here we report a third case, and the first one to be autopsied. Design: A 5-year-old female with HI, intractable seizures and mental retardation presented with gray vaginal discharge and bacterial vaginosis. The patient subsequently died from neurologic complications and was autopsied. Results: Post-mortem examination revealed pigmentary mosaicism following the lines of Blaschko and advanced development of vulvar labia, pubic hair, and breast buds. Other significant autopsy findings included conical teeth, patchy alopecia, macrosomia (body weight and height above 95th percentile), and macrocephaly with megalencephaly (brain 1850?g). The uterus and ovaries were unremarkable. Epidermis had decreased melanocytes in hypopigmented areas. Skin fibroblast karyotype was normal. Conclusion: The two previous case reports indicate that the mechanism for precocious puberty in HI may be either biochemical, as in McCune-Albright Syndrome, or independent of GnRH. The mechanism of the precocious puberty in our case is most likely central.

AB  - Retinoic X receptor-b (RXR-b) is a heterodimerization partner for vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 activation of VDR leads to growth inhibition in numerous cell lines, including some melanoma lines. Evaluation of VDR and RXR-b expression in vivo in melanocytic neoplasms will increase our understanding of this pathways potential role in growth control. Previous studies in our laboratory showed decreased VDR expression in superficially invasive melanoma, and progressive loss of expression in deeply invasive melanomas and metastatic melanomas (MET). We next sought to evaluate RXR-b expression. Twenty-eight melanocytic neoplasms including 8 melanomas in situ (MIS), 9 primary invasive melanomas (PIM), and 11 MET were evaluated for RXR-b expression by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear labeling was assessed as 0 (0%), 1+(<5%), 2+(>5% but <50%), or 3+(>=50%). A significant increase in RXR-b expression from low (0?1+) to high (>1+) was found when comparing MIS to PIM and MET (chi2 p?<?0.05). These data suggest: 1) potential loss of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced growth inhibition during melanoma progression may be due to decreased VDR expression without concomitant loss of RXR-b; and 2) increased RXR-b expression during melanoma progression may offer selective advantage through alternative signaling pathways.

AB  - The inconsistent use of the term ?erythema annulare centrifugum? has created confusion, in that it has been applied to a group of distinct diseases as if they were a single condition. The literature becomes more ambiguous when different names are given to annular eruptions that have a similar pathogenesis. We present two neonates who presented at birth with similar diffuse erythematous annular eruptions, but differed in their serologic and histopathologic findings. The first child was otherwise healthy and had normal laboratories findings that excluded both infectious and autoimmune diseases. His biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate throughout the entire dermis that was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous eosinophils. The second neonate had elevated anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, thrombocytopenia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. His biopsy showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. There was a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate that extended throughout the dermis which consisted primarily of nuclear debris. Within the cytoplasm of the few intact histiocytes and neutrophils, were hematoxylin bodies, giving these cells the appearance of LE cells. We discuss the clinical and histopathological findings in these two neonates and attempt to clarify the nomenclature pertaining to the annular erythemas.

AB  - Introduction: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a low grade B cell lymphoproliferative disease with overlapping features with small lymphocytic lymphoma. The neoplastic cell is an autoreactive CD5 CD23 B lymphocyte. B-CLL may involve the skin, typically in the context of known disease. We present a case of subclinical B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. Results: A 73-year-old male developed a lesion on his right cheek in April 2003 compatible with basal cell carcinoma. The re-excision specimen contained a well differentiated atypical lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with B-CLL along with residual carcinoma. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed slight thrombocytopenia and mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. A diagnosis was made of stage 0 CLL. Chromosomal studies on peripheral blood showed a deletion at 13q14.3. Conclusion: This case represents a cutaneous presentation of subclinical B-CLL. There are two prior reports describing B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. In one case the infiltrates were incidental on a re-excision specimen. The second report suggests 16% of B-CLL patients have cutaneous manifestations as the first sign of disease. Data indicates that 13q14 deletion in B-CLL in early stage disease may portend a more aggressive course, possibly explaining its early presentation in the skin in our case.

AB  - Genetic identity analysis is a procedure that may be done on paraffin blocks to determine genetic identity or non-identity of tissues. On occasion biopsy specimens from different patients are mixed up. This becomes a major problem if the subsequent diagnoses require further therapy or have other significant medical implications. We recently had such a case in which three biopsy specimens from a middle age man were possibly mixed up with that from a pre-teen age boy. The biopsy from the pre-teen was originally reported as a malignant skin tumor. Initially, the three biopsy specimens from the middle age man were sent for genetic identity analysis, which showed that one biopsy specimen was genetically different. The biopsy specimen from the pre-teen was then sent, and found to be genetically similar to the two genetically identical specimens originally submitted for the middle age man. Further confirmation of genetic identity could have been obtained by obtain further samples from both patients, but was not felt necessary in this case. We review the procedure used for genetic identity analysis as well as its other applications for this procedure in clinical practice.

AB  - A 33-year-old African American woman presented with a 2 year history of skin lesions on her legs. Skin biopsy demonstrated interstitial and focally confluent reticular dermal histiocytic infiltrate consistent with granuloma annulare. She was treated with high-potency topical steroids and returned 14 months later with diffuse papular lesions, 80?lb. weight loss, and dyspnea. Repeat skin biopsy showed similar distribution of interstitial and sheet-like histiocytopathy, accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis, cell-poor lymphocytic interface dermatitis and thrombogenic vasculopathy. Stains for fungi (AB ? PAS and GMS) and mycobacterial species (Ziehl-Neelsen, Fite and auramine-rhodamine immunofluorescence) were negative. No foreign material was evident under polarized light. A diagnosis of cutaneous necrotizing sarcoidosis was made. Necrotizing sarcoidosis is a well-recognized pulmonary entity, but is rarely reported in the skin. Diagnostic features include granulomata with regional necrosis, often with a granulomatous vasculitis, in the absence of demonstrable microbial pathogens. Patients are typically adult women who present with pulmonary symptoms, fever, weight loss and fatigue. The etiology of sarcoidosis remains obscure. One proposed mechanism is an id reaction to an as yet unidentified pathogen, with circulating microbial antigens leading to an occlusive and infarctive vasculopathy. Such a mechanism could explain the pathologic changes seen with our patient.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - Case 1: A 38 year-old man presented with a painless right post auricular mass, slowly growing for ten years. Clinical impression was a salivary gland lesion. The excised mass measured 3?cm and was gelatinous. Case 2: A 28 year-old man presented with a lump in the region of the left heel, slowly growing for several years. Excision revealed a lobulated pink-gray mass measuring 2?cm. In both cases, histology demonstrated a circumscribed encapsulated proliferation of tumour cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma. There were almost exclusively hyaline cells with plasmacytoid features, arranged predominantly in nests and sheets with abundant pink cytoplasm and hyaline inclusions. Round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and rare mitotic figures were seen. Both cases stained strongly positive for low molecular weight cytokeratin, S 100 and vimentin and were negative for desmin, smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin. We describe two cases of hyaline cell-rich chondroid syringoma, a histologically benign entity. The importance in recognizing this entity is that these tumors can easily be confused with malignant neoplasms including malignant melanoma, myxoid chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Follow up for a year has shown no evidence of metastases or recurrence in both cases.

AB  - Atypical fibroxanthoma is a fairly common dermal neoplasm that is characterized histologically by infiltrating pleomorphic spindle cells and atypical giant cells with numerous mitoses. Clinically, the lesion most commonly presents as a solitary ulcerated papule on the head or neck of elderly males. We report a patient with a rare granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma. The patient was a seventy-five-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the left scalp treated by Mohs surgery two years prior. In the vicinity of the previous squamous cell carcinoma site, the patient presented with a slow growing, approximately 1.0 by 1.0?cm red, violaceous, firm nodule on the left scalp. The clinical impression was recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a dermal tumor composed of pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm with numerous typical and atypical mitoses. The tumor stained focally with Factor VIII, CD 68, and SMA and 30% of the neoplastic cells stained with Ki 67. Staining for Keratin cocktail, High Molecular Weight Keratin, Melan A and S100 were negative. PAS strongly stained the granules. These features are consistent with a granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as a complication of both types of HSCT. Recently the clinical phenomenon of late-onset (>100 days) acute GVHD has been described following nonablative HSCT. However, there has been no relevant description of the histologic features of GVHD in this setting. We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of 28 cases of acute and chronic GVHD following nonablative HSCT at out institution between 2000 and 2003. Our results support the observation of late onset acute GVHD in nonablative HSCT. The mean onset of acute GVHD was 109.8 days (range 8?410 days). Furthermore, we identified a subset of patients (8/23) in the acute GVHD group with composite histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD. This subset was more likely to develop chronic GVHD as compared to patients with only classic acute GVHD, 87.5% versus 25%, respectively (p?<?0.01). Composite histologic features could serve a a predictor of an increased risk for the development of chronic GVHD. These patients may potentially benefit from more aggressive treatment than patients with histologic features of solely acute GVHD.

AB  - Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma typically presents as solitary, well-circumscribed, firm plaques or nodules. We describe a case of cutaneous leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag on the thigh of a 50-year-old male. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a dome-shaped tumor with interlacing fascicles of smooth muscle with pleomorphism, cellular atypia and multiple mitoses. Malignant tumors may rarely present as a skin tag, and these are most frequently basal cell carcinomas. We are unaware of previously reported leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag. This case suggests that solitary, wide-based, papilloma-like lesions or skin tags should be submitted for histologic examination to rule out malignancy.

AB  - The Src-family tyrosine kinases are modulators of growth-regulatory signals within keratinocytes. The relationship between Src kinases and epidermal neoplasia is unexplored in human biopsies. Keratinocytes express 3 Src kinases: Src, Fyn, Yes. Activation of these kinases corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylation? near the active site, tyrosine 416 of human Src. This study compared the levels of total Src-kinase protein and activated Src kinases within a spectrum of lesions ranging from actinic keratoses (AKs) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An antibody that recognizes an epitope in Src, Fyn, and Yes revealed the total level of Src kinase protein; an antibody specific for the phosphoryated active site tyrosine determined the level of Src kinase activation. The level of Src-kinase expression and activated Src kinases was evaluated in paraffin imbedded sections of AKs, SCC in-situ (SCIS), and SCC containing adjacent unremarkable epidermis. The total level of Src kinase protein in lesions was similar to unremarkable epidermis. The level of Src kinase activation was elevated within approximately one-third of AKs and SCIS, but was increased in over 80% of SCCs. These results demonstrate Src kinases are activated in epidermal neoplasia, and that increased Src kinase activity is associated with the transition from SCIS to SCC.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that typically arises in the pleural cavity but may also be seen at extra-pleural sites including liver, lung, thymus, orbit, soft tissue, and rarely the skin. The diagnosis of cutaneous SFT is challenging due to its histologic variability and lack of distinctive immunophenotype. We report a case of SFT with unusual histologic and immunophenotypic findings. A 23-year-old man presented with a two-year history of a painful, enlarging scalp mass. Histologic examination revealed a variably cellular neoplasm composed of tumor cells with uniform oval nuclei embedded in a collagenous matrix. In areas there was a prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature. The tumor was strongly immunoreactive for CD34 and had some immunoreactivity for S100. The diagnosis of SFT was rendered based upon the histologic features and strong immunoreactivity for CD34. Immunoreactivity for S100 is rarely seen in SFT. The tumor had a mitotic rate of 8/50?hpf. Mitotic rates greater than 5/50?hpf have been associated with aggressive behavior in SFTs of soft tissue. The significance of aggressive histologic attributes with clinical outcome is yet to be determined in cutaneous SFT. Cutaneous SFTs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of superficial spindle cell tumors.
