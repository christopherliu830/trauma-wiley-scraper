AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - A 64-year-old white male presented with a three-month history of multiple crusted erythematous nodules on the lower legs. The patient was immunosuppressed on prednisone and tacrolimus secondary to liver transplant. Biopsy revealed a fibrinopurulent crust overlying an interstitial, non-follicular oriented, neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis. PAS and GMS positive septate hyphae were present within the stratum corneum while yeast-like forms with pseudohyphal projections, suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis, were found within the dermis. There was no evidence of follicular rupture or granulomatous inflammation. Subsequent culture grew Trichophyton rubrum confirming the diagnosis of deep dermatophytosis. This case illustrates several histologic differences in deep dermatophyte infection in the immunocompromised host from invasive dermatophyte infection, Majocchi?s granuloma, occurring in the immunocompetent patient. In the immunocompromised patient there is typically the following: no evidence of fungal invasion via a ruptured hair follicle, suppurative inflammation as opposed to granulomatous inflammation, and atypical fungal forms consisting of swollen hyphae and round, yeast-like, arthroconidia, as opposed to the slender hyphae seen in Majocchi?s granuloma. In addition, because of the clinical appearance of the lesions, immunocompromised state of the patients, and atypical fungal forms seen on biopsy, an initial diagnosis of systemic mycosis is often incorrectly made.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.

AB  - Abstract Dendrimers have emerged as a powerful class of nanomaterials in the nanomedicine field due to their unique structural features: globular, well-defined, highly branched and controllable structure, nanosize-scale, low polydispersity, and the presence of several terminal groups that can be functionalized with different ligands simulating the multivalency present in different biological systems. Although in its infancy, the application of dendrimers as therapeutics or theranostic tools in central nervous system (CNS) disorders is already significant and has opened promising avenues in the treatment of many conditions where the inherent ?smartness? of the dendritic structures is being explored to effectively target the CNS. Here we present an overview of the past and future challenges of the use of dendrimers to respond to one of the ultimate challenges in the (nano)medicine field: to attain CNS repair and regeneration.

AB  - Dimorphic fungal infections (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis) can occur in immunocompromised and healthy individuals. Cutaneous involvement is often secondary and may be the presenting sign of systemic disease. These ominous infections are frequently clinically indistinct and their prognosis is influenced by their timely diagnosis and treatment. Morphological differentiation between these organisms is not definitive and tissue cultures represent the diagnostic gold standard in current day practice. However, not uncommonly tissue cultures are not obtained and merely represent an afterthought in seemingly unsuspecting cases. Furthermore, when performed, they may take several days to weeks for completion. In situ hybridization (ISH) utilizing oligonucleotide probes directed against fungal ribosomal RNA represents a rapid and accurate assay for the diagnosis of dimorphic fungi in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. We present 7 patients in whom ISH both prospecitively and retrospectively confirmed the presence of a cutaneous infection (2 histoplasmosis, 2 blastomycosis, 1 coccidiomycosis, 2 cryptococcosis). In all of the skin sections analyzed, dimorphic fungi were morphologically apparent but not diagnostically discernable. In summary, ISH represents a valuable tool in the prompt diagnosis of cutaneous deep fungal infections.

AB  - A 37-year-old woman with diagnosis of Sjogren?s syndrome (SS) presented with asymptomatic non-palpable purpura of the lower extremities. Biopsy of a purpuric macule revealed a perivascular and focally nodular lymphocytic infiltrate with large numbers of plasma cells, seemingly around eccrine glands. There was no vasculitis. The histologic findings in the skin were strikingly similar to those of salivary, parotid, and other ?secretory? glands affected in SS. The cutaneous manifestations of SS highlighted in textbooks include xerosis, annular erythema, small-vessel vasculitis, and pigmented purpura. This case illustrates that purpura in skin of patients with SS may be caused by a peri-eccrine plasma-rich infiltrate. The link between hypergammaglobulinemia, auto antibodies, plasma cells infiltration, and development of extranodal B-cell lymphoma in SS remains to be elucidated.

He also reported seeing ?dark spots? at night. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced and appeared smaller than his age. The skin examination revealed numerous 2?8?mm follicular, keratotic papules on the extensor surfaces of the patient?s arms and legs. H&E preparation of the skin biopsy revealed distention of the upper portion of the follicles with prominent keratotic plugging, as well as focal follicular perforation and acute inflammation. Laboratory examination revealed a vitamin A level of 11, carotene level of less than 2, and retinol binding protein of 2.1. The patient was diagnosed with phrynoderma and initiated on vitamin A therapy. After a two-months course of vitamin A therapy, his serum vitamin A increased to 67, and he had dramatic improvement of the follicular eruption. This is a fascinating case of phrynoderma in a child with biliary dysfunction. The presence of perforating folliculitis on histology is curious, as there are less than 10 documented cases of perforating folliculitis in phrynoderma. This case illustrates the intriguing clinical and pathological presentations of phrynoderma.

AB  - Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a common soft tissue sarcoma of adults. We present an unusual case which initially showed features of a pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor (PHAT). The lesion was characterized by abundant plump, eosinophilic cells exhibiting striking nuclear atypia, set in a dense, hyalinized stroma with a prominent, angiectatic vasculature. Rare mitotic figures were identified. These findings were felt to be most consistent with the diagnosis of PHAT. Four months after removal, local recurrence was noted, which demonstrated findings of a high grade MFS, including a cellular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells set in a prominent myxoid stroma. Multiple mitoses, including atypical ones, were present. In light of these findings, the original specimen was reexamined and the diagnosis was revised to high- grade MFS. MFS, especially low-grade lesions, may be confused with several benign lesions. Previous cases mimicking PHAT have not been reported. We describe a unique case of high-grade MFS which initially showed characteristic features of a PHAT, raising the possibility that MFS may occasionally arise in, or have areas that masquerade as, PHAT. It is possible that PHAT, currently considered a benign neoplasm, may actually represent a peculiar form of MFS of low malignant potential.

AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a recessively inherited genodermatosis associated with extreme sun sensitivity, defective repair of several types of sunlight induced adducts in cellular DNA, and numerous, early-onset skin cancers. The dry, rough skin corresponds to progressive cytologic atypia and loss of polarity in the underlying epidermis. Associated with these changes are immune deficiencies against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin cancer. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a DNA synthesis antimetabolite used against several types of cancers. Applied topically in normal subjects it is associated with moderate to severe inflammation in areas where actinic keratoses have arisen followed by ablation of the actinic keratoses which is dependent on the inflammation. We applied 5-FU to the sun-exposed skin of two patients with XP, a 14 year-old light complected black male and a 14 year-old Caucasian female. No inflammation was observed, but marked improvement in the clinical presentation of the skin was seen, as well as an absence of new malignancies. This change was confirmed histopathologically and correlated with normalization of polarity and cytologic changes in the epidermal cells. These histologic findings were quantitated using computerized image analysis. These results may be due to activation of alternative DNA repair pathways in these nucleotide excision repair deficient cells.

AB  - Cutaneous granular cell tumour is a well-characterised benign neoplasm of Schwann cell origin. However, there remains a sub-category of neoplasms that appears non-neural in origin and thus requires further appraisal. We present on 11 clinicopathological cases of non-neural granular cell tumour, highlighting the histological patterns, immuno-profile, clinical features and behaviour. The results showed that lesions most commonly occurred in young to middle aged adults (9 cases, median?=?33?years, age range: 6?56?years), with a slight female predominance. The lesions presented as painless nodules, mainly on the extremities or face. Local excision was the treatment of choice and up to date follow-up reveals no local recurrence or metastasis. Histologically, the lesions were polypoid (8 cases) or intra-dermal (3 cases), and composed of elongated spindle-shaped to polygonal cells with prominent granular cell change and focal, variable nuclear atypia. Low level of mitotic activity was noted. Immunohistochemical labelling of the tumour cells showed expression for NKI-C3 (n.11) and CD68, with no staining for S100 protein, SMA, desmin and cytokeratin. In conclusion, this analysis of 11 clinicopathological cases will contribute to the characterisation of this recently described entity, which despite some atypical histological features appears to behave in a completely indolent fashion.

AB  - We describe a 7-year old male with a 7-month history of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) presenting as an innocuous 0.5???0.5?cm nodule on the nasal dorsum. Following diagnostic sampling, Mohs? micrographic surgery was performed to ensure adequate removal and patient continues to do well 1 year post-surgery. PFT is a rare neoplasm described initially by Enzinger and Zhang in 1988. It afflicts children and young adults (median age: 14.5 years) and has a strong female predisposition. It typically occurs on the upper extremity. Histologically, the tumor has a bland appearance consisting of a biphasic population of varying numbers of fibroblast and histiocyte-like cells. Cellular atypia and pleomorphism are lacking and mitotic activity is low. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally, the tumor demonstrates myofibroblastic differentiation. The constituent cells have a diploid DNA content. Unique cytogenetic aberrations have been anecdotally identified. PFT behaves in a locally aggressive fashion and regional nodal disease can occur despite adequate excision. In rare instances, metastasis to the lungs has been described. No association between specific clinicopathologic features and outcome has been identified. In summary, PFT is a rare but distinct low-grade myofibroblastic tumor of children and young adults with a misleading clinical and histological appearance.

AB  - Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma in children. The majority of LL are derived from immature T cells and present with a mediastinal mass with or without bone marrow involvement. The incidence of subsequent leukemic conversion is high. LL presenting as an isolated tumor in the skin has rarely been described in children. In this study, we reviewed the literature and present four additional cases of childhood primary cutaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma (PCLL). We also contrasted PCLL with mediastinal LL and compared the clinical and prognostic features of PCLL with granulocytic sarcoma (GS). Most tumors occurred in the scalp. Histologically, all cases demonstrated a dense monomorphic dermal infiltrate of intermediate sized cells with scant cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli. The majority of cases were of precursor B phenotype, in contrast to primary mediastinal LL. A number of patients demonstrated concomitant bone marrow involvement at presentation and concurrent or subsequent conversion to acute lympoblastic lymphoma. We believe there are many similarities between PCLL and GS, both in terms of clinical presentation and the association of acute leukemia. Recognition of this uncommon tumor is important so that appropriate clinical workup and therapy may be instituted.

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, characterised by recurrent crops of necrotic self-healing papules and nodules. Although chronic, LyP typically has a benign clinical course in the majority of cases. Histologically, a malignant appearing T-cell lymphoid infiltrate is seen. The atypical cells often resemble the cerebriform cells of mycosis fungoides or Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 10?20% of the patients go on to develop lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides, CD30-positive anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin lymphoma. We report a case of LyP associated with a B-cell lymphoma. A 50-year-old male, presented with scattered erythematous scaly papules, some with central crust, located on the arms, trunk and leg of one-month duration. A skin biopsy revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with many large atypical lymphocytes, resembling Reed Sternberg cells. By immunohistochemistry, the large cells were positive for T-cell markers and CD30. Subsequently, he developed fever, night sweats and diffuse lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy showed a vaguely nodular proliferation of small to medium lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic and flow cytometric studies best characterised the process as mantle cell lymphoma. Although, LyP has been previously associated with lymphomas of above-mentioned types, this is an extremely unusual case presenting with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma.
