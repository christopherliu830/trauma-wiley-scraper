AB  - Cutaneous granular cell tumour is a well-characterised benign neoplasm of Schwann cell origin. However, there remains a sub-category of neoplasms that appears non-neural in origin and thus requires further appraisal. We present on 11 clinicopathological cases of non-neural granular cell tumour, highlighting the histological patterns, immuno-profile, clinical features and behaviour. The results showed that lesions most commonly occurred in young to middle aged adults (9 cases, median?=?33?years, age range: 6?56?years), with a slight female predominance. The lesions presented as painless nodules, mainly on the extremities or face. Local excision was the treatment of choice and up to date follow-up reveals no local recurrence or metastasis. Histologically, the lesions were polypoid (8 cases) or intra-dermal (3 cases), and composed of elongated spindle-shaped to polygonal cells with prominent granular cell change and focal, variable nuclear atypia. Low level of mitotic activity was noted. Immunohistochemical labelling of the tumour cells showed expression for NKI-C3 (n.11) and CD68, with no staining for S100 protein, SMA, desmin and cytokeratin. In conclusion, this analysis of 11 clinicopathological cases will contribute to the characterisation of this recently described entity, which despite some atypical histological features appears to behave in a completely indolent fashion.

AB  - We describe a 7-year old male with a 7-month history of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor (PFT) presenting as an innocuous 0.5???0.5?cm nodule on the nasal dorsum. Following diagnostic sampling, Mohs? micrographic surgery was performed to ensure adequate removal and patient continues to do well 1 year post-surgery. PFT is a rare neoplasm described initially by Enzinger and Zhang in 1988. It afflicts children and young adults (median age: 14.5 years) and has a strong female predisposition. It typically occurs on the upper extremity. Histologically, the tumor has a bland appearance consisting of a biphasic population of varying numbers of fibroblast and histiocyte-like cells. Cellular atypia and pleomorphism are lacking and mitotic activity is low. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally, the tumor demonstrates myofibroblastic differentiation. The constituent cells have a diploid DNA content. Unique cytogenetic aberrations have been anecdotally identified. PFT behaves in a locally aggressive fashion and regional nodal disease can occur despite adequate excision. In rare instances, metastasis to the lungs has been described. No association between specific clinicopathologic features and outcome has been identified. In summary, PFT is a rare but distinct low-grade myofibroblastic tumor of children and young adults with a misleading clinical and histological appearance.

AB  - Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma in children. The majority of LL are derived from immature T cells and present with a mediastinal mass with or without bone marrow involvement. The incidence of subsequent leukemic conversion is high. LL presenting as an isolated tumor in the skin has rarely been described in children. In this study, we reviewed the literature and present four additional cases of childhood primary cutaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma (PCLL). We also contrasted PCLL with mediastinal LL and compared the clinical and prognostic features of PCLL with granulocytic sarcoma (GS). Most tumors occurred in the scalp. Histologically, all cases demonstrated a dense monomorphic dermal infiltrate of intermediate sized cells with scant cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli. The majority of cases were of precursor B phenotype, in contrast to primary mediastinal LL. A number of patients demonstrated concomitant bone marrow involvement at presentation and concurrent or subsequent conversion to acute lympoblastic lymphoma. We believe there are many similarities between PCLL and GS, both in terms of clinical presentation and the association of acute leukemia. Recognition of this uncommon tumor is important so that appropriate clinical workup and therapy may be instituted.

AB  - A 47 year-old female presented with a five-month history of left lower extremity cellulitis which was refractory to oral antibiotics. Physical exam revealed focal erythema of the left lower extremity and left inguinal adenopathy. A left leg skin punch biopsy revealed a dense infiltrate present primarily within the deep dermis consisting of markedly atypical large cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism and focal multinucleation. Many of the cells displayed ?horseshoe shaped? or ?donut shaped? nuclei, consistent with so-called hallmark cells and/or wreath cells. Scattered mitoses were also observed. Imunohistochemical stains for CD45 and vimentin were positive. Stains for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CK7, desmin, and S-100 protein were negative. The CD45-positive population was also positive for CD3, CD30, CD45 Ro, and epithelial membrane antigen. They were negative for CD20, CD15, and CD43. A biopsy of the left inguinal lymph nodes revealed involvement by a morphologically similar neoplasm with an identical immunohistochemical staining pattern. Additionally, a CD56 and ALK-1 stain were performed on the lymph node biopsy, and both were negative. This neoplastic process represents a CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis includes an ALK-1-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and a primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

AB  - Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, characterised by recurrent crops of necrotic self-healing papules and nodules. Although chronic, LyP typically has a benign clinical course in the majority of cases. Histologically, a malignant appearing T-cell lymphoid infiltrate is seen. The atypical cells often resemble the cerebriform cells of mycosis fungoides or Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 10?20% of the patients go on to develop lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides, CD30-positive anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin lymphoma. We report a case of LyP associated with a B-cell lymphoma. A 50-year-old male, presented with scattered erythematous scaly papules, some with central crust, located on the arms, trunk and leg of one-month duration. A skin biopsy revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with many large atypical lymphocytes, resembling Reed Sternberg cells. By immunohistochemistry, the large cells were positive for T-cell markers and CD30. Subsequently, he developed fever, night sweats and diffuse lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy showed a vaguely nodular proliferation of small to medium lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic and flow cytometric studies best characterised the process as mantle cell lymphoma. Although, LyP has been previously associated with lymphomas of above-mentioned types, this is an extremely unusual case presenting with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

AB  - Background: Sun exposure plays an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Melanocytic lesions occur in sun-exposed skin and protected skin. Here we study the histologic interaction of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and solar elastosis (SE). Design: We selected 15 invasive malignant melanomas (MM) and 6 benign melanocytic nevi (MN) occurring in sun exposed areas in patients with significant SE. We measured SE thickness in perilesional skin and SE displacement in lesional skin. Results: SE thickness was 0.64?+/??0.11?mm in MM, and 0.38?+/??0.06 in MN (P?<?0.05). SE displacement was 1.02?+?/?0.85?mm in MM, and 0.44?+/??0.30 in MN (P?<?0.05). Tumor cells and host response were responsible for displacement of SE in MM. Thickness of displaced SE was decreased in 6?MM and 1?MN (attenuation), unchanged in 7?MM and 4?MN and increased in 2?MM and 1?MN. Conclusion: Displacement of SE may be helpful in the diagnosis of MM. In MM the newly formed tumor and associated host response appear to push down the preexisting solar elastosis. Conversely, long standing benign MN in sun exposed areas appear to coexist with the SE without significant displacement.

AB  - CD44 is the cell surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA). We demonstrated that the lack of CD44 expression in murine keratinocytes leads to an abnormal HA accumulation in the dermis, indicating an important role of CD44 in local HA metabolism in mouse skin. We also observed a decrease in the expression of epidermal CD44 in patients of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus which is potentially responsable for the dermal deposition of HA. We also showed that HA accumulation was associated with decreased expression of CD44 in epithelial proliferations in perifollicular solitary cutaneous myxoma. In this study we examined the follicular expression of CD44 and HA in the skin biopsy specimens of seven patients with follicular mucinosis by using CD44-specific antibodies and biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP), respectively. No difference of CD44 expression was observed in the follicular keratinocytes when compared with those of unaffected interfollicular epidermis. The follicular zones of mucin deposition were strongly positive for HA. A weak interkeratinocyte staining pattern for HA was also observed in the interfollicular epidermis. However, HABP staining revealed a stronger reactivity in the follicular keratinocytes surrounding the mucin-accumulated areas compared to the interfollicular keratinocytes, indicating an active secretion of HA by follicle cells in follicular mucinosis.

AB  - CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of ten variant exons (v1-v10). Standard CD44 (CD44s) is the cell-surface receptor for hyaluronate and is involved in lymphocyte homing and activation. The function of the variant CD44 isoforms (CD44v) is unknown. Recently we observed an altered expression of CD44s and CD44v in different inflammatory skin diseases. In cutaneous lichen planus (LP) CD44s and CD44v are expressed in the epidermis whereas dermal lymphocytes express strongly CD44s and weakly CD44v3 and are negative for CD44v. In this study we examined the expression of CD44s and CD44v (CD44v3, CD44v4, CD44v5, CD44v6, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10) in active oral LP lesions by immunohistochemistry. CD44s was highly expressed by keratinocytes and dermal lymphocytes. Epithelial expression of CD44v4, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10 was decreased or absent. Biopsies did not contain CD44v3, CD44v7, CD44v7v8 and CD44v10-positive lymphocytes. Lymphocyte expression of CD44v4, CD44v5 and CD44v6 was observed. Unlike CD44v4 and CD44v5, CD44v6 was expressed by large quantities of lymphocytes. Our results show that the expression of CD44v in oral LP is different from cutaneous LP, which suggests that differential expression of CD44v may play a role in the generation of LP in different locations.

AB  - Sparganosis is a helminthic infection caused by the migrating larvae of the cestode genus Spirometra. Human infection is most commonly encountered in regions of the Far East where it has been associated with dietary consumption and medicinal usage of raw snake and frog tissue preparations or the drinking of contaminated water. Approximately 63 cases of sparganosis have been reported in the United States and reports of cutaneous sparganosis are very rare within the world literature. A case of cutaneous sparganosis involving the lateral abdominal region of a 54-year-old Filipino American women is discussed. Clinically the lesion presented as a cutaneous nodule. Skin punch biopsy revealed a sparganum possessing an undulating body wall with outermost microvillus layer overlying a thick tegument. Two thin smooth muscle layers and deeper subtegumental cells resided subjacent to the tegument. Calcareous corpuscles and intermixed mesenchymal tissues occupied the central regions of the larval worm. The inflammation consisted of a dense perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and surrounding dermal fibrosis. Cutaneous sparganosis is rarely encountered in dermatology and dermatopathology practice, hence recognition of the clinical, histomorphological and patient history characteristics associated with this helminthic infection will facilitate in diagnosing this entity.

AB  - Mature cystic ovarian teratomas (MCOT) are the most common ovarian neoplasm and contain components of one or more embryonic germ cell layers. Ectodermal components are most common. Rarely (1?3%), malignant transformation can occur in MCOT and are usually epidermoid, although multiple case reports of melanomas have been described. Four compound nevi and three blue nevi have also been reported; however, atypical (dysplastic) nevi have not been reported to our knowledge. A 28-year-old woman presented with a right ovarian mass. A 5???4???2.5?cm cystic ovarian mass was filled with hair and grumous keratinaceous debris. The lining was smooth with a 1?cm dark macule. Histologically, the mass was predominantly lined by epidermis and appendages. The pigmented lesion consisted predominantly of melanocytic nests irregularly disposed on sides and tips of distorted rete ridges, some with bridging between adjacent rete ridges, and junctional extension lateral to the small dermal component of nevus. Slight fibrosis invested some rete ridges. Moderate atypia was present. Although melanomas and melanocytic nevi have rarely been described previously in MCOT, we present the first atypical (dysplastic) compound nevus, to our knowledge. This case expands the spectrum of melanocytic lesions arising in MCOT.

AB  - A 60-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis and lung transplant presented to clinic with a three week history of cutaneous eruption on the extremities associated with nausea and fatigue. His medications included prednisone and azathioprine. Exam revealed the patient was afebrile with multiple perforating nodules and subcutaneous nodules in a sporotrichoid pattern over the extremities. Tissue was sent for histopathological evaluation, and culture for bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, and deep fungal organisms was performed. Histopathology revealed necrotizing panniculitis, but no organisms were found, and tissue cultures were negative. Due to choreoathetoid movements of the right extremities and persistence of cutaneous nodules, the patient was hospitalized and an extensive search for infectious etiology of his condition undertaken. Empiric antibacterial and antifungal therapy was given, but he progressed to multiorgan failure and expired. Autopsy revealed rare amoebic trophozoite forms in the skin in addition to cysts in the lung and brain. Cause of death was determined to be disseminated Acanthamoebiasis. Review of initial skin biopsy showed rare trophozoites. Differing from Entamoeba, Acanthamoeba is a rare but important emerging pathogen. Histopathological diagnosis of Acanthamoeba rests on high index of suspicion in cases of suspected infectious etiology.

The patient had recently undergone cardiac catheterization via his right femoral artery. The patient had no other complaints, was afebrile, and generally felt well. The clinical impression was either cholesterol emboli versus vasculitis. A 4?mm punch biopsy was obtained. Histopathology showed a vasculitis with many basophilic organisms consistent with bacteria present within the vascular spaces. There was a perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and neutrophils. A gram stain revealed gram-positive cocci. The clinician was immediately notified and blood cultures were drawn and echocardiogram performed. The cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. While no evidence of endocarditis was found, a psuedoaneurysm of the right femoral artery was noted. Despite rapid admission and treatment, the patient subsequently expired.

AB  - An 85 year-old woman presented with two pearly papules on her left cheek. The clinical impression was BCC. Biopsy revealed a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes emanating from the epidermis and extending beyond the papillary dermis. A diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered. Excison with frozen section margin control was performed. Permanent sections revealed melanoma, at least 2.06?mm in depth, with melanoma in situ extending to all peripheral margins. Upon re-examination of the initial biopsies, pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia (PEH) with marked squamous atypia was noted. Intimately admixed with the squamous proliferation was a growth of large malignant epithelioid cells. The epitheliod cells lacked pigment production and extended to the shave biopsy margins. This second population of cells was strongly S-100 positive, diagnostic for amelanotic verrucous melanoma. A revised diagnosis of verrucous malignant melanoma, Clark level III, 0.82?mm in depth was rendered. The patient?s course was complicated by multiple positive surgical margins and she ultimately received XRT. This case spotlights the rare occurrence of PEH in conjunction with melanoma. PEH can mask the underlying melanoma and lead to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. As demonstrated, immunostaining is essential in diagnosis of this difficult tumor.

AB  - Physicians of various specialties submit cases for histopathological examination. Using the dermatopathology report as an objective verification tool of clinical diagnostic accuracy we assessed the diagnostic abilities of nondermatologist physicians, who performed various types of skin biopsies, and compared them with those of dermatologists. In total, 4,451 cases were analyzed. Dermatologists diagnosed twice the number of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions correctly (75%) than nondermatologists (40%). The clinical diagnosis rendered by family practitioners matched only in 26% the histopathological diagnosis. Plastic surgeons did better than family physicians but still had a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 45% for skin tumors. Inflammatory skin diseases were correctly diagnosed in 71% of the cases by dermatologists but in only 34% of the cases by nondermatologists. In our view, it is appropriate for nondermatologists to perform skin biopsies only, if they have required sufficient knowledge in basic dermatology and dermatopathology. A skin biopsy consists not only of the technical aspects of the actual procedure but necessitates an understanding of basic dermatology and dermatopathology to facilitate clinicopathological correlation.

AB  - We present a case of a sixty-one-year-old Hispanic man with multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Facial papules and nodules appeared around age five, increasing in number with age. Two BCCs were diagnosed and treated elsewhere, one of which prompted enucleation of the left eye and radiation therapy to that area at age fifty. Physical examination showed nodules (0.5 to 2.5?cm in size) on the scalp, face, ears, arms and the upper back. Biopsies from such tumors demonstrated three histological patterns: pure trichoepithelioma, trichoepithelioma with unequivocal BCC, and basaloid neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis. The trichoepithelioma shows the typical pattern: hair papillae, cystic, retiform basaloid cells and abundant stroma. The BCCs, which were often admixed with the trichoepitheliomas, were nodular type with peripheral palisading, stromal retraction, central confluent necrosis and adenoid features. The basaloid neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis showed cords and nests of basaloid cells without follicular differentiation. Immunohistochemically BCC?s areas showed more uniform and stronger staining for BCL-2 than in trichoepithelioma though the latter showed papillary mesenchymal staining. No significant difference was observed for Ber-EP4 and CD34. We conclude this may represent a unique malignant degeneration or a contiguous gene syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma patients without lymph node metastases (Stage II) have a variable five-year survival. The influence of falsely negative lymph nodes on this variability is unknown. DESIGN: The Poisson distribution describes the probability of finding no positive lymph nodes when a certain number are examined. Using this model, we analysed lymph node dissection results from 780 patients with melanoma and published survival results for Stage II patients. RESULTS: In the 294 patients without positive nodes, 18% had fewer than 7 nodes examined. The Poisson probability of finding no positive nodes when 1 to 6 were examined ranged from 0.4 to to 0.8 (mean 0.6). We partitioned survival for stage II into two categories: those with truly negative nodes with a five-year survival of 80% and those with a five-year survival matching Stage III (46%). The observed five-year survival of 77% in Stage II patients implied that the fraction with false negative nodes was also 18%, which corresponded with the subgroup with fewer than 7 nodes examined. CONCLUSION: The Poisson model suggests that the variable survival in Stage II patients may reflect the incorrect staging of patients with stage III melanoma who have limited numbers of lymph nodes examined.

AB  - Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. On occasion, KS may histologically mimic pyogenic granulomas (PG), a common benign vascular tumor of the skin. Using immunoperoxidase stains, we examined 28 PG and 4 PG-like KS for HHV-8 to determine the specificity of positive staining in this setting. All PG-like KS demonstrated nuclear staining for HHV-8. No staining was identified in any of the PG. Furthermore, histologic criteria often used to differentiate between these two entities were not helpful in difficult cases. The only distinguishing features were the presence/absence of HHV-8 staining and, in some cases, clinical history. The presence of HHV-8 nuclear staining appears to be a specific marker for KS when comparing PG and PG-like KS. Given the lack of distinguishing morphologic criteria, we suggest performing immunoperoxidase stains for HHV-8 on any PG occurring in a clinically atypical setting.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - Texts and atlases have limitations when used to teach dermatopathology to trainees: they can be tedious and time-consuming to use, image detail is limited, text and figure legends can be ambiguous, and only a minor degree of image annotation (letters, arrows, lines outlining important features) is possible. A video screen recording software program (Camtasia Studio) has been used to create high quality digital audio and video dermatopathology tutorials. The screen recording program is started with the image window being recorded. Audio narration (USB digital microphone) is recorded along with live drawings of annotating lines outlining important histologic features, creating the effect of a ?digital chalkboard? being used by the instructor. Separate clips of each ?chalkboard annotation? with accompanying narration can be combined to create a seamless movie detailing each of the important histopathologic features leading to a specific dermatopathologic diagnosis. Video dermatopathology tutorials are extremely effective because they closely mimic instruction at the microscope. However, they offer the significant advantage of allowing remote teaching at any time or place convenient for the learner. Tutorials can be compressed into a variety of multimedia formats and streamed for web delivery or can be provided on CD for distribution.
