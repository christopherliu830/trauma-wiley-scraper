AB  - 1 Anu Muraja-Murro, 1 Ari Pääkkönen, 2 Leena Jutila, 2 Reetta Kälviäinen, 3 Arto Immonen, 1 Sara Määttä, and 1 Esa Mervaala ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; 2 Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mismatch-negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential (ERP) produced by a deviant stimuli that occurs infrequenty among standard stimuli. MMN is thought to reflect the activation of an automatic change-detector system that compares new auditory input with a short-term memory trace generated by the previous auditory stimuli. MMN in human has been demonstrated from several cortical sites, but not to our knowledge from hippocampus or amygdala. This is surprising, given that these limbic structures are so essential for learning and memory functions. We could obtain MMN from these temporomesial structures using intracranial electrodes in adult patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Methods: 4 adults with intractable temporal lobe seizures (age 32?48 years) had each 2?4 stereotactically implanted 6-contact depth-electrodes at amygdalo-hippocampal complex. The electrodes were implanted via lateral approach and their exact anatomical localizations were confirmed by MRI and CT in situ. After the post hoc anatomical localization of the depth-electrodes, the presence of MMN could be studied from 6 hippocampi and 5 amygdalas (i.e., the electrode tips were exactly within amygdalo-hippocampal complex). The most mesial depth-electrode contacts were chosen for the MMN analysis with the MMN latency range of 120?250 ms, as well as with the P300 range of 250?500 ms. We analyzed possible statistically significant differences between the ERPs to deviant and standard tones. Results: A definite MMN within 120?250 ms latency range could be recorded from 4/6 hippocampi and 3/5 amygdalas. MMN was also detected within 250?500 ms latency range in 3/6 hippocampi and 2/5 amygdalas, respectively. In only one patient the hippocampal MMN resembled typical scalp-recorded MMN. In all, the MMN decreased from the deepest contacts towards the cortex, suggesting a local maximum of MMN at the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Conclusions: Our data implicates that a local and early (120?500 ms post-stimuli) automatic electrophysiological change-detector system exists within the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. This data is the first to demonstrate that also these temporomesial structures are activated and involved in mismatch detection, and is in line with recent sensory mismatch fMRI studies. Other sensory stimuli might also produce MMN in the same structures, possibly thus revealing a common function for hippocampus and amygdala in early sensory stimulus detection. 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 2 Gabriel Moeddel, 1 Elia M. Pestana, 1 Deepak K. Lachhwani, 1 Ajay Gupta, 1 Prakash Kotagal, and 1 Elaine Wyllie ( 1 Department of Epilepsy and Sleep Disorder, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Westfalen, Germany ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is part of the presurgical workup of patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery to determine language and memory lateralization. Most information on results and complications are derived from adults. Little is known about children undergoing IAT. Difficulties arise from anxiety, need for barbiturate dosage adjustment, and impaired baseline memory in children with mental retardation [4]. The goal of this study was 1) to describe language lateralization in children with epilepsy and 2) to outline complications during IAT. Methods: 126 consecutive pediatric IAT performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a seven year period were reviewed. Results: 44 patients were age 5?12 years, 82 were age 13?18. 102 were right-handed. Amobarbital (n = 96, average dose: 100 +- 25 mg) or Methohexital (n = 30, average dose 5 +- 1 mg) was injected into the left (n = 18), right (n = 13), or both (n = 95) ICA. Language was localized in 95 patients (75.4%): 75 [78.9%] were left, 6 [6.3%] were right, 14 [14.7%] bilateral language dominant. Neurological complications included prolonged lethargy impairing language and memory evaluation in 4 patients. Four children had a seizure after injection. Additionally, valid data could not be obtained due to fear or agitation in three children age 5?9 years. No lasting neurological deficits were seen. General complications included shortness of breath after contrast injection in one boy. One girl presented with fever of 38.5 C the night after the procedure complaining of groin pain. No other major complications were seen. Conclusions: This is one of the largest pediatric IAT series studied so far. The data on language lateralization agree with those previously reported [1, 2, 3]. The IAT in children is an invasive test with a potential for complications, as in adults, occuring in 10 out of 126 patients [7.9%]. Our series highlights the need for refinement and further development of novel methods to establish language lateralization in children during the evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Isojärvi ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ; and 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: To prospectively evaluate changes in interictal heart rate (HR) variability in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after 4 years follow-up. Methods: A 24-hour ECG recording was obtained at baseline and four years after first recording in 18 patients with refractory TLE, 18 patients with well controlled TLE, and once in 36 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Time and frequency domain measures, along with fractal and complexity measures of HR variability, were analysed from the ECG recordings. Results: At baseline most of the measures showed decreased HR variability in the TLE patients compared to control subjects. After four years follow-up, most of the HR variability measures were further decreased in patients with TLE, and the RR interval (p = 0.015), the Poincaré component SD2 (p < 0.002), and ApEn (p = 0.000) value decreases from the baseline were statistically significant. Conclusions: TLE was associated with reduced HR variability at the baseline of the study. Further decrease in HR variability in patients with TLE was observed after four-year follow-up 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Shalini Mukherjee, 1 K.K. Deepak, and 1 Padma Vasantha ( 1 Department of Neurology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; and Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India ) Rationale: Changes in cardiovascular tone is noted in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients. The dysfunction of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients. The present study was aimed at finding out the effect of epilepsy surgery on autonomic functions in intractable epileptic patients. Methods: 27 patients of mean age 27.3 +/?10.8 who were intractable for over two years or more and selected for surgery. They underwent a battery of tests that assessed their autonomic reactivity. Baseline autonomic activity (tone) was also measured by Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The patients underwent the same tests again 3 months later. Results: The indices of Deep Breathing test (DBT)- before and after surgery, i.e. E:I ratio (1.27 +/?0.13 vs. 1.4 +/? 0.1) and delta changes in heart rate (20.5 +/? 8.75 vs. 23.0 +/? 1.3) show an increase, though not significant, in parasympathetic reactivity after surgery. No changes were observed in the Valsalva Maneuver or in the 30:15 ratio in the Head Up Tilt test (HUT). The rise in Diastolic BP in Hand Grip Test (28.0 +/? 7.0 vs. 16.0 +/? 10.4) was significantly less after surgery. The reactivity tests show that there may be a trend towards increase in parasympathetic and decrease in sympathetic reactivity after surgery. Among the parameters in the HRV which denote the autonomic tone, most of the time domain measures between pre and post surgery patients, i.e. SENN (1.4 +/? 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/? 1.2), SDSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), RMSSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), NN50 (0.55 +/? 3.3 vs. 5 +/? 26.1), pNN50 (0.4 +/? 0.1 vs. 0.51 +/? 0.2) showed an increase in values post surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone. In the frequency domain measures, LF (nu) and% LF denote the sympathetic tone; LF (nu) ((45.5 +/? 19.6 vs. 34 +/? 14.6) showed a significant decrease after surgery and%LF (20.8 +/? 13.1 vs. 22.2 +/? 8.8) was also reduced, thereby showing a decrease in sympathetic tone. HF (nu) and% HF denote parasympathetic tone and HF (nu) showed an increase (48.6 +/? 21.5 vs. 57.2 +/? 22.8), while%HF (36.5 +/? 21.8 vs. 43.2 +/? 16.9) showed a significant increase after surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone after surgery. The LF/HF ratios, which show the sympathovagal balance, also showed a significant decrease (1.1 +/? 1.1 vs. 0.63 +/? 0.4) after surgery. Two patients who had abnormal tone before surgery showed normalization after surgery. Conclusions: The present study shows that the autonomic functions are modulated after surgery; exhibiting a decrease in sympathetic reactivity and increase in parasympathetic reactivity. An increase in parasympathetic tone and a significant decrease in sympathetic tone is also noted after surgery.

AB  - 1 Ronald Emerson ( 1 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ) Until recently, functional neurological assessment of neurologically critically ill patients has been limited largely to periodic physical examinations, often compromised by medication effects, along with occasional, brief EEG's. This is changing with the availability of continuous/EEG monitoring, made practical by recent advances in computer and network technology. Indeed, in some centers, continuous EEG monitoring, with or without concurrent video, has become part of routine neuro-critical care. Its greatest initial impact has been on the recognition and management of non-convulsive seizures. The use of EEG monitoring for real-time detection of cerebral ischemia will likely become compelling as effective treatments for acute stroke emerge. Practical implementation of EEG-based cerebral ischemia detection in the ICU, however, awaits development of reliable, robust automated detection algorithms capable of triggering bedside alarms. Concurrent monitoring of other physiological parameters, including blood pressures, intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygenation along with EEG-derived parameters may provide the basis for development of better treatment models incorporating multivariable feedback systems. Evoked potentials can provide useful prognostic information, with long latency evoked potentials attracting recent attention as possible predictors of recovery of consciousness in comatose patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral tube and parenteral hyperalimentation are widely used nutritional support systems. Few studies examine the relation between nutritional support and patient outcomes in seriously ill hospitalized adults. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between nutritional support and survival in seriously ill patients enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). DESIGN: A prospective study of preferences, decision-making, and outcomes. SETTING: Five teaching hospitals PARTICIPANTS: 6298 patients aged 18 or older meeting diagnostic and illness severity criteria. MEASUREMENT: Demographic characteristics, diagnoses, comorbid conditions, acute physiology score, nutritional support, and functional status before hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 2149 patients received nutritional support. In patients who received artificial nutrition on hospital days 1 or 3 (Cohort 1), enteral feeding was associated with improved survival in coma (hazard: 0.53; 95%CI, 0.42-0.66), and reduced survival in COPD (hazard: 1.57; 95%CI, 1.18-2.08). In patients who were hospitalized on Day 7 and received artificial nutrition on days 1, 3, or 7 (Cohort 2), enteral tube feeding (hazard: 0.35; 95%CI, 0.27-0.46) or hyperalimentation (hazard: 0.58; 95%CI, 0.38-0.90) was associated with improved survival in coma. Tube feeding was associated with decreased survival in acute respiratory failure (ARF) or multiorgan system failure (MOSF) with sepsis (hazard: 1.21; 95%CI, 10.4-1.41), cirrhosis (hazard: 2.15; 95%CI, 1.35-3.42), and COPD (hazard: 1.37; 95%CI, 1.04-1.80). Hyperalimentation was associated with decreased survival in ARF or MOSF with sepsis (hazard: 1.34; 95%CI, 1.12-1.59). CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional support was associated with improved survival in coma. Enteral feeding and hyperalimentation was associated with decreased survival in ARF or MOSF with sepsis. Tube feeding was associated with decreased survival in cirrhosis and COPD. Except for patients in coma, artificial nutrition was not associated with a survival advantage.
