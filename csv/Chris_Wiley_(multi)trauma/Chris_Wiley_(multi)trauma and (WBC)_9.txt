AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - Summary Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA) is an uncommon neurological disease that most commonly affects Arabian horses. Affected horses are typically identified within the first 6 months of life. Intention tremor, wide based stance and ataxia are common clinical signs observed in affected individuals. No treatment is available for resolution of clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is based on histopathological examination of cerebellar tissue, which is characterised by loss of Purkinje cell layer. This report describes a case of cerebellar abiotrophy that had a delayed diagnosis until 6 years of age.

AB  - Summary There are several differences in treatment of neonatal foals with antimicrobials, compared to mature horses. Firstly, the dose of many antimicrobials is different in the foal. For orally administered drugs, this may also affect their efficacy, due to different enteral absorption. Secondly, neonatal foals are not yet hindgut fermentors and this allows antimicrobials with a high propensity to cause colitis in mature horses to be used. Thirdly, toxicities are different and some antimicrobials used in mature horses, such as enrofloxacin, are not suitable for use in foals. Foal-specific information is therefore needed for their safe and effective treatment with antimicrobials.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical, radiological, and pathological features of a polyostotic cystic bone lesion in a 9-month-old Doberman Pinscher are described. The patient was diagnosed as having nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism at 6 weeks of age and after dietary correction it remained clinically normal until 9 months when there was sudden left hind-limb lameness due to a pathological fracture through a cystic lesion in the distal femur. Radiography revealed additional cystic structures in the metaphyses of the left radius, and left and right tibia. Pseudofractures were associated with two of the cystic lesions. In some areas the cysts were crossed by trabeculae and in others there were bony ridges on the inner cystic wall. The cavities were lined with flesh-coloured fibrillar material which formed a lacy network extending into cavities. Histologically, multiple small cysts were present adjacent to the larger cavities noted radiographically. The secondary spongiosa and the metaphyseal periosteum were the major abnormal tissue sites. The small cysts appeared to arise in an oedematous and congested metaphyseal spongiosa. The cysts were accompanied by small foci of intense osteoclasis but unattended by compensatory bone production, and the consequent possibility of pseudofractures is an important clinical consideration. Earlier reports demonstrated that resolution of the lesions will follow surgical drainage and curettage of the cystic cavity. Of six cases of polyostotic cystic bone lesions observed in the dog, five were in the Doberman Pinscher breed.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the utility of capsule endoscopy to detect mucosal abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. METHODS Capsules were administered to 2 healthy controls and 8 patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Images were evaluated for quality, gastric emptying time, small intestinal transit time and presence of lesions. RESULTS There were no adverse effects of capsule endoscopy in dogs weighing from 7·7 to 58 kg. The capsule traversed the entire gastrointestinal tract in 5 of 8 patients, with high quality images obtained in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric emptying time and small intestinal transit time ranged from 1 to 270 and 15 to 180 minutes, respectively. In 3 of 8 patients, the capsule remained in the stomach despite pro-kinetics. Gastric lesions included mild haemorrhage and pinpoint erosion (4 of 8), a mass (1) and thickened bleeding pyloric mucosa (2). Two of 3 dogs with capsule retention had gastric lesions. Intestinal lesions included a healing duodenal ulcer, abnormal villi, ileal ulceration and colonic bleeding. Lesions identified by capsule endoscopy were considered a significant source of haemorrhage in 4 of 7 dogs with active bleeding. The relevance of pinpoint gastric mucosal erosions to blood loss is unclear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Capsule endoscopy can enable the non-invasive detection of gastric and small intestinal mucosal lesions in dogs presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Abstract Background Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have an increased risk of neurological complications, particularly stroke and silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a nerve growth factor associated with neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities and increased risk of stroke in patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to analyze plasma BDNF protein levels in children with SCD participating in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Multi-Center Clinical Trial (SIT Trial), comparing plasma samples of children with SCD and SCI to plasma samples from children with SCD without SCI, as well as healthy pediatric control participants. Procedure Entry, exit, and longitudinal blood samples were collected from 190 SIT Trial participants with SCD and healthy pediatric controls over time. BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sample collection was not optimized for measurements of BDNF, but factors affecting BDNF levels were accounted for in analyses. Results BDNF levels were significantly higher in children with SCD in comparison to healthy pediatric control subjects. BDNF levels significantly increased over time in SCD participants. BDNF levels did not show any significant associations with the presence or absence of SCI or new/progressive SCI/stroke or TCD velocities. Conclusions Plasma BDNF levels are elevated and increase over time in children with SCD. Additional studies with more longitudinal samples are needed to address the reasons for those increased levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND Outcomes among older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain poor. This study sought to determine the efficacy of an intensified, multi-agent approach derived from a Dana-Farber consortium trial in younger adults for patients older than 50 years (trial identifier NCT00973752). METHODS The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) at 1 year. Patients received induction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and pegylated asparaginase. Imatinib was incorporated for Philadelphia chromosome?positive disease. After induction, the first consolidation incorporated clofarabine. Patients in remission could proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after induction and consolidation I. Those not receiving HCT went on to receive central nervous system, consolidation II, and continuation phases of treatment. RESULTS Thirty patients were enrolled: 19 achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction and 1 achieved CR after consolidation I for a CR rate of 67%. Sixteen patients underwent HCT. The proportion surviving at 1 year was 63%, and this met the primary endpoint. The 2-year OS rate was 52% (n = 30), and the 2-year disease-free survival rate was 52% for patients achieving CR (n = 20). There was no survival advantage among those undergoing HCT. Therapy-related hyperbilirubinemia prompted adjustments and limitations to asparaginase dosing. CONCLUSIONS Intensified chemotherapy can result in improved outcomes in comparison with historical data. Additional studies of similarly intensive regimens are warranted in this population.
