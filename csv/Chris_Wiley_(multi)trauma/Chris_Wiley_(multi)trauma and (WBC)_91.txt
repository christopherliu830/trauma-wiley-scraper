AB  - Abstract Forty-six patients with pyogenic liver abscess have been treated at Paul Brousse Hospital between 1966 and 1986. The overall mortality was 24 per cent, all 11 deaths occurring in 24 patients seen prior to 1978 when there was often a considerable delay in the diagnosis of liver abscess (mean 90 ± 71 days). In seven patients the diagnosis was not made until post-mortem examination. The mainstay of treatment was surgical drainage. Since 1978 high resolution imaging techniques for the liver, and in particular ultrasound, have been available. The diagnostic delay has been significantly reduced (mean 28±20 days, P<0.01). Patients are receiving definitive treatment at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disease process, with fewer established complications prior to treatment (P < 0.05). Percutaneous drainage under ultrasound control is the preferred initial drainage procedure in high-risk patients. There have been no deaths in 22 patients treated for pyogenic liver abscess since 1978 (P<0.001).

AB  - Objectives? In this study the frequency of inherited thrombophilic risk factors in a population of German CVT patients and their influence on clinical outcome were evaluated. Material and methods? Twenty-five patients (age 37.1±16.3 years) with CVT were screened for inherited coagulation disorders. All participants received a full clinical follow-up (mean follow-up period 4.8±6.4 years). Results? Inherited thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 9 (36%) of the 25 patients studied. Four were found positive for the heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, 2 were heterozygous carriers of the prothrombin-G20210A-polymorphism. APC resistance proved to be a reliable screening method for factor V Leiden mutation, whereas genetic evaluation for protein S and C deficiencies failed to demonstrate any mutations despite the identification of 1 patient with a protein C and protein S deficiency each. One patient suffered from a familial plasminogen deficiency. These 9 patients had a less favorable outcome (P<0.05). Conclusion? Our results demonstrate that screening for inherited thrombophilia should be an integral part in the diagnostic work up of CVT patients. Patients with inherited coagulopathies tended to have a less favorable outcome, corroborating recommendations for a longer period of oralanticoagulation.

AB  - Abstract The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Apheresis Applications Committee is charged with a review and categorization of indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (fourth edition), the subcommittee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Fifth ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by refining the category definitions and by adding a grade of recommendation based on widely accepted GRADE system. The concept of a fact sheet was introduced in the Fourth edition and is only slightly modified in this current edition. The fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis. The article consists of 59 fact sheets devoted to each disease entity currently categorized by the ASFA as category I through III. Category IV indications are also listed. J. Clin.

AB  - A total of 1,921 leukapheresis procedures have been performed on 532 normal and CIVIL donors at six research institutions, for the purpose of supporting granulocytopenic leukemia patients during infectious episodes. The addition of HES alone or in combination with either etiocholanolone or dexamethasone, resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of leukocytes (granulocytes) harvested by continuous and noncontinuous flow centrifugation. Normal donors participating in these programs were monitored prior to and immediately following each procedure by standard laboratory methods which revealed no serious or abnormal changes occurring as a result of the procedure in those undergoing single or multiple donations with these agents. CIVIL donors tolerated the addition of only HES well, as evidenced by the lack of toxic reactions in three donors undergoing 101 to 121 procedures.

AB  - Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are mobilized from the bone marrow and increase in the early phase after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of CECs and indices of endothelial dysfunction in patients with STEMI. In 78 patients with acute STEMI, characterization of CD34+/VEGFR2+CECs, and indices of endothelial damage/dysfunction such as brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD) were determined. Blood samples for CECs assessment and quantification were obtained within 24 hours of admission and FMD was assessed during the index hospitalization. At 30 days follow up, the primary composite end point of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of all-cause mortality, recurrent nonfatal MI, or heart failure and the secondary endpoint of early adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling were analyzed. The 17 patients (22%) who developed MACE had significantly higher CEC level (P?=?0.004), von Willebrand factor (vWF) level (P?=?0.028), and significantly lower FMD (P?=?0.006) compared to the remaining patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that CECs level and LV ejection fraction were independent predictors of MACE. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for CEC level, FMD, and the logistic model with both markers were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.82, respectively, for prediction of the MACE. The 16 patients who developed the secondary endpoint had significantly higher CEC level compared to remaining patients (P?=?0.038). In conclusion, increased circulating endothelial cells and endothelial dysfunction predicted the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and adverse cardiac remodeling in patients with STEMI.
