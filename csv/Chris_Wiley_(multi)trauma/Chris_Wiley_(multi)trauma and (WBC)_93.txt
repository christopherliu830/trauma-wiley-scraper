AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections. We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia. Methods Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1?21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001). Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase. Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery. Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. Results Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia. The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001). The rate of fungal infections (4.8% vs. 3.6%) and induction death (0.9% vs. 2%) was not significantly different. Conclusion For children with newly diagnosed ALL, uniform antibiotic administration until blood count recovery, including fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for afebrile patients, reduced the incidence of bacteremia during the induction phase. Larger, randomized studies should be performed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Abstract The urine chemistry analysis in dogs and cats is performed using commercially available urine chemistry test strips impregnated with colorimetric reagents. Several semi-automated instruments are commercially available for reading reagent test strips. The urine protein pad contains pH-based indicator dye at acidic pH and, when bound to the amino groups of negatively charged proteins, it changes color. Results of the urine test pad are often interpreted in conjunction with the urine specific gravity because the concentration of the urine protein is closely associated with the concentration or dilution of the urine. The test pad detects the presence of glucose by an enzymatic reaction involving glucose oxidase that results in a color change proportional to the amount of glucose present. The dipstick test pad for blood contains a peroxidase substrate which reacts with heme molecules contained in compounds such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, and in erythrocytes.

AB  - Abstract Background The outlook for many brain tumors remains poor. Increased dose intensity has been correlated with response rate and survival in many solid tumors. Patients and Methods Ten children with recurrent or newly diagnosed brain tumors were treated with four sequential courses of high-dose single agent chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support. PBSC harvesting was undertaken prior to chemotherapy and following the first course of chemotherapy (3.6 g/m2 etoposide). Each course of chemotherapy consisted of a single drug followed 48 hours later by PBSC reinfusion. Three patients were treated on Regimen A: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95 g/m2, cyclophosphamide 5 g/m2, and thiotepa 300 mg/m2; three patients were treated on Regimen A? with carmustine 600 mg/m2 replacing cyclophosphamide; four patients received Regimen B: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95g/m2, cyclophosphamide 7 g/m2, and thiotepa 900 mg/m2. Results No course of chemotherapy was complicated by >14 days of neutropenia. Platelet recovery was more prolonged, particularly in patients who had previously received craniospinal irradiation. Non-hematologic toxicity was severe with three toxic deaths including two patients who developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome and respiratory failure. Two of three patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors had a partial response; no responses were observed in patients with high-grade gliomas. Conclusions Administration of multiple courses of high-dose chemotherapy with PBSC support is feasible in this patient population and successfully mitigates hematologic toxicity. Non-hematologic toxicity becomes prohibitive as chemotherapy doses are escalated. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 29:553?559, 1997. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - As infectious complications from blood transfusion have decreased because of sophisticated blood screening, non-infectious side-effects have emerged as the most common complications of transfusion in industrialized countries. Despite making every endeavour, quite a number of these side-effects are very difficult to control. Some of these side-effects present as acute transfusion reactions, the most important of which are transfusion-related acute lung injury, circulatory overload, sepsis, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Acute adverse events require immediate action, but are often difficult to evaluate. On the other hand, transfusion recipients may experience delayed non-infectious side effects, including, non-ABO haemolytic transfusion reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura. In addition, a not well-defined risk of increased mortality following blood transfusion has been recognized. Some aspects regarding the clinical presentation, the physiology behind, and possible preventive measures are summarized here.
