AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. Methods Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999?2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. Results Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. Conclusions Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the admission characteristics and hospital outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients admitted to intensive units (ICUs) after major trauma. Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Lung hyperinflation is a technique used by physiotherapists to mobilize and remove excess bronchial secretions, reinflate areas of pulmonary collapse and improve oxygenation. Hyperinflation may be delivered by the ventilator or manually, by use of a manual resuscitation circuit, depending upon the respiratory and cardiovascular status of the patient. The effects of manual hyperinflation, with respect to excess bronchial secretions and static lung compliance, have been well-established. There is, however, only limited evidence as to the efficacy of ventilator hyperinflation as a physiotherapy treatment technique. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on static pulmonary compliance and sputum clearance in stable intubated and ventilated patients. Method Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied. This was a double crossover study where all patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences over two days. The first sequence involved manual hyperinflation followed two hours later by ventilator hyperinflation and the order was reversed on the second day. In the second sequence, ventilator hyperinflation preceded manual hyperinflation. The variables of static pulmonary compliance and sputum wet weight were analysed by use of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results There was no significant difference in sputum wet weight production between either technique or on either day of treatment. Static pulmonary compliance improved with both hyperinflation techniques (p < 0.05). Conclusions Hyperinflation as part of a physiotherapy treatment can be performed with equal benefit using either a manual resuscitation circuit or a ventilator. Both methods of hyperinflation improve static pulmonary compliance and clear similar volumes of pulmonary secretions. Copyright ? 2002 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Summary The inflammatory response to acute injury among humans has proved difficult to study due to the significant heterogeneity encountered in actual patients. We set out to characterize the immune response to a model injury with reduced heterogeneity, a tracheostomy, among stable critical care patients, using a broad cytokine panel and clinical data. Twenty-three critical care patients undergoing percutaneous bedside tracheostomies were recruited in a medical intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected at five intervals during 24-h peri-procedure. Patients were followed-up for 28 days for clinical outcomes. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the cytokines between the five time-points when studied as a whole cohort. Longitudinal analysis of the cytokine patterns at the individual patient level with a clustering algorithm showed that, notwithstanding the significant heterogeneity observed, the patients? cytokine responses can be classified into three broad patterns that show increasing, decreasing or no major changes from the baseline. This analytical approach also showed statistically significant associations between cytokines, with those most likely to be associated being interleukin (IL)-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and ferritin, as well as a strong tri-way correlation between GCSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP1?). In conclusion, in this standard human model of soft tissue injury, by applying longitudinal analysis at the individual level, we have been able to identify the cytokine patterns underlying the seemingly random, heterogeneous patient responses. We have also identified consistent cytokine interactions suggesting that IL-6, GCSF, MCP1 and MIP1? are the cytokines most probably driving the immune response to this injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To describe and identify the relationship between ED length of stay (LOS) and mortality after ICU admission. Methods:? We undertook a retrospective cohort study of records from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006). Data from 45 hospitals and 48?803 ED patients directly transferred to ICU were included. Patients were divided into ED LOS < 8?h and ED LOS ≥ 8?h. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results:? Median ED LOS was 3.9?h (interquartile range 2.0?6.8). Patients transferred within 8?h (80.9%) were younger (P < 0.001) and more seriously ill (higher mortality and mechanical ventilation rate) than those transferred ≥8?h. There was no clear relationship between ED LOS and hospital survival for patients admitted directly to ICU (odds ratio = 1.01 per hour, 95% confidence intervals 0.99?1.02). Conclusion:? Although 20% of critically ill patients spend more than 8?h in ED before transfer to ICU, we were unable to demonstrate an adverse relationship between time in ED and hospital mortality.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.
