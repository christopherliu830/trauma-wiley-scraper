AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Most potentially preventable haemorrhagic deaths occur within 6?h of injury. Conventionally, blood component therapy delivery is measured by 24-h cumulative totals and ratios. The study aim was to examine the effect of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) on early (6?h) balanced component therapy. Methods:? An 88-month retrospective clinical study at a level 1 trauma centre was undertaken, examining consecutive trauma patients receiving ≥10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24?h, before (pre-MTP) and after implementation of MTP. Demographic data, injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), shock parameters, coagulation profile, the need for surgical intervention (<24?h), mortality and intensive care unit length of stay were collected. The ratios of blood products given by 6?h, by 24?h and the time between administrations of components was collected and analysed. Results:? Pre-MTP and MTP patients had similar demographics, shock severity and initial laboratory findings. Despite MTP patients having had a higher ISS (42 ± 12 versus 36 ± 12, P < 0.05) and AIS head score (2.6 ± 1.8 versus 1.6 ± 2.0, P < 0.05), there was no difference in mortality. Area under the curve (AUC) of the MTP period showed earlier delivery of higher median ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/PRBC (P= 0.004). Similar findings were found for cryoprecipitate/PRBC and platelet/PRBC ratios. By 24?h, the AUC for FFP/PRBC ratios were no different. Discussion:? Implementation of MTP resulted in earlier balanced transfusion. The difference between the FFP/PRBC ratios of the two types of resuscitations levelled by 24?h. The efficacy of component therapy delivery should be measured earlier than 24?h.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - A timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals? PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants? item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants? education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents? female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals? PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the admission characteristics and hospital outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients admitted to intensive units (ICUs) after major trauma. Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Objective Exposure to sexual assault is a significant risk factor to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in females. The early neurobiological changes leading to the development of PTSD remain understudied and unclear in this population. Methods Participants were 27 adult females recruited within a month following exposure to sexual assault (T1) and 20 age-matched non-exposed controls. Among the victims, 10 participants met (PTSD+) and 15 did not meet (PTSD?) DSM-IV criteria for PTSD 6 months post-trauma (T2). At both visits, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans, and indices of total diurnal cortisol changes were derived from individual areas under the curve relative to the ground (AUCg). Measures at T1 were compared between groups at T1, measures at T2 between groups at T2, and measures at T1 between groups at T2. Results At T1, victims had significantly smaller bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not AUCg, than controls. At T2, neither hippocampal volume nor AUCg significantly differed among the groups. However, the PTSD+ group had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes at T1 than the control group, but not compared to the PTSD? group. Conclusions This study indicates that having smaller hippocampal volumes is a risk factor to develop PTSD in females exposed to sexual assault.

AB  - Summary The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are effective statistical tools for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for binary-class medical data. However, many real-world biomedical problems involve more than two categories. The Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) and Hypervolume Under the ROC Manifold (HUM) measures are extensions for the AUC under three-class and multiple-class models. Inference methods for such measures have been proposed recently. We develop a method of constructing a linear combination of markers for which the VUS or HUM of the combined markers is maximized. Asymptotic validity of the estimator is justified by extending the results for maximum rank correlation estimation that are well known in econometrics. A bootstrap resampling method is then applied to estimate the sampling variability. Simulations and examples are provided to demonstrate our methods.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To determine whether pre- and post-operative administration of intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) can significantly decrease pain and morphine use when compared with placebo in adult orthopedic surgical patients. Design.? This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting.? This study was completed at eight hospitals; six in the United States and two in South Africa. Patients.? A total of 185 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Interventions.? Patients were randomized to receive either 800?mg IV-ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours, with the first dose administered pre-operatively. Additionally, all patients had access to intravenous morphine for rescue. Outcome Measures.? Efficacy of IV-ibuprofen was demonstrated by measuring the patient's self assessment of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; assessed with movement and at rest) and a verbal response scale (VRS). Morphine consumption during the post-operative period was also assessed. Results.? In the immediate post-operative period, there was a 25.8% reduction in mean area under the curve-VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM) in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen (P?<?0.001); a 31.8% reduction in mean AUC-VAS assessed at rest (AUC-VASR; P?<?0.001) and a 20.2% reduction in mean VRS (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Patients receiving IV-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events. Conclusion.? Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - Background: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is suggested to reflect the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and the main objective of the present study was to determine whether ScvO2 is associated with outcome in haemodynamically stabilized trauma patients. Methods: Haemodynamically unstable trauma patients receiving a central venous line within 1?h of admission were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate and ScvO2 were recorded at inclusion and every 6?h for 36?h or until lactate was <2.0?mmol/l and ScvO2 was >75% in two consecutive measurements. Patients with a MAP of ≥70?mmHg were considered to be haemodynamically stabilized. The outcome measure was complications defined as infections, delta sequential organ failure assessment score of >0, and mortality. Results: Fifty patients with a median new injury severity score of 27 (17?34) were analysed. Complications occurred in 33 patients. An association between ScvO2 following resuscitation to MAP ≥70?mmHg and complications was detected with an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% confidence interval; 0.89?0.99). This association was also significant when adjusted for injury severity. The result implies that a low ScvO2 value is associated with more complications. The optimal cut-off for ScvO2 to discriminate between patients who did or did not develop complications was found to be 66.5% (56?86%). Conclusions: These data suggest that low ScvO2 in haemodynamically stabilized patients is associated with a poor outcome and that ScvO2 represents a potential endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The survey was supported by a grant from the Petplan Charitable Trust. Boehringer Ingelheim assisted with survey distribution. Competing interests:?None.
