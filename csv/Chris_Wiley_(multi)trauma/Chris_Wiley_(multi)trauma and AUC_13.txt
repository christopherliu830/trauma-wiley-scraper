AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Some ponies are predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis, but the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically active tissue that secretes mediators which affect vascular function, insulin signalling and inflammation, all of which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of laminitis. Objectives To determine whether the gene expression of adipose tissue from previously laminitic ponies (LP) differs from nonlaminitic ponies (NL). Study design Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected by biopsy from the neck region of healthy LP and NL (n?=?6 each group) in the summer and winter. Methods Gene expression was determined using a 44?K equine expression microarray. Data were analysed using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes with >2-fold difference, P<0.01 were considered significant using a t test to analyse group and/or season. Results The most significant differences in global gene expression in adipose tissue were observed between summer and winter in both groups, with 244 (NL) and 174 (LP) genes differentially expressed. There was a significant difference between LP and NL groups in the summer (141 genes differentially expressed), whereas the 2 groups were more similar in the winter (40 genes differentially expressed). Eight of the top 10 upregulated genes and 3 of the top 5 canonical pathways that differed between LP and NL in the summer were associated with inflammation and/or immunity. Conclusions Laminitic ponies appear to have a different adipose tissue gene expression profile to NL, particularly in the summer. Inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in the LP group suggesting higher levels of inflammation or priming of inflammatory pathways which may contribute to a predisposition to laminitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Since 2010, the OIE expert surveillance panel (ESP) recommends that EI vaccines contain representative equine influenza virus (EIV) strains from the Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages for optimal protection against EIV currently circulating worldwide. To date, no EI vaccine commercially available in the EU meets this recommendation. Objectives This report summarises the development process of a fully updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, including clinical efficacy results against EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. Study design The EI vaccine ProteqFlu containing 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of EIV strains was updated by replacing the A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 strain with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 isolate (Florida clade 2 sub-lineage) and keeping A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 sub-lineage), to meet the last OIE recommendations. The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy in the Welsh mountain pony model. Methods The mode of action, production steps and efficacy of the updated EI vaccine will be presented. Efficacy was tested in a group of 7 ponies vaccinated twice, 5 weeks apart. Protective antibody response were measured and challenged by experimental infection with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 EIV strain. Clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with control unvaccinated ponies (n?=?7). Results Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. Conclusions The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was already the first EI vaccine to meet the 2004 OIE ESP recommendations and was successfully used in Australia during the 2007 EI outbreak. This new version will be the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift. EI vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to prevent or limit the impact of EI, as clearly illustrated by the limited frequency and scale of EI outbreaks.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinicopathological and laboratory investigation of horses showing severe neurological signs during the 2010 WNV-lineage 2 human epidemic in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece). Implementation of preventive measures was also addressed. Objectives To describe the clinical signs, supportive treatment and outcome in WNV cases and report the use of an inactivated WNV vaccine used for the protection of horses during the following epidemic periods. Study design Clinical study. Methods Laboratory testing included serology, real-time RT-PCR and histopathology. All affected animals received supportive treatment (furosemide, dexamethasone, B-complex vitamins and NSAIDs). The Equip WNV vaccine was used for immunisation of horses. Results WNV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 17 horses with neurological signs. The specificity of the detected antibodies was confirmed by seroneutralisation tests. The maximum duration of IgM was determined to be 60 days. Clinical signs included weakness of hindlimbs, ataxia and tremors (17/17), altered mental state (10/17), hypersensitivity (7/17), inability to swallow (3/17), recumbency (3/17) and convulsions (3/17). Supportive treatment was successful in 14/17 horses. The 3 recumbent horses died as a result of the infection, or were subjected to euthanasia. Histopathological findings observed in the CNS were mild perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, axonal swelling, glial nodules, microhaemorrhages and neuronal necrosis. None of the vaccinated horses showed clinical signs. Three unvaccinated horses showed clinical signs and developed WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Conclusions The Nea Santa-Greece-lineage 2 strain responsible for the massive human epidemic of 2010 was also highly pathogenic for horses. Timely administration of supportive treatment is important to the prognosis of the cases. WNV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with encephalitis in Greece. Vaccinations can effectively protect horses, especially in areas of Greece where the virus seems to have become endemic.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early pregnancy loss (EPL) between Days 15 and 65 of pregnancy occurs in 7?10% of Thoroughbred pregnancies causing substantial financial losses. Despite this, very little is known about risk factors associated with the condition. Objectives To determine the current incidence of EPL in Thoroughbred mares and to investigate risk factors associated with the condition. Study design A prospective cohort study was carried out on a population of 927 Thoroughbred mares in the Newmarket area during the 2013 breeding season. Methods Questionnaires were completed by clinicians from 2 veterinary hospitals and stud secretaries from 23 stud farms. Univariable risk factor analyses were conducted using Chi-squared and t tests. Results The incidence of pregnancy loss was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3?8.6%) between Days 15?42 and 2% (95% CI 1.2?3.0%) between Days 43?65. Mares aged 11 years or over were 2.4 times more likely to suffer EPL than younger mares (95% CI 1.5?3.9): the risk of loss increased as mare age increased. Foaling, rested or barren mares had a 4.3 times increased risk of loss compared to maiden mares (95% CI 1.5?12.0). Mares receiving the preovulatory hormones deslorelin or hCG were shown to have a significantly reduced risk of EPL (P?=?0.03) compared with mares who had not received any preovulatory treatments. Pregnancies undergoing loss had a significantly smaller vesicle size (mean 1.7?cm, s.d. 0.51) at the initial (Day 14?17) pregnancy scan compared to pregnancies which were maintained throughout the study period (mean 2.0?cm, s.d. 0.49, P?=?0.01). Conclusions The incidence of EPL in 2013 was similar to that previously reported in the Newmarket area. Further multivariable risk factor analyses and investigations to discover novel causes of EPL are required to reduce the incidence of this condition.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The maxillary first premolar (wolf tooth) is present in a significant proportion (13?40%) of horses and is frequently extracted. The size of these teeth has been reported to vary but the authors are not aware of published descriptions of the dimensions of these teeth. Objectives To measure the dimensions of a sample of equine first premolar teeth and to seek correlations between dimensions of the crown and the root. Study design A retrospective descriptive study. Methods Calipers were used to measure total length, root length, crown height, and crown width of 65 first premolar teeth extracted in their entirety from 2 populations of horses (UK population: n?=?30, USA population: n?=?35). Most of the variables were not normally distributed so nonparametric statistics (Spearman correlation coefficients) were used to describe tooth size and seek correlations between different measurements. Results Dimensions expressed as median (range) were total length: 21 (12?34) mm; root length: 13.2 (0?19.6) mm; crown height 7 (2?20) mm; and crown width 7 (2.6?16) mm. Root length was longer than crown height in 61/65 teeth. Total length was poorly correlated with crown height (r?=?0.443) but had a good correlation with root length (r?=?0.799). Crown height and crown width were poorly correlated with root length (r?=?-0.093 and r?=?0.463), respectively. Conclusions The dimensions of 65 first premolar teeth indicate that the root is usually longer than the crown but that the dimensions of the clinical crown of the tooth do not provide a good estimate of the length of the root.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. It represents a potential source of disease specific proteins that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of joint disease and be used in the early diagnosis of disease. Objectives To comprehensively profile the protein complement of SF in health and osteoarthritis (OA) using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and identify potential OA biomarkers. Study design SF was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. Methods Samples were analysed with LC-MS/MS using a NanoAcquity LC coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos. ProgenesisTM LC-MS software was used for label-free quantification with data searched using Mascot in the Ensembl database for horse. Adjusted ANOVA values of P<0.05 and regulation of >2-fold were regarded as significant. Results 754 proteins were identified in SF. Thus ProteominerTM beads concentrated the lower abundance proteins enabling the most comprehensive SF proteome to date. Proteins identified included those relating to matrix proteins, inflammatory factors, complement activation proteins and proteases. A subset of 10 proteins was identified which were differentially expressed in OA SF. Conclusions A number of proteins were identified for the first time in SF which may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA. We identified a distinct set of proteins that may act as potential biomarkers to distinguish between normal and OA joints. S100-A10, a calcium binding protein has upregulated in OA. This may have a role in the synthesis and activation of matrix degrading proteases. CD109 is a TGF-? co-receptor, released from the chondrocyte cell surface that inhibits TGF-? signalling. Its contribution to the disregulation of TGF-? is unknown.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of colic can be expensive and may exceed the owners? financial limitations. This may result in premature euthanasia prior to treatment on rectifiable financial grounds rather than for welfare reasons. It is therefore important to ensure appropriate business model auditing to identify where costs may limit expected treatment options. Objectives This study investigated how the costs of treatment for equine colic at a single university referral hospital have changed over a 10-year period between 2003 and 2013. The aim was to analyse which costs have changed excessively or disproportionately between different treating services, consumables and professional fees, which may render treatment of colic financially prohibitive. Study design Retrospective study. Methods All charges billed against cases undergoing treatment for colic between 2003 and 2013 were accessed from hospital records. Horses were identified as having surgery or purely medical management. Charges were categorised by service (medicine, surgery, anaesthesia), type (consumable, livery, professional fee), and consumable type (e.g. NSAID, opiate, antibiotic, fluid therapy, lab fee, surgery consumables). Results There was a significant association between year and the frequency of medically and surgically treated colic (Chi-square test, P<0.001). Between 2003 and 2012, median total treatment costs increased in both medically (42%) and surgically treated (46%) cases. Costs attributable to consumables increased (surgical cases 28%, medical cases 14%), while those attributable to livery (surgical -19%, medical -21%) and professional fees decreased (surgical -22%, medical -8%). The greatest increase in consumable cost was attributable to fluids (surgical 94%, medical 182%). Conclusions This study demonstrates areas where the cost of colic treatment are disproportionately changing and thus highlights potential targets where business models may be optimised in the interest of patient survival. The substantial increase in costs attributable to fluids correlates with increasing emphasis on fluid therapy in the management of colic.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Osteoarthritis (OA) of the articular processes (APs) is recognised as a clinical condition in the equine cervical spine, but there is little information on the prevalence and distribution of OA in the APs of the cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae. Objectives To determine the prevalence and distribution of OA in the APs of the equine cervical and cranial thoracic vertebrae in relation to vertebral level, age and size of the horse and side of the neck. Study design A post mortem longitudinal randomised study of 53 horses. Hypotheses OA is more prevalent and more severe in the APs of the cervicothoracic junction, the prevalence and severity of OA increases with horse age and size, and OA is equally distributed on left and right sides. Methods The cervical (C1?C7) and cranial thoracic (T1?T7) vertebrae of 53 horses were removed at necropsy and boiled out. Based on the size (percentage) of the joint margin that was affected, OA of the 4 APs of each vertebra was graded on a scale of 0 (no osseous lesions) to 3 (severe osseous lesions). Based on these grades, a 3-factor ANOVA was used to test the random effects of horse, age (young, old) and size (small, large), and the fixed factors of side (left, right) and vertebral level (C1 to T7). Results OA lesions were most severe in the mid-cervical vertebrae (C3?C4) followed by the cervicothoracic curvature (C5?T1). Severity of OA increased with age and size of the horse but there was no difference between left and right sides. Conclusions OA is symmetrically present with higher severity in the mid-cervical and cervicothoracic regions and with higher prevalence in older and larger horses. These factors support bilateral injections in specific APs for clinical treatment of OA in the equine cervical spine.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypotension is the most common cardiovascular complication encountered during equine inhalational anaesthesia, for which a dobutamine intravenous constant rate infusion (DCRI) is often the sole treatment. There is limited literature available on the combined use of crystalloid boluses and inotropic agents during equine hypotensive episodes. Objectives To determine the cardiovascular effects of DCRI, alone and in combination with a crystalloid bolus (CB) during controlled ventilation in hypotensive, isoflurane anaesthetised horses. Study design Prospective, randomised, cross-over experimental design of 6 healthy Standardbred horses aged 5?13 years weighing 464?578?kg. Methods Horses were premedicated with intravenous acepromazine and xylazine. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous ketamine and diazepam. Isofluorane was used to maintain anaesthesia and achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60?mmHg?±?5%. Sixty minutes post induction (T0) when a stable end tidal isoflurane percentage and target MAP had been achieved for ≥15?min one of 2 treatments was given. Treatment A (TA) was a DCRI, commencing at 0.5??g/kg bwt/min and increasing in increments of 0.5?ug/kg bwt every 10?min as required to achieve a MAP of 80?mmHg?±?5% by 30?min following initiation of the DCRI. Treatment B (TB) was as for TA plus a 20?ml/kg bwt CB. Cardiac output, haemoglobin concentration, PaO2 and SaO2 were obtained at baseline (T0) and 30?min following initiation of the DCRI (T1). Data were analysed with a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (P<0.05 considered significant), with data presented as median?±?interquartile ranges. Results Treatment A was associated with a significant (P?=?0.03) increase in oxygen delivery index (DO2I) from baseline (T0 707.78?±?159.73?ml/ min/m2; T1 1260.26?±?184.56?ml/min/m2), while TB was not (P?=?0.09). Conclusions In an experimental model of isoflurane induced hypotension, DCRI results in increased DO2I, while the use of DCRI in combination with CB does not.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is a common equine distal axonopathy associated with neurogenic atrophy of intrinsic laryngeal muscles (particularly the left) causing laryngeal paresis and poor performance. An objective, reliable method of assessing changes in structure that correlates with laryngeal muscle function in vivo is necessary to determine response to novel treatments, including functional electrical stimulation. This study aimed to determine whether laryngeal muscle and nerve morphology (determined by CT and histopathology) correlated with laryngeal function. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Resting (grades 1?4) and exercising (grades A?C) laryngeal function was graded in adult Thoroughbred horses. Standing CT of the larynx was performed to compare volume, cross-sectional area (XSA) and tissue density between left and right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis (CAD) muscles in 22 horses. CAD muscles and recurrent laryngeal nerves were collected in a subgroup of 10 horses and analysed for fibrosis, fat infiltration and nerve fibre density (axons/?m2). Results Horses with grade C?RLN on exercising endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles and reduced nerve fibre density than horses with grades A or B. Horses with grade 4?RLN on resting endoscopy had significantly (P<0.005) smaller left CAD muscles than horses with grades 1 or 2. Left CAD muscles had significantly more collagen than the right in horses with grade C?RLN. CT measurements of the CAD muscles were significantly associated with % collagen/fat and nerve fibre density (P<0.05). Conclusions Laryngeal CT results correlate with laryngeal function at rest and exercise in the horse and provide a noninvasive method of monitoring changes in CAD morphology in response to novel treatments. CAD CT appearance is dependent on % collagen and fat in the muscle and is associated with nerve fibre density.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little exists in the literature regarding the outcome of endoscopically-guided desmotomy of the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) where injury to the PAL was the only diagnosis. Objectives To report the return to previous level of exercise in horses treated with endoscopically guided PAL resection in which PAL injury was considered to be the primary condition. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Medical records of surgical cases at Donnington Grove Veterinary Surgery between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were cases that had undergone surgical transection of the palmar/plantar annular ligament under general anaesthesia and endoscopic guidance using a No. 12 scalpel blade where annular ligament injury was the only notable finding at surgery. Follow-up was obtained by a telephone questionnaire. Results Twenty-three horses were included in the study. Twenty horses were noted to have restriction to passage of the arthroscope within the digital flexor tendon sheath at the time of surgery. Following the initial 3-month post operative rest period 21 horses were sound. Three horses did not return to their previous level of activity due to unrelated lameness issues and 2 returned to a lower level of competition due to owner preference. Of the remaining 18 horses, 16 returned to their previous level of athletic performance. Two horses had recurrent or persistent lameness associated with the residual PAL desmopathy. Conclusions In this case series surgical treatment of primary PAL injury carries a good prognosis (89% return to previous level of exercise) in contrast to a previously reported study (<50% of horses were able to return to athletic function) [1].

AB  - Reasons for performing study Tumours of the thyroid gland are rare in the equine species. In literature varying clinical signs and diagnostic findings are described in single reports and case series. Reported clinical signs are related to upper airway compression or thyroidal metabolic activity. A considerable risk of laryngeal hemiplegia is described when horses were treated with hemithyroidectomy [1]. Objectives To review 11 horses referred with a unilateral thyroid neoplasia in order to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment and outcome. Histopathology was performed on all resected thyroid lobes. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Records from horses with histologically confirmed thyroid tumours treated with unilateral thyroid lobe resection were reviewed (2003?2013). Short-term outcome was defined for 2 weeks after surgery. Owners? questionnaire was performed for evaluation of long-term outcome defined as a minimum of 6 months. Results Affected horses were aged between 6 and 21 years. In contrast to literature the majority of tumours were adenocarcinomas (9/11), mainly found in mares (8/9). Histology revealed follicular and parafollicular (C-cell) mixed growth pattern of the carcinomas. Tumour size, growth rate and sonographic appearance did not correlate to histological characteristics. Ventral displacement of the thyroid lobe and close preparation along the thyroid capsule during surgical resection are inevitable to avoid damage to laryngeal nerves. Seroma formation was the only observed short-term complication. No long-term complications occurred. Conclusions Hemithyroidectomy is regarded the treatment of choice in horses with a unilateral thyroid lobe neoplasia with excellent long-term prognosis. High incidence of malignant tumours particularly in mares has to be considered. Tumour characteristics can only be derived from histopathology and immunhistochemistry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lack of ?gold standard? for pain assessment in horses. Objectives To assess different approaches of quantifying pain in horses. Castration was chosen as a pain model because of its wide clinical relevance. Study design Exploratory study. Methods 51 equine stallions undergoing castration under general anaesthesia were divided in 3 pain-relieving treatment groups: A) single perioperative administration of flunixin (n?=?19), B) additional subsequent flunixin administrations (n?=?21), D) like A but with intra-operative mepivacaine injections into the spermatic cord (n?=?11). All horses were assessed before and 5 times after surgery (up to 44?h) by means of a modified composite pain scale (CPS), a newly developed facial expression pain scale (FEPS), faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) and plasma cytokine profiles. The same parameters were measured in a control group C, undergoing general anaesthesia for different nonpainful procedures (n?=?6). Data were analysed with nonparametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Mann Whitney U). Results Time had an influence on CPS and FEPS scores in treatment groups A, B and D but not in C. Scores of groups A and B were higher compared to groups D and C at 4 (CPS, FEPS) and 8?h (CPS), whereas there was no difference between groups A and B nor between groups D and C. Only in group AB was there an increase of faecal GCMs 20?h after surgery. GCMs in group AB were higher compared with groups C and D at 32?h. No effects by time or treatment could be identified for the different plasma cytokines. Conclusions CPS and FEPS seem to be able to detect different levels of post castration pain differentiating from possible anaesthesia effect. Additional local anaesthesia of the spermatic cord was associated with lower post surgical pain scores when compared to perioperative flunixin application alone, whereas subsequent applications of flunixin had no obvious effect.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Equine sarcoids are locally aggressive fibroblastic cutaneous tumours, representing the third most common health problem in working horses. In developed countries they also have welfare and economic impact (e.g. prepurchase examination). No current treatment offers 100% success rate. It is now well established that Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoid tumours. In a number of human cancers, aberrant expression of microRNAs has been linked to the cancerous phenotype. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate essential biological and cellular processes. Currently there is much interest in their role as biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents for many diseases. Objectives In an attempt to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of sarcoids, we aim to identify specific microRNAs associated with equine sarcoids. Study design Differential expression of microRNAs was assessed in control equine fibroblasts (EqPalfs) and EqPalfs transformed with the BPV-1 genome (S6-2s). Methods Using a commercially available human microarray, 453 microRNAs were interrogated in RNA samples from both cell lines. Each cell line was analysed in triplicate. Results 219 individual microRNAs were differentially expressed in control (EqPalFs) versus BPV-transformed cells (S6-2s) (P<0.05). of these, 148 microRNAs (68%) were underexpressed in S6-2 cells relative to EqPalfs. Conclusions We have shown that BPV-1 transformed equine cell lines exhibit a different microRNA profile to control equine fibroblasts and the aberrant expression of microRNAs in S6-2 cells can be attributed to the presence of BPV-1 genomes. Our future work will focus on studying the expression profiles of a subset of microRNAs in a larger panel of cell lines and sarcoid tumours to help elucidate the significance of the deregulated expression.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationship between pelvic hindlimb lameness pointers remains unclear. Objectives To examine sacrum and tubera coxae (TC) based movement asymmetry across different lameness degrees, patterns and changes in pelvic rotation. Study design Parameter regression and rigid body model. Methods Vertical displacement of left and right tubera coxae (LTC, RTC) and sacrum was quantified experimentally in 107 horses with varying lameness degrees using inertial sensors. To investigate the theoretical relationship between pointers, a geometrical model of pelvis movement was created in Matlab. The model predicts TC movement based on experimentally derived pelvic rotation and computer-generated asymmetrical sacrum movement. Further, the effect of changes in pelvic rotation on TC-based lameness pointers was quantified. For both, experimental and model data, asymmetry measures corresponding to visual assessment strategies of veterinarians were calculated and contrasted. Results Experimental data showed that upward movement amplitudes for sacrum and TC were strongly correlated (r?≥?0.96). Regression showed that differences were greater between amplitudes of LTC/RTC than sacrum (slope 1.18; r2?=?0.94; P<0.001); however, for ratios the reverse held true (slope 0.86; r2?=?0.92; P<0.001). The model predicted experimentally determined tubera coxae asymmetry well. While the model data matched the experimental scaling relationship between amplitude ratios, it predicted a slightly shallower slope for amplitude differences. Perturbing the model with a different rotational range of movement, an offset in pelvic rotation and asymmetrical pelvic rotation affected observable TC-based asymmetry depending on the chosen assessment strategy. Conclusions Detecting lameness based on sacrum or comparative TC movement can give similar results. Using comparative TC movement for lameness detection would be susceptible to changes in pelvic rotation which a lame horse may adopt. Hence, assessment of multiple pelvis-based lameness pointers can help establishing nonobvious hindlimb lameness. Ethical animal research:?The experimental component of this study was approved by the RVC Ethics Committee. Some horses were included with owner informed consent and data from clinical cases were recorded as part of lameness investigations. Sources of funding:?S.D.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Epidemiological investigations suggest that soil macro- and micro-nutrients may be a trigger for the occurrence of equine grass sickness (EGS). However, there is limited information regarding relationships between exposure to geochemical elements and the occurrence of EGS. Objectives To determine whether the geographical distribution of EGS cases referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies was associated with the presence or absence of particular geochemical elements in the environment. Study design A retrospective time-matched case?control study. Methods 455 EGS geo-referenced cases were identified between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2006. Each case had 2 time-matched geo-referenced controls (n?=?910). For study purposes, cases or controls originating outwith Scotland were excluded. Environmental concentrations of a range of elements, most with known biological function, were collated from 2 geochemical point datasets and spatially extrapolated giving continuous cover across Scotland: the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) stream sediment dataset and the James Hutton Institute (JHI), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS). Data were analysed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Results Statistically significant associations were obtained between the distribution of EGS cases and (i) higher environmental levels of Ca, K, Mo, Na, Se and Ti, and (ii) lower environmental levels of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. This study identified no association between EGS cases and the environmental concentrations of Ba, Ga, Fe, Mg, Mn, P or Sr. Conclusions A number of statistically significant associations were identified between EGS cases and element concentrations in the spatially extrapolated stream sediment and soil data. This information will assist future studies on the aetiology of EGS, with further research suggested to focus on those identified significant associations with greatest biological plausibility such as reduced levels of Cu and Zn, and higher levels of K and Se.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colostrum acts as a source of immunomodulatory molecules for the neonate. Little information is available about the transfer of cytokines via colostrum in the foal. Objectives To investigate the transfer via colostrum of IL-4, IL-13, IL-8 and IFN-?. Study design Prospective observational study. Methods Jugular venous blood pre- (T0) and post suckling (T24) and colostrum were collected from 14 healthy foals and their dams. The cytokines? concentration was measured with an ELISA test. Serum IgG concentration was measured in foals at T24 with an immunoturbidimetric assay. Since data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests for statistical analysis were used. The Wilcoxon t test evaluated the difference in each cytokine concentration between T0 and T24. Spearman rank correlation tested the association between cytokines? concentration in T24 serum and in colostrum, between T24?T0 (?T) serum concentration and colostrum concentration, and between cytokines serum concentration at T24 and IgG concentration. Results All the foals had a complete transfer of passive immunity. A statistically significant difference was found between serum IL-4 concentration at T0 and at T24. The significant correlations found were: serum IL-4 concentration at T24 with IL-4 concentration in colostrum, serum IL-13 concentration at T24 with IgG serum concentration, and IL-4 concentration in colostrum with ?T serum IL-4 concentration. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that IL-4 is transferred via colostrum to the foal, as reported for TNF-α [1]. The presence of IL-8 in the foal's serum at T0 suggests an endogenous production. The IL-13 concentration is close to zero for the major part of serum and colostrum samples suggesting a subject-dependent immunologic response. The IFN-? is present both in colostrum and in T0 serum suggesting that foals are not deficient at birth.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing.
