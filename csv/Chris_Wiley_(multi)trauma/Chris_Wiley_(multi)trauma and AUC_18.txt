AB  - Reasons for performing study There are currently no studies detailing cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release and clearance in normal horses post exercise using an analytically validated assay. These data are essential for selecting appropriate sampling times in equine athletes with suspected myocardial damage. Objective To plot the magnitude and time course of cTnI release and clearance, using a validated cTnI assay, after maximal effort. Study design Descriptive longitudinal study. Methods Five clinically normal Standardbred racehorses in full race training were included in the study. Physical examinations were performed on subjects and blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture pre-exercise. Horses were exercised in harness at race intensity in groups on a training track. A second blood sample was taken immediately post exercise and an intravenous catheter was then placed in a jugular vein. Hourly blood samples were taken for 24?h. All samples were collected in red top serum Vacutainer? tubes and allowed to clot for 30?min before being centrifuged and serum harvested. Serum samples were stored at ?80°C until analysis. All samples were analysed using the Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity cTnI? assay. Results Mean resting cTnI level was 1.33?±?0.6?ng/l (range, 0.82?2.33?ng/l). All horses exhibited an increase in cTnI level after exercise with peak elevation occurring 2?6?h post exercise (mean, 4.6?±?1.7?h). Mean peak increase in cTnI level was 11.96?±?9.41?ng/l (range, 1.72?23.76?ng/l). All horses returned to baseline levels within 24?h. Conclusions All horses experienced an increase in cTnI post exercise, with the peak occurring 2?6?h post exercise. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of these increases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic remains a life-threatening condition in the horse. Ischaemia and reperfusion following correction of small intestinal strangulation may produce oxidative stress. The ability to withstand oxidative stress depends on antioxidant levels and may be linked to horse survival. Objectives To measure peripheral antioxidant levels in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy with small intestinal strangulation. Study design Case?control study. Methods Blood and plasma were collected from horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for small intestinal strangulation and stored at ?80°C. Controls involved non-colic horses. Total plasma glutathione was measured spectrophotometrically at 412?nm using the 5,5?-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) reaction. Samples containing scavenger (to remove reduced glutathione, GSH) were used to measure oxidised glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity (u/l) was measured as the rate of GSH production at 412?nm. Glutathione peroxidise (GPx) activity (u/l) was measured as the change in optical density (340?nm) following the consumption of NADPH after GSSG production. All assays were purchased from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, California). Clinical data including arterial blood gas analysis were collected on admission. Results Glutathione reductase activity in horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions was significantly reduced compared to control horses (12.2?±?1.1?u/l vs. 15.9?±?0.8?u/l, P?=?0.03, n?=?6) whereas GPx activity did not significantly differ between colic and control horses (155.7?±?48.7?u/l vs. 167.3?±?30.1?u/l, P?=?0.84, n?=?6). Total glutathione, reduced or oxidised glutathione did not differ significantly between control and colic horses. A positive correlation existed between GR activity and Ca2+ (r?=?0.93) and K+ (r?=?0.75) whereas a strong negative correlation was present between GR activity and HCO3? (r?=??0.92) and PaCO2 (r?=??0.96). Conclusions Reduced plasma glutathione reductase activity with small intestinal strangulation indicates oxidative stress and may be related to systemic electrolyte/bicarbonate abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists such as prucalopride are used as human prokinetics, since activation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal cholinergic neurons facilitates acetylcholine release. 5-HT4 receptors, linked to adenylyl cyclase, act via generation of cAMP. None of the 4 in vitro studies on 5-HT in horses provided evidence for neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, but none used the protocol as described in human studies [1?4]. Objectives To investigate whether functional 5-HT4 receptors are present in the equine small intestine. Study design and methods In vitro organ bath set up, applying electrical field stimulation (EFS) in longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips. Results Results were similar in both muscle layers. In the presence of 0.3?mmol/l NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 0.3??mol/l apamine, excluding effects of the inhibitory transmitters NO and ATP, EFS induced voltage-dependent on-contractions; these were neurogenic as they were abolished by 3??mol/l tetrodotoxin. At a voltage inducing 50% of the maximal amplitude, the submaximal EFS-induced contractions were cholinergic as atropine (1??mol/l) abolished them. Prucalopride (0.3??mol/l) did not increase the amplitude of these submaximal EFS-induced contractions. Even in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, previously shown to enhance the effect of neuronal 5-HT4 receptors by inhibiting breakdown of their 2nd messenger cAMP [5], prucalopride (3??mol/l) had no influence. Also 5-HT (10??mol/l), a full agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, tested in the presence of methysergide and granisetron to exclude interaction with other 5-HT receptor subtypes, did not enhance EFS-induced submaximal contractions. Conclusions There is no evidence for presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the cholinergic neurons of the equine small intestine. These results question the application of 5-HT4 prokinetic drugs in horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using ≤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study While open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice for most ulnar fractures conservative treatment is sometimes chosen due to financial constraints. Additional motives for the choice of treatment may be present, and the clients perception is therefore of interest. Objectives To compare survival and outcome between horses treated for an ulnar fracture, either surgically or conservatively and to assess clients perception of treatment. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Medical records and radiographs of horses treated between January 2002 and December 2012, with a diagnosis of ulnar fracture were reviewed. Information regarding short- (within 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) outcome and owner satisfaction with treatment was obtained via telephone questionnaires. Differences between groups were investigated using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results Fracture types included 11 type 4, 7 type 5, one type 2, and one type 1b fracture. Eleven horses were treated surgically (Group 1). Nine horses were managed conservatively (Group 2). Group 1: 7/11 (64%) survived >1 year, 5/11 (45%) returned to previous athletic level. In Group 2: 6/9 (67%) survived >1 year, 4/9 (43%) returned to previous athletic level. No significant difference in outcome could be detected. There was no difference in the total treatment cost for horses that stayed at the hospital (P?=?0.22). Owners in Group 1 expressed more satisfaction with the treatment than owners in Group 2. Several of the latter expressed welfare concerns regarding the prolonged stall confinement in harness involved with this treatment. Conclusions Veterinarians recommending therapy for cases of ulnar fractures should be aware that many can be treated surgically with a good outcome. Prolonged hospitalisation and stall confinement of horses treated conservatively was a major welfare concern of the owners interviewed and had the same total cost as surgical treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF), causing epizootic lymphangitis (EZL), is endemic in parts of Africa including, Ethiopia, Senegal and Gambia. Despite its high prevalence, impact on animal welfare and socio-economic importance, there is little evidence upon which to build practical disease control strategies. The performance and availability of diagnostic tests currently used by clinicians is problematic. Methods such as pattern recognition of clinical signs and microscopy lack specificity and other reported methods are either not commercially available or not readily feasible in these settings (e.g. culture). This is a significant barrier to further understanding this disease within endemic countries. Objectives To validate a nested PCR method to confirm the presence of HCF in equine clinical samples. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Twenty-nine horses with suspected EZL were included from topographically varied regions of Ethiopia. Clinical data, lesion location drawn onto equine silhouettes, blood samples and aspirates of pus from cutaneous nodules were obtained before treatment provided by SPANA clinic. Blood and clinical data were collected from a further 20 horses with no cutaneous EZL lesions. Giemsa stained impression smears of pus were examined microscopically. Aliquots of heat-inactivated pus and blood were inoculated onto Whatman FTA cards and imported to the UK with Defra approved licensing. A nested PCR targeting the ITS region, was used to identify samples containing HCF and PCR products were sequenced. Results HCF was confirmed in heat-inactivated FTA card pus samples from 24 horses, additionally, 23 blood samples were positive from EZL suspected cases. Bioinfomatic analyses suggested that there was diversity within the ITS region among these HCF products. Conclusions These PCR techniques allow the rapid diagnosis of HCF directly from equine clinical samples. The identification of HCF in blood raises questions about the pathogenesis of HCF in horses and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Every year, several equine influenza (EI) epidemics are reported worldwide. Equine influenza vaccination is the most efficient method of prevention; however, not all horses develop sufficient immunity after EI immunisation, increasing the risk of infection, infectious virus excretion and the spread of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to better understand poor vaccine response mechanisms during the primary EI vaccination. Study design Cohort study. Methods The EI humoral immune response was measured in 118 Thoroughbred foals set in 3 different stud farms (SF#1 to SF#3) after the primary course of EI vaccination. All foals were immunised with a recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, following the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. The age at first vaccination was 4 to 8 months. Sera were tested by single radial haemolysis (SRH) against the A/equine/Jouars/4/2006 EIV strain (Florida clade 2) at the time of the first vaccination (V1), 2 weeks and 3 months after the second immunisation (V2), 2 days and 3 months after the third immunisation (V3). Results Short (V2?+?2 weeks) and mid-term (V3?+?3 months) SRH antibody levels were statistically different between the stud farms (P-value?=?0.0011 and 0.003, respectively), with SF#1<SF#3<SF#2 and SF#1 SRH antibody titres below the protection threshold (i.e. 85?mm2) at all time points studied. SRH antibody levels induced by EI vaccination were related to the age of foals at the first immunisation (SF#1 median age 143 days, SF#2 median age 181 days and SF#3 median age 156 days), but were independent of the presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA; P-value 0.41). Given the results in SF#1, a booster immunisation (V4) was brought forward to restore protective levels of antibody. Conclusion Independently of the presence of MDA, the age of foals at first immunisation plays an important role in the establishment of adequate antibody levels.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in unselected critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Methods: Prospective, observational cohort study in 25 intensive care units in Finland. This study included a total of 602 patients with laboratory samples from 958 consecutive patients with ARF treated either with invasive or with non-invasive ventilatory support (the FINNALI study). Plasma NT-pro-BNP samples were drawn after the onset of ventilatory support (day 0) and on the morning of the second day. Results: The median [interquartile ranges (IQR)] NT-pro-BNP-values were significantly higher at baseline in 90-day non-survivors than the survivors, 4378?pg/ml (1400?13,943?pg/ml) vs. 1052?pg/ml (232?4076?pg/ml), respectively. The median (IQR) NT-pro-BNP values were significantly higher in patients with chronic cardiac disease or cardiac surgery than in non-cardiac patients, 1947?pg/ml (801?4687?pg/ml) vs. 417?pg/ml (153?1735?pg/ml), respectively, if renal function was normal. With deteriorating renal function, the NT-pro-BNP values showed a significant increase. The area under curve for baseline NT-pro-BNP predicting 90-day mortality was moderate: 0.718 (95% confidence interval 0.674?0.761). Baseline NT-pro-BNP over 1765?pg/ml was independently associated with 90-day mortality by logistic regression analysis (P<0.001). Conclusions: NT-pro-BNP on admission is commonly elevated and independently associated with 90-day mortality in critically ill ARF patients. However, the routine use of NT-pro-BNP for prognostic purpose does not seem to add value to clinical data in ARF patients.

AB  - Reason for performing study Measurement of lactate in horses with colic has been described for over 20 years. Objectives To systematically review the evidence on the use of plasma and/or peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS scoring system. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to colic; 32 studies related to the use of lactate in the diagnosis of colic, 2 papers met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using QUADAS. Both papers investigated the use of plasma and peritoneal lactate to identify strangulating intestinal lesions. Both were cross-sectional studies, and together they evaluated a total of 71 horses with confirmed strangulating lesions. Appraisal of the studies using the QUADAS tool was performed. Both papers met QUADAS criteria relating to study design and data analysis, but the QUADAS tool did highlight some limitations in terms of sample and control groups in both papers. Data analysis varied, with one study developing a model to predict the presence of a strangulating lesion, which included peritoneal lactate and other measurements, and the other study assessing optimal predictive values associated with concentrations of peritoneal lactate. Both studies concluded that peritoneal lactate was a more useful diagnostic test than blood lactate. Conclusions Despite the large numbers of publications reporting use of lactate, only a small number used study designs considered suitable for evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy as proposed by the Cochrane Library. Although the current evidence is limited, there is agreement on the value of peritoneal lactate as a diagnostic test for strangulating intestinal lesions. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ethmoidal infection with Aspergillus spp. is rarely reported in horses. Three horses suffering from unilateral infection with Aspergillus spp. of the ethmoid with varying underlying conditions are described. Study design Case series. Methods Diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the ethmoid (presence of white mycotic plaques on a layer of thick yellow mucus) and confirmed by fungal culture (A. fumigatus) and/or cytology. Clinical details and outcome were obtained from the medical records and by contacting owners. Results Horse 1 and 2 had a progressive ethmoid haematoma (PEH) and had been treated for over 5 months with repeated formalin injections (one horse after initial surgical debulking of the PEH that also invaded the maxillary and sphenopalatine sinuses) before the infection with Aspergillus was diagnosed. The third horse, presented with poor performance and nasal discharge, had congenitally abnormal anatomy of the right dorsal nasal passage and right ethmoids. In the 2 horses with PEH the mycotic plaques were removed transendoscopically successfully. After 6 weeks the infection was no longer present at endoscopy in both horses (follow-up endoscopy: Horse 1 no relapse >16 months and Horse 2 no relapse >7 months). In the third horse, it was not possible to remove all mycotic plaques, therefore systemic treatment with itraconazole (3?mg/kg bwt q. 12?h for 8 weeks orally) was started. After 8 weeks, the clinical signs had resolved and endoscopy showed that the Aspergillus infection had cleared (follow-up: no relapse >14 months). No side effects were seen with systemic itraconazole treatment. Conclusions In horses with underlying ethmoidal conditions, secondary infection with Aspergillus spp. may occur. Transendoscopic removal of the mycotic plaques alone may be successful and if this approach is not feasible or unsuccessful, systemic treatment with itraconazole can be considered.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recent studies evaluating owner sound horses have identified a large proportion of horses with motion asymmetries but the prevalence, type and magnitude of asymmetries have not been investigated. The increasing use of objective lameness evaluation necessitates a further characterisation of the differences between lameness and motion asymmetries. Objectives To investigate prevalence, and quantify type and magnitude of motion asymmetries during straight-line trot in riding horses, perceived sound by their owners. Study design Cross-sectional prospective study. Methods Vertical head and pelvic movement symmetry was measured in 220 Warmblood riding horses, all functioning in daily work and considered sound by their owners; 100 of these individuals had been included in a previous report [1]. Body-mounted uni-axial accelerometers were used and differences between maximum and minimum head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvic (PDmax, PDmin) vertical displacement between left and right forelimb and hindlimb stances were calculated during straight-line trot. Previously used symmetry thresholds (absolute differences >6?mm for the head and >3?mm for the pelvic variables) were used. Results The thresholds for symmetry were exceeded for 159 horses (72%) for at least one variable, HDmax (n?=?41, mean 12.7?mm, s.d. 5.5), HDmin (n?=?58, mean 14.3?mm, s.d. 7.1), PDmax (n?=?87, mean 6.5?mm, s.d. 3.10), PDmin (n?=?77, mean 5.7?mm, s.d. 2.1). Contralateral and ipsilateral concurrent fore- and hindlimb asymmetries were detected in 41 and 49 horses, respectively. Conclusions A surprisingly large proportion (72%) of horses perceived as sound by their owner showed movement asymmetries during straight-line trot. It is not known to what extent these asymmetries are related to pain or mechanical abnormalities as opposed to ?normal variation? and this leads to 2 potential welfare problems ? either too many horses in training are actually ?lame? or many horses categorised as ?lame? have no locomotor system disease. Ethical animal research:?This study was conducted within guidelines of the participating sites institutional animal care and use procedures (C 206/10, C48/13) and informed consent for data collection was obtained from the horse owners prior to the study.
