AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients are at risk for developing pressure injuries during operative and other invasive procedures. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to explore the relationship of OR time to sacral pressure injuries in critically ill patients using high frequency ultrasound as a method of assessment. The 41 participants examined in this study had both time in the OR and up to eight days of pressure injury data. The multivariable model containing OR bed time, body mass index, and Braden Scale score produced the best prediction of pressure injury (area under the curve = 0.859). A higher body mass index (P = .09), shorter OR bed time (P = .01), and lower Braden Scale score (P = .05) were associated with a greater chance of pressure injury. These results suggest that use of high frequency ultrasound may identify tissue changes before observable skin changes, leading to earlier pressure injury prevention strategies.

AB  - Summary Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) comprise 3?5% of all congenital bleeding disorders. They can evade typical coagulation screening tests and there is a poor correlation between laboratory results and bleeding phenotype. Thromboelastography (TEG) measures coagulation globally in whole blood samples. The aims of this study were to evaluate the utility of TEG as an adjunct to the routine screening tests employed for the diagnosis of RBDs and to correlate TEG results with the bleeding phenotype in RBDs. TEG parameters and clot kinetics were compared to bleeding phenotypes (asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe) in 26 RBD patients and 30 normal controls. Clot kinetics correlated strongly with RBDs and with the severity of bleeding phenotype with mean maximum rate of thrombus generation (MRTG) 15.4 mm min?1 in controls vs. 6.0 in RBDs (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxin). The mean MRTG was 7.7 in mildly symptomatic, 5.5 in moderately symptomatic and 4.1 in severely symptomatic patients (P < 0.0001, Kruskal?Wallis). Disorders that are often missed by conventional screening tests, dysfibrinogenaemia and platelet disorders displayed a distinctive TEG curve with markedly decreased maximum amplitude (MA) and low MRTG values. Factor XIII and PAI deficient patients displayed increased fibrinolysis in addition to low MRTGs. All patients with RBDs, but none of the normal controls, had abnormal clot kinetics suggesting that TEG may be an effective screening test for RBDs.

AB  - Knowledge on interplay between the cardiac molecular response to transplantation-induced stress and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is limited. A cDNA array identified HIF-1, EGR-1, NAB-2, VEGF-A and uPA as mediators of cardiac tissue response to transplantation-induced stress. mRNA expression of these molecules was measured in left ventricular biopsies from 200 donors before and after aortic cross-clamping and at 10-, 30- and 60-min reperfusion by real-time RT-PCR. HIF-1α expression at two time points was significantly associated with PGD, as shown by univariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariate logistic regression. At a cut-off level of 200 arbitrary units, HIF-1α after aortic cross-clamping in donors (78% sensitivity, 83% specificity) and at 10-min reperfusion (85% sensitivity, 83% specificity) identified PGD. HIF-1α demonstrates the potential to be a predictive marker for PGD; however, as multiple factors were tested at different time points, prospective evaluation is clearly necessary to confirm this observation.

AB  - Abstract For patients with ischaemic heart disease, remote ischaemic conditioning may offer an innovative, non-invasive and virtually cost-free therapy for protecting the myocardium against the detrimental effects of acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury, preserving cardiac function and improving clinical outcomes. The intriguing phenomenon of remote ischaemic conditioning was first discovered over 20 years ago, when it was shown that the heart could be rendered resistant to acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury by applying one or more cycles of brief ischaemia and reperfusion to an organ or tissue away from the heart ? initially termed ?cardioprotection at a distance?. Subsequent pre-clinical and then clinical studies made the important discovery that remote ischaemic conditioning could be elicited non-invasively, by inducing brief ischaemia and reperfusion to the upper or lower limb using a cuff. The actual mechanism underlying remote ischaemic conditioning cardioprotection remains unclear, although a neuro-hormonal pathway has been implicated. Since its initial discovery in 1993, the first proof-of-concept clinical studies of remote ischaemic conditioning followed in 2006, and now multicentre clinical outcome studies are underway. In this review article, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying this academic curiosity, and assess the success of its application in the clinical setting.

AB  - Key points Inadequate sleep and irregular work schedules have not only adverse consequences for individual health and well-being, but also enormous economic and safety implications for society as a whole. This study demonstrates that visual motion processing and coordinated eye movements are significantly impaired when performed after sleep loss and during the biological night, and thus may be contributing to human error and accidents. Because affected individuals are often unaware of their sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, there is a critical need for non-invasive, objective indicators of mild, yet potentially unsafe, impairment due to disrupted sleep or biological rhythms. Our findings show that a set of eye-movement measures can be used to provide sensitive and reliable indicators of such mild neural impairments. Abstract Sleep loss and circadian misalignment have long been known to impair human cognitive and motor performance with significant societal and health consequences. It is well known that human reaction time to a visual cue is impaired following sleep loss and circadian misalignment, but it has remained unclear how more complex visuomotor control behaviour is altered under these conditions. In this study, we measured 14 parameters of the voluntary ocular tracking response of 12 human participants (six females) to systematically examine the effects of sleep loss and circadian misalignment using a constant routine 24-h acute sleep-deprivation paradigm. The combination of state-of-the-art oculometric and sleep-research methodologies allowed us to document, for the first time, large changes in many components of pursuit, saccades and visual motion processing as a function of time awake and circadian phase. Further, we observed a pattern of impairment across our set of oculometric measures that is qualitatively different from that observed previously with other mild neural impairments. We conclude that dynamic vision and visuomotor control exhibit a distinct pattern of impairment linked with time awake and circadian phase. Therefore, a sufficiently broad set of oculometric measures could provide a sensitive and specific behavioural biomarker of acute sleep loss and circadian misalignment. We foresee potential applications of such oculometric biomarkers assisting in the assessment of readiness-to-perform higher risk tasks and in the characterization of sub-clinical neural impairment in the face of a multiplicity of potential risk factors, including disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms.

AB  - Aim Idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent, mystifying disorder with a questionable neurogenic background. We aimed to investigate the possible subtle neuropathic affection underlying its pathogenesis. Methods A cross-sectional cut off study was carried out on a series of 38 females with idiopathic OAB and 22 healthy matched female volunteers. The following was performed: symptom score questionnaire, determination of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML), sacral reflexes? latencies, pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials, and needle electromyography of the external anal and urethral sphincters. Results A highly significant prolongation of PNTMLs and sacral reflexes latencies among the patients group was detected (P?≥?0.001). Pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials showed non- significance among the two studied groups (P?≥?0.05). External anal sphincter neuropathic affection was detected in 27 patients (71%) and external urethral sphincter neuropathic affection was detected in 30 patients (78.9%). The clitoral anal reflex showed the highest sensitivity and specificity among the neurophysiologic tests used in assessing the neuropathic affection (86.7 and 83%, respectively), followed by PNTML (83.3 and 80%, respectively). Conclusion Pudendal neuropathy is the dominating possible attributing factor in the pathogenesis underlying idiopathic OAB. An integrated clinical, urodynamic, and electro-physiological assessment is recommended for evaluation of any overactive bladder patients.
