AB  - Abstract Hospital length of stay (LOS) after liver transplantation has been determined to correlate with liver disease severity, post-transplant survival rates, and transplant-associated costs. A patient's model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and an organ's Donor risk index (DRI) have both been found to be significant predictors of LOS, but these two factors alone are insufficient to form an accurate prediction. Previous studies have identified other factors predictive of LOS, which can be incorporated with MELD and DRI to create more specific results. The objective of this study was to create an algorithm, or models, based on the most significant LOS predictors as identified from national data at different stages of the transplant process. Four models were developed predicting LOS using recipient factors, payment factors, donor factors, and postoperative factors. A medical care team member can enter a patient's data into the model and receive a reasonably accurate prediction of LOS for each phase of the liver transplant process, specifying the impact of each factor. These predictions would help predict the factors most likely to prolong LOS, inform resource allocation, and provide patients with more specific predictions of their LOS following transplantation.

AB  - 1 Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a cytokine with diverse properties consistent with a possible role in inflammatory disease. We investigated whether TNF-α is induced during the progression of lung inflammation elicited by a particulate non-antigenic stimulus, and whether pharmacological control of TNF-α expression influences recruitment of specific inflammatory cell types. 2 A single intravenous injection of Sephadex particles into rats led to extensive granulomatous inflammation in lung alveolar and bronchial tissue that peaked in intensity after 24?72?h. Mononuclear cells were the principal component of granulomas, but neutrophils and eosinophils were also abundant. Numbers of mononuclear cells, neutrophils and eosinophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) peaked at 72?h, 48?h and 72?h, respectively. 3 Messenger RNA encoding TNF-α was induced in lung epithelial cells, lung granulomas and BAL cells 6?h after Sephadex administration and remained elevated for 72?h before declining to baseline by 7 days. In BAL cell populations TNF-α protein was localized to mononuclear cells at all times points pre- and post-Sephadex administration. 4 Treatment of rats with dexamethasone significantly reduced the Sephadex-induced recruitment of mononuclear cells, neutrophils and eosinophils into the bronchoalveolar cavity, and significantly reduced TNF-α mRNA expression by BAL cells. 5 Treatment of rats with cyclosporin A was without effect on Sephadex-induced elevations of mononuclear cell numbers and expression of TNF-α, but did reduce significantly recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils to BAL cell populations. 6 These results show that a sequential asthma-like recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells into lung tissue can be induced by single exposure to a non-antigenic stimulus. Pharmacological and histological studies reveal that mononuclear cell mobilization relates closely to induced TNF-α expression, whereas mobilization of neutrophils and eosinophils appears secondary to expression of the cytokine.

AB  - Abstract Background The Maastricht frailty screening tool for hospitalised patients (MFST-HP) is a frailty screening tool that is fully integrated in the nursing assessment at admission. This study aims to determine the predictive value of the MFST-HP for the health outcomes length of hospital stay, discharge destination, readmission and mortality. Methods Data of 2691 hospitalised patients (70+), admitted between 01-01-2013 and 31-12-2013, were included in the study. The predictive value of the MFST-HP was analysed by means of receiver operating characteristics curves. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for different MFST-HP cut-off scores were examined. Results Mean age of the population was 78.9 years (SD 6.4) and their average length of stay was 10.2 days (SD 9.7). Nearly 75.0% of the patients were discharged to their home and around. Approximately 25% of the patients were readmitted within 120 days. Mortality rates were 4.3% and 9.5% (within 30 or 120 days postdischarge, respectively). The area under the curve was moderate and varied from 0.50 to 0.69 for the different outcomes. As a result of high values on negative predictive value (between 73.5% and 96.7%) the MFST-HP is able to rule out a large proportion of non-frail patients. In this study 84% of the patients had a MFST-HP score of ≥ 6, suggested as most favourable cut off. Conclusions The MFST-HP seems to operate more strongly as a non-frailty indicator than as a frailty indicator and may in this respect help professionals to decide upon subsequent care. The MFST-HP is able to rule out 84% of the non-frail population in this study. The remaining 16% need to be assessed by means of a comprehensive geriatric assessment or rapid geriatric assessment, to gain more insight in the level of vulnerability in the frail-group.
