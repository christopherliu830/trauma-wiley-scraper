AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Evoked phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain are viewed as a window into the underlying pathophysiology. They are also potential therapeutic targets. This study sought evidence for the effect on such evoked phenomena of currently used agents. Design.? We reviewed MEDLINE (1966?2006) and EMBASE (1980?2006) to locate all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining therapeutic responses of evoked neuropathic pain phenomena, including dynamic mechanical allodynia, pin prick hyperalgesia, and thermal allodynia. We also noted the methods of elicitation of these evoked pain phenomena. Results.? We found 40 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. A wide variety of methods was used to evoke neuropathic pain phenomena. For dynamic mechanical allodynia, there is some evidence for the efficacy of ketamine, alfentanil, and morphine, but only when administered intravenously. For other agents and other evoked pain phenomena, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Conclusions.? There is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in treating evoked pain phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain states. There is little clinical evidence to either support or refute theoretical arguments for efficacy of specific agents in evoked neuropathic pain phenomena. More and larger trials are needed to examine these phenomena. Consensus is required with respect to methods used to elicit these evoked phenomena.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in pregnancy is most often encountered secondary to underlying obstetrical, surgical, or medical complications. The process of DIC is initiated through the activation of tissue factor (TF), which is found in subendothelial cells, amniotic fluid, and placenta. DIC is seen in severe forms of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication in obstetrics and is associated with significant maternal mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease associated with massive obstetric hemorrhage. It is characterized by accumulation of microvesicular fatty infiltration in the maternal hepatocytes, leading to liver failure. The diagnosis of DIC is clinical, based upon underlying etiology, blood loss, and the general condition of the patient. The basic principles of managing obstetrical DIC are multidisciplinary approach, treatment of obstetric causes, blood and blood products, and supportive care.

AB  - Objectives To define a uroflowmetry-based non-invasive predictive tool for the primary diagnosis of urethral stricture disease. Methods A total of 300 male patients (150 with urethral stricture disease and 150 with benign prostatic obstruction), treated surgically between 2005 and 2015, and 75 healthy males were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups (75 benign prostatic obstruction patients and 75 urethral stricture disease patients in each group). A model, able to objectively differentiate between benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease, was created by use of original and hybrid uroflowmetry variables in logistic regression in group A (test group). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used for validation in group B (validation group) and to calculate cut-off values to distinguish healthy individuals from benign prostatic obstruction as a result of urethral stricture disease. Results Receiver operating characteristics area under the curve values of the created model were 0.841 (0.777?0.905) and 0.807 (0.735?0.879) in groups A and B, respectively. Optimal cut-off values were 2.2847 and 0.1182 to distinguish healthy individuals versus benign prostatic obstruction and benign prostatic obstruction versus urethral stricture disease. Conclusions A triphasic uroflowmetry-based model is able to objectively distinguish voiding patterns of healthy individuals, benign prostatic obstruction and urethral stricture disease. The probability of urethral stricture disease can be objectively calculated for each individual patient based on a non-invasive uroflowmetry test. Uroflowmetry pattern interpretation by use of statistical models could become a new standard.

AB  - Summary Girls and women in conflict with the law are slowly garnering serious attention from mainstream correctional scholars. Contemporary mainstream correctional scholars started conducting female-centered research in the 1990s. Collectively, mainstream and gender-responsive scholars have made significant strides in understanding, preventing, and treating female criminal conduct. This chapter highlights major advancements, existing challenges, and debates in the field of female offender corrections. It describes the nature and prevalence of female-perpetrated crime. The chapter provides a review of prominent theories to explain female criminal conduct. It reviews recent developments and remaining debates regarding female offender risk assessment and intervention. Historically, risk assessment methods developed and validated on male offenders have been applied to female offenders with little thought or opposition. The chapter attempts to consider consensual facts, identify existing knowledge gaps, recognize ongoing debates, and highlight points of reconciliation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to construct a predictive model to identify aged care residents at risk of future skin tears. Extensive data about individual characteristics, skin characteristics, and skin properties were gathered from 173 participants at baseline and at 6 months. A predictive model, developed using multivariable logistic regression, identified five variables that significantly predicted the risk of skin tear at 6 months. These included: a history of skin tears in the previous 12?months (OR 3.82 [1.64-8.90], P = 0.002), purpura ≤20 mm in size (OR 3.64 [1.42-9.35], P = 0.007), a history of falls in the previous 3 months (OR 3.37 [1.54-7.41], P = 0.002), clinical manifestations of elastosis (OR 3.19 [1.38-7.38], P = 0.007), and male gender (OR 3.08 [1.22-7.77], P = 0.017). The predictive model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.854 with an 81.7% sensitivity and an 81.4% specificity. This predictive model could inform a simple but promising bedside tool for identifying older individuals at risk of skin tears.

AB  - Redox-active iron, catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in experimental renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, in clinical transplantation, it is unknown whether redox-active iron is involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury of non-heart-beating (NHB) donor kidneys. We measured redox-active iron concentrations in perfusate samples of 231 deceased donor kidneys that were preserved by machine pulsatile perfusion at our institution between May 1998 and November 2002 using the bleomycin detectable iron assay. During machine pulsatile perfusion, redox-active iron was released into the preservation solution. Ischemically injured NHB donor kidneys had significantly higher perfusate redox-active iron concentrations than heart-beating (HB) donor kidneys that were not subjected to warm ischemia (3.9 ± 1.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.0 ?mol/L, p = 0.001). Moreover, redox-active iron concentration was an independent predictor of post-transplant graft viability (odds ratio 1.68, p = 0.01) and added predictive value to currently available donor and graft characteristics. This was particularly evident in uncontrolled NHB donor kidneys for which there is the greatest uncertainty about transplant outcomes. Therefore, perfusate redox-active iron concentration shows promise as a novel viability marker of NHB donor kidneys.
