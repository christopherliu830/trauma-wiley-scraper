AB  - Background Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) are increasingly used for anaesthesia and postoperative pain control in acute orthopaedic limb surgery but rebound pain upon cessation of PNBs may challenge the benefits on the pain profile. We aimed to explore the pain profile following acute ankle fracture surgery under PNB anaesthesia and investigate if rebound pain could pose a clinical problem. Methods Exploratory, observational study of adults scheduled for acute primary internal fixation of an ankle fracture under ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic and saphenous ropivacaine block anaesthesia. Postoperatively, patients regularly registered pain scores while receiving a fixed analgesics regimen and patient controlled morphine on-demand. We analysed morphine consumption and depicted the detailed pain profiles as graphs allowing for visual analysis of pain courses, including rebound pain. Secondly, we compared the area under the curve and peak pain between relevant age-subgroups. Results We included 21 patients aged 20-83. Depicted pain profiles reveal that PNB supplied effective and long lasting postoperative pain control, but cessation of the PNB led to intense rises in pain scores with six out of nine 20-60-year-olds reaching severe pain levels. The rebound was less pronounced in patients >60 years old, but nearly all reached moderate pain levels. Morphine consumption rates were high during the rebound. Conclusions This study thoroughly analyses the post-PNB pain profile and suggests rebound pain is a clinically relevant and problematic issue with the potential to outweigh the PNB benefits, especially for younger patients. The conclusions are tentative, and a randomised study is pending.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slowly progressive joint disease. Joint distraction can be a treatment of choice in case of severe OA. Prediction of failure will facilitate implementation of joint distraction in clinical practice. Patients with severe ankle OA, who underwent joint distraction were included. Survival analysis was performed over 12 years (n?=?25 after 12 years). Regression analyses were used to predict failures and clinical benefit at 2 years after joint distraction (n?=?111). Survival analysis showed that 44% of the patients failed, 17% within 2 years and 37% within 5 years after joint distraction (n?=?48 after 5 years). Survival analysis in subgroups showed that the percentage failure was only different in women (30% after 2 years) versus men (after 11 years still no 30% failure). In the multivariate analyses female gender was predictive for failure 2 years after joint distraction. Gender and functional disability at baseline predicted more pain. Functional disability and pain at baseline were associated with more functional disability. Joint distraction shows a long-term clinical beneficial outcome. However, failure rate is considerable over the years. Female patients have a higher chance of failure during follow-up. Unfortunately, not all potential predictors could be investigated and other clinically significant predictors were not found. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Aims Previous evaluations of natriuretic peptide (NP) levels in patients with acute dyspnoea presenting to the emergency department (ED) have selected only a minority of patients for echocardiography. We aimed to evaluate the association between NPs and more subtle echocardiographic findings and to assess the potential for NPs to provide additional prognostic information beyond that provided by echocardiography in ?all-comers? with acute dyspnoea. Methods and results Prospective echocardiograms were performed on 338/412 patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnoea. B-type natriuretic peptide and NT-proBNP were measured on presentation. Patients were followed-up for 1 year. Decompensated heart failure was diagnosed in 37% of patients and 13% died. The diagnostic accuracy (c-statistic) of BNP and NT-proBNP for identifying LVEF ≤ 40% was 0.88 (P < 0.001) and 0.86 (P < 0.001), respectively. The c-statistics for BNP and NT-proBNP for identifying diastolic dysfunction were 0.67 (P < 0.001) and 0.67 (P < 0.001); but only 0.57 (P = 0.09) and 0.60 (P = 0.02) in patients with LVEF ≥ 50%. Natriuretic peptides, but not LV mass or diastolic parameters, independently predicted mortality at 1 year in all patients and in those with an LVEF ≥ 50%. Conclusion In an acute dyspnoea population with ?all-comers? undergoing echocardiography, NPs correlate strongly with structural abnormalities and identify those with preserved LVEF at highest risk for death. Careful interpretation of elevated NP values is needed in the presence of preserved systolic function.

AB  - Abstract Background The Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire is a 12-item self-report instrument divided into abdominal, rectal and stool domains. Aims This study aimed to (1) evaluate the psychometric properties of PAC-SYM in assessing the symptoms and severity of opioid-induced constipation; (2) test for differences in opioid-induced constipation between Durogesic? fentanyl transdermal reservoir (TDF) and oral sustained-release morphine (SRM) in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods In a 13-month, open-label, parallel-group study, 680 patients were randomised to receive either TDF (n = 338) or SRM (n = 342) for CLBP. Assessments were recorded at Visit 1 (baseline), Visit 5 (Day 29) and Visit 17 (Month 13). Concurrent validity, clinical validity and responsiveness of PAC-SYM were determined based on patients' confirmation of constipation (CC) scores. Differences in PAC-SYM scores between treatment groups were also evaluated. Results The study included 677 patients, of whom 638 were opioid-naïve. Mean PAC-SYM scores for constipated patients were substantially higher than for non-constipated patients, demonstrating good clinical validity for PAC-SYM. The PAC-SYM could detect changes in bowel function over the treatment period, indicating responsiveness. Homogeneity of each symptom domain exceeded Cronbach's α coefficient of 0.70, suggesting good internal consistency and reliability. Changes in mean PAC-SYM scores from baseline to Visit 5 and Visit 17 were significantly lower for the TDF group than for the SRM group, indicating that the TDF group experienced less severe constipation. Conclusion PAC-SYM is a reliable, valid and responsive measure of the presence and severity of opioid-induced constipation symptoms.
