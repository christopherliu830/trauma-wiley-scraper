AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tonapofylline. Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment were enrolled in parallel with demographically matched healthy subjects. All study participants received a single 75-mg oral tonapofylline capsule. The pharmacokinetic parameters for both tonapofylline and its active metabolite, acyl-glucuronide (tonapofylline-AG), were affected by hepatic impairment significantly (P < .1) except for time to peak plasma concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (t1/2), and apparent volume of distribution based on the terminal phase (Vdz/F). In the mild group, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the time-concentration curve from time 0 to 48 hours postdose (AUC48h), and from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) of tonapofylline modestly increased as compared with the control healthy subjects (GMR 1.62, 1.57, and 1.53, respectively). The extent of increase of these parameters for tonapofylline-AG was more profound than tonapofylline with geometric mean ratio (GMR) ranging from 2.02 to 2.08. Moderate hepatic impairment was also associated with modest increases of Cmax, AUC48h, and AUCinf of tonapofylline (GMR 1.41, 1.98, and 2.08, respectively). Similar to the mild group, the increase of these parameters were higher for tonapofylline-AG with GMR ranging from 2.80 to 3.86. Single oral 75-mg tonapofylline was safe and well tolerated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

AB  - Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are mobilized from the bone marrow and increase in the early phase after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of CECs and indices of endothelial dysfunction in patients with STEMI. In 78 patients with acute STEMI, characterization of CD34+/VEGFR2+CECs, and indices of endothelial damage/dysfunction such as brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD) were determined. Blood samples for CECs assessment and quantification were obtained within 24 hours of admission and FMD was assessed during the index hospitalization. At 30 days follow up, the primary composite end point of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of all-cause mortality, recurrent nonfatal MI, or heart failure and the secondary endpoint of early adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling were analyzed. The 17 patients (22%) who developed MACE had significantly higher CEC level (P?=?0.004), von Willebrand factor (vWF) level (P?=?0.028), and significantly lower FMD (P?=?0.006) compared to the remaining patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that CECs level and LV ejection fraction were independent predictors of MACE. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for CEC level, FMD, and the logistic model with both markers were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.82, respectively, for prediction of the MACE. The 16 patients who developed the secondary endpoint had significantly higher CEC level compared to remaining patients (P?=?0.038). In conclusion, increased circulating endothelial cells and endothelial dysfunction predicted the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and adverse cardiac remodeling in patients with STEMI.

AB  - Background The incidence of adolescent suicide is rising in the United States, yet we have limited information regarding short-term prediction of suicide attempts. Our aim was to identify predictors of suicide attempts within 3-months of an emergency department (ED) visit. Methods Adolescents, ages 12?17, seeking health care at 13 pediatric EDs (Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network) and one Indian Health Service Hospital in the United States were consecutively recruited. Among 10,664 approached patients, 6,448 (60%) were enrolled and completed a suicide risk survey. A subset of participants (n = 2,897) was assigned to a 3-month telephone follow-up, and 2,104 participants completed this follow-up (73% retention). Our primary outcome was a suicide attempt between the ED visit and 3-month follow-up. Results One hundred four adolescents (4.9%) made a suicide attempt between enrollment and 3-month follow-up. A large number of baseline predictors of suicide attempt were identified in bivariate analyses. The final multivariable model for the full sample included the presence of suicidal ideation during the past week, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, lifetime history of suicidal behavior, and school connectedness. For the subgroup of adolescents who did not report recent suicidal ideation at baseline, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and social connectedness. Among males, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and past week suicidal ideation. For females, the final model included past week suicidal ideation, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, number of past-year nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) incidents, and social connectedness. Conclusions Results indicate that the key risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts differ for subgroups of adolescents defined by sex and whether or not they report recent suicidal thoughts. Results also point to the importance of school and social connectedness as protective factors against suicide attempts.

AB  - Overall outcomes for women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remain relatively poor, and superior methods of treatment are needed. EOC is a peritoneal surface malignancy that is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy agents, making it a good target for i.p. chemotherapy. Because there is strong laboratory data demonstrating the ability of hyperthermia to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, the addition of hyperthermia to i.p. chemotherapy, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), makes theoretical sense. This article reviews the current literature and discusses the possible role for HIPEC in EOC at significant natural history time points: front line, at the time of interval debulking, in consolidation, and for recurrent disease. The conclusion is that much further research is needed but that HIPEC could sensibly be researched at all the natural history time points in EOC.
