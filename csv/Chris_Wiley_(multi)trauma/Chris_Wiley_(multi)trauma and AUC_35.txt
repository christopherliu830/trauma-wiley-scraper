AB  - Abstract Inherent recipient factors, including pretransplant diagnosis, obesity and elevated pulmonary pressures, are established primary graft dysfunction (PGD) risks. We evaluated the relationship between preoperative lung injury biomarkers and PGD to gain further mechanistic insight in recipients. We performed a prospective cohort study of recipients in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group enrolled between 2002 and 2010. Our primary outcome was Grade 3 PGD on Day 2 or 3. We measured preoperative plasma levels of five biomarkers (CC-16, sRAGE, ICAM-1, IL-8 and Protein C) that were previously associated with PGD when measured at the postoperative time point. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Of 714 subjects, 130 (18%) developed PGD. Median CC-16 levels were elevated in subjects with PGD (10.1 vs. 6.0, p?<?0.001). CC-16 was associated with PGD in nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) subjects (OR for highest quartile of CC-16: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.37, 6.00, p?=?0.005) but not in subjects with IPF (OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.43, 4.45, p?=?0.59). After adjustment, preoperative CC-16 levels remained associated with PGD (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 7.30, p?=?0.013) in non-IPF subjects. Our study suggests the importance of preexisting airway epithelial injury in PGD. Markers of airway epithelial injury may be helpful in pretransplant risk stratification in specific recipients.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis have reported loss of fingernail resilience as the disease progresses. Keratin is the predominant protein in human nail tissue, and its structure has been postulated to be different in fingernails clipped from subjects who have sustained fragility fractures and those who have not, which may offer a window into the donor's bone health. This study was designed to qualify these differences, which may lead to the development of a novel screening tool for fracture risk. Raman spectroscopy was used to measure the fingernails of 633 postmenopausal women who presented at six fracture clinics located across the UK and Ireland. The Raman signals from donor's fingernails were compared between (1) fracture and nonfracture and (2) osteoporotic versus non-osteoporotic donors The data presented show differences in the protein changes observed for pervasive osteoporosis compared to a general increased risk of fragility fracture. For fracture risk, compositional changes falling into broad classes of amino acid residue (aliphatic, aromatic, acidic, amide and sulphurous) were observed, while a difference in disulphide bonding levels was reaffirmed. For pervasive osteoporosis, the disulphide mode suggested increasing disorder in disulphide bonding orientation. Fractures were associated with a transition from alpha helical secondary structure to random, while the pervasive osteoporosis cases were associated with a transition to beta sheet structure. General fracture risk is associated with a change in the structure and composition of the keratin protein. Osteoporosis is associated with different protein structural changes and an increase in free acid groups. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Effects of altered plasma α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels on pharmacokinetic parameters of basic antimicrobials, erythromycin (EM), lincomycin (LM) and clindamycin (CM) were evaluated in pigs by simulation analysis. Intravenous (i.v.) injections of EM, LM and CM were performed to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy conditions. Binding parameters were obtained from an in vitro study using ultrafiltration. Simulation studies indicated that an increase of plasma AGP levels resulted in a decrease of both volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) and total body clearance (Cltot) for all the drugs. Elimination rate constant for LM was almost unchanged by an increase of plasma AGP levels, whereas those for EM and CM were increased. Plasma concentration?time profiles at a high AGP level (often observed in pathophysiological conditions) were also simulated. All of the total plasma concentration?time profiles were different from those at normal AGP level. The differences were characterized by a higher initial concentration with faster or similar elimination. Unbound plasma concentration?time profile of LM was unaffected by AGP levels, whereas EM and CM were eliminated from plasma more rapidly at high AGP level. These results suggested that adjustment of dosage regimen of EM and CM is required in pathophysiological conditions, but that of LM is not required.
