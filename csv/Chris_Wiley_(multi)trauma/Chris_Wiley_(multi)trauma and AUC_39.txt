AB  - Background Little is known on adverse events and their timing after peripheral nerve surgery in extremities. The aim of this study is to identify predictors and typical timing of complications, unplanned readmission, and length of hospital stay for patients undergoing peripheral nerve surgery in the extremities. Methods Data were extracted from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry from 2005 to 2015. Adult patients undergoing peripheral nerve surgery in the extremities were included. A subgroup analysis was performed for brachial plexus operations. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of any complication, surgical site infection, unplanned readmission, and reoperation. Results A total of 2,840 patients were identified; 628 were brachial plexus operations. Overall complications were 4.4% and 7.0%, respectively. Median time for occurrence of any complication was 8 days. The most common complications were wound-related (1.7%), which occurred at a median of 15 days postoperatively. Reoperation occurred in 1.8% of all cases; most commonly for musculoskeletal repair (16.7%). Unplanned readmissions occurred in 2.3% and were most often due to wound-related problems (24.1%). Preoperatively contaminated wounds, inpatient procedures, and longer operative time seemed to have the most influence on all adverse events. In brachial plexus pathology, insulin-dependent diabetes and emergency cases also negatively affected outcomes. Conclusions Complications usually occur one to two weeks postoperatively. Preoperatively contaminated wounds, inpatient procedures, and longer operative times influence outcome. Anatomical level of operation results in significantly different lengths of hospital stay; brachial plexus pathology has the longest length of stay.

AB  - The International Working Group on Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested the free and cued selective reminding test (FCSRT) to assess memory, as it showed high sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation of AD from healthy controls and other dementias. The FCSRT involves the use of selective reminding with semantic cueing in memory assessment. This study aims to validate the FCSRT for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD through the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy and the suggestion of cut-off scores. Patients were classified into two groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n = 100) and AD (n = 70). A matched control group (n = 101) of cognitively healthy subjects was included. The reliability and the validity of the FCSRT were analysed on the immediate (IR) and delayed (DR) recalls. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.915 for the IR and 0.879 for the DR. The total recall measures revealed good areas under the curve for MCI (IR: .818; DR: .828) and excellent for AD (IR: .987; DR: .991). Furthermore, the MCI group was subdivided with respect to a non-similar/similar AD pattern of impairment, with almost half of the subjects showing an AD-like decline. This analysis represents a novel contribution regarding the properties of the FCSRT in illustrating the heterogeneity of MCI at baseline. The FCSRT has proved to be a very useful tool in the characterization of the memory impairment of the AD spectrum.

AB  - Abstract This chapter describes technical design, validation, guiding values and purposes of the COMPAS system. It is used at sequential stages of criminal justice, including: pretrial and community corrections, probation, jail, prisons, and parole. Its goals include accurate risk assessment, comprehensive needs assessment, public safety, institutional safety, fairness and racial equity, and ease of use. For incarcerated offenders, it supports decisions regarding internal management, treatment, and referrals to community programs as alternatives to incarceration. Periodic re-validation, re-norming, and calibration studies are conducted. COMPAS selection of risk and need factors is based on a scientific foundation of explanatory theories of crime, meta-analytic research, and current evidence on predictive validity. Many output reports are designed to guide staff in the use of the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) principles. A large body of research supports the predictive validity and scale reliability of COMPAS including both internal validation studies and external studies by independent research teams in diverse states. In addition to the adult core version of COMPAS, customized versions are developed for youth, women, and long-term incarcerated prisoners to support internal management in jails and prisons, reentry planning, and post-release arrangements. Current developments involve advanced machine learning (ML) tools for risk prediction, and a theory-guided internal classification (IC) to address specific responsivity among incarcerated prisoners.

AB  - Abstract The effect of cimetidine (CM) on the pharmacokinetics of fentiazac (FT) was studied in six rats. FT was administered by intravenous (iv) bolus injection at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg to rats receiving iv infusion of saline (control) or CM. The infusion of CM was conducted to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of CM of 30 and 60 ?g/mL. In the control rats, the plasma disposition of FT and its major metabolite, p-hydroxy FT, followed a classical drug-metabolite profile irrespective of FT dose. The plasma level of p-hydroxy FT was comparable with that of FT. The disappearance of FT from the rat plasma was significantly delayed by the CM infusion, and p-hydroxy FT was unde-tectable in the plasma in CM-treated rats. The total body clearance (CLt) of FT was decreased to 20?50% of the control value in CM-treated rats, implying that FT metabolism to p-hydroxy FT is almost completely impaired by CM. The CLt, values in rats with different Css of CM (30 and 60 ?g/mL) were not significantly different from each other. The distribution volume of FT at steady state (Vdss) was decreased to 60?70% of the control value by the CM infusion at higher doses of FT (10 and 20 mg/kg). The decreases in Vdss and CLt, seem not to be related to the binding of FT to plasma protein because the binding of FT was not influenced by CM. In clinical settings, the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic difference may warrant dose adjustment to avoid toxic effects of FT when administered with CM.
