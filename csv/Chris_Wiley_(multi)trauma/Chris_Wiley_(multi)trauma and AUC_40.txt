AB  - BACKGROUND Preoperative anemia is an important modifiable risk factor for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in a variety of surgical populations. The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between preoperative anemia and i) transfusion of RBCs within 72 hours of surgery and ii) postoperative clinical outcomes in children undergoing spine arthrodesis surgery. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We assembled a retrospective cohort of children included in the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database who underwent spine arthrodesis surgery from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined using age- and sex-specific hematocrit thresholds. Data collected included demographic and surgical characteristics, RBC transfusion within 72 hours, and 30-day postoperative outcomes (postoperative mechanical ventilation, infection, readmission, hospital length of stay, mortality). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of RBC transfusion and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS We included 9,095 patients in the analysis. Preoperative anemia was present in 14% (n = 1,233) of the population and 67% (n = 6,135) of patients were transfused. Our multivariable logistic regression showed anemia, surgical time > 350 minutes, > 7 vertebral levels fused, neuromuscular disease, and cerebral palsy were all independent predictors of RBC transfusion. Preoperative anemia was also associated with prolonged hospital LOS (adjusted OR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.11?1.54, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS In this study of 9,095 children undergoing spine surgery, preoperative anemia was associated with an increased risk of RBC transfusion and prolonged LOS. Further studies are needed to determine if treatment of preoperative anemia can effectively reduce intraoperative RBC transfusion.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the development and validation of the National Cancer Center Psychological Symptom Inventory (NCC-PSI). Methods Psychometric properties of the NCC-PSI were examined by using multicenter surveys involving 400 patients with cancer in 5 cancer-treatment hospitals throughout Korea. Related measures including the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were administered. Results Convergent validity was supported by NCC-PSI's significant associations with related measures. Known-group validity was proven with higher scores of helplessness/hopelessness and anxious preoccupation on the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer in the depression and anxiety diagnosis group, defined by the NCC-PSI. Cutoff scores for insomnia, anxiety, and depression were identified. Overall, the screening performance of the NCC-PSI was comparable to that of the distress thermometer and Patient Health Questionnare-2. Conclusions The NCC-PSI represents a meaningful effort to develop a distress screening tool that addresses specific psychological symptoms common in cancer, which are tailored to the local oncology care system with varying degrees of psychosocial care resources.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major contributor to respiratory morbidity and mortality after oesophagectomy. Several pre-, intra- and post-operative factors are thought to predispose to its development in the post-oesophagectomy period. The aim of this study was to determine factors predisposing to ARDS in the post-oesophagectomy period. Methods:? A total of 112 patients who underwent elective oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer (gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia, 93; oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 16; oesophageal oat cell tumour, 1; oesophageal anaplastic carcinoma, 1; oesophageal colloid carcinoma, 1) between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 formed the study group in this retrospective study. The pre-, intra and post-operative data for these patients (male?:?female = 89:23, mean age 60.8 years) were collected from an oesophagectomy database and hospital medical records. Results:? The incidence of ARDS was 13%. The in-hospital mortality among ARDS cases was 20% and 1-year mortality was 40%. Various factors such as preoperative chronic respiratory disease (P-value = 0.000, odds ratio = 17.76), smoking pack-years (P-value = 0.045, odds ratio = 1.02), abnormal preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1?s (P-value = 0.009, odds ratio = 7.97), high percentage of oxygen in inspired air (P-value = 0.041, odds ratio = 1.24) and use of perioperative inotropes (P-value = 0.021, odds ratio = 4.26) were associated with ARDS. Conclusions:? Preoperative physiological status as indicated by a preoperative history of chronic respiratory disease and preoperative pulmonary function influenced the post-operative outcome in our patients. The use of perioperative inotropes suggests perioperative cardiorespiratory instability, and could also predispose to the development of ARDS in the post-operative period.

AB  - Abstract The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a physical and metabolic entity that isolates the brain from the systemic circulation. The barrier consists of tight junctions between endothelial cells that contain egress transporters and catabolic enzymes. To cross the BBB, a drug must possess the appropriate physicochemical properties to achieve a sufficient time-concentration profile in brain interstitial fluid (ISF). In this overview, we review techniques to measure BBB permeation, which is evidenced by the free concentration of compound in brain ISF over time. We consider a number of measurement techniques, including in vivo microdialysis and brain receptor occupancy following perfusion. Consideration is also given to the endothelial and nonendothelial cell systems used to assess both the BBB permeation of a test compound and its interactions with egress transporters, and computer models employed for predicting passive permeation and the probability of interactions with BBB transporters.
