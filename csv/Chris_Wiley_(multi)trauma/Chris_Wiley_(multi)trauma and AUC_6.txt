AB  - Objectives: To determine the combination of conformation characteristics of the pelvic limbs of Labrador Retrievers that best discriminates between limb at risk to develop cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) disease and limbs at low risk using radiographs, computerized tomography (CT) images, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Study Design: Cross-sectional clinical study. Animals: Twelve clinically normal and 9 unilaterally CCL-deficient Labrador Retrievers. Methods: The pelvic limbs of normal dogs were considered as non-predisposed to CCL disease and the contralateral limbs of CCL-deficient dogs as predisposed. Conformation variables, obtained from femur and tibial radiographs, pelvic limb CT images and DEXA studies, of predisposed pelvic limbs were compared with the conformation variables from pelvic limbs of the low-risk group. An ROC curve analysis was used to assess the discriminating properties of conformation variables for several combinations. Results: We determined that a combination of tibial plateau angle (TPA) and femoral anteversion angle (FAA) measured on radiographs was optimal for discriminating predisposed and non-predisposed limbs for CCL disease in Labrador Retrievers. Conclusions: Assessing predisposition to CCL disease with a combination of conformational measurements is better than using univariate parameters. In the future, TPA and FAA may be used to screen dogs suspected of being susceptible to CCL disease.

AB  - Abstract? Turpentine oil treatment (0·2 mL kg?1, s.c.) was used to increase the plasma concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (0·13 mg mL?1 in control rats) to 1·72 mg mL?1 after 2 days, and allow assessment of its effects on the pharmacokinetics and stereoselective binding of three ?-blockers. Racemates (5 mg kg?1) were administered intravenously to control and turpentine oil-pretreated rats and the plasma concentrations were determined up to 90 min. Stereoselective analysis showed the apparent distribution volume and the area under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of R-(+)-propranolol to be, respectively, one-quarter and twice those of the S-(?)-enantiomer and differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two were magnified by turpentine oil pretreatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxprenolol enantiomers were essentially similar for the controls but after turpentine oil pretreatment, a higher affinity of the R-(+)-enantiomer for plasma was observed. Acebutolol enantiomers behaved non-stereospecifically throughout. These results were consistent with predictions from the in-vitro stereospecific binding properties of these agents to purified rat α1-acid glycoprotein.

AB  - Abstract Objective Extracorporeal life support is increasingly used in the treatment of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Identifying therapeutic targets and factors associated with the prognosis are highly desirable. The present study analysed the impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on the outcome of patients undergoing VA ECMO. Methods Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels of 329 patients were analysed prior to, on day 1 and 5 of VA ECMO therapy. IL 6 and 8 serum levels of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared. At time points with significant differences, receiver operating characteristics and cut-off levels were analysed to determine the prognostic value of interleukin serum levels. Survival analysis was performed to compare patients above and below cut-off levels. Results Interleukin 6 serum levels were significantly elevated in non-surviving patients prior to VA ECMO initiation. Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels in non-surviving patients were significantly elevated on day 1 of VA ECMO. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed significant prognostic impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on day 1 of VA ECMO (AUC 0.70 and 0.72). Survival analysis comparing patients above and below cut-off showed a 1 year survival of 32.6% for IL6 and 20.8% for IL8 above, as well as 66.9% for IL6 and 61.9% for IL8 below the cut-off (p<0.05). Conclusion Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels demonstrated prognostic value early in VA ECMO therapy. The technical applicability of interleukin reduction raises interest in interleukin 6 and 8 as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and describe the extent and severity of periodontal disease and associated periodontal parameters in beagle dogs. Methods: A full-mouth, site-specific examination was performed in 98 beagle dogs. Focus was placed on clinical attachment loss, pocket depth and bleeding on probing. Results: The prevalence of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm was 20 per cent in the one-year-old dogs, increasing to 84 per cent of the dogs aged more than three years. The number of sites affected with clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm showed a skewed distribution. The prevalence of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 4 mm was only seven per cent. A probing pocket depth of 4+ mm was observed in 44 to 81 per cent of the dogs, depending on age. Also, the distribution of the number of deepened pockets/dog was skewed. The teeth most prone to clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm were the P2, the P3 and the P4 of the maxilla. The teeth most prone to pocket depth greater than equal to 4 mm were the maxillary canines. Clinical Significance: Periodontal disease in terms of clinical attachment loss greater than equal to 1 mm and pocket depth greater than equal to 4 mm is common in beagle dogs, but the major disease burden is carried by only a few dogs. The prevalence increases with increased age but is high already at the age of two years.

AB  - Abstract We tested the efficacy of a snow-tracking-based model for predicting wolf (Canis lupus) distribution and environmental relationships, using n independent radiotelemetry data dataset. We documented tracks in snow on highway rights-of-way and adjacent transects in the central Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada between November and March, 1997?2000. Radiotelemetry data (ground and aerial) were collected in the same region for 2 wolf packs between 1991?1993. We assessed the relationship between wolf track data and topographic, vegetative, and prey metrics, using a Geographic Information System (GIS), logistic regression, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). We transformed our optimal regression model into a probability surface in GIS and verified that surface using radiotelemetry data and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The optimal model showed that wolf presences were positively related to wetness (mature, possibly more complex forest), and elk (Cervus elaphus), and deer (Odocoileus sp.) track density and negatively associated with terrain ruggedness and open canopy. The ROC curve indicated that the track-based model was robust (AUC=0.78). We concluded that track data provide a reliable, cost-effective approach for determining distribution and predicting wolf-environmental relationships in mountainous regions.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the effects of three doses of L-659?066 (MK-467) on the bispectral index (BIS) and clinical sedation in dexmedetomidine-sedated Beagles. Study design? Randomized, experimental cross over study. Animals? Eight purpose-bred healthy laboratory Beagles. Methods? Dexmedetomidine (10??g?kg?1 IV [DEX]) was administered alone or in combination with three doses of L-659?066 (250??g?kg?1 [DL250]; 500??g?kg?1 [DL500] and 750??g?kg?1 [DL750] IV) in the same syringe in a randomized crossover manner. The bispectral index (BIS), electromyography (EMG) and sedation score were recorded at baseline and 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60?minutes after treatment. Results? When compared to DEX, BIS and EMG were significantly higher and the sedation score significantly lower with DL500 and DL750. With DEX, BIS was significantly decreased at times 20, 30 and 60?minutes whereas the sedation scores were significantly increased at all time points after drug administration in all groups. Bioequivalence for clinical sedation was detected between DEX and all doses of L-659?066, reaching European Medicines Agency (EMA) standards. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Although L-659?066 interfered with dexmedetomidine induced sedation, the degree of the reduction was not clinically relevant. Despite performing better when dexmedetomidine was used alone, BIS did not reflect the clinical sedative status when the antagonist was added.

AB  - Abstract Background Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is commonly used to deploy new bioprosthetic valves inside degenerated surgically implanted aortic valves in high risk patients. The three scoring systems used to assess risk of postprocedural mortality are: Logistic EuroSCORE (LES), EuroSCORE II (ES II), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS). Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the accuracy of LES, ES II, and STS in estimating all-cause mortality after transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve (ViV) implantations, which was not assessed before. Methods Using the Valve-in-Valve International Data (VIVID) registry, a total of 1,550 patients from 110 centers were included. The study compared the observed 30-day overall mortality vs. the respective predicted mortalities calculated by risk scores. The accuracy of prediction models was assessed based on calibration and discrimination. Results Observed mortality at 30 days was 5.3%, while average expected mortalities by LES, ES II and STS were 29.49 (± 17.2), 14.59 (± 8.6), and 9.61 (± 8.51), respectively. All three risk scores overestimated 30-day mortality with ratios of 0.176 (95% CI 0.138?0.214), 0.342 (95% CI 0.264?0.419), and 0.536 (95% CI 0.421?0.651), respectively. 30-day mortality ROC curves demonstrated that ES II had the largest AUC at 0.722, followed by STS at 0.704, and LES at 0.698. Conclusions All three scores overestimated mortality at 30 days with ES II showing the highest predictability compared to LES and STS; and therefore, should be recommended for ViV procedures. There is a need for a dedicated scoring system for patients undergoing ViV interventions.

AB  - Objectives This study set out to identify significant lesion features of chronic total occlusion (CTO) that predict successful retrograde recanalization via epicardial collateral channels (CCs). Background Epicardial CCs remain essential in retrograde percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of CTO. However, the unpredictability of success and occurrence of complications limit the application of epicardial CCs for retrograde PCI technique for CTO. Methods 103 retro-recanalization cases were analyzed using epicardial CCs with successful recanalization as an end point. Clinical and angiography data were collected. Results The total success rate was 76.3%. Independent predictors associated with technical success included CCs tortuosity, side branch at CCs tortuosity, inadequate CCs Size and inadequate CCs exit location. Assigning a score of one for each variable, four levels of difficulty were obtained and formed the EPI-CTO score (Epicardial CTO). This score had significant predictive value for the likelihood of successful recanalization (AUC: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.89-0.98). Coronary and CCs perforation occurred in 6 and 10 cases respectively. Four cases including two coronary and two CCs perforations had tamponade that needed pericardiocentesis. Conclusions Using epicardial CCs for retrograde approach of CTO PCI is effective. Complication rate was acceptable. We found four independent predictors relative to procedure success.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.
