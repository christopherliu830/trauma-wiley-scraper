AB  - Abstract Objective Prognostic models are commonly used in the clinical setting. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the Rapid Emergency Medical Score (REMS) or alternate models. Methods A retrospective cohort study of critical care patients who underwent retrieval service transfer to an ICU in a single state-wide service in Victoria, Australia. All patients aged 18 years and over transferred to an ICU between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013. Retrieval and ICU datasets were probabilistically linked. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the capacity of physiological markers and patient characteristics to predict in-hospital mortality in the ICU population. The prediction performance was evaluated using measures of discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (Hosmer?Lemeshow [H-L statistic]?). Results There were 1776 ICU patients who were transferred and 1749 (98.5%) had complete data. Of the 1749 patients with complete data, 257 (14.7%) died in-hospital. The REMS calculated at the time of retrieval referral demonstrated borderline predictive capability (C-statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.62?0.76). Following logistic regression analysis of the REMS components, final variables included in the Retrieval REMS model were age, mean arterial pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale score. This model demonstrated acceptable predictive capability (C-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.64?0.79). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) Retrieval REMS for survivors and non-survivors, respectively, were 7 (5, 10) and 9 (7, 11), P < 0.01. Conclusions The availability of a validated tool such as Retrieval REMS assists recognition of high-risk patients and consideration of this risk in retrieval mission planning and response.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The foal requires an active hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis for organ maturation and post natal survival. Prenatal administration of synthetic glucocorticoids may provide an effective method for inducing fetal maturation safely in the mare. Objectives: To determine whether dexamethasone administered to late pregnant mares: 1) will induce fetal maturation and precocious delivery; 2) is safe to use and 3) to identify endocrine responses in the mare and foal. Methods: Pregnant Thoroughbred mares received either 100?mg dexamethasone i.m. (treated n = 5) or 50?ml saline i.m. (control n = 5) at 315, 316 and 317 days of gestation. Plasma progestagens, cortisol and prostaglandin F2α metabolite (PGFM) concentrations were measured before and after treatment. The foals were weighed, the crown-rump length (CRL) measured and an adrenal stimulation test performed on Day 1. Results: Dexamethasone significantly (P<0.01) reduced gestation length in treated mares without apparent adverse effects. Plasma progestagens increased (P<0.05), and cortisol and PGFM (P<0.05) decreased, following dexamethasone treatment compared with control mares. Foals were clinically mature but those from dexamethasone treated mares had reduced (P<0.05) CRL, but not bodyweights, compared with controls. Their cortisol concentrations increased following exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation but 2 foals from dexamethasone treated mares showed evidence of adrenal suppression. Conclusions: Dexamethasone stimulates precocious fetal maturation and delivery in healthy late pregnant mares. However, fetal HPA activity may be suppressed. Potential relevance: Dexamethasone treatment could be used to improve foal viability in mares at risk of preterm delivery. The endocrine effects of such a therapy must be evaluated before clinical intervention with glucocorticoids can be recommended.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Objective Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling. Methods Fifty-six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates. Results Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (p <?0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10-fold cross-validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3%, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 75.0%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (p <?0.008). Interpretation This study provides the first multi-institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost-effective allocation of health care resources.

AB  - Abstract Although intra-dialytic hypertension (IDH) has been noted in clinical settings for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed IDH incidence in our center and the correlation between postdialysis volume state and IDH. One hundred thirty-one maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were enrolled in our study, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and echocardiography (ECG) were recorded. In addition, demographic data were collected, and laboratory examinations were conducted. The patients were grouped into four groups according to the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between predialysis and postdialysis. The incidence of IDH was 10.7%. The proportion of extracellular water to total body weight (ECW/TW), as evaluated by BIA, was significantly higher in the IDH group than in the other three groups both in pre-and post-dialysis. In particular, postdialysis SBP was highest in the highest tertile interval of ECW/TW. In addition, among the four groups, left ventricular volume (LVV) was highest in the IDH group. Binary logistic analyses revealed that predialysis SBP, postdialysis ECW/TW and LVV were independent risk factors of intradialytic hypertension. When predicting IDH, the AUC of the ROC curve was higher for ECW/TW combined with LVV (0.752, 95% CI 0.613?0.896) than for either LVV or ECW/TW alone. Our study further showed that post-dialysis volume expansion is an important factor for the development of IDH.

AB  - Subcutaneous (SC) insulin injection has been demonstrated to be the most effective method for treatment of diabetes mellitus but is conventionally performed by hypodermic needles, leading to poor management of diabetes because of the pain, needle phobia, and tissue trauma. Identification of a viable, safe, and pain-free alternative method has been a longstanding challenge in modern health care. Here, the thermoplastic droplet stretching technique is developed to create an ultrahigh-aspect-ratio needle mold with simple microstructure control. The optimized ultrafine needle (UN) with 4 mm length, minimized 120 µm outer diameter, and 15° sharp bevel angle is formed via electroplating of a metallic layer on the surface of a needle mold with forcing sharp tip. This novel UN enables minimally invasive 4 mm skin insertion to deliver insulin in the targeted SC layer. The similar relative areas under the curves of insulin concentration within UN and 31G needle in vivo insulin administration indicate that UN can ensure stable insulin absorption for secure blood glucose management. Additionally, the proposed fabrication method may facilitate industrialization and commercialization of the UN, holding great promise for replacement of hypodermic needles and for improvement of quality of life among patients with diabetes.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, haemophilia management has continually evolved, with prophylaxis now considered the treatment of choice. Prophylaxis primarily seeks to prevent bleeding and haemarthrosis episodes from occurring and avert the otherwise inevitable haemophilic arthropathy. Yet, numerous unanswered issues remain. These concern dose levels, dosing intervals, ways of integrating variability in bleeding phenotype, patient age, joint status, lifestyle, physical activity, treatment adherence and individual responses to FVIII or FIX concentrates. Individualized prophylaxis may thus be paramount. One crucial tool that may allow more accurate prophylaxis regimens to be implemented is the individual pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Therefore, physicians in charge of managing those living with haemophilia must be comfortable with PK profiling in order to be in a position to tailor patients? treatment, taking into account PK data, while minimizing patients? inconvenience, discomfort, as well as, possibly, treatment costs. For optimization of prophylaxis, recent development of recombinant molecules with more attractive PK properties, such as prolonged elimination half-life, increases the choice of dosing regimens, enabling decreased frequency of dosing for some, if deemed appropriate. For each patient, PK parameters can be determined, including trough levels, AUC, and time spent under a predefined threshold, with additional pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters possibly established by means of a global coagulation test like the thrombin generation test. Most importantly, target PK/PD parameters will need to consider clinical variables like patient age, body weight, joint status, treatment adherence, number of bleeding episodes, activity index or lifestyle.

AB  - Abstract Motion-related artifacts are one of the major challenges associated with pediatric neuroimaging. Recent studies have shown a relationship between visual quality ratings of T1 images and cortical reconstruction measures. Automated algorithms offer more precision in quantifying movement-related artifacts compared to visual inspection. Thus, the goal of this study was to test three different automated quality assessment algorithms for structural MRI scans. The three algorithms included a Fourier-, integral-, and a gradient-based approach which were run on raw T1-weighted imaging data collected from four different scanners. The four cohorts included a total of 6,662 MRI scans from two waves of the Generation R Study, the NIH NHGRI Study, and the GUSTO Study. Using receiver operating characteristics with visually inspected quality ratings of the T1 images, the area under the curve (AUC) for the gradient algorithm, which performed better than either the integral or Fourier approaches, was 0.95, 0.88, and 0.82 for the Generation R, NHGRI, and GUSTO studies, respectively. For scans of poor initial quality, repeating the scan often resulted in a better quality second image. Finally, we found that even minor differences in automated quality measurements were associated with FreeSurfer derived measures of cortical thickness and surface area, even in scans that were rated as good quality. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of automated quality assessment measures can augment visual inspection and may find use as a covariate in analyses or to identify thresholds to exclude poor quality data.

AB  - Objective To determine the vertebral heart size in chinchillas using right and left lateral radiographic views and CT images. To evaluate the agreement between radiographic and CT modalities. Methods Twenty-one clinically healthy chinchillas and seven chinchillas with cardiovascular abnormalities underwent cardiovascular examination before thoracic radiographs and thoracic CT obtained under dexmedetomidine-ketamine anaesthesia. Two observers calculated vertebral heart size for radiographic and CT studies. Reference intervals were calculated with the robust method. Agreement between radiographic and CT-derived vertebral heart size was evaluated with Bland?Altman plots and Deming regression. Results Mean ±sd vertebral heart size for lateral radiographs was 8·9 ±0·62 (reference interval: 7·5 to 10·2) and for CT-derived vertebral heart size was 8·2 ±0·55 (reference interval: 7·1 to 9·4). CT significantly underestimated the radiographic vertebral heart size by 0·66 vertebrae. There was no significant difference between vertebral heart size for right and left lateral radiographic views, or between female and male chinchillas. Clinical Significance Radiographic vertebral heart size for chinchillas is larger than that reported for similar rodents. Vertebral heart size can be calculated using radiography or CT in chinchillas, but these techniques are not interchangeable.

AB  - Summary Background While cobalt is an essential micronutrient for vitamin B12 synthesis in the horse, at supraphysiological concentrations, it has been shown to enhance performance in human subjects and rats, and there is evidence that its administration in high doses to horses poses a welfare threat. Animal sport regulators currently control cobalt abuse via international race day thresholds, but this work was initiated to explore means of potentially adding to application of those thresholds since cobalt may be present in physiological concentrations. Objectives To devise a scientific basis for differentiation between presence of cobalt from bona fide supplementation and cobalt doping through the use of ratios. Study design Six Thoroughbred horses were given 10 mL vitamin B12/cobalt supplement (Hemo-15?; Vetoquinol, Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, UK., 1.5 mg B12, 7 mg cobalt gluconate = 983 ?g total Co) as an i.v. bolus then an i.v. infusion (15 min) of 100 mg cobalt chloride (45.39 mg Co) 6 weeks later. Pre-and post-administration plasma and urine samples were analysed for cobalt and vitamin B12. Methods Urine and plasma samples were analysed for vitamin B12 using an immunoassay and cobalt concentrations were measured via ICP-MS. Baseline concentrations of cobalt in urine and plasma for each horse were subtracted from their cobalt concentrations post-administration for the PK analysis. Compartmental analysis was used for the determination of plasma PK parameters for cobalt using commercially available software. Results On administration of a vitamin B12/cobalt supplement, the ratio of cobalt to vitamin B12 in plasma rapidly increased to approximately 3 and then rapidly declined below a ratio of 1 and then back to near baseline over the next week. On administration of 100 mg cobalt chloride, the ratio initially exceeded 10 in plasma and then declined with the lower 95% confidence interval remaining above a ratio of 1 for 7 days. For two horses with extended sampling, the plasma ratio remained above one for approximately 28 days after cobalt chloride administration. The effect of the administration of the vitamin B12/cobalt supplement on the urine ratio was transient and reached a peak value of 10 which then rapidly declined. However, a urine ratio of 10 was exceeded, with the lower 95% confidence interval remaining above a ratio of 10 for 7 days after cobalt chloride administration. For the two horses with extended sampling, the urine ratio remained above 10 for about 18 days (442 h) after cobalt chloride administration even though the absolute cobalt urine concentration had dropped below the international threshold of 100 ng/mL after 96 h. Main limitations Only one vitamin B12/cobalt product was evaluated, a limited number of horses were included, the horses were not in full race training and the results may be specific to this population of horses. Conclusions The results provide the basis for a potential strategy for allowing supplementation with vitamin B12 products, while controlling the misuse of high doses of cobalt, through a combination of international thresholds and ratios of cobalt to vitamin B12, in plasma and urine.
