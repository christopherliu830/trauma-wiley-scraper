AB  - ABSTRACT 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP or fampridine) is a potassium channel-blocking agent that has been shown to restore conduction in focally demyelinated axons. A sustained-release matrix tablet form of 4-AP (fampridine-SR) is currently undergoing multicenter clinical trials in patients with multiple sclerosis or chronic spinal cord injury. This review describes the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of 4-AP, its pharmacokinetics in human subjects, and the outcomes of clinical trials employing either immediate-release or sustained-release formulations of the drug. The randomized clinical trials that have been completed to date indicate that K+ channel blockade may prove to be a useful strategy for ameliorating central conduction deficits due to demyelination. Diverse neurological gains have been reported for both motor and sensory domains. At the present time, however, the clinical trials have not provided sufficiently robust or definitive evidence of efficacy to gain regulatory approval for the symptomatic management of patients with either multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.

AB  - Three radiolabeled diphosphonates, 99mTc-labeled 1-hydroxy-3-(2-propyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (PIPrDP), 1-hydroxy-4-(2-propyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)butane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (PIBDP), and 1-hydroxy-5-(2-propyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)pentane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (PIPeDP), have been designed and synthesized with good chemical yields and high radiochemical purity. Their in vitro and in vivo biological properties were investigated and compared. All radiotracers evaluated in mice showed substantial retention in bone (8.42?±?0.53, 9.08?±?0.65, and 10.3?±?0.61 ID%/g, respectively) at 1?h post-injection and had rapid clearance in blood (1.9484, 1.3666, and 0.7704 ID%/g/min, respectively). 99mTc-PIBDP has the highest uptake ratio of bone-to-soft tissue at 1?h post-injection among the three radiotracers. The results indicate that 99mTc-PIBDP is the most promising bone imaging agent. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are the gold standard in cases of massive hemorrhage, but induce hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury, a serious complication associated with hemorrhage and RBC resuscitation. Thus, the development of a novel resuscitable fluid that is not associated with hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury would be desirable. It was reported that exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) treatment ameliorated hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury accompanying liver transplantation. This suggests that transfusions with CO-bound RBC (CO-RBC) might protect against hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury following massive hemorrhage and resuscitation compared with RBC resuscitation. To investigate this, we created a hemorrhagic shock model rat, followed by resuscitation with RBC and CO-RBC. Hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury and the destruction of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) were significantly ameliorated in the CO-RBC resuscitation group compared with the RBC resuscitation group. The free heme derived from the destruction of hepatic CYP was correlated with hepatic oxidation and injury, suggesting that CO-RBC was a major factor in the amelioration of hepatic ischemia?reperfusion injury induced by hemorrhage and resuscitation via hepatic CYP protection. These results indicate that CO-RBC has potential for use as a resuscitative fluid in blood transfusion and does not suffer from the limitations associated with the RBC transfusions that are currently in use. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103:2199?2206, 2014

AB  - Abstract Objective Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is one of the major existential unmet needs of cancer survivors. Due to growing availability of evidenced-based interventions for high FCR, valid and reliable brief measures of FCR are needed. This study aimed to validate the 6-item Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) and to establish a cut-off score for high FCR. Methods Participants in this study were 1033 cancer survivors and patients recruited as part of 5 existing studies on FCR involving patients and survivors with gastro-intestinal stromal tumors, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. De-identified data of the CWS, Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), Impact of Event Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 were amalgamated for the analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis of the CWS was performed. Sensitivity and specificity were tested with the FCRI as gold standard. Results Results confirmed that the 6-item version of the CWS maintained good construct validity, convergent and divergent validity, and high internal consistency (α 0.90). The optimal cut-off for the 6-item CWS was 9 versus 10 using the 12 vs 13 FCRI-SF score (sensitivity 82%, specificity 83%) and the 15 vs 16 FCRI-SF score (sensitivity 88%, specificity 73%). Using the highest FCRI-SF cut-off (21 vs 22), the optimal CWS cut-off was 11 vs 12 (sensitivity 88%, specificity 81%). Conclusions The present results provide researchers and clinicians with a brief valid and reliable measure of FCR which is suitable for measuring FCR in cancer patients and survivors.
