AB  - Abstract Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and haemophilia A (HA) lack, to varying degrees, the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that are critical for normal haemostasis. These conditions in turn make patients prone to uncontrolled bleeding. Historically, patients with severe forms of VWD or HA were crippled before adulthood and their life expectancy was significantly reduced. Over the past decades, specific coagulation factor replacement therapies including Haemate?P, have been developed to help patients achieve and maintain normal haemostasis. Haemate?P is a human, plasma-derived VWF/FVIII medicinal product, which was first licensed in Germany in 1981 for the treatment of HA-associated bleeding. It has since then come to be accepted as the gold standard for both the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in VWD, especially in cases where desmopressin [1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP)] has been ineffective. Haemate?P was the first effectively virus-inactivated (pasteurisation: 60°C for 10?h in aqueous solution) FVIII product, whereby the risk of potentially threatening infective complications of plasma-derived products was reduced. Haemate?P was also shown to have a VWF multimer profile remarkably close to that of normal plasma. This bibliographic review presents previously unpublished clinical data of Haemate?P, based upon internal clinical study reports of the proprietor, CSL Behring, in addition to data already presented in other publications. The data demonstrate a predictable and well-characterised pharmacokinetic profile, and a proven record of short- and long-term safety, while effectively correcting the haemostatic defects in VWD and HA. Recently available data have also shown Haemate?P to be of haemostatic value in exceptional clinical circumstances including surgical interventions. By virtue of its plasma-derived combination of VWF and FVIII, in addition to its high VWF:FVIII content ratio (2.4:1), Haemate?P is also associated with successful immune tolerance induction in those patients developing inhibitor antibodies. Although the theoretical risk of thromboembolic complications does exist while receiving Haemate?P, as it does with any FVIII replacement therapy, the incidence of such complications has remained notably low. Given the robust data that have accumulated for the use of Haemate?P, dosing recommendations are also described in this review; the recommendations are tailored to patient-specific contexts including baseline VWF and FVIII levels in plasma and the type of surgical intervention being undertaken. A wide variety of studies have also provided data on paediatric and geriatric populations, all of which have suggested that Haemate?P can be safely and effectively used in a wide variety of clinical circumstances.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes a variety of ways of approaching clinical significance and the interpretation of results. It elucidates methods aimed at providing familiarity of scale scores and understanding the meaning of changes in scores. The chapter explains the use of population-based reference values from healthy individuals and from groups of patients with known health status and various illnesses. Patient-orientated methods include the identification of the minimal changes in PROs that are discernible by patients or are important to patients, the impact of quality of life (QoL) states upon behaviour, and the changes in QoL which are caused by major life events. Data-derived effect sizes , which consider the random variability of the observed data, provide yet another method and can be particularly useful when reference values and patient-orientated information are not available.

AB  - Abstract Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, levels of increased CSF tau protein and decreased levels of ?-amyloid 1?42 (A?42) have been shown to correlate with brain plaque formation and tangle pathology. Intracellular Lewy inclusions containing aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) represent a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In most ? but not all ? studies published to date total CSF α-syn concentrations have been found to be decreased in disorders related to α-syn pathology, that is, PD, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. However, these reports show extensive signal overlap among tested individuals, thereby diminishing its potential for routine use in clinical practice. To investigate potential biological (i.e., non-technical) confounders of reported CSF levels for α-syn, A?42, and tau in PD and related disorders, we carried out a methodical review of known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. We discuss several biological factors, such as neuropathology, demographics, clinical phenotype, progression and duration of disease, concomitant illnesses and, last but not least, pharmacotherapy, which in isolation or combination can substantially alter values for CSF proteins of interest. Enhanced implementation of standardized clinical protocols, streamlined operating procedures, and further progress in the development of validated assays for CSF proteins have the potential to (i) inform us as to the pathogenesis of disease, (ii) support the laboratory-based diagnosis for symptomatic subjects in the future, and (iii) facilitate breakthrough therapies to alter the course of neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been extensively studied to explore biochemical alterations in subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate potential biological confounders of reported CSF levels for α-synuclein (α-Syn), amyloid-? 1-42(A?42) and tau protein in Parkinson's disease and related disorders, we reviewed the current literature for known factors that underlie signal variability and speculate on those that have not yet been tested. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.
