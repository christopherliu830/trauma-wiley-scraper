AB  - Abstract This study examined the operating characteristics of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as a screen for ?at-risk? drinking in a multi-ethnic sample of primary care patients, from a family practice center located in the southwestern United States. A probability sample of 1333 family medicine patients, stratified by gender and racial/ethnic background (white, African-American and Mexican-American) completed the AUDIT, followed by the Alcohol Use Disorders and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule (AUDADIS) to determine ICD-10 diagnoses. Indicators of hazardous alcohol use and alcohol-related problems were included as measures of ?at-risk? drinking. Despite differences in the spectrum of alcohol problems across patient subgroups, there was no evidence of gender or racial/ethnic bias in the AUDIT as indicated by Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve analysis. Excluding abstainers from the analysis had little impact on screening efficacy. In this patient population, the A UDIT appears to be an unbiased measure of ?at-risk? drinking.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - Objective To investigate local and systemic pharmacokinetics of gentamicin after intra-articular implantation of a gentamicin impregnated collagen sponge (GICS) in the inflamed canine joint. Study Design Descriptive repeated measures experimental study. Animals Dogs (n?=?9). Methods Stifle joint inflammation was caused by urate injection. Twenty-four hours later a GICS (gentamicin dose, 6?mg/kg) was arthroscopically implanted. Synovial fluid and plasma gentamicin concentrations were measured for 14 days after implantation, and pharmacokinetic parameters modeled using statistical moment analyses. Results Intra-articular gentamicin concentrations fell to sub-MIC for Staphylococcus sp. (4?µg/mL) by 22.4?hours (95% CI: 18.6?26.2) after sponge implantation. Cmax synovial was 2397?µg/mL (95%CI: 1161?3634?µg/mL) at 1.2?hours (95%CI: 0.5?1.8?hours). Plasma gentamicin concentrations achieved levels of Cmax plasma?=?8.0?µg/mL (95%CI: 6.1?10.0?µg/mL) at 1.5?hours (95%CI: 0.8?2.1) after GICS placement and fell below target trough of 2.0?µg/mL by 5.6?hours (95%CI: 4.7?6.5?hours) after GICS placement. Conclusions Intra-articular gentamicin concentration after GICS placement at an IV-equivalent dose reached high levels and declined rapidly. The maximum plasma levels attained were ?1/3 of the recommended sub-toxic target for people after parenteral gentamicin administration.

AB  - Abstract Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the most common causes of neonatal bowel obstruction. Without an early screening and diagnosis, some patients develop serious complications, such as toxic megacolon or acute enterocolitis. We sought to identify specific serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can serve as novel early, non-invasive screening signature and then to test their specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. We obtained serum samples from 95 HSCR cases and 104 matched controls. An initial screening of miRNA expression was performed through TaqMan Low Density Array. The candidate miRNAs were validated by individual reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR arranged in the training and a two-stage validation set. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 23 patients with clinically suspected HSCR to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the serum miRNA profile in predicting HSCR. Following a multi-stage evaluation approach, five miRNAs were significantly increased in HSCR cases compared with controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this five-serum miRNA signature were 0.895, 0.893 and 0.925 in training set and two validation sets, respectively. The accuracy rate of the five-miRNA profile as HSCR signature was 82.6%, which, in the double-blind testing set, was markedly higher than that of contrast enema (70%), the most commonly used test performed to diagnose HSCR. Our results indicate that a five-serum miRNA signature may be linked to HSCR, representing a potential, novel, non-invasive diagnostic approach for early screening of HSCR.

AB  - Objectives Considerable variation has been reported in the prevalence and correlates of challenging behaviour (CB) in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). To provide a robust estimate of prevalence, we identified the entire administrative population of adults with ID in a defined geographical area and used a behaviour assessment tool with good psychometric properties. Methods Data from 265 adults who were known to services were collected using a demographic survey tool and the Behavior Problems Inventory ? Short Form. The prevalence of self-injurious, aggressive/destructive, stereotyped, and overall CB was evaluated. We explored the potential of developing cumulative risk indices (CRI) to inform longitudinal research and clinical practice. Results The prevalence of overall CB was 18.1% (95% CI: 13.94?23.19%). The prevalence of self-injurious behaviour was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.94?11.37%), aggressive?destructive behaviour 8.3% (95% CI: 5.54?12.25%), and stereotyped behaviour 10.9% (95% CI: 7.73?15.27%). Communication problems and severity of ID were consistently associated with higher risk of CBs. CRIs were significantly associated with CBs, and the five methods of CRI development produced similar results. Conclusions Findings suggest a multi-element response to CB is likely to be required that includes interventions for communication and daytime activity. Exploratory analyses of CRIs suggested these show promise as simple ways to capture cumulative risk in this population. Subject to longitudinal replication, such a tool may be especially useful in clinical practice to identify adults who are priority for interventions and predict future demand on services. Practitioner points The prevalence of challenging behaviour (CB) was 18.1% in this total population study. Stereotypy was the most frequent type of CB. Communication difficulties and severe-profound intellectual disabilities were most systematically related to the presence of CB. Establishing the effect of multiple risk factors is likely to identify people who are priority for interventions. Addressing multiple, rather than singular risks, is likely to be more efficacious. We tested five different methods of putting together a multiple risk index. All methods provided a reasonable association with CB. The most user-friendly method was the additive cumulative risk index (CRI). Limitations This is a cross-sectional design which enabled factors currently associated with CB to be identified for the whole cohort, but these variables may not be those conferring risk for the development or maintenance of CB over time. Future longitudinal research is required to replicate these CRI analyses before concluding about the CRI method with the highest predictive validity.

AB  - Purpose Unlike conventional MR spectroscopy (MRS), which only measures metabolite concentrations, multiparametric MRS also quantifies their longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, as well as the radiofrequency transmitter inhomogeneity (B1+). To test whether knowledge of these additional parameters can improve the clinical utility of brain MRS, we compare the conventional and multiparametric approaches in terms of expected classification accuracy in differentiating controls from patients with neurological disorders. Theory and Methods A literature review was conducted to compile metabolic concentrations and relaxation times in a wide range of neuropathologies and regions of interest. Simulations were performed to construct receiver operating characteristic curves and compute the associated areas (area under the curve) to examine the sensitivity and specificity of MRS for detecting each pathology in each region. Classification accuracy was assessed using metabolite concentrations corrected using population-averages for T1, T2, and B1+ (conventional MRS); using metabolite concentrations corrected using per-subject values (multiparametric MRS); and using an optimal linear multiparametric estimator comprised of the metabolites' concentrations and relaxation constants (multiparametric MRS). Additional simulations were conducted to find the minimal intra-subject precision needed for each parameter. Results Compared with conventional MRS, multiparametric approaches yielded area under the curve improvements for almost all neuropathologies and regions of interest. The median area under the curve increased by 0.14 over the entire dataset, and by 0.24 over the 10 instances with the largest individual increases. Conclusions Multiparametric MRS can substantially improve the clinical utility of MRS in diagnosing and assessing brain pathology, motivating the design and use of novel multiparametric sequences.

AB  - Objective? To estimate maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma (tmax) bupivacaine concentration after intra-articular administration of bupivacaine for single injection (SI) and injection followed by continuous infusion (CI) in normal dogs. Study Design? Cross-over design with a 2-week washout period. Animals? Healthy Coon Hound dogs (n=8). Methods? Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, canine plasma bupivacaine concentration was measured before and after SI (1.5?mg/kg) and CI (1.5?mg/kg and 0.3?mg/kg/h). Software was used to establish plasma concentration?time curves and estimate Cmax, Tmax and other pharmacokinetic variables for comparison of SI and CI. Results? Bupivacaine plasma concentration after SI and CI best fit a 3 exponential model. For SI, mean maximum concentration (Cmax, 1.33±0.954??g/mL) occurred at 11.37±4.546 minutes. For CI, mean Cmax (1.13±0.509??g/mL) occurred at 10.37±4.109 minutes. The area under the concentration?time curve was smaller for SI (143.59±118.390??g/mL ? min) than for CI (626.502±423.653??g/mL ? min, P=.02) and half-life was shorter for SI (61.33±77.706 minutes) than for CI (245.363±104.415 minutes, P=.01). The highest plasma bupivacaine concentration for any dog was 3.2??g/mL for SI and 2.3??g/mL for CI. Conclusion? Intra-articular bupivacaine administration results in delayed absorption from the stifle into the systemic circulation with mean Cmax below that considered toxic and no systemic drug accumulation. Clinical Relevance? Intra-articular bupivacaine can be administered with small risk of reaching toxic plasma concentrations in dogs, though toxic concentrations may be approached. Caution should be exercised with multimodal bupivacaine administration because plasma drug concentration may rise higher than with single intra-articular injection.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Abstract Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), a racemic mixture, is a biologically active ingredient isolated from a traditional Chinese herb Rhizoma Corydalis (yanhusuo). The main objective of this study was to determine the brain pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of THP enantiomers in rats after oral administration of racemic THP (rac-THP). Rats (5 animals/group/per time) were given a single oral dose of rac-THP and killed after different post-treatment times. The concentrations of THP enantiomers in plasma, cortex, cerebellum, diencephalon, brain stem, striatum and hippocampus were measured using a validated chiral high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method coupled with an achiral column. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the two enantiomers in six brain regions were significantly different. The peak concentrations (Cmax) and AUC0?∞ values of the (?)-enantiomer were significantly greater than the corresponding values for the (+)-enantiomer while the striatum contained the highest peak concentrations compared with the plasma and other brain regions. The tissue distribution studies also revealed significant differences between the two enantiomers in all tissues except the lung. The highest concentrations of both enantiomers were found in the liver. The (?)/(+)-THP ratios in six brain regions and other tissues were consistent with that observed in plasma indicating that the stereoselective disposition of THP in rat brain and other tissues reflects the situation in plasma.

AB  - Objective To investigate whether preoperative methadone provides superior perioperative analgesia compared to buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Methods Eighty female dogs were recruited to an assessor-blinded, randomised, clinical trial. Dogs received a premedication dose of 0·05?mg/kg acepromazine or 10 ?g/kg medetomidine combined with either 0·3 mg/kg methadone or 20??g/kg buprenorphine intramuscularly. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Pain was assessed using two scoring schemes (a dynamic interactive visual analogue scale and the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale) before premedication, 30?minutes later and every hour for 8 hours after premedication. If indicated, rescue analgesia was provided with methadone. Meloxicam was administered after the final assessment. The area under the curve for change in pain scores over time and the requirement for rescue analgesia were compared between groups. Results Groups premedicated with buprenorphine had significantly higher pain scores than those premedicated with methadone. There was no interaction between opioid and sedative for any outcome measure. Rescue analgesia was required by significantly more dogs premedicated with buprenorphine (45%) than that of methadone (20%). Clinical Significance At the doses investigated, methadone produced superior postoperative analgesia compared to buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.
