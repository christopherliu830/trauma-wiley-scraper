AB  - Background:? The aims of this cohort study were to assess the survival of trauma patients treated in a general intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, injury severity score (ISS), age, sex and severe head injury as predictors of 30-day mortality. Methods:? Three hundred and twenty-five adult patients admitted during 1998?2003 were evaluated retrospectively with update of survival data in January 2005. Kaplan?Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to study survival and to assess predictors of mortality, respectively. Results:? The 30-day mortality was 16.9%, ICU mortality 13.8% and hospital mortality 17.8%. Long-term survival (observation time, 1?7 years) was 77.8%. After 3.5 years, mortality was the same as for the background population. Severe head injury was the main cause of death and increased the risk of 30-day mortality 2.4-fold. In addition, SAPS II and an age above 50 years proved to be significant predictors of mortality in a multivariate analysis. Sex was not associated with mortality, and ISS and the maximum SOFA score were significant predictors in univariate analyses only. Conclusion:? Reduced long-term survival was observed up to 3.5 years after acute injury. The 30-day mortality was strongly related to severe head injury, SAPS II and an age above 50 years. These variables may be useful as predictors of mortality, and may contribute to risk adjustment of this subset of trauma patients when treatment results from different centres are compared.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Background This study strives to define prognostic models for outcome after surgery for malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Methods Forty-one patients were included. Prognostic models for mortality and disease recurrence were developed with multivariate binary logistic regression. Results The proposed prognostic model for tumor recurrence risk after surgery in percentage (AUROC?=?0.774, 95%CI?=?0.611?0.937) is: Risk in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??4.360?+?(0.015???tumor diameter in cm)?+?(0.010???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(1.077???distant metastases, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0)?+?(?0.026???Ki-67-positive cells in %)?+?(?1.086???upper abdominal pain, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0). The proposed prognostic model for observed 3-year survival probability after surgery in % (AUROC?=?0.932, 95%CI?=?0.857?0.999) is: Survival probability in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??12.492?+?(0.054???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(0.112???minimal distance of the resection margin from the tumor in mm)?+?(?1.574???number of positive lymph nodes)?+?(2.292???histological tumor infiltration, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0) Conclusions The platelet count was identified as a relevant risk factor. Proposed prognostic models with good model-fit display properties that indicate potential clinical usefulness. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:194?202. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

AB  - Objective To identify incidence and risk factors for surgical glove perforation in small animal surgery. Study Design Observational cohort study. Sample Population Surgical gloves (n?=?2132) worn in 363 surgical procedures. Methods All gloves worn by operative personnel were assessed for perforation at end-procedure using a water leak test. Putative risk factors were recorded by a surgical team member. Associations between risk factors and perforation were assessed using multivariable multi-level random-effects logistic regression models to control for hierarchical data structure. Results At least 1 glove perforation occurred in 26.2% of procedures. Identified risk factors for glove perforation included increased surgical duration (surgery >1?hour OR?=?1.79, 95% CI?=?1.12?2.86), performing orthopedic procedures (OR?=?1.88; 95% CI?=?1.23?2.88), any procedure using powered instruments (OR?=?1.93; 95% CI?=?1.21?3.09) or surgical wire (OR?=?3.02; 95% CI?=?1.50?6.05), use of polyisoprene as a glove material (OR?=?1.59, 95% CI?=?1.05?2.39), and operative role as primary surgeon (OR?=?2.01; 95% CI?=?1.35?2.98). The ability of the wearer to detect perforations intraoperatively was poor, with a sensitivity of 30.8%. Conclusions There is a high incidence of unrecognized glove perforations in small animal surgery.

AB  - Background Hematoma expansion confers excess mortality in intracerebral haemorrhage, and is potentially preventable if at-risk patients can be identified. Contrast extravasation on initial computed tomographic angiography strongly predicts hematoma expansion but is not very sensitive, and most centers have not yet integrated computed tomographic angiography into acute intracerebral haemorrhage management. We therefore asked whether other presentation variables can predict hematoma expansion. Methods We searched the electronic medical records of a large integrated healthcare delivery system to identify patients with a hospitalization discharge diagnosis of intracerebral haemorrhage between the years 2008 and 2010. Hematoma expansion was defined as radiographic increase by 1/3 or by 12·5?ml within 48?h of presentation. Pre-specified patient demographic and clinical presentation variables were extracted. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was performed to model hematoma expansion. Because some patients may have died from hematoma expansion without a second head computed tomography, we constructed a separate model including patients that died without a second head computed tomography in 48?h, hematoma expansion or death. Results Ninety-one of 257 patients (35%) had hematoma expansion. Antithrombotic use (odds ratio?=?1·9, P?=?0·04) and initial mNIHSS (modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; odds ratio?=?1·06, P?=?0·001) were significant predictors in the hematoma expansion model (area under the Receiver?Operator Characteristics curve, AUROC?=?0·6712, pseudo-r2?=?0·0641). 163 of 343 patients (48%) had hematoma expansion or death. Age (odds ratio?=?1·02, P?=?0·02), initial mNIHSS (odds ratio?=?1·07, P?<?0·001), and initial hematoma volume (odds ratio?=?1·01, P?=?0·03) were significant predictors of hematoma expansion or death (AUROC?=?0·7579, pseudo-r2?=?0·1722). Conclusion Clinical and noncontrast radiographic variables only weakly predict hematoma expansion. Examination of other indicators, such as computed tomographic angiography contrast extravasation (the ?spot sign?), may prove more valuable in acute intracerebral haemorrhage care.
