AB  - Abstract Older people are increasingly utilising emergency services, often at the end of their life. This scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of available research regarding end-of-life (EOL) care for older people in the ED. The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology guided this review. Databases of CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, SocINDEX and Google Scholar were searched using a combination of terms, including older/aged/geriatrics/elderly, palliative/terminal/end-of-life and emergency/emergency service. The search was limited to articles published in English from 2007 to 2018. The level of evidence of included articles was assessed using the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) criteria. Fourteen articles were included. Definitions pertaining to EOL care in the ED vary. Older people presenting to ED at EOL were mostly female, triaged in urgent or semi-urgent category, presented with diagnoses of advanced cancer, cardiac and pulmonary disease, and dementia with symptoms including pain and breathlessness. Multiple tools pertaining to EOL exist and range from predicting mortality, and assessing functional status, co-morbidities, symptom distress, palliative care needs, quality of life and caregiver's stress. Outcomes for older people enrolled in specific EOL intervention programmes included lower admission rates, shorter ED length of stay, increased palliative care referral and consultations, and decreased Medicare costs. The NHMRC evidence level of included articles ranged from II to IV. Limited evidence exists regarding the definition, clinical profile, care delivery and outcomes for older people requiring EOL care in the ED. Future research and clinical practice that uses current evidenced-based policies and guidelines is required.

AB  - Summary Pancreas donor selection and recognition are important to cope with increasing organ shortage. We aim to show that the PDRI is more useful than the P-PASS to predict acceptance and should thus be preferred over P-PASS. Eurotransplant donors from 2004 until 2014 were included in this study. PDRI logistical factors were set to reference to purely reflect donor quality (PDRI donor). PDRI and P-PASS association with allocation outcome was studied using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Regional differences in donor quality were also investigated. Of the 10 444 pancreata that were reported, 6090 (58.3%) were accepted and 2947 (28.2%) were transplanted. We found that P-PASS was inferior to PDRIdonor in its ability to predict organ reporting, acceptance, and transplantation: AUC 0.63, 0.67 and 0.73 for P-PASS vs. 0.78, 0.79 and 0.84 for PDRIdonor, respectively. Furthermore, there were significant differences in donor quality among different Eurotransplant countries, both in reported donors and in transplanted organs. PDRI is a powerful predictor of allocation outcome and should be preferred over P-PASS. Proper donor selection and recognition, and possibly a more liberal approach toward inferior quality donors, may increase donation and transplant rates.

AB  - ABSTRACT Decreased lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS), a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived image texture measurement, is a risk factor for major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) independent of 10-year fracture probability estimated using FRAX. We determined how often applying the TBS adjustment to fracture probability altered treatment qualification. Using a population-based registry containing all clinical DXA results for Manitoba, Canada, we identified 34,316 women with baseline spine and hip DXA, FRAX-based fracture probability measurements (computed with femoral neck bone mineral density), lumbar spine TBS, and minimum 5 years of observation (mean 8.7 years). Population-based health services data were used to identify incident non-traumatic MOF and HF in 3503 and 945 women, respectively. Baseline MOF and HF probabilities were estimated using FRAX before and after applying the TBS adjustment. Risk recategorization was assessed using net reclassification improvement (NRI) for individual FRAX-based intervention criteria and three national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) (US National Osteoporosis Foundation, Osteoporosis Canada, and UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group). Overall, proportions of women reclassified with the TBS adjustment to FRAX were small (less than 5%) with more than 90% of the reclassification occurring close to the intervention threshold. For women close to an intervention cut-off reclassification, rates ranged from 9.0% to 17.9% and were <1% otherwise. There was a small but significant improvement in overall NRI for all individual FRAX-based intervention criteria (range 0.007 to 0.018) and all three national CPGs (range 0.008 to 0.011). NRI was larger in women below age 65 years (up to 0.056 for hip fracture). In summary, a small but significant improvement in MOF and HF risk assessment was found by using lumbar spine TBS to adjust FRAX probability. An improvement in risk reclassification was observed for CPGs from three different countries, with almost all of the benefit found in individuals close to an intervention threshold. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Summary The most common cause of late kidney transplant failure is chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Much research has focused on identifying biomarkers (or correlates) that would predict subsequent CAN and allow timely intervention. Functional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have been widely adopted, even though they have not been rigorously evaluated as surrogate markers. This study evaluated serum creatinine and eGFR for predicting the early histopathological changes seen in transplant protocol biopsies (TPB). We prospectively followed 289 kidney transplant patients in the Southern Alberta Transplant Program who had TPB at 6?12?months post-transplant. Tissue samples (n?=?280) were independently examined by renal pathologists. The ability of serum creatinine or eGFR to predict the threshold level for abnormal histopathology was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Serum creatinine and eGFR had poor predictive value (most confidence intervals included 0.5, indicating no predictive ability) for ten individual histological measurements (Banff 97 scores), and the Chronic Allograft Damage Index. We conclude that serum creatinine and eGFR have a limited clinical role in predicting the early histopathological changes that precede CAN and should not be used for this purpose.
