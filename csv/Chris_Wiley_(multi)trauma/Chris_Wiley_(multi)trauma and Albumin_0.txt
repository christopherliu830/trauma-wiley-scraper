AB  - A decrease in serum albumin concentrations is an almost inevitable finding in disease states, and is primarily mediated in the acute phase by alterations in vascular permeability and redistribution. This change is not disease specific but marked changes that persist are generally associated with a poorer prognosis. Critical appraisal of long-standing practices and the availability of alternative colloid solutions have led to a reduction in albumin replacement therapy, and a widespread tolerance of lower albumin concentrations in patients. The factors determining serum albumin concentrations, their measurement and the implications of hypoalbuminaemia are reviewed. The clinical value of serum albumin measurement is discussed.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To report on the use of 25% human serum albumin (25% HSA) (Plasbumin?), associated outcome, and efficacy in raising serum albumin and systemic blood pressure (BP) in critically ill dogs and cats. Design: Retrospective clinical study. Animals: Client-owned cats and dogs. Interventions: Administration of 25% HSA. Measurements and main results: The medical records of 66 animals (64 dogs, 2 cats) at the Ontario Veterinary College, which received 25% HSA (Plasbumin?) from June 1997 to December 2001 were reviewed for age, body weight, clinical problems, albumin and globulin (g/L) levels pre- and within 18-hour post-transfusion and upon discharge from hospital, total solids (TS), systolic and diastolic BP pre- and post-transfusion total volume administered, adverse reactions, blood products and synthetic colloids used, and outcome. Twenty-five percent HSA was prescribed for a range of clinical problems, which were grouped into 6 categories for analysis. The age range was 4 months?12 years and body weight range 1.4?65?kg. The maximum volume administered to any dog was 25?mL/kg, mean volume administered was 5?mL/kg, maximum volume given as a slow push or bolus was 4?mL/kg with a mean of 2?mL/kg volume. The range for a constant rate infusion (CRI) was 0.1?1.7?mL/kg/hr over 4?72 hours. Forty-seven (71%) animals survived to discharge; 11(16%) were euthanized, and 8 (12%) died. Serum albumin and TS increased significantly (P<0.0001) above pre-transfusion levels as did systolic BP (P<0.01). Conclusions: Twenty-five percent HSA can be safely administered to critically ill animals, and an increase in albumin levels and systemic BP can be expected.

AB  - Abstract? Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is hampered by the scant therapeutic options available to the practicing physician. Albumin dialysis has been proposed to improve the management of such patients, by removing both water-soluble and protein bound toxins. A recently completed trial of albumin dialysis in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy offers the opportunity to evaluate the role of such a therapy. Such patients had encephalopathy associated with acute-on-chronic liver failure rather than the result of precipitant-induced changes in mental state. In this entity, improvement in encephalopathy may also require correction of the hemodynamic changes associated with liver failure.

The basic method and mechanism(s) of preparation of albumin microspheres and subsequent modifications made to overcome the drawbacks of earlier approaches and the need for further developments are discussed, as are the processing parameters and the level of various ingredients affecting the physicochemical properties of the albumin microspheres. Different equations proposed by various investigators to modulate in vitro release kinetics are reviewed. The microscopic structural and surface properties, the chemical modification of the biopolymer (e.g., cationization, tagging with amino acids and sugar moieties) for tissue specificity or to influence the release profile and biodegradation are discussed. An array of potential diagnostic applications and the use of albumin microspheres as a drug delivery system are reviewed. Drug Dev. Res. 58:219?247, 2003.? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) is sometimes necessary in patients with a bleeding risk, i.e., before/after surgery or brain hemorrhage. In such case IHD has to be modified to limit the conventional anticoagulation used to avoid clotting of the extracorporeal circuit (ECC). We evaluated if priming using a heparin and albumin (HA) mixture could minimize the exposure to heparin. Methods: Retrospective data from 1995 to 2013 were collected from 1408 acute dialysis treatment protocols that included 321 patients. Comparisons were made between IHD patients that had increased risk for bleeding and were treated by standard anticoagulation (Group-S), and patients at increased risk of bleeding (Group-HA). The ECC in Group-HA was primed with a solution of unfractioned heparin (UFH) (5000 Units/L) and albumin (1 g/L) in saline that was discarded after priming. There were 16 different dialyzers in the material. Findings: Comparing Group-S (n?=?883) with Group-HA (n?=?221), the mean age was 61.6 vs. 62.2 years (P?=?0.8), dialysis time was 197 vs. 190 minutes (P?=?0.002), and total dose of intravenous anticoagulant/IHD was at median 5000 Units vs. 1200 Units (P?=?0.001). Twenty-four percent of patients were treated without any additional heparin. Clotting resulting in interrupted dialysis was similar in both groups (0.8% for Group-S vs. 1.0% for Group-HA, P?=?0.8). No secondary bleeding was reported in either group. Discussion: HA priming minimized the risk of clotting and enabled acute IHD in vulnerable patients without increased bleeding, thus allowing completion of IHD to the same extent as for standard HD.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

On computed tomographic examination, lesions within the pituitary fossa and structures adjacent to the right guttural pouch were identified. Soft tissue swelling was seen in the dorsal aspect of the right guttural pouch surrounding several cranial nerves, with fluid-like material in the dependent portions of the right guttural pouch. A CSF sample revealed mild mixed pleocytosis and increased protein concentration. The horse had concurrent periapical disease of the 209-cheek tooth and mild left sinusitis. The horse's demeanour deteriorated requiring euthanasia. Post-mortem examination revealed a pituitary gland abscess.

AB  - Abstract. In order to explain the pathogenesis of protein depletion in chronic uraemia, 13 measurements of albumin catabolism were performed in uraemic patients undergoing haemo- or peritoneal dialysis treatment; during either the early phase or steady uraemic state. Catabolism was determined during a single haemo- or peritoneal dialysis by a double tracer technique (Human Serum Albumin and sodium iodide labelled with two different isotopes of iodine). The output from both albumin and iodine systems was measured in the dialysis solution flowing out from the peritoneum or artificial kidney. The radioactive iodide arising in dialysate from albumin breakdown was concentrated by the use of an anion exchange resin. Catabolic rate was three times the normal in 3 patients showing clinical features of hypercatabolism (true rapid loss of body weight) in the early phase of uraemia, or during relapse of it; albumin turnover rate returned to normal in 2 of these patients, when measured during clinical steady state conditions. This behaviour suggests highly increased catabolism, not counterbalanced by a correspondingly increased synthesis, as the cause of albumin depletion in chronic uraemia.

AB  - Abstract The influence of temperature on the stability of human serum albumin (HSA) pharmaceutical preparations has been studied by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with multi-angle laser-light-scattering detection and by particle-size analysis. The behaviour of HSA in two pharmaceutical preparations stored at different temperatures (40, 55 and 70°C) followed the same pattern?an increase in the relative percentage of dimer (MW 132 000 Da) and aggregate (MW > 200 000 Da), and then a decrease in the concentration of all species and, finally, sudden protein coagulation. These results suggest a time- and temperature-dependent process. At 70°C, monomer only was detected for both preparations; the amount remaining was 83 and 72% for formulations A and B, respectively. Analysis of size-distribution curves also seems to confirm these results. Initially, three distributions were observed with length-volume mean diameters (dl,v)of 1.67, 10.6 and 57 ?m. After 80 days at 55°C, only two distributions were observed, with dl,v of 3.07 and 76 ?m. An additional study using pure HSA at different concentrations (0.3, 2.5, 5 and 10% w/v) and storage at 75°C was performed to determine the influence of the concentration of auxiliary substances and of the HSA. Only when the HSA concentration was 0.3% w/v did the remaining fraction of HSA fit a Prout-Thompkins nucleation model. Initially three distributions with mean sizes of 2, 20 and 40 ?m were observed whereas at the end of the assay only one distribution, mean size 129 ?m, was seen. The methodology used enabled us to separate the HSA degradation products and to determine the absolute molecular weight of albumin monomer and dimer. It is possible to conclude that the degradation mechanism for the formulations studied is complex, and that it is possible to fit the degradation data to Prout-Thompkins kinetics only when the concentration of HSA is low enough (0.3% w/v).

AB  - Background Shock and severe tissue injury lead to an endogenous coagulopathy mediated by activation of Protein C and hyperfibrinolysis known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Together, hemodilution, acidosis, inflammation, and hypothermia result in a global trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy in trauma is associated with mortality. Early and effective hemostatic resuscitation is critical in restoring perfusion, correcting coagulopathy, and saving lives in exsanguinating trauma. Lyophilized plasma (LP) provides a logistically superior alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Study Design and Methods Plasma was lyophilized following whole blood collection from anesthetized swine. A series of studies were performed using anesthetized swine subjected to a validated model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock including a Grade V liver injury. Animals were randomized to resuscitation using reconstituted LP fluids. Physiologic data and blood loss were measured. Coagulation status and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. Results Full volume reconstituted LP (100%LP) retains on average 86% coagulation factor activity compared to fresh plasma and when used in 1:1 ratios with red blood cells demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy compared to FFP. Hypertonic LP reconstituted using 50% of the original plasma volume (50%LP) had higher coagulation factor concentrations, was well tolerated in swine, and equally effective compared to 100%LP with respect to physiologic and hemostatic properties. Buffering with ascorbic acid resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Conclusion By minimizing the volume of reconstituted LP and optimizing its anti-inflammatory properties, an LP resuscitation fluid may be created to provide effective hemostatic resuscitation with superior logistical properties.

AB  - There have not been dramatic changes in trauma management in recent years. Nevertheless, there are noteworthy developments that might eventually change both paradigms of trauma systems and clinical management. In the present study, organizational aspects of mass casualty scenarios and what we have learned from the experiences of military doctors are examined. Then, the perennial theme of fluid resuscitation; when, what and how much to give, is examined. The management of bleeding and minimization of allogeneic blood transfusions raise the topics of recombinant factor?VIIa and oxygen carrying blood substitutes. Finally, an aspect of intensive care management that is very topical, that of immunonutrition and the modulation of sepsis in intensive care, is examined.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - As a result of the common usage of albumin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions at The Ohio State University Hospitals, a review of the use of this product was performed. Albumin therapy in 18 patients was evaluated using prospective criteria. Therapy was considered appropriate if the serum albumin level was less than or equal to 3.0 g%. Using these criteria, 12 of 18 patients (67%) received albumin in the TPN solution. Of these 12 patients, 7 received albumin unnecessarily. During the 3-week review, a total of 168 vials of 50 ml, 25% albumin (2100 g) were administered to patients with serum albumin concentrations greater than 3.0 g/100 ml at a cost of $6,014. Over a year, this could mean over $100,000 in costs which could be eliminated. Criteria for use of albumin in malnourished patients receiving TPN are not well established. This study demonstrated that developing simple criteria for the prospective review of albumin in TPN solutions and using them to monitor albumin therapy closely, can result in very significant cost savings to patients receiving TPN.

AB  - The overall study goal was to produce a microparticle formulation containing atropine sulfate for ocular administration with improved efficacy and lower side effects, compared with that of the standard marketed atropine solution. The objective was to prepare an atropine sulfate-loaded bovine serum albumin?chitosan microparticle that would have longer contact time on the eyes as well as better mydriatic and cycloplegic effect using a rabbit model. The microparticle formulation was prepared by method of spray-drying technique. The percent drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were assessed using a USP (I) dissolution apparatus. The particle sizes and zeta potential were determined using laser scattering technique and the surface morphology of the microparticles was determined using a scanning electron microscope. The product yield was calculated from relative amount of material used. In vitro cytotoxicity and uptake by human corneal epithelial cells were examined using AlamarBlue and confocal microscopy. The effects of the microparticle formulation on mydriasis in comparison with the marketed atropine sulfate solution were evaluated in rabbit eyes. The prepared microparticle formulation had ideal physicochemical characteristics for delivery into the eyes. The in vivo studies showed that the microparticles had superior effects on mydriasis in rabbits than the marketed solutions ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 104:1677?1690, 2015
