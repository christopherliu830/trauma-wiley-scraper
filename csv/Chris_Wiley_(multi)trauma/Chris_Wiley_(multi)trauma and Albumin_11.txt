AB  - The phenomenon of spontaneous nonimmune rosette formation between human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes has been investigated with respect to its sensitivity to mechanical trauma It is shown that tin percentage of rosettes depends on the strength of the force used to resuspend the lymphocyte-erythrocyte pellet alter incubation but not on the duration of the resuspension procedure Differences between patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia and persons with normal percentages of T lymphocytes are clearly shown when the resuspension force is weak but not when a relatively strong force is used Practical and theoretical aspects of these findings are discussed

AB  - Overview Melanoma comprises a wide variety of malignant cell types arising from the skin, the mucous membranes, and the pigmented cells of the eye. While these tumors are all classified as melanoma and share a common molecular biology of pigmentation and biological resemblance to cells of neural crest origin, important distinctions in other molecular characteristics and patterns of exposure to ultraviolet light as a carcinogen determine their clinical natural history, including the response to therapeutic interventions. While the majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and curable with minimal surgery, melanoma has the potential for early and widespread dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for primary, regional, and many cases of single- or oligo-metastatic disease, but systemic therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis for metastatic melanoma, particularly immunotherapies that enhance existing cellular immunity. The rapid discovery of new molecular targets, immunotherapy combinations (including the use of radiotherapy), and understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance are likely to lead to even greater improvements in the prognosis for patients with melanoma in the near future.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact-finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi-component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non-core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that ?herd immunity? is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non-governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.

AB  - Abstract Background Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a bone metabolism disorder involving systematic inflammation activation. Blood routine examination is easily available in clinical practice and contains abundant information reflecting the systematic inflammation level. Thus, it is attractive to achieve early diagnosis of PMOP and predict osteoporotic fracture risk just based on the biomarkers in blood routine examination. Methods A multi-centric prospective cohort study was designed and enrolled postmenopausal women from two independent institutions. All participants underwent the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for diagnosing PMOP. Blood routine examination was conducted, and the key inflammatory biomarkers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated. PMOP patients were followed up to observe osteoporotic fracture and identify the related risk predictors. Results A total of 92 participants out of 238 enrolled postmenopausal women were diagnosed with PMOP, with a prevalence of 38.66%. The main risk factors identified for PMOP included older age (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.14-3.72), longer menopause duration (OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.06-4.79), higher NLR (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.37-3.25), and higher SII (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.98-4.61). Besides age and menopause duration, SII ≥834.89 was newly identified as a prominent risk factor for discriminating osteoporotic fracture risk in PMOP patients (HR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.249-10.71). Conclusion As an easy and economical biomarker calculated from blood routine examination, SII not only acts as a good risk predictor for PMOP diagnosis but also well discriminates the osteoporotic fracture risk, which deserves further investigation and application in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Summary Large-bore Hickman? catheters are useful in infants and small children for the rapid transfusion of blood or fluids into the central circulation. Recently high-flow plastic sheaths have been developed for the same purpose. We compared the flow rates of normal saline, 5% albumin and packed red blood cells through two sizes of Hickman catheters that have been recommended for major surgery in infants to five sizes of Arrow? plastic sheaths of comparable external diameters, and to 14 and 16 gauge Jelco? catheters. The flow rates of all three solutions through the plastic sheaths and the 14 gauge Jelco catheters were superior to both sizes of Hickman catheters. Shortening the Hickman catheters improved their flow. High-flow plastic sheaths can provide a useful alternative to Hickman catheters in patients where permanent, large-bore central venous catheters are not required. Hickman catheters should be shortened as much as safely possible if massive haemorrhage is anticipated.

AB  - Summary The vascular endothelial surface is coated by the glycocalyx, a ubiquitous gel-like layer composed of a membrane-binding domain that contains proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side-chains, and plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, this component is highly vulnerable to damage and is also difficult to examine. Recent advances in analytical techniques have enabled biochemical, visual and computational investigation of this vascular component. The glycocalyx modulates leukocyte?endothelial interactions, thrombus formation and other processes that lead to microcirculatory dysfunction and critical organ injury in sepsis. It also acts as a regulator of vascular permeability and contains mechanosensors as well as receptors for growth factors and anticoagulants. During the initial onset of sepsis, the glycocalyx is damaged and circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including syndecans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid, can be measured and are reportedly useful as biomarkers for sepsis. Also, a new methodology using side-stream dark-field imaging is now clinically available for assessing the glycocalyx. Multiple factors including hypervolemia and hyperglycemia are toxic to the glycocalyx, and several agents have been proposed as therapeutic modalities, although no single treatment has been proven to be clinically effective. In this article, we review the derangement of the glycocalyx in sepsis. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the important roles of the glycocalyx, the relationship between derangement of the endothelial glycocalyx and severity of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been adequately elucidated and further work is needed.

AB  - Summary We describe a case of severe pain associated with extensive lower limb injures in a 5-year old, complicated by profound anemia in a Jehovah?s Witness family. The study was carried out in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary level university hospital. The patient was 5-year-old girl, with multiple open fractures and extensive soft tissue loss on her left foot and ankle due to a lawnmower injury leading to severe pain and profound anemia with management of the latter complicated by family beliefs. The interventions given were multi-modal pain management and treatment of severe anemia with avoidance of transfusion. A drop in hemoglobin from 11.6?g·dl?1 at admission to a nadir of 4.3?g·dl?1 on day 7 was observed. Effective pain control was achieved with nurse- and then patient-controlled analgesia plus adjuncts. Effective pain management and control of anxiety can be achieved by a multi-modal approach in young children. Profound anemia was treated without transfusion and without compromise of tissue healing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Canine distemper virus causes a multi systemic disease in dogs often with severe neurological signs. These signs are the result of viral replication in neurons and glial cells leading to grey matter lesions and demyelination. Inflammation leads to further destruction of the tissue. As extraneural signs are often lacking and only one localisation may be found on neurological examination, distemper may be difficult to diagnose. Myoclonus is almost pathognomonic for this disease but occurs in less than half of the cases. The inflammation of the central nervous system that occurs during the chronic stage of the disease can be detected on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, in particular by determination of the IgG index. Viral antigen can be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid cells by fluorescent antibody techniques. The prognosis of nervous distemper is generally poor although dogs can recover from this disease. Treatment is largely supportive and symptomatic. The importance of regular vaccination is stressed.

AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

AB  - Abstract The peripheral nerve regeneration is still one of the major clinical problems, which has received a great deal of attention. In this study, the electrospun silk fibroin (SF)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated and functionalized their surfaces with laminin (LN) without chemical linkers for potential use in the peripheral nerve tissue engineering. The morphology, surface chemistry, thermal behavior and wettability of the scaffolds were examined to evaluate their performance by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements, respectively. The proliferation and viability of Schwann cells onto the surfaces of SF/PEO nanofibrous scaffolds were investigated using SEM and thiazolyl blue (MTT) assay. The results showed an improvement of SF conformation and surface hydrophilicity of SF/PEO nanofibers after methanol and O2 plasma treatments. The immunostaining observation indicated a continuous coating of LN on the scaffolds. Improving the surface hydrophilicity and LN functionalization significantly increased the cell proliferation and this was more prominent after 5 days of culture time. In conclusion, the obtained results revealed that the electrospun LN-functionalized SF/PEO nanofibrous scaffold could be a promising candidate for peripheral nerve tissue regeneration. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.

Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the sepsis and the inflammatory response to injury. Higher doses of corticosteroids have been shown to be harmful in severe sepsis. Early administration of antibiotics has been shown to have a significant impact on outcomes with sepsis. The coagulation system plays an important role in the sepsis-induced inflammatory cascade. Coagulation is activated by the inflammatory reaction to tissue injury and is activated independent of the type of microbe (e.g., gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites). Coagulation induced by inflammation can in turn contribute to further inflammation. Depletion of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factors contributes to the microvascular deposition of fibrin that is associated with organ dysfunction. Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis contribute significantly to organ dysfunction and death.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hypocobalaminaemia in cats with moderate to severe hyperthyroidism and to investigate the relationship between cobalamin status and selected haematologic parameters. Methods: Serum cobalamin concentrations were measured in 76 spontaneously hyperthyroid cats [serum thyroxine (T4) concentration ≥100 nmol/L] and 100 geriatric euthyroid cats. Erythrocyte and neutrophil counts in hyperthyroid cats with hypocobalaminaemia were compared with those in hyperthyroid cats with adequate serum cobalamin concentrations (≥290 ng/L). Results: The median cobalamin concentration in hyperthyroid cats was lower than the control group (409 versus 672 ng/L; P=0·0040). In addition, 40·8% of hyperthyroid cats had subnormal serum cobalamin concentrations compared with 25% of controls (P=0·0336). Weak negative correlation (coefficient: ?0·3281) was demonstrated between serum cobalamin and T4 concentrations in the hyperthyroid population, and the median cobalamin concentration was lower in cats with T4 above the median of 153 nmol/L compared with cats with T4 below this value (P=0·0281). Hypocobalaminaemia was not associated with neutropenia or anaemia in hyperthyroid cats. Clinical Significance: This study indicates that a substantial proportion of cats with T4≥100 nmol/L are hypocobalaminaemic and suggests that hyperthyroidism directly or indirectly affects cobalamin uptake, excretion or utilisation in this species.

AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.
