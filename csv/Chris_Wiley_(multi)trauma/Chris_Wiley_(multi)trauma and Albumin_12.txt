AB  - Abstract Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease in Malaysia. The symptoms of leptospirosis vary from mild nonspecific flu-like illness to a severe condition which is usually associated with serious complication and fatality. To study the protein expression profile of mild and severe leptospirosis, 15 paired sera were collected from the patients who were mildly infected and following that progressed to severe stage. The proteome profiles of mild and severe cases were studied using 2DE analysis in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression of proteins that were significantly different and had a fold difference of at least 2 had been identified and then validated using Western blot. Our study demonstrated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I), serum amyloid A (SAA), transferrin (TF), haptoglobin (HP) and transthyretin (TTR) have significantly different expression between mild and severe leptospirosis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suggested the expression of these five proteins were modulated by acute phase response signaling pathway. Besides that, a functional network of lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry that interconnects these five proteins with interactomes also had been predicted by this software. In conclusion, this finding supports the potential of these five proteins to be the biomarkers for mild and severe human leptospirosis.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Abstract Background Adult primary mesenchymal cells of different origin which can be obtained with minor donor site morbidity are considered for articular cartilage repair. This study aims at a comparison of their chondrogenic potential. Methods Mesenchymal cells were isolated from perichondrium/periosteum, bone marrow or fat of adult rats and found to be positive for the stem-cell-related antigens Sca-1, c-Kit, CD10, CD13 and CD90 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chondrogenic differentiation was induced by applying recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or adenoviral vectors carrying BMP-2 cDNA, followed by micromass culture. The stimulated cells were characterized by RT-PCR, cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Expression of aggrecan, collagen type I, II, IX and X and alkaline phosphatase genes was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in comparison with unstimulated control cells. Adenovirally stimulated cells were transplanted into mechanically generated partial-thickness cartilage lesions in the patellar groove of the rat femur. Quality and integration of the repair tissues were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Results Stimulation with BMP-2 or AdBMP-2 led to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in all three cell populations studied, most rapidly and prominently in the perichondrial/periosteal cells, which showed a 3200-fold increase of type II collagen mRNA and reached the highest absolute levels of type II and IX collagen transcripts after stimulation. Similar results were obtained for the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), while the respective transcript levels in fat stromal cells declined after an initial more than 30-fold elevation. Following transplantation in vivo, AdBMP-2-infected perichondrial/periosteal cells produced a proteoglycan-rich, type II collagen-positive matrix with only faint staining for type I collagen. The repair tissue originating from AdBMP-2-infected BMSC showed less intense type II collagen staining, but a relatively proteoglycan-rich matrix, weakly positive for type I collagen. Transgene-activated fat stromal cells formed rather fibrous tissue mainly composed of type I collagen. Unstimulated cells of the three different populations gave only rise to fibrous tissue. Conclusions Perichondrium/periosteum-derived cells and BMSC seem superior to cells isolated from fat with respect to forming hyaline cartilaginous tissue. A chondrogenic stimulus, e.g. by transfer of BMP-2 cDNA, appears to be required for initiation and support of chondrogenic differentiation. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Dapsone is a sulfone-type drug used widely for different infectious, immune, and hypersensitivity disorders as an antibacterial treatment alone or in combination for leprosy and sometimes for infected skin lesions. DHS is a severe idiosyncratic adverse reaction with multi-organ involvement. However, acute necrotic hepatitis requiring an emergent LT is rare. Herein, we report a case of 12-yr-old girl who suffered from fulminant hepatitis and multi-organ failure due to DHS for PPD. She was saved by emergent LDLT. A high index of suspicion and rapid diagnosis are necessary not to miss this potentially lethal but rare disease.

AB  - Summary We conducted a prospective study of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 70?years or more in 23 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. We studied 4158 consecutive patients of whom 2845 (68%) had pre-existing comorbidities. By day 30, 216 (5%) patients had died, and 835 (20%) suffered complications; 390 (9.4%) patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Pre-operative factors associated with mortality included: increasing age (80?89?years: OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6?2.8), p?<?0.001; 90+?years: OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.6?6.2), p?<?0.001); worsening ASA physical status (ASA 3: OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.8?5.5), p?<?0.001; ASA 4: OR 12.4 (95% CI 6.9?22.2), p?<?0.001); a pre-operative plasma albumin <?30?g.l?1 (OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8?3.5), p?<?0.001); and non-scheduled surgery (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3?2.5), p?<?0.001). Complications associated with mortality included: acute renal impairment (OR 3.3 (95% CI 2.1?5.0), p?<?0.001); unplanned Intensive Care Unit admission (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.9?4.9), p?<?0.001); and systemic inflammation (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.7?3.7), p?<?0.001). Patient factors often had a stronger association with mortality than the type of surgery. Strategies are needed to reduce complications and mortality in older surgical patients.

AB  - Abstract We report a fatal case of acute gastric dilatation in a 3-year old boy who presented with severe abdominal pain and massive gastric distension in the emergency room. On physical examination the patient was in shock due to acute abdomen and lower limb ischemia. Initial laboratory findings showed multi-organ failure with acute renal failure and pancreatitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed marked dilatation of the stomach resulting in compression of the abdominal aorta. The left kidney, spleen and pancreas were not visible on CT due to the necrotic changes. The patient was quickly stabilized by initial volume resuscitation, but suddenly deteriorated immediately after gastric decompression via nasogastric tube, and died from multi-organ failure 3?h after initial presentation.

AB  - There are limited data on demographics, long-term follow-up, and iron/rHuEPO requirements of hemodialysis (HD) patients in Turkey. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of the HD duration, primary illness, blood pressure, and age on serum albumin, CRP, blood pressure, iron/rHuEPO requirements, PTH, and HCV positivity of HD patients. 703 patients (280 women, 423 men, aged 47.8?±?15.5 years) from 4 HD units were included and grouped according to the duration on HD. The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data of the last 3 months for each patient were recorded retrospectively. When the groups were compared, patients with a longer HD duration were younger and percentage of diabetic patients decreased as the duration increased. Serum albumin and CRP levels were similar between the groups. When the groups were compared according to the blood pressure profiles, after the 5th year, a decline in the systolic blood pressures was observed. Diastolic blood pressures were similar across the years. There was no significant difference in need of antihypertensive medicines. Iron requirements showed a fall after the 5th year, and an increase in after the 10th year. There was a decline in the hematocrit levels by the duration on HD but there was no change in rHuEPO requirements over the years. Parathyroid hormone levels and HCV positivity tended to increase across the years. Our results revealed that during the first 10 years, age, etiology (diabetes, hypertension), and blood pressure control seemed to be important factors affecting survival. Whereas, after the 10th year, patients seemed to be more prone to the long-term complications of HD, such as HCV infection, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9.

AB  - In end-stage renal failure, impaired renal catabolism leads to retention of beta 2 microglobulin (ß2M), identified as the major constituent of hemodialysis (HD) related amyloidosis. It has been previously shown that, while using a high flux (HF) HD membrane, nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) with its increased time and frequency provides a much higher clearance of ß2M compared to conventional HD. We compared serum ß2M levels between low flux (LF) and HF in a group of 9 NHD patients who dialyse 8 hours 6 nights/week. Fresenius polysulfone LF membrane size F6-F8 HPS dialyser were used for the first 15 months (mth) of NHD (SA 1.3?1.8?m2). Subsequently, polysulfone HF FX80 dialyzer were used (SA 1.8?m2). Blood flow and dialysate flow rates were unchanged throughout the study. ß2M levels were measured at 6, 12, 15?mth on LF and at 6, 12?mth on HF. Albumin, homocysteine (Hcy), and phosphate (Phos) levels were also recorded at these times. ß2M levels trended upwards during the 15?mth on LF (36.6?±?10.57 at 6?mth vs 47.1?±?11.7 at 15?mth). On introduction of HF, there was a significant fall in ß2M at 6?mth to 12.4?±?3.5 (p?<?0.003), while ß2M levels were unchanged at 12?mth of HF. A downward trend in Hcy levels with the use of HF was noted (12.9?±?2.9 at 0?mth Vs 11.1?±?3.7 at 12?mth). Plasma albumin and Phos levels remained unchanged as did the use of Phos supplementation. Levels of ß2M continued to rise on NHD with LF, indicating inadequate clearance. With the introduction of HF there was a significant fall in ß2M levels consistent with improved clearance. The implications of this are that ß2M clearance may be time and frequency dependent only if dialyser membrane flux is adequate.

AB  - Summary Critical illness, an extreme form of severe physical stress, is characterized by important endocrine and metabolic changes. Due to critical care medicine, survival from previously lethal conditions has become possible but many patients now enter a chronic phase of critical illness. The role of the endocrine and metabolic responses to acute and prolonged critical illness in mediating or hampering recovery remains highly debated. In recent years, important novel insights into the pathophysiology and the consequences of these endocrine responses to acute and chronic critical illness have been generated. This chapter summarizes these insights with a specific focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and on the impact of the hyperglycemic response, on recovery from critical illness. The therapeutic implications of these novel insights are critically analyzed.

AB  - Summary Sutures play an important role in wound repair by supporting healing tissues. Understanding the various characteristics of suture materials enables appropriate selection. However, no single suture material is ideal, and compromises must be made. Proper suture placement, using specific patterns, generally ensures a predictable progression of wound healing and of scar formation. Drains, when properly applied, may help to prevent or at least lessen complications during healing. Sutures and drains are not substitutes for proper wound management because they cannot compensate for poor cleansing, debridement, and wound irrigation. Moreover, inappropriate use of sutures and drains may delay healing and may lead to scarring.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions.

AB  - Abstract Membrane lesions play an early role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Using a new albumin-targeted contrast agent (MS-325), sarcolemmal integrity of two animal models for muscular dystrophy was studied by MRI. Intravenously injected MS-325 does not enter skeletal muscle of normal mice. However, mdx and Sgca-null mutant mice, animal models for Duchenne and sarcoglycan-deficient limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, respectively, showed significant accumulation of MS-325 in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that contrast agent-enhanced MRI could serve as a common, noninvasive imaging procedure for evaluating the localization, extent, and mechanisms of skeletal muscle damage in muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, this method is expected to facilitate assessment of therapeutic approaches in these diseases. Magn Reson Med 44:655?659, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
