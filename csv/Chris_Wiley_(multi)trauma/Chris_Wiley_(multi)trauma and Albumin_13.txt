AB  - Summary Lymphoma, although rare, is the most common haematopoietic neoplasm encountered in horses and can occur at any age, with horses 4?10 years more commonly affected. Lymphoma can be classified into multicentric, alimentary, mediastinal, cutaneous and solitary. Clinical signs are typically nonspecific until the disease has progressed to end-stage at which time clinical signs reflect function of organ(s) involved. Horses with the cutaneous form of lymphoma typically present with multifocal skin lesions and no other clinical signs. Like the nonspecific clinical signs of lymphoma, results of complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistries are not often helpful with diagnosis, but lymphoma should be considered if anaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are observed without a clear indication of infectious disease. Identification of neoplastic lymphocytes during cytological examination of a body cavity effusion can confirm the presence of lymphoma. Typically, ante mortem confirmation of lymphoma is made through histopathological examination of a biopsy or cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate of a suspected lesion. Observation of compression or destruction of normal tissue architecture by invading neoplastic cells during histological examination is indicative of lymphoma. Additional diagnostics that may improve our knowledge of equine lymphoma include detection of hormone receptors, immunophenotyping, and immunohistochemical analysis for tumour proliferation rates. Prognosis of horses with lymphoma depends on the form of lymphoma and stage at which the horse is presented but death is the common outcome of this disease. Current treatment options are surgical excision, radiation or administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Treatment of horses with lymphoma can result in palliation and occasional resolution of this disease. Equine oncology is in its infancy, but through further documentation of horses with lymphoma and their response to therapy, a clearer understanding of the disease process and effective treatment of this neoplasm can be developed.

AB  - Abstract Proliferation of astrocytes plays an essential role during ontogeny and in the adult brain, where it occurs following trauma and in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases as well as in normal, healthy mammals. The cellular mechanisms underlying glial proliferation remain poorly understood. As dopamine is known to modulate proliferation in different cell populations, we investigated the effects of dopamine on the proliferation of striatal astrocytes in vitro. We found that dopamine reduced proliferation. As proliferation involves, among other things, a change in cell volume, which normally comes with water movement across the membrane, water channels might represent a molecular target of the dopamine effect. Therefore we studied the effect of dopamine on aquaporin?4 (AQP4) expression, the main aquaporin subtype expressed in glial cells, and observed a down-regulation of the AQP4-M23 isoform. This down-regulation was the cause of the dopamine-induced decrease in proliferation as knockdown of AQP4 using siRNA techniques mimicked the effects of dopamine on proliferation. Furthermore, stimulation of glial proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor was also abolished by knocking down AQP4. In addition, blocking of AQP4 with 10??m tetraethylammonium inhibited osmotically induced cell swelling and stimulation of glial cell proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor. These results demonstrate a clear-cut involvement of AQP4 in the regulation of proliferation and implicate that modulation of AQP4 could be used therapeutically in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in the regulation of reactive astrogliosis by preventing or reducing the glia scar formation, thus improving regeneration following ischemia or other trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.

AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990?1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of liver and spleen. In a nonoperative patient, angiographic embolization (AE) can be an adjunct in liver injuries that contains an arterio-venous fistula or have ongoing bleeding. Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in patients with normal hemodynamics is recommended with greater than 90% success. Hydatid disease of the liver is uncommon. It is caused by parasitic Echinococcus, which has dogs as its definitive hosts. Patients with high-grade liver injuries have an increased risk of developing post-injury biloma as a complication. The accessory spleen is a common anomaly, occurring in up to 20% of the population. However, it can occur in up to 30% of patients with a hematologic disorder. Splenic artery aneurysm is very uncommon, but it is the third most frequent abdominal artery to undergo aneurismal changes.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - The regenerative neurogenesis of the optic tectum of larval Xenopus laevis has been studied analyzing the proliferative and morphogenetic phases of the regeneration process after removal of one optic lobe. To this end, short-term and long-term pulses were carried out using the thymidine analog BrdU, selectively incorporated into cells during the S phase of the cell cycle. Results indicate that while in early larvae (stage 49/50, according to Nieuwkoop & Faber 1967) regeneration occurs mainly at the expense of the stem cells present in extensive proliferation zones (?matrix areas?) of the midbrain, in late larvae (stage 55/56) regeneration occurs at the expense of stem cells present in very limited matrix areas of the brain and of quiescent cells, which re-enter the cell cycle following trauma. Moreover, in early larvae, morphogenesis of the optic tectum is carried out according to a precise spatio-temporal order from rostro-caudal to latero-medial. By contrast, in late larvae, the topographical order of the regenerative morphogenesis of the optic lobe is completely altered. As a consequence, the regenerated optic tectum in early larvae has an apparently normal structure, while the regenerated optic tectum in late larvae lacks stratification.

AB  - Control of certain clinical and laboratory parameters affects morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) both before and after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). To identify areas and stage of renal failure where control of these critical variables needs improvement, we compared important clinical and laboratory parameters 6 months before (PRE) and 6 months after starting HD (POST) in 43 type 2 diabetic men with CRF, who were 69.3?±?10.7 years old at HD initiation. Differences, all at p?≤?0.05, were found in blood pressure, in mm Hg, at the physician's office, both systolic (PRE 154?±?16, POST 138?±?18) and diastolic (PRE 77?±?13, POST 69?±?11), serum cholesterol in mg/dL (PRE 206?±?61, POST 159?±?40), and serum creatinine in mg/dL (PRE 4.1?±?1.3, POST 7.0?±?1.8), while no differences were noted in blood hematocrit (PRE 36?±?7%, POST 34?±?9%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin (PRE 7.4?±?1.7%, POST 6.9?±?2.3%), serum glucose in mg/dL (PRE 151?±?67, POST 184?±?94), serum phosphorus in mg/dL (PRE 4.5?±?0.8, POST 4.6?±?1.5), serum calcium in mg/dL (PRE 8.7?±?0.5, POST 8.5?±?1.4), and serum albumin in g/dL (PRE 3.2?±?0.5, POST 3.4?±?0.6). Compared to the POST category, significantly (p?≤?0.05) higher percentages were found in the PRE category for systolic blood pressure >150?mm Hg (PRE 58.8%, POST 26.5%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin >8%(PRE 33.3%, POST 13.3%), serum cholesterol >200?mg/dL (PRE 48.4%, POST 19.4%). A lower percentage was found in the PRE category for serum phosphorus >5.5?mg/dL (PRE 13.2%, POST 31.6%), while the corresponding percentages for serum albumin <3.0?g/dL (PRE 21.6%, POST 18.9%) and serum calcium <8?mg/dL (PRE 7.9%, POST 13.2%) did not differ. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal failure, control of blood pressure, glycemia, and serum lipids appears to be better; whereas, control of serum phosphorus is worse in the first year after starting chronic hemodialysis than in the preceding year. There is room for improvement, both before and after hemodialysis initiation, in the control of these variables, which affect the clinical outcomes of hemodialysis.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

Methods Prospective cohort study. Routine plasma biochemical parameters, plasma parathyroid hormone and calcitriol concentrations, ionized calcium concentrations, and venous pH, were measured at diagnosis and following treatment of hyperthyroidism. Linear regression analysis was used to determine predictors of ionized calcium concentration. Results Hyperthyroid cats (n=45) had lower ionized calcium concentrations than healthy geriatric cats (n=52), however, ionized calcium concentrations were higher in hyperthyroid cats with concurrent or masked chronic kidney disease than non-azotaemic hyperthyroid cats. Plasma calcitriol concentrations were higher in hyperthyroid cats than control cats. Plasma total thyroxine concentration and venous pH were independent predictors of ionized calcium concentration. Plasma total thyroxine concentration was also a predictor of ionized calcium concentration after adjustment for plasma parathyroid hormone and calcitriol concentrations. Clinical Significance Hypocalcaemia in hyperthyroid cats is not associated with the presence of concurrent or masked chronic kidney disease or reduced plasma calcitriol concentrations. Increased thyroid hormone concentrations might influence ionized calcium concentrations through a mechanism, yet to be determined, that is independent of control by parathyroid hormone and calcitriol.

AB  - Abstract A technique is described for the dissociation and fractionation by isopycnic centrifugation (4,000 ? g, 60 minutes, 4°C) in linear bovine albumin density gradients (12 ml, pH 5.2 real osmolality 333 mmol/Kg water, 1.030?1.075 g/cm3) of cells (? 3 ? 107/gradient) released by a strictly standardised combination of mechanical and enzymatic means from a transplantable methylcholanthrene induced BALB/c fibrosarcoma. Optimal conditions for reproducible localisation of cell bands with maintenance of both satisfactory resolution and satisfactory viable cell recovery (> 80%) were established by means of a series of simultaneous double fractionation experiments. When rebanding was performed under these conditions the density of the median of the cell count of the refractioned cells shifted less than 0.0005 g/cm3. Experiments also showed that close adherence to certain aspects of the tissue dissociation and fractionation protocol was necessary to avoid reduced cell yields and viabilities, density-dependent selective cell losses, reductions in resolution and shifts in the location of cell bands. Other aspects of the protocol were tolerant to variation without introducing artefacts.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - Summary Adequate volume maintenance is essential to prevent acute renal failure during major surgery or to ensure graft function after renal transplantation. The various recommendations on the optimum fluid therapy are based, at best, on sparse evidence only from observational studies. This article reviews the literature on perioperative fluid management in renal transplantation. Crystalloid solutions not exerting any specific side-effects are the first choice for volume replacement in kidney transplantation. The use of colloids should be restricted to patients with severe intravascular volume deficits necessitating high volume restoration. The routine application of albumin, dopamine, and high dose diuretics is no longer warranted. Mannitol given immediately before removal of the vessel clamps reduces the requirement of post-transplant dialysis, but has no effects on graft function in the long term. There is insufficient evidence on the best use of dialysis, but it seems peritoneal dialysis pretransplant is associated with less delayed graft function, whereas the preference of dialysis post-transplant is not yet well-founded. This review article should provide better guidance for fluid management in kidney transplantation until best-evidence guidelines can be established based upon more research.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Abstract Current understanding of the means by which the trace metals copper, iron and zinc are transported and stored in the human body is reviewed. Although metal-related inherited metabolic diseases manifest themselves as deficiencies in metalloenzymes, these deficiencies in fact arise from disturbances in the absorption/rejection or transport or storage phases of the metal metabolism. The considerable information available on iron metabolism shows these phases to be closely interrelated with a number of feedback mechanisms operating as controls on the various metabolic stages. Copper and zinc have vastly different roles in their enzymes but, following their close coordination chemistry properties, have similar metabolic routes. Both make use of albumin for transport and of metallothionein at the absorption and hepatic-binding stages. In contrast to iron, copper and zinc have no well-defined storage system; instead they make use of body reserves distributed in various tissues. Our knowledge of the transport and storage systems of the trace metals is still very incomplete. More research is needed on the dynamics of movement of the trace metals between the various body tissues and fluids. Further advances will also come from the study of related metal inherited diseases in other animal species.
