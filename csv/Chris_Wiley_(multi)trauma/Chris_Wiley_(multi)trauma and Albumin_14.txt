AB  - Abstract X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common monogenic disorder causing hypophosphatemia. This case-note review documents the clinical features and the complications of treatment in 59 adults (19 male, 40 female) with XLH. XLH is associated with a large number of private mutations; 37 different mutations in the PHEX gene were identified in this cohort, 14 of which have not been previously reported. Orthopaedic involvement requiring surgical intervention (osteotomy) was frequent. Joint replacement and decompressive laminectomy were observed in those older than 40 years. Dental disease (63%), nephrocalcinosis (42%), and hearing impairment (14%) were also common. The rarity of the disease and the large number of variants make it difficult to discern specific genotype-phenotype relationships. A new treatment, an anti-FGF23 antibody, that may affect the natural history of the disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - Summary von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the commonest inherited bleeding disorder. Management of major surgery or bleeding often requires treatment with a plasma-derived (pd) VWF/FVIII containing concentrate. Wilate? is a dual-virally inactivated pd-concentrate, produced specifically for the treatment of VWD, containing physiological (1:1) ratios of VWF: FVIII. We reviewed efficacy and safety of Wilate? usage (2007?2012) at our centre including 2 years following product switching the majority of patients. Clinical and laboratory data of all adult patients treated with Wilate? during the study period were evaluated. Fifty four patients used 3 972 150 IU of Wilate? (1378 infusions) between 1/3/07 and 1/5/12. Efficacy was rated as being excellent or good in 94% of surgical episodes (n = 70; 34 patients) and 98% of bleeding/traumatic episodes (n = 46; 25 patients). Eight patients (2 636 100 IU) were managed on home treatment regimens. Two patients switched to Wilate? prophylaxis in the evaluation period, demonstrating similar efficacy to a previous product. Incremental recoveries (n = 37) were 2.24 IU dL?1 per IU kg?1 for FVIII:C, 2.39 IU dL?1 per IU kg?1 for VWF:Ag and 1.88 IU dL?1 per IU kg?1 for VWF:RCo. Six adverse events occurred in six patients (11.1% patients) over 1378 infusions (0.44%). Half of these were retrospectively felt to be infusion speed related. No notable accumulation of FVIII was seen in patients treated for ≥3 days. There was no treatment failure, thrombosis, transfusion transmitted infection or inhibitory VWF antibodies seen. Our findings confirm safety and efficacy of Wilate? in an adult VWD population with lack of notable FVIII accumulation.

AB  - Eighteen patients undergoing colorectal excision had gastrointestinal function preserved. Paralytic ileus was avoided by efficient exclusion of swallowed air by aspiration of the esophagus. Full strength elemental diet was delivered into the duodenum immediately postoperatively at 100?150 ml/ hour. Virtually stoichiometric digestion, absorption, and utilization of dietary protein was demonstrated in six patients, for whom 125I-albumin was added to the initial feedings. The 24-hour urine contained 94 ± 4% of the activity. The same group of patients had hourly determinations of nitrogen balance. Each had achieved positive protein balance by 5 ± 3 hours postoperatively. The morning following surgery (17?24 hours postoperatively) the special nasogastric device was removed and intravenous feedings were discontinued, with transition to per os intake of elemental diet. Twelve patients had oral barium motility studies initiated at this time, with continued oral intake of elemental diet. On serial x-rays, each showed clinically adequate peristalsis, with prompt passage of the contrast agent out of the stomach, through intestine and colon. The barium traversed anastomoses to enter the rectum and exit in a spontaneous bowel movement within the second 24-hour period. Three patients were discharged within 48 hours of surgery (sigmoid resection, 2; right hemicolectomy, 1). Paralytic ileus develops after the usual postoperative regimens. Clinically adequate gastrointestinal function can be preserved by a regimen that includes efficient exclusion of swallowed air. This study documents the immediate enteral absorption of full nutrition (ie, 3000 kcal/day) as elemental diet. The x-ray studies document preservation of even gastric and colonic function, permitting normal per os intake and discharge within 24?48 hours of major abdominal surgery.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of supplemental arginine with nutritional support in the presence of sepsis, eighty-eight gastrostomized female Hartley guinea pigs were implanted with osmotic pumps effusing an Eschericia coli/Staphylococcus aureus mixture. Animals were randomized and infused for two weeks with isocaloric and isovolumetric diets containing 0%, 2%, 4%, or 6% supplemental arginine as arginine hydrochloride. Survival was 12/22 (54%) in 0%, 9/22 (41%) in 2% and 4%, and 2/22 (9%) in 6%. Analysis by chi-square test of independence was significant (p = 0.0141) with 6% survival lower than the others. Median survival was 11 days in 0%, 8 days in 2% and 6%, and 9 days in 4%. Median survival was longer in 0% than in 2% or 6% (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly lower in 6% compared to 0% on days 2 through 10, and lower than 2% and 4% on days 6 and 9. Nitrogen balance was higher in 0% than in 2% on days 4, 6, 10, and 13. Serum albumin and C3 were lower in all experimental groups than normal controls (ANOVA: p = 0.01). Comparison of liver, spleen, adrenals, gastrocnemius, and carcass weights, cell-mediated immunity as determined by contact sensitivity to DNFB, and transferrin showed no significant differences. There was a positive dose-response effect seen amongst the experimental groups for the amino acids arginine, ornithine, and citrulline in relation to the amount of supplemental arginine. This study suggests that dietary arginine supplementation does not enhance survival in a guinea pig model of established peritonitis. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 14:237?244, 1990)

AB  - Abstract Aims Diabetic kidney disease independently predicts cardiovascular disease and premature death. We examined the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and quality of care in a cross-sectional survey of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes across Asia. Methods The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation programme is a disease-management programme implemented using an electronic portal that systematically captures clinical characteristics of all patients enrolled. Between July 2007 and December 2012, data on 28 110 consecutively enrolled patients (China: 3415, Hong Kong: 15 196, India: 3714, Korea: 1651, Philippines: 3364, Vietnam: 692, Taiwan: 78) were analysed. Results In this survey, 15.9% of patients had CKD, 25.0% had microalbuminuria and 12.5% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with CKD were less likely to achieve HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (36.0% vs. 42.3%) and blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg (20.8% vs. 35.3%), and were more likely to have retinopathy (26.2% vs. 8.7%), sensory neuropathy (29.0% vs. 7.7%), cardiovascular disease (26.6% vs. 8.7%) and self-reported hypoglycaemia (18.9% vs. 8.2%). Despite high frequencies of albuminuria (74.8%) and dyslipidaemia (93.0%) among CKD patients, only 49.0% were using renin?angiotensin system inhibitors and 53.6% were on statins. On logistic regression, old age, male gender, tobacco use, long disease duration, high HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI, and low LDL cholesterol were independently associated with CKD (all P < 0.05). Conclusions The poor control of risk factors, suboptimal use of organ-protective drugs and high frequencies of hypoglycaemia highlight major treatment gaps in patients with diabetic kidney disease in Asia.

AB  - Abstract Chromium is an essential nutrient required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in humans and many animal species. We evaluated whether feeding laying hens with high levels of different chemical forms of trivalent chromium may affect hepatic metabolizing cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-linked enzymes. Modulation of CYP-dependent monooxygenases (which play a pivotal role in the endogenous metabolism) by Cr(III) was tested using either specific substrates as probes of different CYPs or testosterone as a multi-bioprobe. The CYP-supported oxidases were studied in liver microsomes from laying hens fed with diet supplemented with either 25 or 50 ppm chromium chloride as a yeast or as aminoniacinate. Although at 25 ppm no appreciable effects were observed, at 50 ppm a general inactivation of the recorded monooxygenases (ranging from 34% loss for ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase with chromium chloride to 85% loss for O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin with either chromium yeast or aminoniacinate) were achieved in the supplemented groups vs controls. The only exception was the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin, which was significantly boosted by both chromium yeast (up to 65% increase) and chromium aminoniacinate (up to 141%). Measurements of the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of testosterone used as a multi-bioprobe corroborated the inactivating properties of Cr(III) at the higher dose. Taken as a whole, these findings seem to indicate that high levels of Cr(III) supplementation can substantially impair CYP-catalysed drug metabolism in laying hens.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Aim To evaluate long-term survival and prognostic factors in elderly Mexican patients who have undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Methods The present study was a retrospective cohort analysis of 110 patients aged older than 70 years without head and neck malignancy who underwent PEG between January 2005 and December 2012. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for demographic and clinical variables, and survival was determined by the Kaplan?Meier method. Results Medium age and follow up were 82.45?±?6.6 years and 688.3?±?394.6 days, respectively. The patients who died in the early postoperative period (n?=?6) were older than those who survived. The Karnofsky performance status and lymphocyte count were non-significantly lower in non-survivors. The body mass index and serum albumin level were lower in non-survivors (P?=?0.03 and 0.01, respectively) and Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI) was higher. A total of 32 (29%) patients died later in the postoperative period with a mean follow up of 436.2?±?267.4 days. Risk factors for mortality included Karnofsky Performance Status (odds ratio [OR] 9.76, 95% CI: 3.26?29.3), CCI (OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.31?21.41) and postoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.45, 95% CI: 1.71?6.67). Postgastrostomy pneumonia occurred in 36.8% of the patients who died during follow-up (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.6?1.26). Conclusions Karnofsky performance status, Charlson's comorbidity index and postoperative hypoalbuminemia, were independent risk factors for mortality. Modifiable factors are related to nutritional support. Early PEG may help prevent malnutrition and infection. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2015; 15: 19?26.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract The present series of experiments demonstrate that a polypeptide activity present in rat serum induces a proliferative response in cultured rat Schwann cells. Schwann cells in multi-well tissue culture plates were incubated in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and serial dilutions of normal rat serum, and control preparations were incubated in the same culture medium without rat serum. Rates of cell proliferation were assayed by measuring DNA incorporation of tritiated thymidine using liquid scintillation counting. A prominent dose-dependent proliferative response was observed among Schwann cells incubated with rat serum and rat plasma dilutions as compared to controls; this activity is abolished by heat inactivation and by proteolytic digestion, and was not affected by dialysis against a cellulose ester membrane that excludes molecules larger than 10,000 daltons. In contrast, no increase in DNA uptake of tritiated thymidine was observed when astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cultures were incubated with serial dilutions of rat serum. No proliferative effect was observed when rat Schwann cells were incubated with a dilution of standard adult bovine serum. These results suggest there is an intravascular plasma polypeptide with a molecular weight greater than 10,000 daltons that specifically stimulates Schwann cell proliferation, and it is proposed that this factor may be the mitogen responsible for the Schwann cell proliferative response known to occur after nerve injury. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
