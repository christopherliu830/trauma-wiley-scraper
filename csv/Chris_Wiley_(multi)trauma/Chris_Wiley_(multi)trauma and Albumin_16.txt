AB  - Abstract Objective To describe a large segmental (sub-total) mandibulectomy for removal of an undifferentiated sarcoma in a horse. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 10-year-old mare. Methods A combination of methods including computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a large undifferentiated sarcoma of the right mandible. A large segmental mandibulectomy extending from 3?cm below the right temporomandibular joint to immediately caudal to tooth 407 was used to perform an en-bloc resection of the mass under general anesthesia. Results Surgery time was 11?hours and 35?minutes and total anesthesia time, 12?hours and 40?minutes. The mare was eating well 3 days after surgery. Some postoperative skin sloughing occurred, but the cosmetic and functional outcome was good. The mare continued to do well, with no evidence of disease recurrence, 24 months after surgery. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT images was instrumental in surgical planning. A very large portion of the mandible can be removed in a horse with acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Abstract Aim: To investigate: 1) the occurrence of hypoxic hepatitis in full-term infants after birth asphyxia, 2) the temporal enzyme pattern in asphyxiated newborn infants, and 3) whether the degree of hypoxic hepatitis, as reflected by the rise in aminotransferase, correlates with the severity of the asphyxia and CNS symptomatology. Methods: Serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total and conjugated bilirubin, cholinesterase activity, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), and nucleated red blood cell count were prospectively measured in full-term asphyxiated newborn infants (n=26). Samples were collected three times during the first 72 h and once between days 6 and 12 after birth. Samples from healthy newborns (n=56), collected 24?172 h after birth, served as controls. Results: In 12 of the 26 asphyxiated infants, a serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT) pattern compatible with hypoxic hepatitis was found. Five infants showed increased S-ALAT activity but with a different pattern. Similar patterns were seen in serum aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT). S-ALAT and -ASAT concentrations 0?72 h after birth correlated significantly with severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Conclusion: Birth asphyxia can induce an enzyme pattern in serum compatible to hypoxic hepatitis. There seems to be a correlation between aminotransferases in serum and the extent of CNS injury.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Summary Persons with diabetes require surgical procedures at a higher rate and have longer hospital stays than those without diabetes. Approximately 5% of persons with diabetes will require emergency surgery over their lifetime. The actual perioperative glycemic treatment recommendations for a given patient should be individualized, based on factors such as current glycemic control, type of diabetes, nature and extent of surgical procedure, and antecedent diabetes therapy. The management goal is to optimize metabolic control through close monitoring, adequate fluid and caloric repletion, and judicious use of insulin. Other endocrine and metabolic derangements (e.g., adrenal insufficiency; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism; carcinoid crisis; hyponatremia; and hypercalcemia) are also common in the emergency perioperative setting and warrant prompt review and management.

AB  - Abstract Stereoselective human plasma protein binding of chlorpheniramine was studied by an ultrafiltration technique using a simple method of chiral stationary-phase liquid chromatographic resolution of racemic chlorpheniramine. The Scatchard plots of both chlorpheniramine enantiomers to human plasma protein showed high- and low-affinity components. Although there was no significant difference in the dissociation constant (Kd) between enantiomers at the high-affinity site, the Kd of (?)-chlorpheniramine in the low-affinity component was higher than that of (+)-chlorpheniramine. The number of binding sites (n2) of (+)- and (?)-chlorpheniramine in the low-affinity component were 24.4 and 25.0 nmol (mgprotein)?1, respectively. However, the partitioning constants (n/kd) of (+)-chlorpheniramine in the high- and low-affinity component were, respectively, approximately two-times higher than those of (?)-chlorpheniramine. Both (+)- and (?)-enantiomers appeared to bind to approximately one site per human serum α1-acid glycoprotein (HSAAG) molecule with a dissociation constant of 186.9 and 295.9 ?M, respectively. Moreover, the binding to human serum albumin (HSA) of both enantiomers was weaker than that to HSAAG, and both enantiomers bound to approximately one site of HSA with a similar affinity. These results suggest that binding of (+)-chlorpheniramine to human plasma protein is stronger than that of (?)-chlorpheniramine, indicating a stereoselective binding of chlorpheniramine. The study also shows that the low affinity of binding of the enantiomers is in keeping with the AAG.

AB  - Abstract Background Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) is a common complication after abdominal surgery, but data about risk factors of PPOI for patients with gastric cancer are rare. We sought to investigate the impact of laparoscopic versus open surgery for PPOI after gastric cancer surgery. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a registry database consecutively collected from June 2016 to March 2017. PPOI was defined as no bowel function persisting for more than 4 days. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression models were performed to investigate risk factors, and stratified analysis was carried out to examine the primary association at different levels of a potential confounding factor. Results A total of 162 patients composed of 63 patients undergoing laparotomy and 99 patients undergoing laparoscopy were enrolled and PPOI was observed in 32 (19.75%) patients. Risk factors significantly correlated with PPOI were as follows: open surgery, older age, late surgical pathologic staging, postoperative use of opioid analgesic, low level of postoperative albumin and serum potassium. Compared to open surgery, the laparoscopic surgery was a strong protective factor for PPOI after adjusting related variables (OR = 0.17, CI: 0.05-0.52, P = .002). There was an interaction between surgical methods and the postoperative WBC level (P for interaction = .007). In the two group stratified analysis of WBC, laparoscopic surgery had a significant lower risk of PPOI than open group for the patients with WBC counts above the middle level in crude or adjusted models. This result remained significantly in the three group stratified analysis for the patients with WBC counts in the middle and or high tertile groups. Conclusions PPOI is a common postoperative complication of patients after gastrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with decreased risk of PPOI in gastric surgery. Patients who underwent open surgery and presented with high level of WBC should be cautious with PPOI.

AB  - Summary Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF), a clinical syndrome associated with a dismal prognosis, occurs acutely in patients with chronic liver disease. An important feature of this syndrome is the potential for reversibility if it is recognized early and supportive measures are instituted before multi-organ failure ensues. There have therefore been recent efforts to better define and understand the pathophysiologic basis of the condition so as to aid early diagnosis and management. In this chapter, we aim to review the most recent data on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and management of ACLF.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Background: The neuroendocrine response following major surgery has not been previously influenced by either regional anaesthetic techniques or opioid analgesia probably due to insufficient intraoperative afferent neural blockade. In this study we attempted to determine whether significant inhibition of these pathways could be achieved by combining preoperative high spinal anaesthesia with postoperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia. In theory too, there may be additional benefits over perioperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia on pain and pulmonary dysfunction. Methods: 20 ASA 1?3 patients undergoing elective colonic surgery were studied. Gp 1 (n=10) received a high spinal intraoperative block to T4 using 6mls of 0.5% bupivacaine plus continuous epidural 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. Gp 2 (n=10) patients received epidural 0.5% bupivacaine block to T4 plus continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. We measured a) plasma glucose and Cortisol at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h; b) forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak flow rate (PFR) preoperatively, at 8 and 24 h; c) visual analogue pain scores (VAS 0?10) at rest, cough and mobilisation at 8 and 24 h; d) block height every hour for 12 hours then 3 hourly; e) 24-hour urine volumes for dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline f) 24-hour PCA morphine requirements. Results: The two groups did not differ in age, sex, height, weight, duration of surgery, blood loss or serum albumin. Pain relief was excellent and similar in both groups. The average 24 hour morphine consumption was 10 mg in both groups with no differences in the block height. All the patients had a 30?50% reduction in FEV1, FVC and PFR (P>0.05). Metabolically, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups except a higher rise in glucose in Gpl at 2 and 3 h (P=0.0312 and 0.014). 24-hour catecholamine studies showed no differences for noradrenaline (P=0.8), adrenaline (P=0.47) and dopamine (P=0.36). Conclusions: Thoracic epidural bupivacaine/diamorphine infusion provided excellent postoperative analgesia following colonic surgery. An intraoperative combined spinal/epidural technique conferred no additional benefit on analgesia, pulmonary function and the neuroendocrine response.

AB  - Abstract The ability of emergency care research (ECR) to produce meaningful improvements in the outcomes of acutely ill or injured patients depends on the optimal configuration, infrastructure, organization, and support of emergency care research networks (ECRNs). Through the experiences of existing ECRNs, we can learn how to best accomplish this. A meeting was organized in Washington, DC, on May 28, 2008, to discuss the present state and future directions of clinical research networks as they relate to emergency care. Prior to the conference, at the time of online registration, participants responded to a series of preconference questions addressing the relevant issues that would form the basis of the breakout session discussions. During the conference, representatives from a number of existing ECRNs participated in discussions with the attendees and provided a description of their respective networks, infrastructure, and challenges. Breakout sessions provided the opportunity to further discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these networks and patterns of success with respect to their formation, management, funding, best practices, and pitfalls. Discussions centered on identifying characteristics that promote or inhibit successful networks and their interactivity, productivity, and expansion. Here the authors describe the current state of ECRNs and identify the strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls of research networks. The most commonly cited strengths of population- or disease-based research networks identified in the preconference survey were access to larger numbers of patients; involvement of physician experts in the field, contributing to high-level study content; and the collaboration among investigators. The most commonly cited weaknesses were studies with too narrow a focus and restrictive inclusion criteria, a vast organizational structure with a risk of either too much or too little central organization or control, and heterogeneity of institutional policies and procedures among sites. Through the survey and structured discussion process involving multiple stakeholders, the authors have identified strengths and weaknesses that are consistent across a number of existing ECRNs. By leveraging the strengths and addressing the weaknesses, strategies can be adopted to enhance the scientific value and productivity of these networks and give direction to future ECRNs.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Environmental factors are poorly understood in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The importance of environmental factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants. Results and Discussion We propose the ?AD exposome? to comprehensively assess the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.

AB  - Abstract. Fluid from 41 non-keratinizing jaw cysts was examined by cellulose acetate membrane (CAM) electrophoresis. Improved separation with more regular protein profiles was obtained after digestion with bovine testicular hyaluronidase of two cyst contents exhibiting pronounced viscosity. CAM electrophoretograms of cyst fluid and serum contained the same protein fractions, with the exception of the ?2globulin band which was clearly demonstrated in only one cyst fluid, that from a median palatine cyst. Quantitation by scanning of the CAM eleclrophorelograms yielded contents of albumin, α1-, and α2-globulins which usually were proportionately lower in cyst fluid than in autologous serum while the ?1-globulin fraction was roughly similar. Relative concentrations of ?-globulins were significantly higher in cyst fluid than in autologous scrum, rising to as much as 56% of the total cyst fluid protein content. The ?-globulin band of cyst fluid generally was broad-based (?polyclonal? pattern). Within these broad ?-zones discrete, narrow, but well demarcated bands were occasionally seen (?oligoclonal? pattern). One cyst fluid exhibited a narrow-based ?-globulin band (?monoclonal? pattern). The electrophoretic patterns as well as other observations provide indirect evidence for the view that the bulk of the cyst fluid proteins are derived from the plasma and indicate that the ?-globulin fraction is a mixture of extravasated arid locally produced immunoglobulins.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.
