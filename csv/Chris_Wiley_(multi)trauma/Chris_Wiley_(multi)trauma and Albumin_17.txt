AB  - Abstract Study of cell-biomaterial interaction is a crucial aspect of bone tissue engineering to find a state-of-the-art functional substitute. In present study, the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) behavior on three-dimensional biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/gelatin (nHA/CS/Gel) scaffolds was investigated. The outcome was assessed by histological, biochemical and morphological tests. Results indicated that hWJ-MSCs attached onto the scaffold surface through membrane filopodia, uniformly spread throughout the contacting surface. It only took 3 days for the seeded cells to appear deep inside the scaffold, reflecting proper hWJ-MSCs adhesion and migration, evidenced by both scanning electron microscope and hematoxilin and eosin assessments. Additionally, the present fabricated nHA/CS/Gel scaffold proved to be non-toxic as it supported cell proliferation measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, 3-week culture of hWJ-MSCs on scaffolds, immersed in osteogenic medium, rendered the microenvironment in favor of hWJ-MSCs differentiation into osteoblast cells and extracellular matrix secretion. Finally, osteoblasts were immunologically positive for various osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase. Present findings indicate that nHA/CS/Gel scaffold appropriately harbored hWJ-MSCs, stimulating their growth, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. hWJ-MSCs-loaded nHA/CS/gel substitute may therefore be considered as a suitable platform for the rising demand in in vivo bone repair studies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Metabolic disturbances may present with non-specific symptoms and signs and can be easily missed if blood tests are not undertaken. Advancing age is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and is associated with a higher mortality and reduced renal recovery. Standard diagnostic criteria may miss acute kidney injury in the older patient. Sodium disturbances may be multifactorial and the cause may be more difficult to determine in the older patient. Symptoms and signs are largely related to speed of onset. Hypercalcaemia requiring emergency treatment is most often due to malignancy. This chapter includes: An outline of age related changes in the kidney Classification, management, and complications of acute kidney injury A summary of common causes of hyponatraemia A guide to the emergency management of hyponatraemia and hypercalcaemia

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell based therapies for the repair and regeneration of various tissues are of great interest for a high number of diseases. Adult stem cells, instead, are more available, abundant and harvested with minimally invasive procedures. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent progenitors, able to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and adipose tissues. Human adult adipose tissue seems to be the most abundant source of MSCs and, due to its easy accessibility; it is able to give a considerable amount of stem cells. In this study, we selected MSCs co-expressing CD34 and CD90 from adipose tissue. This stem cell population displayed higher proliferative capacity than CD34?CD90? cells and was able to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes (PPAR?+ and adiponectin+) and endothelial cells (CD31+VEGF+Flk1+). In addition, in methylcellulose without VEGF, it formed a vascular network. The aim of this study was to investigate differentiation potential of human adipose CD34+/CD90+ stem cells loaded onto commercial collagen sponges already used in clinical practice (Gingistat) both in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that human adult adipose and loose connective tissues can be obtained in vivo, highlighting that CD34+/CD90 ASCs are extremely useful for regenerative medicine.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - SUMMARY Patients with esophageal cancer may present with dysphagia and weight loss. Resectable lesions require consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which improves survival but have side effects, which compound already poor intake. Prevention of malnutrition has historically required interventions such as surgical jejunostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, which carry associated morbidity. With established roles in palliation, self-expanding removable metal stents (SERMS) may provide an alternative intervention in resectable disease. We sought to evaluate outcomes from our unit's introduction of SERMS in dysphagic patients prior to esophagectomy. All dysphagic patients presenting with esophageal cancer and considered for curative surgery between April 2006 and November 2008 were offered preoperative treatment of dysphagia with SERMS during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Baseline and preoperative outcomes assessed included dysphagia score and nutritional markers. Sixteen patients underwent esophageal stenting during neoadjuvant therapy of whom 7/16 (44%) were female with mean age 63 (53?76). In 12/16 (75%), tumors were located in the lower one third of the esophagus. There was a significant fall in mean dysphagia score from 2.5 (range 1?4) to 1.1 (range 0?3) immediately preoperatively. There was no significant change in serum albumin, weight, or body mass index. Stent-related morbidity occurred in 4/16 (25%) patients and stomach migration occurred in 7/16 (43.8%). All were resolved endoscopically and there was no stent-related mortality. Of 10/16 (62.5%) patients ultimately progressing to esophagectomy, 30-day mortality was 6.3%. Anastomotic leak occurred in one patient (10%) and R1 resection rate was 20%. SERMS are a safe and effective intervention in dysphagic patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancer. Complications are minor and readily treatable with endoscopy. Objective parameters suggest nutritional status is maintained and symptoms are improved. SERMS do not appear to compromise resection.

The protein binding of disopyramide was measured in plasma obtained from nonpregnant women, pregnant women in the first, second, and third trimesters, matched pairs of mothers and neonates (cord plasma), and 1 month postpartum women (n = 6 or 8 of each). 2. Plasma samples spiked with 0.2-12.0 micrograms ml-1 of the drug were ultrafiltered and the free fractions were measured with a fluorescent polarization immunoassay. 3. The mean (+/? s.d.) percentages of free drug at a total concentration of 3.0 micrograms ml-1 observed in the third trimester (46 +/? 9%) and neonate (79 +/? 5%) groups were greater (P less than 0.05 or 0.01) than that in the non-pregnant group (34 +/? 7%). In contrast, the corresponding value observed in the postpartum group (23 +/? 8%) was less (P less than 0.05) than that in the non-pregnant group. In addition, there was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the mean percentage of free drug at 3.0 micrograms ml-1 in plasma from mothers (43 +/? 9%) and neonates (79 +/? 5%). 4. A multiple regression analysis indicated that alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (r = -0.88, P less than 0.01), rather than albumin (r = -0.008), dominated the binding of disopyramide within the therapeutic range of drug concentration. An analysis of the binding parameters of disopyramide suggested that alterations in binding were attributable to changes in the capacity rather than the affinity of binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Abstract Electrodes can provide information on neural function and stimulate neural activity. These neural electrodes can provide remarkable benefit to people suffering physical trauma or neural disease. Traditional metal electrodes have shortcomings related to poor biostability, cytocompatibility, and a rigid structure that maps poorly to tissue. Organic conductors can be formed with various chemical and physical properties to create improved electrode-neural interfaces. The processability of organic conductors enables their use in advanced fabrication methods. This review details the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conducting polymers for neural interfacing. Construction of novel neural electrode architectures via advanced fabrication processes is also addressed.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Abstract Background To examine the outcomes of the implementation of a multidisciplinary nutrition support team (NST) that included a pharmacist for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records and compared between the pre-NST group (n = 73) and post-NST group (n = 75). Patients were included if they received enteral or parenteral nutrition support for at least 72 hours in the ICU of an approximately 900-bed, top-tier university medical center. The percentage of goal kcal, the percentage of goal protein, serum albumin level, total lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, duration of mechanical ventilation use, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and mortality were evaluated. Results There were significant differences in the percentage of goal kcal (66.9% ± 25.9% vs 86.2% ± 27.5%; P < 0.001) and the percentage of goal protein (67.0% ± 29.9% vs 81.7% ± 30.7%; P < 0.05) between the pre-NST and post-NST groups. A higher percentage of goal kcal was associated with a significant decrease in the ICU LOS (P < 0.05) and hospital LOS (P < 0.05). The percentage of goal kcal was associated with mortality rate (odd ratio, 0.977; 95% confidential interval, 0.959?0.996; P = 0.016). Conclusion Implementation of a multidisciplinary NST service for critically ill patients was associated with higher percentages of goal kcal and goal protein, as well as a shortened duration of mechanical ventilation use. Higher energy supply was associated with a reduced mortality rate.

AB  - A high mortality rate after hip arthroplasty has been reported in hemodialysis patients; however, there has been no previous study on predictors of mortality after hip arthroplasty so far. Objectives:? The purpose of the present study was to identify any risk factors associated with early death in hemodialysis patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. Methods:? We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients on hemodialysis who underwent hip arthroplasty between 1994 and 2001. The average age was 60 years, and the average hemodialysis duration was 116 months at the time of operation. Body mass index (BMI), operating time, and total blood loss were reviewed. Serum levels of albumin (Alb), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured preoperatively. Results:? Of these 34 patients, 9 died (26%). There were 2 perioperative deaths and 7 during follow-up period between 2 and 19 months. No significant difference was found with respect to patient age, hemodialysis duration, Alb, Ca, P, Alp, operating time, and total blood loss. Patients with lower BMI and PTH levels had an earlier mortality than patients with higher BMI and PTH levels (p?<?0.05 and p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? We conclude that despite an intensive care directed to our hemodialysis patients, the incidence of early death after hip arthroplasty is still high. If low BMI and serum levels of low PTH were detected before operation, we should pay special attention to early mortality after hip arthroplasty.

AB  - Summary Burns and dog-bite wounds can be superficial or extensive, involving muscle, bone, and vital organs. Bullet wounds may penetrate deeper tissues causing injury far from the point of entry. Burns that cover a large surface area result in substantial losses of fluids and electrolytes. Medications applied topically to burns should be easy to apply and should not interfere with healing. Horses that have incurred a bullet wound may require antimicrobial therapy, due to the penetration of a viscus, or a synovial structure. The bullet injures tissues directly in its path, and concussive forces injure tissue adjacent to the bullet's path. Dog-bite wounds are heavily contaminated and characterized by the presence of crushed, necrotic tissue. Damage to tissue caused by a bullet, a bite, or a burn progresses after injury, necessitating continuous re-evaluation of the wound.

AB  - Abstract Developmental and trauma-induced mechanism(s) that modify inflammation and immune responses in blood cells were recently found to be regulated by acetylcholine. Here, we report corresponding blood cell-specific changes in acetylcholinesterase splice variants. Plasmon resonance and flow cytometry using acetylcholinesterase variant-specific antibody probes, revealed a progressive increase in myeloid cell fractions expressing the apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase-S variant from newborns to adult controls and post-delivery mothers. Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R. Peripheral stimuli-induced modulations in acetylcholine regulation may hence reflect blood cell lineage-dependent acetylcholinesterase splice variations.
