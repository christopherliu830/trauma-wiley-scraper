AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed with a single port access system (SPAS) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective study. Animals Fifteen client-owned dogs with nonobstructive gallbladder disease. Methods Medical records were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, surgical findings, and outcome until suture removal. Results The SPAS was placed 1?cm caudal to the umbilicus. The procedure was completed with the SPAS alone in two cases. An additional cannula was added in 12 cases. In the last 10 cases, the additional cannula was placed at the beginning of the procedure. Dissection began at the cystic duct in 11 dogs (73%). In three cases (20%), the SPAS procedure was converted to a laparotomy; two of these conversions were elective, and one was emergent. The risk of conversion was affected by the experience of the surgeon (odds ratio = 0.53; P = .0105), and the rate of conversion was reduced when a cannula was added at the beginning of the procedure (P = .022). Fourteen dogs were discharged from the hospital. One dog died after being discharged due to severe cholangiohepatitis, and another dog died due to leakage of a gastrostomy tube. Conclusions The use of SPAS for cholecystectomy in dogs has an acceptable outcome. The experience gained by the surgeon and the addition of a cannula reduced the risk of conversion. Clinical Relevance/Impact Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a SPAS. The placement of an additional cannula at the beginning of the procedure is highly recommended.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 92?101. Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HCV on two markers of systemic inflammation, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HD patients. Methods:? The study included 118 HD patients (47% males, age 47?±?13 years, 9% diabetics) who were treated by on standard HD for at least 6 months. The patients were divided in two groups, depending on the presence (HCV+) or absence (HCV?) of serum antibodies against HCV. Serum albumin (S-Alb), plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), IL-6, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, and the values were compared with 22 healthy controls. Results:? The median of hsCRP, IL-6, and the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio were: 3.5 vs. 2.1?mg/L, p?<?0.05; 4.3 vs. 0.9?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001; and 0.8 vs. 2.7?pg/mL, p?<?0.0001 for patients and controls, respectively. Age, gender, S-Alb, IL-6, and hsCRP did not differ between the HCV+ and HCV? patients. However, HCV+ patients had higher ALT (29?±?21 vs. 21?±?25?UI/L) and had been a longer time on HD (6.1?±?3.0 vs. 4.0?±?2.0 years) (p?<?0.0001), respectively. Moreover, HCV+ patients had a significantly lower median hsCRP/IL-6 ratio (0.7 vs. 0.9; p?<?0.05) as compared to the HCV group. Conclusion:? The finding that the hsCRP/IL-6 ratio was lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV? patients suggests that hsCRP may be a less useful marker of inflammation in HCV+ patients and that a different cut-off value for hsCRP may be required to define inflammation in HD patients.

AB  - Stewart used physicochemical principles of aqueous solutions to develop an understanding of variables that control hydrogen ion concentration (H+) in body fluids. He proposed that H+ concentration in body fluids was determined by PCO2, strong ion difference (SID = sum of strong positive ion concentrations minus the sum of the strong anion concentrations) and the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acid (Atot) under normal circumstances. Albumin is the major weak acid in plasma and represents the majority of Atot. These 3 variables were defined as independent variables, which determined the values of all other relevant variables (dependent) in plasma, including H+. The major strong ions in plasma are sodium and chloride. The difference between Na+ and Cl- may be used as an estimation of SID. A decrease in SID below normal results in acidosis (increase in H+) and an increase in SID above normal results in alkalosis (decrease in H+). Unidentified strong anions such as lactate will decrease the SID, if present. Equations developed by Fencl allow Stewart's work to be easily applied clinically for evaluating the metabolic (nonrespiratory) contribution to acid-base balance. This approach separates the net metabolic abnormality into components, and allows one to easily detect mixed metabolic acid-base abnormalities. The Fencl approach provides insight into the nature and severity of the disturbances that exist in the patient. Sodium, chloride, protein, and unidentified anion derangements may contribute to the observed metabolic acid-base imbalance.

AB  - Inhibition of cAMP-dependent stimulation of vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium following haemorrhagic shock is mediated by reactive nitrogen species released within the airspaces of the lung. We tested here the hypothesis that the prior activation of the cellular heat shock or stress response, via exposure to either heat or geldanamycin, would attenuate the release of airspace nitric oxide (NO) responsible for the shock-mediated failure of the alveolar epithelium to respond to catecholamines in rats. Rats were haemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30?35 mmHg for 60 min, and then resuscitated with a 4 % albumin solution. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by change in concentration of a protein solution instilled into the airspaces 5 h after the onset of haemorrhage. Stress preconditioning restored the cAMP-mediated upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance after haemorrhage. The protective effect of stress preconditioning was mediated in part by a decrease in the expression of iNOS in the lung. Specifically, stress preconditioning decreased the production of nitrite by endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages removed from haemorrhaged rats or by A549 and rat alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers stimulated with cytomix (a mixture of TNF-α, IL-1? and IFN-?) for 24 h. In summary, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that stress preconditioning restores a normal fluid transport capacity of the alveolar epithelium in the early phase following haemorrhagic shock by attenuating NO-mediated oxidative stress to the lung epithelium.

AB  - Summary The quality of donor organs will determine the quality of life for the recipient and the importance of optimal management of the multi-organ donor is that the organs may benefit up to five, critically ill, patients. The basic principle is to maintain sufficient preload to minimise the need for inotropic support and it is recommended that all multiple organ donors should have central venous and arterial pressure monitoring in addition to adequate venous access. The importance of the choice of fluid for volume expansion and the management of the hormonal disturbances which follow brain death are considered.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the utility of capsule endoscopy to detect mucosal abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. METHODS Capsules were administered to 2 healthy controls and 8 patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Images were evaluated for quality, gastric emptying time, small intestinal transit time and presence of lesions. RESULTS There were no adverse effects of capsule endoscopy in dogs weighing from 7·7 to 58 kg. The capsule traversed the entire gastrointestinal tract in 5 of 8 patients, with high quality images obtained in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric emptying time and small intestinal transit time ranged from 1 to 270 and 15 to 180 minutes, respectively. In 3 of 8 patients, the capsule remained in the stomach despite pro-kinetics. Gastric lesions included mild haemorrhage and pinpoint erosion (4 of 8), a mass (1) and thickened bleeding pyloric mucosa (2). Two of 3 dogs with capsule retention had gastric lesions. Intestinal lesions included a healing duodenal ulcer, abnormal villi, ileal ulceration and colonic bleeding. Lesions identified by capsule endoscopy were considered a significant source of haemorrhage in 4 of 7 dogs with active bleeding. The relevance of pinpoint gastric mucosal erosions to blood loss is unclear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Capsule endoscopy can enable the non-invasive detection of gastric and small intestinal mucosal lesions in dogs presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Atherosclerotic lesion of coronary artery frequently accompanies intimal hyperplasia of radial artery. We have reported that the lesion of radial artery (intimal hyperplasia) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with early access failure (EAF) as well as ischemic heart disease (IHD) (Am J Kidney Dis. 2003; 41: 422?428). Objective:? This study was designed to determine the impact of IHD on the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 125 nondiabetic HD patients who received radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula operation for the first time. We evaluated IHD before the operation through clinical symptoms and electrocardiography and then investigated EAF within 1 year after the operation. We analyzed the access patency rates between the patients with and without IHD, using Kaplan?Meier method and log-rank test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors of the EAF. Results:? The mean age of the patients was 48?±?14 years, and the number of females was 54 (43.2%). Of the total 125 patients, 19 patients (15.4%) had IHD before the operation. The EAF developed in 23 patients (18.4%) within 1 years after the operation. The access patency rate in the patients with IHD was lower than that in the patients without IHD (39.7 vs. 88.3%, p?<?0.001). IHD and old age were independent risk factors of the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. But sex, smoking history, hypertension, and the levels of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, and total cholesterol checked before the operation were not associated with the EAF. Conclusion:? This study suggests that IHD is closely associated with EAF in nondiabetic HD patients.

AB  - Abstract Terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents could expose large numbers of people to ionizing radiation, and early biomarkers of radiation injury would be critical for triage, treatment, and follow-up of such individuals. However, no such biomarkers have yet been proven to exist. We tested the potential of high throughput proteomics to identify protein biomarkers of radiation injury after total body X-ray irradiation (TBI) in a rat model. Subtle functional changes in the kidney are suggested by increased glomerular permeability for macromolecules measured within 24?h after TBI. Ultrastructural changes in glomerular podocytes included partial loss of the interdigitating organization of foot processes. Analysis of urine by LC-MS/MS and 2-DE showed significant changes in the urine proteome within 24?h after TBI. Tissue kallikrein 1-related peptidase, cysteine proteinase inhibitor cystatin C and oxidized histidine were found to be increased while a number of proteinase inhibitors including kallikrein-binding protein and albumin were found to be decreased postirradiation. Thus, TBI causes immediately detectable changes in renal structure and function and in the urinary protein profile. This suggests that both systemic and renal changes are induced by radiation and it may be possible to identify a set of biomarkers unique to radiation injury.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Part I was an overview of the role and function of proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the pulpo?dentin complex; part II will focus on enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors. This review will discuss current knowledge regarding matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, serum proteins, and growth factors in dentin and the related dentin?pulp complex in an attempt to better understand their nature, role, and function in the dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Dentin formation in physiological and pathological conditions has been widely studied. However, the regulation and involvement of non-collageneous enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors are still not completely elucidated. MMPs, a family of 23 endopeptidases in humans, are collectively capable of degrading virtually all ECM components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases) participate in organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover, and pathological tissue destruction. Similarly, the lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) are capable of degrading ECM proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. These enzymes are implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue re-modeling states. Dentin also contains serum-derived proteins (such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and transferrin), and a variety of growth factors in the mineralized ECM are available for release during demineralization or other injury. A detailed description of the components of the above-mentioned dentin non-collageneous proteins will be summarized in this literature review.
