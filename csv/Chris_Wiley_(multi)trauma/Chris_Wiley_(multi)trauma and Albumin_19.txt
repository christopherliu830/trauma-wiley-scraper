AB  - Part I was an overview of the role and function of proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the pulpo?dentin complex; part II will focus on enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors. This review will discuss current knowledge regarding matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, serum proteins, and growth factors in dentin and the related dentin?pulp complex in an attempt to better understand their nature, role, and function in the dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Dentin formation in physiological and pathological conditions has been widely studied. However, the regulation and involvement of non-collageneous enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors are still not completely elucidated. MMPs, a family of 23 endopeptidases in humans, are collectively capable of degrading virtually all ECM components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases) participate in organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover, and pathological tissue destruction. Similarly, the lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) are capable of degrading ECM proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. These enzymes are implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue re-modeling states. Dentin also contains serum-derived proteins (such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and transferrin), and a variety of growth factors in the mineralized ECM are available for release during demineralization or other injury. A detailed description of the components of the above-mentioned dentin non-collageneous proteins will be summarized in this literature review.

AB  - The gender- and age-related binding characteristics of valproic acid to serum proteins were determined in the pediatric population. Serum samples examined in the study were obtained from 61 pediatric patients (28 males, 33 females) with epilepsy on valproic acid monotherapy. Their ages ranged from 1to 15 years (mean age with [SD]: 7.8 [3.9] years; < 10 years, n = 41; /10 years, n = 20). The in vivo population binding parameters of valproic acid to serum proteins and theoretical minimal unbound serum fraction (fu) of valproic acid were determined in (1) all, (2) male and female subgroups, and (3) prepubescent (< 10 years) and pubescent (/10 years) subgroups. The association constant (K) was approximately 1.4 times higher in male (0.018 L/?mol) than in female (0.013 L/?mol) patients, while the total concentration of binding sites (n(Pt)) was 1.2 times greater in female (1235 ?mol/L) than in male (997 mmol/L) patients. The fu was 0.053 and 0.059 for male and female patients, respectively. The value of K was approximately 1.6 times higher in the pubescent (0.019 L/?mol) than in the prepubescent (0.012 L/?mol) patients, while the n(Pt) was 1.2 times higher in the prepubescent (1244 ?mol/L) than in the pubescent (1057 ?mol/L) patients. The fu was 0.063 for the prepubescent and 0.047 for the pubescent patients. No significant differences were observed in binding characteristics of valproic acid to serum proteins between male and female or younger and older patients. However, the differences in valproic acid binding to serum proteins appear to be relatively larger in binding affinity than in binding capacity between the two groups. Because no significant differences were observed in serum concentrations of total and unbound valproic acid, albumin, or free fatty acids between any subgroups (male and female, younger and older), the results suggest that gender or age may not be factors for the determination of the binding characteristics of valproic acid to serum proteins in pediatric patients.

AB  - Frequent or occasional symptomatic intradialytic hypotension during hemodialysis may influence patients' well being, but its effects on survival, independent of comorbidities, have not previously been investigated. Objective:? To assess the effect of frequent (f-IDH) or occasional (o-IDH) dialysis-associated hypotension on survival. Methods:? During the run in period in 1998, 77 patients with f-IDH (≥10 hypotensive events/10 months, responding only to medical intervention) and 101 patients with o-IDH (1 or 2 events/10 months) were identified among all 958 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients of a network. Eighty-five patients who had no hypotensive episodes (no-IDH) served as controls. Patients were followed for a median of 27 months (range 0.3?37), and survival of patients was compared by log-rank test. Independent association of f-IDH and o-IDH on survival, compared to no-IDH, was assessed by proportional hazards model that included patient's demographics, laboratory data, comorbidity as well as medications. Results:? Forty-five patients (58%) with f-IDH, 47 (47%) with o-IDH, and 33 (39%) with no-IDH died during the follow up that represents mortality rates of 37 (p?=?0.013 vs. no-IDH), 26 (p =?0.375 vs. no-IDH), and 21 deaths/100?patient years in the three groups, respectively. In multivariate proportional hazards regression, where age, sex, time on dialysis, CHD, diabetes, Kt/V, albumin level, use of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates have been adjusted for, neither f-IDH nor o-IDH was associated with survival. Conclusion:? Mortality in patients with f-IDH is significantly higher than in those without such events. Our data, however, did not provide evidence that f-IDH, independent of age and comorbidities, contributes to mortality in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Introduction? The significant changes, which have affected departments of medicine over the last two decades, have been much editorialized. Surprisingly few data have been published that document these changes. We describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted to one hospital's departments of internal medicine. Methods? During a 3?months prospective study, 1039 patients (46% of all 2277 new admissions to the departments of medicine, consisting of ±?175 beds) were randomized for inclusion. Information was extracted from the medical records regarding ?demography; ?functional ?capacity; ?clinical ?data ?and ?outcome. Results? The mean age of the patients was 72?±?16?years (mean?±?SD); 51% were male, 56% were married, and 83% lived at home. Although 293 patients (28%) were defined as dependent, the majority lived at home (170, 58%). Cognition was normal in only 74%. The four most common disease categories leading to admission were infections (383 patients, 37%), cardiovascular disorders (372, 36%), respiratory conditions (284, 27%) and genito-urinary problems (90, 9%). Overall, 98 persons died (9%). Independent risk factors for death were: mechanical ventilation; a ?do not resuscitate? order; a high APACHE-II score; a low serum albumin level; higher age; and not being married (P?<?0.01).? Conclusions? Geriatric patients occupy a central position in our medical wards. These data are relevant for allocation of special resources for departments with high proportions of geriatric patients; for the design of employment conditions that ascertains continuing job satisfaction; as well as for the planning of teaching opportunities for residents and students.

AB  - Background and purpose Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIP/CIM) is being increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in critically ill children especially if they have spent long periods in the intensive care unit. So the aim was to determine the frequency of CIP/CIM amongst mechanically ventilated children and to analyse the associated risk factors and drawbacks frequently encountered in this cohort. Methods The study included 105 patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit who underwent mechanical ventilation for ≥7 days. These patients were screened daily for awakening. Patients with severe muscle weakness on day 7 post-awakening underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Accordingly, the patients were classified as CIP/CIM patients if they had abnormal neurophysiology studies or control patients if normal neurophysiology studies were obtained. Their clinical and laboratory profiles had been recorded as well. Results Overall, of 105 patients who achieved satisfactory awakening, 34 patients (32.4%) developed CIP/CIM mostly of the axonal polyneuropathy pattern (27.6%) whilst 71 control patients (67.6%) showed normal electrophysiological studies. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in patients with CIP/CIM compared to control patients (P = 0.001). The study also revealed that 62.1% of our CIP/CIM patients failed weaning trials and finally died. CIP/CIM was significantly associated with decreased platelets, elevated liver enzymes and prolonged prothrombin time. Acidosis, low serum calcium and albumin levels and higher blood glucose were also found to be more significant in CIP/CIM patients compared to control patients. Conclusion Critically ill children frequently develop CIP/CIM, mostly of axonal polyneuropathy pattern, which compromises rehabilitation and recovery and is associated with a number of comorbidities.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of malnutrition in the hospitalized setting is 30% to 55%. Previous studies reported an association of malnutrition with an increased hospital length of stay (LOS), morbidity, and mortality of patients. This study evaluated the role of early nutrition intervention on LOS, diagnosis coding of malnutrition cases, calculating case mix index, and reducing delays in implementing nutrition support to patients. Methods: Demographic data, anthropometric measurements, LOS, and serum albumin levels were collected from 400 patients in 2 medical wards to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and potential delays in nutrition consultation. Based on these results, a nutrition intervention study was conducted in 1 ward; the other ward served as a control. Patients were classified as normally nourished or malnourished. Multivariate general linear regressions were used to reveal the impact of intervention on the change in LOS, controlling for other potential confounding factors on the cohort and a subset with severe malnutrition. Results: Of the 400 patients assessed, 53% had malnutrition. Multiple general linear regressions showed that nutrition intervention reduced LOS an average of 1.93 days in the cohort group and 3.2 days in the severe malnourished group. Case mix index and female gender were positively associated with LOS in the malnourished group. Nutrition intervention reduced the delays in implementing nutrition support to patients by 47%. Conclusions: Results highlight the positive impact of nutrition intervention in terms of reduced LOS in malnourished hospital patients. Reduction in LOS with diagnosis coding of malnutrition cases yielded substantial economic benefits.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare short-term postoperative mortality in dogs after splenectomy performed with or without a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) and to identify variables associated with mortality. Study design Retrospective study. Sample population Client-owned dogs (n = 203). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent splenectomy from 2005-2018 were reviewed. Mortality rates were compared between dogs that underwent splenectomy with or without BVSD. Causes of death and variables associated with short-term mortality were assessed. Results Fifteen of 203 (7.4%) dogs died prior to discharge, and seven (3.4%) dogs died prior to suture removal for a total short-term mortality rate of 22 of 203 (10.8%). The estimated difference in proportion of deaths prior to discharge between the BVSD and non-BVSD groups was ?0.01 (95% confidence interval = ?0.08 to 0.06). Duration of anesthesia was longer when splenectomy was performed without BVSD (median 168 vs 152?minutes; P = .03). Multivariate analysis identified intraoperative (odds ratio [OR] 5.7) or postoperative (OR 13.6) administration of blood products, increasing duration of anesthesia (OR 1.15 per additional 16?minutes), and intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias (OR 6.8) as significantly associated with death prior to discharge. Intraoperative (OR 3.2) or postoperative (OR 7.7) administration of blood products was associated with death prior to suture removal. Conclusion Use of a BVSD did not appear to increase short-term mortality after splenectomy. Clinical significance Dogs undergoing splenectomy that require intraoperative or postoperative transfusions, experience intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias, or have prolonged anesthesia may be at risk for death in the short-term postoperative period.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Background and purpose Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, but the cause remains unknown. Changes to the proteome prior to first symptom onset may reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Methods This preliminary study utilized pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic serum from a sample of 100 incident population-based US military veterans with MS along with 100 matched healthy controls. All samples were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Multidimensional protein identification technology tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on tryptic peptides of lectin-captured glycosylated serum proteins following albumin/immunoglobulin G depletion. Identified proteins were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program. Results The mean intervals between first symptom onset and the collection of pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic sera were ?6.0 and +1.1 years, respectively. Pre-symptomatic proteins from the MS group were differentially regulated compared with both control groups indicating that proteomic changes are detected prior to symptom onset. Pathway analysis showed that proteins involved in the complement and coagulation pathways and lipid transport are significantly altered in the serum of subjects with MS compared with healthy donors. Conclusions Compared with healthy controls, differential proteomic changes were noted in the serum of patients with MS that preceded the onset of symptomatic disease. Further work is in progress to confirm or refute these findings.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis, a pro-inflammatory state that alters tubular handling of filtered albumin. We hypothesized that dipstick albuminuria (DA) is associated with a lower rate of AKI recovery in septic patients. Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of adults with sepsis-associated AKI in an urban academic intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with unknown baseline serum creatinine (SCr), absent urinalysis, and those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min per 1.73m2 or receiving chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. The independent variable was DA (negative or trace, 30 mg/dL, and ≥100 mg/dL) within the first 72 h of ICU stay. The outcome variable was AKI recovery at 30 days following hospital discharge, defined as the last SCr returning to a level less than 1.5 times the baseline SCr level and independence of RRT. Results A total of 988 patients were included in the study. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days. The patients with higher degree of DA had worse critical illness scores. After adjustment for several confounders, DA ≥30 mg/dL was independently associated with ?no AKI recovery? at 30 days post-discharge (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01?1.95 for DA =30 mg/dL and 1.67, 1.15?2.42 for DA ≥100 mg/dL, P =?0.02). Other independent predictors of ?no AKI recovery? were cumulative fluid balance, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, exposure to diuretics, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusion Dipstick albuminuria ≥30 mg/dL is independently associated with lower rate of AKI recovery at 30 days post-discharge. Our findings emphasize the potential utility of a simple routine test of DA in the risk-stratification of AKI recovery in ICU septic patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.
