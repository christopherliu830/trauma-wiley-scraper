AB  - Background: Few data are available to establish recommendations for trace element supplementation during critical illness. This study quantified the loss of several elements and assessed the adequacy of manganese and selenium in parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods: Men with traumatic injuries were grouped by renal status: adequate (POLY; n = 6), acute failure with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH; n = 2), or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD; n = 4). PN supplied 300 ?g/d manganese and 60 ?g/d selenium. Urine and effluent (from artificial kidneys) were collected for 3 days and analyzed for boron, manganese, nickel, and silicon using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, and for selenium using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: POLY manganese and selenium excretion averaged (standard deviation [SD]) 7.9 (3.3)? g/d and 103.5 (22.4) ?g/d, respectively. All elements except selenium were detected in dialysate (prior to use). CVVHD effluent contained 3.5 and 7.3 times more manganese and nickel than CVVH ultrafiltrate, respectively. Loss of manganese averaged 2.6%, 21%, and 73% of PN amounts for POLY, CVVH, and CVVHD groups, respectively. Discussion: Minimal loss of manganese compared with the amount in PN suggests that excessive amounts are retained. POLY patients excreted more selenium than was in PN, indicating negative balance. POLY losses of boron and silicon were less than that published for healthy adults, reflecting less than typical intake, whereas loss during CVVH was in the normal reference range, possibly because of added intake from boron contamination of replacement fluids. All patients lost more nickel than amounts published for healthy adults. Conclusions: Current guidelines of 60-100 ?g/d of parenteral manganese may be excessive for trauma patients. The uptake of manganese and nickel from contaminants in CVVHD dialysate should be investigated.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - SUMMARY Two patients who presented with skin fragility and a bullous eruption were found to have amyloid deposits along the epidermal basement membrane. In both cases a basement membrane similar to that observed in pemphigoid was seen on direct immunofluorescence resulting from the non-specific absorption of immunoglobulins by the amyloid deposits. Evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia was found in both patients, one of whom developed nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Neutron activation analysis has been used to determine the total content in the body of N, K, Na, Cl, P and Ca in 25 critically ill surgical patients before and after a 14-day course of intravenous nutrition. Muscle elemental compostion was also determined in these patients at the same time as the total body analysis. Over the 14-day period of intravenous feeding the total body contents of all the measured elements increased (2?9Â·7 per cent) but only the increase in K was statistically significant. Muscle chemistry suggested an intracellular K depletion which was corrected over the study period. The results of the total body multi-element analysis were interpreted to show a mean gain of 1Â·25 l of extracellular fluid and 0Â·51 l of intracellular fluid and direct measurement of total body water suggested that this interpretation was probably valid. The first application of the technique to patients with nutritional and metabolic problems has quantified the weight gained by two body compartments during a 2-week period of intravenous nutrition. Its further application should help to solve a number of nutritional and metabolic problems in clinical surgery.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - Abstract Background The management of hepatic hemangiomas remains ill defined. This study sought to investigate the indications, surgical management and outcomes of patients who underwent a resection for hepatic hemangiomas. Methods A retrospective review from six major liver centres in the United States identifying patients who underwent surgery for hepatic hemangiomas was performed. Clinico-pathological, treatment and peri-operative data were evaluated. Results Of the 241patients who underwent a resection, the median age was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39?53] and 85.5% were female. The median hemangioma size was 8.5?cm (IQR: 6?12.1). Surgery was performed for abdominal symptoms (85%), increasing hemangioma size (11.3%) and patient anxiety (3.7%). Life-threatening complications necessitating a hemangioma resection occurred in three patients (1.2%). Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications occurred in 14 patients (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.8% (n = 2). Of patients with abdominal symptoms, 63.2% reported improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Conclusion A hemangioma resection can be safely performed at high-volume institutions. The primary indication for surgery remains for intractable symptoms. The development of severe complications associated with non-operative management remains a rare event, ultimately challenging the necessity of additional surgical indications for a hemangioma resection.

AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 Â± 11 years, mean Â± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 Â± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 Â± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 Â± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.

AB  - Wounding of Norway spruce by inoculation with sterile agar, or agar containing the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica, induced traumatic resin duct formation in the stem. Visible anatomical responses occurred in the cambium 6?9 d post-inoculation. Near the inoculation site cellular proliferation, polyphenolic accumulation, and lignification were induced as a wound reaction to seal the damaged area. Five centimetres from the inoculation site cells in the cambial zone swelled and divided to form clusters. By 18 d post-inoculation, these cells began to differentiate into resin duct epithelial cells surrounding incipient schizogenous lumens. Mature axial traumatic ducts appeared by 36 d as a row of ducts in the xylem centripetal to the cambium. The ducts formed an interconnected network continuous with radial resin ducts. Parenchyma cells surrounding the ducts accumulated polyphenols that disappeared as the cells differentiated into tracheids. These polyphenols appeared to contain fewer sugar residues compared to those accumulating in the secondary phloem, as indicated by the periodic acid?Schiff's staining. The epithelial cells did not accumulate polyphenols but contained immunologically detectable phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), indicating synthesis of phenolics as a possible resin component. These findings may represent a defense mechanism in Norway spruce against the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica.

This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To determine whether pre- and post-operative administration of intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) can significantly decrease pain and morphine use when compared with placebo in adult orthopedic surgical patients. Design.? This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting.? This study was completed at eight hospitals; six in the United States and two in South Africa. Patients.? A total of 185 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Interventions.? Patients were randomized to receive either 800?mg IV-ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours, with the first dose administered pre-operatively. Additionally, all patients had access to intravenous morphine for rescue. Outcome Measures.? Efficacy of IV-ibuprofen was demonstrated by measuring the patient's self assessment of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; assessed with movement and at rest) and a verbal response scale (VRS). Morphine consumption during the post-operative period was also assessed. Results.? In the immediate post-operative period, there was a 25.8% reduction in mean area under the curve-VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM) in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen (P?<?0.001); a 31.8% reduction in mean AUC-VAS assessed at rest (AUC-VASR; P?<?0.001) and a 20.2% reduction in mean VRS (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Patients receiving IV-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events. Conclusion.? Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.
