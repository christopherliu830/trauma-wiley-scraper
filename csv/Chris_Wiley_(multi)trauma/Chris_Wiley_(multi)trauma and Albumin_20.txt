AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2009) 109, 911?922. Abstract Adrenal chromaffin cells synthesize and secrete catecholamines and neuropeptides that may regulate hormonal and paracrine signaling in stress and also during inflammation. The aim of our work was to study the role of the cytokine interleukin-1? (IL-1?) on catecholamine release and synthesis from primary cell cultures of human adrenal chromaffin cells. The effect of IL-1? on neuropeptide Y (NPY) release and the intracellular pathways involved in catecholamine release evoked by IL-1? and NPY were also investigated. We observed that IL-1? increases the release of NPY, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EP) from human chromaffin cells. Moreover, the immunoneutralization of released NPY inhibits catecholamine release evoked by IL-1?. Moreover, IL-1? regulates catecholamine synthesis as the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase decreases IL-1?-evoked catecholamine release and the cytokine induces tyrosine hydroxylase Ser40 phosphorylation. Moreover, IL-1? induces catecholamine release by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism, and by nitric oxide synthase activation. Furthermore, MAPK, protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and nitric oxide (NO) production are involved in catecholamine release evoked by NPY. Using human chromaffin cells, our data suggest that IL-1?, NPY, and nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to a regulatory loop between the immune and the adrenal systems, and this is relevant in pathological conditions such as infection, trauma, stress, or in hypertension.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - Abstract In diabetes, the number of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) decreases and their differentiation is impaired. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Patients with diabetes often experience sympathetic nerve injury. Norepinephrine (NE), a major mediator of the sympathetic nervous system, influences rat MSC migration in culture and in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of NE on MSCs under high glucose conditions; therefore MSCs were treated with high glucose and NE. High glucose-induced MSCs apoptosis, which was reversed by NE. To verify the effect of NE, mice underwent sympathectomy and were used to establish a diabetic model. Diabetic mice with sympathectomy had a higher apoptosis rate and higher levels of reactive oxygen species in their bone marrow-derived cells than diabetic mice without sympathectomy. High glucose inhibited p-AKT production and B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 expression, and promoted BAX and caspase-3 expression. NE reversed these effects of high glucose. An AKT inhibitor enhanced the effects of high glucose. Thus, NE had a protective effect on MSC apoptosis induced by high glucose, possibly via the AKT/BCL-2 pathway.

AB  - A 20-month-old, female French bulldog was presented with a three-month history of generalised seizures and progressive ataxia with occasional falling over on either side. Neurological examination revealed signs, suggesting a multifocal intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two connected lesions on the left side of the caudal brainstem and a further lesion in the cerebrum. The dog was euthanased, and histopathological examination revealed lesions which closely resembled those of necrotising encephalitis in Yorkshire terriers. This is the first case describing this type of necrotising encephalitis in a French bulldog.

AB  - Abstract History CaridianBCT apheresis machines require a ~285 mL priming volume (extracorporeal blood) that is withdrawn from the patient in ~10 minutes. Therefore, apheresis in dogs has generally been limited to dogs > ~20 kg to assure <20% of the blood volume is removed in the priming phase. Animals/physical examination Three dogs weighing <14 kg (13.6, 10.5, and 9.9 kg) with lymphoma that underwent apheresis. Management The dogs were premedicated for placement of apheresis catheters with hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) IM. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, to effect, intravenously and general anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Following catheter placement, dogs were allowed to recover from isoflurane but were kept sedated with either a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) or a propofol CRI. Real time autologous blood priming was not performed in any of the dogs. Instead, priming solutions were composed of a combination of hetastarch, lactated Ringer's solution, and/or autologous blood that was harvested 4 days before the procedure. During apheresis, dogs received anticoagulant citrate-dextrose, solution-A (ACD-A) to prevent clotting and 10% calcium gluconate as needed to maintain normal ionized calcium concentrations. Dogs were monitored for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary stability, anemia and lactic acidosis. Follow-up All of the dogs had cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary values within clinically acceptable ranges. Immediately following apheresis all of the dogs were mildly to moderately anemic (PCV; 17?35%) although none of the dogs required a transfusion or had an increased lactate concentration. Conclusions Dogs as small as 9.9 kg can successfully undergo apheresis with a variety of priming solutions. Dexmedetomidine or propofol given as a CRI provides sufficient sedation for this procedure.

AB  - Summary. Background: B-domain-deleted recombinant factor VIII (BDDrFVIII) was developed when the B-domain was found to be redundant for maintaining haemostasis. This allows formulation of the final product without albumin added as a stabilizer. Methods: Three multicentre clinical studies and one pharmacokinetic study were conducted in 218 patients to evaluate the safety and haemostatic efficacy of BDDrFVIII. Results: Previously treated patients (n = 113; median duration, 1711 days; median exposure days, 385; total 98 096 287 IU infused) rated 97?99% of all infusions as good or excellent efficacy. FVIII inhibitor was noted in one patient in the previously treated patient cohort after 113 exposure days. Among 101 previously untreated patients, responses to BDDrFVIII were rated as excellent or good in 92?95% of infusions (median duration, 1413 days; median exposure days, 148; total 12 636 458 IU infused). Thirty-two previously untreated patients developed inhibitors after a median duration of 12 exposure days (range, 3?49). Sixteen of 32 (50%) patients had low levels (≤?5 Bethesda units) and 16 had high levels of inhibitors. Inhibitors disappeared in six of 14 (43%) of the high-level and six of eight (75%) of the low-level patients who underwent immune tolerance induction therapy. A total of 42 patients underwent surgery and the overall efficacy of BDDrFVIII was rated as excellent or good for 99.6% of infusions. Conclusions: The results of these clinical studies indicate that BBDrFVIII is safe and effective and has haemostatic activity similar to that of full-length FVIII concentrates.

AB  - Summary Major burn injury remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. With advances in burn care and with the development of experienced multi-disciplinary teams at regionalized burn centers, many children are surviving severe burn injury. As members of the multi-disciplinary care team, anesthesia providers are called upon to care for these critically ill children. These children provide several anesthetic challenges, such as difficult airways, difficult vascular access, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, altered temperature regulation, sepsis, cardiovascular instability, and increased requirements of muscle relaxants and opioids. The anesthesia provider must understand the physiologic derangements that occur with severe burn injury as well as the subsequent anesthetic implications.

Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.

AB  - Summary Epilepsy can be a devastating disorder. In addition to debilitating seizures, epilepsy can cause cognitive and emotional problems with reduced quality of life. Therefore, the major aim is to prevent the disorder in the first place: identify, detect, and reverse the processes responsible for its onset, and monitor and treat its progression. Epilepsy often occurs following a latent period of months to years (epileptogenesis) as a consequence of a brain insult, such as head trauma, stroke, or status epilepticus. Although this latent period clearly represents a therapeutic window, we are not able to stratify patients at risk for long-term epilepsy, which is prerequisite for preventative clinical trials. Moreover, because of the length of the latent period, an early biomarker for treatment response would be of high value. Finally, mechanistic biomarkers of epileptogenesis may provide more profound insight in the process of disease development.

AB  - Summary Obesity is rising in the obstetric population, yet there is an absence of services and guidance for the management of maternal obesity. This systematic review aimed to investigate relationships between obesity and impact on obstetric care. Literature was systematically searched for cohort studies of pregnant women with anthropometric measurements recorded within 16-weeks gestation, followed up for the term of the pregnancy, with at least one obese and one comparison group. Two researchers independently data-extracted and quality-assessed each included study. Outcome measures were those that directly or indirectly impacted on maternity resources. Primary outcomes included instrumental delivery, caesarean delivery, duration of hospital stay, neonatal intensive care, neonatal trauma, haemorrhage, infection and 3rd/4th degree tears. Meta-analysis shows a significant relationship between obesity and increased odds of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, haemorrhage, infection, longer duration of hospital stay and increased neonatal intensive care requirement. Maternal obesity significantly contributes to a poorer prognosis for mother and baby during delivery and in the immediate post-partum period. National clinical guidelines for management of obese pregnant women, and public health interventions to help safeguard the health of mothers and their babies are urgently required.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score has been extensively used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation and determine their prognosis, but with limited predictive value. Autonomic dysfunction may correlate with increased mortality after liver transplant. In this study, two autonomic biomarkers, complexity and deceleration capacity, were added to the predicting model for 1-year mortality after liver transplantation. Methods In all, 30 patients with end-stage liver diseases awaiting liver transplantation were included. Complexity and deceleration capacity were calculated by multi-scale entropy and phase-rectified signal averaging, respectively. Different combinations of autonomic factors and MELD score were used to predict mortality rate of liver transplant after 1-year follow-up. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to determine clinical predictability. Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve represents the overall accuracy. Results The 1-year mortality rate was 16.7% (5/30). The overall accuracy of MELD score used for predicting mortality after liver transplantation was 0.752. By adding complexity and deceleration capacity into the predicting model, the accuracy increased to 0.912. Notably, the accuracy of the prediction using complexity and deceleration capacity alone was 0.912. Conclusion Complexity and deceleration capacity, which represent different dynamical properties of a human autonomic system, are critical factors for predicting mortality rate of liver transplantation. We recommend that these pre-operative autonomic factors may be helpful as critical adjuncts to predicting model of mortality rate in prioritizing organ allocation.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) is superior to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in terms of survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. However, assistance from family members in performing HHD is not always available to patients, and professional assistance for HHD can be cost prohibitive. For certain patients, ICHD can be impractical due to difficulties in transportation, which may necessitate ambulance transportation or hospitalization for in-hospital hemodialysis (IHHD). We describe 4 patients that have had problems receiving ICHD for various reasons. Two of these patients had problems with transportation, while the other two could not remain on dialysis for the prescribed duration of time and, therefore, received inadequate dialysis. These patients had difficulty while receiving ICHD in meeting the adequacy criteria set by Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative. One of these patients had a neuropsychiatric disorder and displayed disruptive behavior. When these 4 patients were switched to staff-assisted home hemodialysis (SAHD), the dialysis core indicators improved compared with ICHD, and the patients needed significantly fewer hospitalization days. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in patients that cannot be easily transferred, and in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, SAHD can be a less expensive and more efficacious modality of dialysis.

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.
