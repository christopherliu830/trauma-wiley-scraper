AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Cases were solicited from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology Diplomate listserv. Medical records of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma diagnosed via a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry with or without analysis of polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, chemotherapy protocol, response to treatment, date of first progression, rescue therapies and date and cause of death or last follow-up visit were collected. Results Twenty cases were included. Males and small breed dogs were over-represented. Frequent clinical signs included weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most lymphomas were T-cell phenotype (95%), and epitheliotropism was commonly described (60%). Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement or both were frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Two dogs had resection of an intestinal mass, and all dogs were treated with chemotherapy; chlorambucil and prednisone were most commonly prescribed. Overall response rate was 70%, and median survival time was 424?days (95% confidence interval: 105 to 1206?days). Clinical Significance Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma appears to be a rare condition in dogs, and treatment with chemotherapy results in a high response rate and favourable survival times. Further study is needed to determine its prevalence in dogs with chronic enteropathies.

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - Abstract To evaluate the effect of donor age on graft and patient outcome after liver transplantation an analysis of a large-scale cohort study was performed at three tertiary referral liver transplant centers. Between April 1990 and June 1994, 772 adults underwent an initial single-organ liver transplantation. The age of the donors averaged 35 years;193 (25%) were 50 or above, the age used to define ?older? donors. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and biochemical features. Outcome was measured using results of biochemical tests after transplantation and by graft and patient survival. Compared with younger donors, older donors were more commonly women (59% vs. 33%:P ≤ .001) and died of central nervous system causes (79% vs. 28%) as opposed to trauma (13% vs. 63%:P ≤ .001). The recipients of the two groups of donor livers did not differ in important respects. However, intraoperatively, livers from older donors were more likely to be assessed as either ?poor? or ?fair? as opposed to ?good? (17% vs. 4%:P ≤ .001) by the harvesting surgeon and to have initial ?poor? or ?fair? bile production (29% vs. 18%:P ≤ .001). During the first week postoperatively, the serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and prothrombin times were higher in recipients of older than those of younger donor livers. During follow-up, graft survival was less for recipients of older donor livers at 3 months (81% vs.91%:P = .0001) and at 1 (76% vs. 85%:P = .007) and 2 years (71% vs. 80%:P = .005); patient survival showed similar though less marked differences. This association of donor age and poorer graft survival persisted after adjusting for many variables using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Importantly, however, the association with poor graft survival was largely among recipients of older donor livers, the quality of which was assessed as fair or poor by the harvesting surgeon; recipients of older donor livers assessed as good had a retransplant-free survival similar to that of younger donor livers (87% vs. 91% at 3 months). Thus, use of older donor livers, the quality of which are judged to be good by the harvesting surgeon, is not associated with a decrease in patient or graft survival after liver transplantation. differences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5?percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3?percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.

AB  - Summary We have proposed that fibrin and hyaluronan (HA) are macromolecular regulators during inflammation and wound healing. Here we extend our studies to characterize the specific interaction between fibrin(ogen) and HA. 125I-labelled HA (Mr ≈ 32000) was bound by plastic surfaces coated with human fibrinogen but not bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, ?-lactoglobin or rabbit immunoglobulin G. 125I-labelled fibrinogen bound to a unique hexylamine derivative of HA coupled to Sepharose and was eluted specifically by HA oligosaccharides in a size-dependent manner. A dot blot assay, in which proteins are adsorbed to nitrocellulose and probed with 125I-HA, also showed specific binding to human fibrinogen. This assay was used to examine fibrinogens from other mammalian species. No specific 125I-HA binding was observed with the protein from horse, rat or cow. Significant binding was detected with human, sheep, rabbit, dog, baboon, goat and pig fibrinogens. Thrombin-induced formation of fibrin clots is also affected by HA, which decreases the lag time before clotting and increases the rate of clot formation. The rate of fibrin polymerization increased over 500% in the presence of 60 µM HA. Furthermore, the structure of the fibrin gel, as assessed by light scattering, was altered by HA or chondroitin sulphate in a concentration-dependent manner. The results support the proposed wound-healing model and indicate that an increase in circulating HA levels could adversely affect haemostasis and increase the risk of thrombosis or bleeding. The interaction between HA and fibrinogen emphasizes the importance of the liver endothelial cell HA receptor in the removal of glycosaminoglycans from the blood. Cultured cells continuously endocytosing 125I-HA for 4 h reutilized their total cellular HA receptors at least once every 50 min even in the presence of cycloheximide. This endocytotic receptor was therefore shown to be part of a recycling system.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - Abstract We have developed an organotypic culture system that allows the production of bone tissue features on a centimeter scale. A composite, calcium phosphate?strained fibrin gel system is able to organize itself in the presence of osteoblastic cells, creating basic hierarchical units as seen in vivo, and can be modified to produce a range of other tissues that require such directional structuring. Constructs evolve over time into multi-compositional structures containing a high mineral content and terminally differentiated, osteocyte-like cells. These tissues can be cultured over extended durations (exceeding 1 year) and are responsive to a variety of chemical and biological agents. The platform can reduce the number of animals used in experimentation by acting as an intermediate stage in which more personalized research conditions can be generated. We provide a thorough description of the protocol used to successfully culture and modify this system, as well as guidance on compositional characterization. ? 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dental cementum covering the tooth root is similar to bone in several respects but remains poorly understood in terms of development and differentiation of cementoblasts, as well as the potential function(s) of cementocytes residing in the cellular cementum. It is not known if the cementocyte is a dynamic actor in cementum metabolism, comparable to the osteocyte in the bone. Cementocytes exhibit irregular spacing and lacunar shape, with fewer canalicular connections compared with osteocytes. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the in vivo expression profile of cementocytes paralleled that of osteocytes, including expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1/DMP1), Sost/sclerostin, E11/gp38/podoplanin, Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin [OPG]), and Tnfsf11 (receptor activator of NF-?B ligand [RANKL]). We used the Immortomouse+/?; Dmp1-GFP+/? mice to isolate cementocytes as Dmp1-expressing cells followed by immortalization using the interferon (IFN)-?-inducible promoter driving expression of a thermolabile large T antigen to create the first immortalized line of cementocytes, IDG-CM6. This cell line reproduced the expression profile of cementocytes observed in vivo, including alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. IDG-CM6 cells expressed higher levels of Tnfrsf11b and lower levels of Tnfsf11 compared with IDG-SW3 osteocytes, and under fluid flow shear stress, IDG-CM6 cells significantly increased OPG while decreasing RANKL, leading to a significantly increased OPG/RANKL ratio, which would inhibit osteoclast activation. These studies indicate similarities yet potentially important differences in the function of cementocytes compared with osteocytes and support cementocytes as mechanically responsive cells. ? 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a model estimating the probability of a patient aged 80 years or older having functional limitations 2 months and 12 months after being hospitalized. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four teaching hospitals in the US. PARTICIPANTS: Enrolled patients were nonelective hospital admissions aged 80 years or older who stayed in hospital at least 48 hours. The 804 patients who survived and completed an interview at 2 months and the 450 who completed an interview at 12 months were from the 1266 patients in the Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project (HELP) (76% and 47% of survivors, respectively). Median age of the 2-month survivors was 84.7 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Patient function 2 and 12 months after enrollment was defined by the number of dependencies in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to predict functional status. Predictors included demographic characteristics, disease category, geriatric conditions, severity of physiologic imbalance, current quality of life, and exercise capacity and ADLs 2 weeks before study admission. RESULTS: Before admission, 39% of patients were functionally independent in ADLs. Of patients who survived and were interviewed at 2 months, 32% were functionally independent, and at 12 months, 36% were independent. Among patients with no baseline dependencies, 42% had developed one or more limitations 2 months later, and 41% had limitations 12 months later. The patient's ability to perform activities of daily living at baseline was the most important predictor of functional status at both 2 and 12 months. In a multivariable predictive model, independent predictors of poorer functional status at 2 months included: worse baseline functional status and quality of life; depth of coma, if any; lower serum albumin level; presence of dementia, depression, or incontinence; being bedridden; medical record documentation of need for nursing home; and older age. Model performance, assessed using Somers' D, was 0.61 for 2 months and 0.57 for 12 months (Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area = 0.81 and .79, respectively.) Bootstrap validation of the month 2 model also yielded a Somers' D = 0.60. The models were well calibrated over the entire risk range. The ROC area for prediction of the loss of independence was 0.76 for 2 months and 0.68 for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Many older patients are functionally impaired at the time of hospitalization, and many develop new functional limitations. A limited amount of readily available clinical information can yield satisfactory predictions of functional status 2 months after hospitalization. Models like this may prove to be useful in clinical care. This work illuminates a potential method for risk adjustment in research studies and for monitoring quality of care.
