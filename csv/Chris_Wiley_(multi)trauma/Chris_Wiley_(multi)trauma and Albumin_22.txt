AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a model estimating the probability of a patient aged 80 years or older having functional limitations 2 months and 12 months after being hospitalized. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four teaching hospitals in the US. PARTICIPANTS: Enrolled patients were nonelective hospital admissions aged 80 years or older who stayed in hospital at least 48 hours. The 804 patients who survived and completed an interview at 2 months and the 450 who completed an interview at 12 months were from the 1266 patients in the Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project (HELP) (76% and 47% of survivors, respectively). Median age of the 2-month survivors was 84.7 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Patient function 2 and 12 months after enrollment was defined by the number of dependencies in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to predict functional status. Predictors included demographic characteristics, disease category, geriatric conditions, severity of physiologic imbalance, current quality of life, and exercise capacity and ADLs 2 weeks before study admission. RESULTS: Before admission, 39% of patients were functionally independent in ADLs. Of patients who survived and were interviewed at 2 months, 32% were functionally independent, and at 12 months, 36% were independent. Among patients with no baseline dependencies, 42% had developed one or more limitations 2 months later, and 41% had limitations 12 months later. The patient's ability to perform activities of daily living at baseline was the most important predictor of functional status at both 2 and 12 months. In a multivariable predictive model, independent predictors of poorer functional status at 2 months included: worse baseline functional status and quality of life; depth of coma, if any; lower serum albumin level; presence of dementia, depression, or incontinence; being bedridden; medical record documentation of need for nursing home; and older age. Model performance, assessed using Somers' D, was 0.61 for 2 months and 0.57 for 12 months (Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area = 0.81 and .79, respectively.) Bootstrap validation of the month 2 model also yielded a Somers' D = 0.60. The models were well calibrated over the entire risk range. The ROC area for prediction of the loss of independence was 0.76 for 2 months and 0.68 for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Many older patients are functionally impaired at the time of hospitalization, and many develop new functional limitations. A limited amount of readily available clinical information can yield satisfactory predictions of functional status 2 months after hospitalization. Models like this may prove to be useful in clinical care. This work illuminates a potential method for risk adjustment in research studies and for monitoring quality of care.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Background/Aim:? Clinical presentation and complications of end-stage renal disesase (ESRD) patients are under influence of many enviromental and genetic factors. In this study we aimed to define frequencies of BsmI and TagI Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and possible influences on clinical presentations in Turkish ESRD population. Methodology and Patients:?186 patients (111 male, 75 female) who are being maintained on hemodialysis were included. Genotyping was performed for the insertion/deletion BsmI (B?b, restriction site, exon VIII?IX), TagI (T?t, 352 exon IX) VDR gene polymorphisms. Last 12 months? laboratory values (C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, Ca x P product) and clinical findings (vitamin D requirement, body weight) were recorded and analysed retrospectively. Results:?Mean age and follow-up period lengths were 42.1?±?12.6 years and 76.3?±?43.9 months, respectively. Polymorphism percentages were as follows: BsmI; BB/Bb/bb: 28.9/65.3/5.8%, TagI; TT/Tt/tt: 36.7/60.5/2.8%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that TT variant of TagI was related with hyperparathyroidism (p?<?0.05). Analysis of data after regrouping patients according to iPTH levels (0?249, 250?499, 500?+?pg/mL) and hemodialysis duration (<60 vs ≥60 months) revealed that influence of TT variation on hyperparathyroidism became more frequent in case of increased hemodialysis duration and iPTH levels (p?<?0.005). Conclusion:?TT variation of TagI VDR gene influences the development of hyperparathyroidism in HD patients. This influence becomes more evident in patients with longer HD duration.

AB  - Summary All diseases, including neurological diseases, can be broadly defined as homeostatic failures. Neuroglial cells are a major component of pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The function of neuroglia is neuroprotection. In neurological diseases, glia attempt to maintain tissue and cellular homeostasis. Reactive astrogliosis can be defined as a constitutive, graded, multi-stage and evolutionary conserved defensive astroglial reaction. It can be classified according to (a) morphological appearances, and (b) severity. This chapter focuses on Wallerian degeneration which is currently used to describe axonal degeneration in both CNS and PNS. Wallerian degeneration is a specialised active process that involves activation of localised signals in both axons and surrounding glial cells. The chapter dicusses excitotoxic vulnerability of oligodendrocytes. The main function of microglia is to detect insults to the CNS and to mount a defensive response, the activation of microglia. The activated microglia can change the repertoire and levels of expression of numerous receptors.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - Summary.? Although up to 30% of babies born with haemophilia do not have a family history of the disorder, the remaining 70% are born in families where haemophilia has been diagnosed. It has been estimated that for each male with haemophilia, there are five potential female carriers. Such women will benefit from knowledge of both their genetic (mutation present or not) and phenotype (level of plasma factor activity) status. Genetic counselling services to provide information and testing, together with plasma factor measurement, should be offered where available to all women at risk of being carriers. It is critical that women know their plasma factor measurement as they may have mild haemophilia (factor 5?30%, reference range 50?150%) which requires management at times of medical and surgical procedures and following trauma. Close liaison between adult and paediatric haemophilia centres and obstetric?gynaecology units is important to ensure that clinical carers identify and address carriers? needs. Genetic testing should be performed only after a potential carrier has been counselled and supported to receive such information. There is no coercion to accept such testing. An advantage of genetic testing is to then discuss pre-implantation genetic diagnosis which is an ex-viro form of prenatal diagnosis. This can assist couples at risk of having a child with haemophilia who wish to reduce their anxieties about reproduction. Approximately 4% of boys with haemophilia, born in countries with good maternal care, will have intracranial haemorrhage in the neonatal period. There are no high-level evidence-based guidelines for the management of delivery or of the newborn with haemophilia. Obstetricians or other birth attendants need to be advised of the possibility of delivery of a boy with haemophilia and seek support from a haemophilia specialist during the pregnancy. The mother can then be monitored and plans for delivery be developed between her medical consultants and discussed with her. It is always preferable for a carrier to know of her genetic and phenotypic status before becoming pregnant so that she is informed as to her options and requirements for safe delivery.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - Abstract Aim: To determine whether the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1 receptor) modulates brain cryoinjury and whether the CysLT1 receptor antagonist pranlukast exerts a time-dependent protective effect on cryoinjury in mice. Methods: Brain cryoinjury was induced by applying a liquid nitrogen-cooled metal probe to the surface of the skull for 30 s. Brain lesion, neuron density, and endogenous IgG exudation were observed 24 h after cryoinjury. Transcription and the expresion of the CysLT1 receptor were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and the localization of the receptor protein by double immunofluorescence. Results: The mRNA and protein expressions of the CysLT1 receptor were upregulated in the brain 6-24 h after cryoinjury, and the CysLT1 receptor protein was primarily localized in the neurons, not in the neurons, not in the astrocytes or microglia. Pre-injury treatments with multi-doses and a single dose of pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) attenuated cryoinjury, postinjury single dose (0.1 mg/kg) at 30 min (not 1 h) after cryoinjury was also effective. Conclusion: The CysLT1 receptor modulates cryoinjury in mice at least partly, and postinjury treatment with its antagonist pranlukast exerts the protective effect with a therapeutic window of 30 min.

Erdheim?Chester disease (ECD) is a disorder of unclear aetiology, characterized by exuberant histiocyte proliferation and a variable clinical course. We report the case of a woman with multi-organ involvement secondary to ECD. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hyperprolactinaemia, gonadotropin insufficiency and decreased insulin-like growth factor I levels were present, suggesting hypothalamic?pituitary dysfunction. The high-intensity signal of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was absent on magnetic resonance imaging, but no sellar mass lesions or stalk thickening were apparent. Additionally, our patient had bilateral adrenal enlargement. Even though ECD is a rare cause of neuroendocrine dysfunction or adrenal enlargement, it should be considered in patients with these disorders in the setting of multiorgan disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although long recognized in microvascular research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory markers are present in human diseases. Since the inflammatory cascade serves as a repair mechanism, the presence of inflammatory markers in patient groups has raised an important question about the mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory cascade (i.e., the mechanisms that cause tissue injury). Using a severe form of inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, for which there is no accepted injury mechanism, we summarize studies that suggest that the powerful pancreatic digestive enzymes play a central role in the destruction of the intestine and other tissues if their compartmentalization in the lumen of the intestine and in the pancreas is compromised. Further, we summarize evidence that uncontrolled degrading enzyme activity in plasma causes proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane receptors and loss of associated cell functions. For example, in a model of metabolic disease with type II diabetes, proteolytic cleavage of the insulin receptor causes the inability of insulin to signal glucose transport across membranes. The evidence suggests that uncontrolled proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity may trigger the mechanism for tissue injury. The significance of such mechanisms remain to be explored in human diseases.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects survival and morbidity of end-stage renal disease patients and also increases treatment costs. Aim of this study is to define prevalence of HCV infection in our hemodialysis (HD) units and documenting past interventions and clinical status of patients. 711 patients were included. Patient data were collected from 4 HD units of Baskent University. Patient records were examined for demograpic findings, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, liver biopsy, interferon treatment information, last 12 months? laboratory values (serum transaminases, albumin, lipid profiles, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein), and current clinical status, retrospectively. 143 patients (3%) were anti-HCV positive. These patients? alanine transferase levels (23.5?±?20.5 vs 15.5?±?12.8?U/L, p?<?0.0001) and HD duration (97.9?±?58.6 vs 46.3?±?35.6 months, p?<?0.0001) were significantly higher. No other significant difference could be identified between the groups. Analysis of HD duration of anti-HCV positive patients revealed that prevalance was increasing as the duration increased. Anti-HCV positivity was known for a mean of 60.4?±?38.8 months while 44 patients (30.7%) were already infected at initiation of HD. HCV RNA analysis was positive in 26.7% and a liver biopsy was performed in 23% of patients after 19.8?±?23.3 months following positive anti-HCV identification. Minimally active chronic hepatitis C was the most common pathological diagnosis (70, 3%). Only 18 patients (12.5%) recieved interferon therapy. None of the patients had chronic liver disease clinical and physical findings by the time this study was done. HCV infection is a common problem in HD patients that increases the need for medical interventions and treatment.

AB  - Purpose:? To analyze all patients who died while on hemodialysis from a single institution 1995?2004 and determine factors that influence duration on HD (months). Material and Methods: Review of the EMR from the dialysis unit for demographics, treatment parameters, cause of death, laboratory data. Two main groups those who stop dialysis (SHD) vs non stop dialysis (NSHD) data as mean and SD. Observations done at the start/mid/end of the period on dialysis by Kaplan Meier analysis. Results:?348 deaths, reported SMR for 2000?93(0.36,0.48,0.72,0.79), average comorbidity index 7.1?16.4; 49.1% male; age 67.6(12.3); 58.2% DM, 117(33.6%) stop dialysis. Detail analysis from 2000?2004; 187 deaths; 33.6% catheter, 41.1% AV graft at the time of death; 26% on no BP meds at the end, 64% 1?2 BP meds at the end. Cause Stop No Stop CV 33(28%) 145(62.7%) Infection 10(8.5%) ?41(17.7%) Other 74(63.5%) ?45(19.6%) Most SHD deaths due to uremia (60%), Cancer 17%, occurred 36% CVA. SHD vs NSHD: older 70.8 (12.9) vs 65.9(12.9) p?<?0.001. No difference in average months in dialysis 41.2 (38.9) vs 48.7(47.7)NS, in URR (start/end), UF during Hd, predialysis MAP (start/end: 105(15) 196(15)/95 (20)?, 96(20)) albumin, phosphorous. Lower creatinine (at the end 6.2(1.5) 7.4(2.4)) higher Kt/V at end 1.47(0.4) vs 1.29(0.3). BMI lower at star/mid/end of the observation period. Conclusions:?A large proportion of deaths were due to discontinuation of dialysis, older patient discontinue dialysis more frequently, the length of time on dialysis (months) is related more to nutritional factors (creatinine, BMI)
