AB  - Trace elements are essential for many physiologic processes. In recent years, supplementation has been studied for a variety of indications, including glycemic control, wound healing, antioxidant effect, and anemia. Critical illness, especially states such as burns, traumas, and septic shock, is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition. In these patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition or pharmaceutical supplementation is used to provide essential macronutrients, including trace elements. The purpose of this review is to describe trace element supplementation, including iron, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium, and zinc, and highlight their mechanism, pharmacology, outcome data, and adverse effects.

AB  - The essential trace element copper (Cu) is required for a range of physiologic processes, including wound healing and functioning of the immune system. The correct amount of Cu must be provided in parenteral nutrition (PN) if deficiency and toxicity are to be avoided. While provision in line with the standard recommendations should suffice for most patients, Cu requirements may be higher in patients with increased gastrointestinal losses and severe burns and lower in those with cholestasis. The tests of Cu status that are currently available for clinical use are unreliable. Serum Cu concentration is the most commonly ordered test but is insensitive to Cu deficiency and toxicity and is misleadingly increased during the acute phase response. These limitations make it difficult for prescribers to assess Cu status and to decide how much Cu to provide. There is a need for better tests of Cu status to be developed to decrease uncertainty and improve individualization of Cu dosing. More information is needed on Cu requirements in disease and Cu contamination of PN components and other intravenous fluids. New multi?trace element products should be developed that provide Cu doses in line with the 2012 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommendations. This article discusses the evaluation and treatment of Cu deficiency and toxicity in patients treated with PN.

AB  - Summary. Successful percutaneous liver biopsy was carried out on 12 multi-transfused haemophiliacs from the Manchester area with persistently abnormal liver function tests. Only one patient showed evidence of chronic active hepatitis with progression to active micronodular cirrhosis although a further four patients showed some evidence of mild chronic active hepatitis. This represents a much lower incidence of severe histological liver damage than many previous reports and implies that liver biopsy in asymptomatic haemophiliacs may not be indicated as a routine procedure, particularly in the absence of proven therapy. Dynamic liver function tests may prove to be a useful indicator of deteriorating liver function in the otherwise asymptomatic haemophiliac.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Background Needle-free, transcutaneous pneumatic injection systems can be used to deliver therapeutic solutions to targeted layers of skin in a minimally invasive manner. Methods To evaluate jet infiltration patterns and tissue reactions, 5% isotonic and 20% hypertonic glucose solutions were pneumatically injected into in vivo micropig skin. Gelatin TM phantom was additionally prepared to analyze penetration and dispersion patterns for different experimental settings. Results As immediate tissue reactions in the in vivo micropig skin, distinct pneumatic injection injury zones (PIIZs) in the dermis, extending from the papillary dermis deep into the dermo-subcutaneous junction, were generated with the 5% and 20% glucose solutions and with pneumatic pressures of 4.64 and 5.7 bars, respectively. PIIZs markedly decreased in appearance at 1 day after treatment, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, and disappeared at 7 days post-treatment with increased collagen and elastin production. In TM phantom study, the PIIZs created by 20% glucose mainly comprised a single, homogenous, round to oval zone, whereas those created by 5% glucose were irregular and multi-lobular. Conclusion The present study suggests that transcutaneous pneumatic injection therapy may exert mechanical stimulatory effects, immediate tissue shrinkage via hypertonic solutions, and late tissue regeneration effects during wound healing.

AB  - Background:? Among patients receiving chronic HD, therapy with paricalcitol (Z) was associated with reduced mortality and morbidity compared to treatment with calcitriol (C). Furthermore, patients who did not receive any vitamin D therapy experienced highest mortality and morbidity. This study examined the hypothesis of a relationship between the dose of Z and subsequent hospitalization, more specifically, that patients receiving lower doses of Z would have a higher risk of being hospitalized. Methods:?We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients new to HD who received treatment with Z or C between Jan 1999 and Dec 2001 using Poisson regression models. The primary exposure variable was the average dose/day, examined as categorical data by quintiles, during a 3-month and then 12-month follow-up period excluding the days in hospitals. This latter exclusion was made due to uncertainty of the treatment during the period of hospitalization. Additional covariates included vitamin-D group (Z vs. C), age, gender, race, and diabetes status, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH. Results:?We first examined dose of Z and C over a 3-month period and then hospitalizations over the ensuing year. We did not find a dose-response relationship in these analyses ? i.e., dose over the first three months of dialysis is not associated with increased or reduced risk of hospitalizations during the ensuing 12 months. We then examined average dose of Z or C over the entire year and risk for hospitalization during the same year. Compared to total doses, average doses (total dose over the entire year divided by number of dialysis sessions during the same year) are less prone to bias. Risk of hospitalizations according to dose (lowest dose, Quintile 1) of injectable vitamin D is shown in the table below: Quintile HR 95% CI 1 1.093 1.025?1.165 2 1.073 1.007?1.143 3 1.055 0.990?1.124 4 1.050 0.978?1.116 5 1.0 REF Compared to those who received the highest doses of injectable vitamin D, those receiving the lowest had a 9% increased risk for a hospitalization. At each level, the risk for hospitalizations was 4% lower with Z compared to C. Conclusion:?This pilot study indicates that higher average doses of Z are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and suggests additional beneficial effects of vitamin D beyond mineral metabolism and PTH control.

AB  - Abstract A new periodontitis classification scheme has been adopted, in which forms of the disease previously recognized as ?chronic? or ?aggressive? are now grouped under a single category (?periodontitis?) and are further characterized based on a multi-dimensional staging and grading system. Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentation as well as on the complexity of disease management, while grading provides supplemental information about biological features of the disease including a history-based analysis of the rate of periodontitis progression; assessment of the risk for further progression; analysis of possible poor outcomes of treatment; and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect the general health of the patient. Necrotizing periodontal diseases, whose characteristic clinical phenotype includes typical features (papilla necrosis, bleeding, and pain) and are associated with host immune response impairments, remain a distinct periodontitis category. Endodontic-periodontal lesions, defined by a pathological communication between the pulpal and periodontal tissues at a given tooth, occur in either an acute or a chronic form, and are classified according to signs and symptoms that have direct impact on their prognosis and treatment. Periodontal abscesses are defined as acute lesions characterized by localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket/sulcus, rapid tissue destruction and are associated with risk for systemic dissemination.

AB  - Some authors suggest that inflammation can be one of the reasons of erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. The purpose of the study was to follow-up some laboratory markers of inflammation in 21 dialysis patients, all treated with adequate anaemia doses EPO, divided in 2 groups: first one adequately responding to EPO treatment (with Hb higher than 9?g/L) and second one resistant to it (with Hb lower than 9?g/L). Some acute phase proteins and markers of inflammation were measured as follow: C-reactive protein (CRP), Î±1-AGT, Î±1-antitrypsine, and haptoglobine (HP), as some anti-acute phase proteins, transferrin (TF). WBC count, some enzymes: ASAT, ALAT, and substrates: urea, creatinine, albumins (Albs), lipid profile, glucose, phosphate, iron, electrolytes, and parathyroid hormone were tested as well. The study found significant higher CRP, HP, Tg, P, and Alb in the second group than in the first. TF was lower in all patients, which may be connected to the chronic inflammatory status (uremia), and there was no iron deficit or severe parathyroid hyperfunction to be convinced for EPO resistance. The study suggests that EPO resistance may be related to some inflammatory factors and treatment of the inflammation possibly will overcome the problem.

AB  - Increasing number of uremic patients, who need IHD, is a great challenge for every society but especially for poor and developing countries. The aim of our study is to look if small (not very expensive) increase in IHD adequacy is able to improve standard medical parameters. In 40 patients, treated with IHD for 57.5 (1?185) months, Kt/V was monitored on-line during the middle IHD session in the week, 4 times in each of 6 consecutive months. Measurements of Kt/V based on a conductivity method. In the first month of observation Kt/V was lower (1.09?Â±?0.02, p?<?0.0009) than in later months, in which Kt/V was ranging from 1.13?Â±?0.04 to 1.17?Â±?0.01. Blood morphology was estimated every month. At the beginning of study period, after 3 months, and at the end of studies, dry body mass, BMI, the blood pH and serum concentration of calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, iron, ferritin, urea, and creatinine were determined. The increase in Kt/V was accompanied by rising values of Hb (99.1?Â±?16.6 ? 105.1?Â±?12.5?g/l, p?=?0.022), Hct (31.6?Â±?5.2 ? 33.8?Â±?3.6%, p?=?0.004), MCV (95.9?Â±?7.7 ? 100.7 fl?Â±?5.7, p?=?0.000), iron (58.2?Â±?29.6 ? 73.2?Â±?27.8??g/dl, p?=?0.002), blood pH before (7.26?Â±?0.04 ? 7.41?Â±?0.04, p?=?0.000) and after (7.34?Â±?0.05 ? 7.48?Â±?0.05, p?=?0.000) IHD session as well as by decreasing values of PTH [918 (38?3500)? 420 (15?4341)?pg/ml, p?=?0.036]. Statistically unchanged parameters included dry body mass (70.4?Â±?15.6 ? 70.9?Â±?16.1?kg), BMI (28.21?Â±?6.73 ? 28.23?Â±?6.79?kg/m2), serum concentration of total protein (69.1?Â±?5.7 ? 70.9?Â±?4.8?g/l), phosphate (5.72?Â±?1.50 ? 5.39?Â±?2.02?mg/dl), cholesterol (203?Â±?49 ? 191?Â±?62?mg/dl) and ferritin (740?Â±?558 ? 632?Â±?346?ng/dl) as well as WBC (8.60?Â±?3.89 ? 6.52?Â±?1.50?K/nl) and PLT (251?Â±?91 ? 195?Â±?60?K/nl). There were correlations between Kt/V and serum concentrations of phosphate (r?=?0.370, p?=?0.019), PTH (r?=?0.314, p?=?0.048), ferritin (r?=?0.417, p?=?0.007), Hb (r?=??0.376, p?=?0.017), and Hct (r?=?0.374, p?=??0.017). Our results indicate that even a small increase in IHD adequacy leads to beneficial changes in management of uremic patients (better response on erythropoietin, diminished laboratory features of secondary hyperparathyroidism, better iron utilization). Correlation between Kt/V and examined parameters indicate that higher IHD doses were provided to patients in more advanced uremic state. It may partially explain advantages observed with incremental IHD adequacy.

AB  - As society ages, aging medical problems such as organ damage or failure among senior citizens increases, raising the demand for organ repair technologies. Synthetic materials have been developed and applied in various parts of human body to meet the biomedical needs. Hydrogels, in particular, have found extensive applications as wound healing, drug delivery and controlled release, and scaffold materials in the human body. The development of the next generation of soft hydrogel biomaterials focuses on facile synthetic methods, efficacy of treatment, and tunable multi-functionalities for applications. Supramolecular 3D entities are highly attractive materials for biomedical application. They are assembled by modules via various non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, p?p stacking and/or van der Waals interactions). Biodegradable thermogels are a class of such supramolecular assembled materials. Their use as soft biomaterials and their related applications are described in this Review.

AB  - SUMMARY Three major antiprotease components in equine serum were identified and characterised. These were the acidic prealbumin Pr, the homologue of human alpha-1 antitrypsin and 2 protease binding proteins, the acidic prealbumin Xc and alpha-2 macroglobulin, both capable of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of trypsin, but with only limited inhibitory effect on its esterolytic activity. The possible role of these serum antiproteases in the onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), analogous to the hereditary dysproteinaemia of alpha-1 antitrypsin in man, was investigated. There was no evidence of a genetically determined variation in the protease binding proteins but an increased frequency of the electrophoretically slower Pr antitrypsin alleles was present in horses affected with COPD. However, because of both the mixed breeding of the animals investigated and the lack of correlation with low serum trypsin inhibitory capacity, measured by inhibition of DL-BAPA hydrolysis, the significance of this observation could not be critically assessed. RÃ‰SUMÃ‰ Trois antiproteases majeures ont Ã©tÃ© identifiÃ©es dans le serum du cheval, et caractÃ©risÃ©es. Il s'agit de la Pr prÃ©albumine acide, homologue de l'alphaantitrypsine humaine, et de deux protÃ©ases, la prÃ©albumine X c acide et la macroglobuline alpha 2, toutes deux capables d'inhiber l'activitÃ© protÃ©olytique de la trypsine, mais avec seulement un effet inhibiteur limitÃ© sur l'activitÃ© estÃ©rolytique de cette enzyme. Le rÃ´le Ã©ventuel de ces antiprotÃ©ases dans l'apparition de la maladie pulmonaire chronique obstructive, analogue Ã  la dysproteinÃ©mie hÃ©rÃ©ditaire de l'antitrypsine alpha 1 chez l'Homme, a Ã©tÃ© recherchÃ©. On n'a pas constatÃ© une variation liÃ©e Ã  des facteurs gÃ©nÃ©tiques chez ces protÃ©ases Ã  l'exception d'une frÃ©quence accrue d'allÃ©les correspondants Ã  des antitrypsines Pr. Cependant, en raison de l'imprÃ©cision gÃ©nÃ©tique des animaux Ã©tudiÃ©s et du manque de corrÃ©lation avec la capacitÃ© inhibitrice trypsique du serum, la signification de cette observation parait difficile Ã  exploiter. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Drei wichtige Antiproteasen konnten im Pferdeserum identifiziert und charakterisiert werden. Es handelte sich um das saure Prealbumin Pr, ein Homolog des menschlichen alpha-1 Antitrypsins und um zwei Protease-bindenden-Proteine, das saure Praealbumin Xc und alpha-2 Macroglobulin, beide befÃ¤higt, die proteolytische AktivitÃ¤t von Trypsin zu hemmen aber mit nur eingeschrÃ¤nkter, hemmender Wirkung auf dessen esterolytische AktivitÃ¤t. Die mÃ¶gliche Bedeutung dieser Serum-Antiproteasen fÃ¼r das Auftreten chronisch obstruktiver Lungenkrankheiten?analog der hereditÃ¤ren Dysproteinaemie von alpha-1 Antitrypsin beim Menschen ?wurde untersucht. Es fanden sich keine Hinweise auf eine genetisch fixierte Variation bei den protease-bindenden Proteinen, aber die elektrophoretisch langsameren Pr Antitrypsinallele kamen bei Pferden mit chronisch obstruktiven Lungenleiden hÃ¤ufiger vor. Die Signifikanz dieser Beobachtung konnte indessen nicht kritisch beurteilt werden, weil die Pferde nicht aus einer Reinzucht stammten und weil sich keine Korrelation mit der tiefen Serumtrypsin-HemmkapazitÃ¤t (gemessen durch die Hemmung der DL-BAPA Hydrolyse) ergeben hatte.

AB  - A 10-year-old, entire, male, mixed-breed dog was presented for severe haematuria and stranguria. Ultrasound revealed a large intraluminal urinary bladder blood clot and a prostatic space-occupying lesion. Invasion of the lesion into the prostatic urethra was detected ultrasonographically during compression of the urinary bladder. Post-mortem examination revealed primary prostatic haemangiosarcoma infiltrating the urethra. Haemangiosarcoma should be considered as a rare cause of prostatic mass lesions, haematuria or lower urinary tract signs in dogs.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - ABSTRACT The features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The disease is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis characterized by erosive, destructive changes within the joint. The latter can be identified on radiographs by loss of mineral, the presence of discrete erosions or an irregular joint margin. Increased periarticular soft tissue is common and periosteal new bone is not unusual. The most obvious clinical feature is generalized stiffness particularly after rest. Joints are often thickened and painful on manipulation. A third of cases present with pyrexia, lethargy and inappetence in addition to lameness. Synovial fluid evaluation shows an increased number of white cells, most of which are polymorphs; the mucin clot is poor. The ESR is generally increased and rheumatoid factor (an antiglobulin auto-antibody) is present in 73 per cent of cases. Treatment is often unrewarding, although many dogs can cope for considerable periods of time.

AB  - Abstract Our objective in this study was to identify the factors contributing to mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis which could be tested easily in every emergency clinic. This is a retrospective study enrolling 104 patients with acute suppurative cholangitis. Demographic and laboratory data were collected for analysis. In univariant analysis red cell distribution width, total bilirubin level, intensive care unit admission was identified as statistically significant (p?<?0.05) to predict mortality. Three variables were statistically significant in multivariate analysis: total bilirubin level equal to or more than 6.9?mg/dl, red cell distribution width equal to or more than 14.45%, and admission to intensive care unit. We found a new scoring system for prediction of mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis utilizing only three variables. This would serve as a simplified, rapid way to direct patients for advanced interventions instead of wasting time with more complicated and time consuming multi-variable scoring systems.

AB  - Abstract Despite recent advance in bioinspired adhesives, achieving strong adhesion and sealing hemostasis in aqueous and blood environments is challenging. A hyperbranched polymer (HBP) with a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic adhesive catechol side branches is designed and synthesized based on Michael addition reaction of multi-vinyl monomers with dopamine. It is demonstrated that upon contacting water, the hydrophobic chains self-aggregate to form coacervates quickly, displacing water molecules on the adherent surface to trigger increased exposure of catechol groups and thus rapidly strong adhesion to diverse materials from low surface energy to high energy in various environments, such as deionized water, sea water, PBS, and a wide range of pH solutions (pH = 3 to 11) without use of any oxidant. Also, this HBP adhesive (HBPA) exhibits a robust adhesion to fractured bone, precluding the problem of mismatched surface energy and mechanical properties. The HBPA's adhesion is repeatable in a wet condition. Intriguingly, the HBPA is capable of gluing dissimilar materials with distinct properties. Importantly, introducing long alkylamine into this modular hyperbranched architecture contributes to formation of an injectable hemostatic sealant that can rapidly stop visceral bleeding, especially hemorrhage from deep wound.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to noxious stimulation. Study Design Prospective, experimental. Animals Eight healthy goats; four does and four wethers. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone 3Â mgÂ kg?1 intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of alfaxalone, initially at 0.2Â mgÂ kg?1Â minute?1, was initiated. Following endotracheal intubation the goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing circuit delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial infusion rate was maintained for 30Â minutes before testing for responses. The stimulus was clamping on the proximal (soft) part of one digit of the hoof with Vulsellum forceps for 60Â seconds. In the absence or presence of purposeful movement of the extremities, the infusion rate was reduced or increased by 0.02Â mgÂ kg?1Â minute?1 and held constant for 30Â minutes before claw-clamping again. Alfaxalone MIR was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Cardio-respiratory parameters were measured. Recovery from general anaesthesia was timed and quality scored. Results are presented as median (range). Results The MIR of alfaxalone was 0.16 (0.14?0.18) mgÂ kg?1Â minute?1 or 9.6 (8.4?10.8) mgÂ kg?1Â hour?1. Induction of and recovery from anaesthesia were excitement-free. Cardio-respiratory changes were minimal, although compared to baseline HR increased, and at 2Â minutes post-induction, (prior to oxygen supplementation), PaO2 decreased significantly from 84 (80?88) to 70 (51?72) mmHg [11.2 (10.7?11.7) to 9.3 (6.8?9.6) kPa]. Sporadic muscle twitches, unrelated to depth of anaesthesia, were observed during the period of general anaesthesia. Time (minutes) to sternal recumbency and standing were 4.0 (3.0?10.0) and 41.5 (25.0?57.0) respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Alfaxalone can be used for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) in goats and is associated with minimal adverse effects. Oxygen supplementation is advised, especially when working at higher altitudes.
