AB  - Summary Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid covalently bound in esterified form in the cell membranes of most body cells. Following irritation or injury, arachidonic acid is released and oxygenated by enzyme systems leading to the formation of an important group of inflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids. It is now recognised that eicosanoid release is fundamental to the inflammatory process. For example, the prostaglandins and other prostanoids, products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, have potent inflammatory properties and prostaglandin E2 is readily detectable in equine acute inflammatory exudates. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and this explains the mode of action of agents such as phenylbutazone and flunixin. Lipoxygenase enzymes metabolise arachidonic acid to a group of non-cyclised eicosanoids, the leukotrienes, some of which are also important inflammatory mediators. They are probably of particular importance in leucocyte-mediated aspects of chronic inflammation. Currently available non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, however, do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity. In the light of recent evidence, the inflammatory process is re-examined and the important emerging roles of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase derived eicosanoids are explored. The mode of action of current and future antiinflammatory drugs offered to the equine clinician can be explained by their interference with arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

AB  - Abstract Despite a number of clinically available hemostats, uncontrolled bleeding is the primary cause of trauma-related death. Shape-memory polymer (SMP) foams have a number of desirable properties for use as hemostats, including shape recovery to enable delivery into bleed sites, biocompatibility, and rapid blood clotting. To expand upon this material system, the current work aims to incorporate phenolic acids, which are honey-based antimicrobial agents, into SMP foams. We showed that cinnamic acid (CA) can be utilized as a monomer in SMP synthesis to provide foams with comparable pore structure and retained cytocompatibility. The addition of CA enabled tuning of thermal and shape-memory properties within clinically relevant ranges. Furthermore, the modified foams demonstrated initial and sustained antimicrobial effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These multifunctional scaffolds demonstrate potential for use as hemostats to improve upon current hemorrhage treatments and provide a new tool in tuning the biological and material properties of SMP foams.

AB  - Summary The parathyroid glands in dogs and cats are tan-colored ovoid structures closely associated with each thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) release is controlled by calcium receptors on the chief cells in the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia. PTH has a short half-life (3?5 min) in serum and so a steady rate of secretion is necessary to maintain serum PTH concentrations. Natural variations in PTH concentration occur in healthy dogs. Exploratory surgery with parathyroidectomy in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism serves as both a diagnostic test and definitive therapy. Surgery should be advocated to reduce the risk of urolithiasis and urinary tract infection, as well as improving the clinical signs seen with hypercalcemia such as polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and decreased appetite. Surgical excision alone is the most widely performed treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism and a cure rate of 94% is reported if all autonomously functioning parathyroid tissue is removed.

AB  - Ligneous conjunctivitis and gingivitis were diagnosed in three related Scottish terrier dogs presented for investigation of severe conjunctivitis and respiratory signs. Hypoplasminogenaemia was confirmed in one of the three affected dogs. Supportive treatment was not effective, and the dogs died or were euthanased because of the disease. Post-mortem analysis of two of the dogs revealed multiple abnormalities including severe proliferative fibrinous lesions affecting the conjunctiva, gingiva, trachea, larynx and epicardium and multiple fibrous adhesions throughout the thoracic and abdominal cavities. One dog had internal hydrocephalus and lacked a cerebellar vermis. Ligneous membranitis was confirmed on histopathology. This is a rare condition in dogs but an important differential diagnosis for severe conjunctivitis and gingivitis.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Abstract The complex intricate architecture of the liver is crucial to hepatic function. Standard protocols used for enzymatic digestion to isolate hepatocytes destroy tissue structure and result in significant loss of synthetic, metabolic, and detoxification processes. We describe a process using mechanical dissociation to generate hepatic organoids with preserved intrinsic tissue architecture from swine liver. Oxygen-supplemented perfusion culture better preserved organoid viability, morphology, serum protein synthesis, and urea production, compared with standard and oxygen-supplemented static culture. Hepatic organoids offer an alternative source for hepatic assist devices, engineered liver, disease modeling, and xenobiotic testing.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine now widely recognized to contribute to the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL-6 that could be neutralized by an IL-6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL-6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was lower in slices treated with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL-6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP-43. Co-culture of CA3 hemi-slices from thy1-YFP mice with CA1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL-6-treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing fluorescent fibres across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration.

AB  - Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a functional substitute for mammalian IgG for antigen detection. Traditional IgY purification methods involve multi-step procedures resulting in low purity and recovery of IgY. In this study, we developed a simple IgY purification system using IgY-specific peptides identified by T7 phage display technology. From disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries constructed on a T7 phage, we identified three specific binding clones (Y4-4, Y5-14, and Y5-55) through repeated biopanning. The synthetic peptides showed high binding specificity to IgY-Fc and moderate affinity for IgY-Fc (Kd: Y4-4 = 7.3 ± 0.2 ?M and Y5-55 = 4.4 ± 0.1 ?M) by surface plasmon resonance analysis. To evaluate the ability to purify IgY, we performed immunoprecipitation and affinity high-performance liquid chromatography using IgY-binding peptides; the result indicated that these peptides can be used as affinity ligands for IgY purification. We then used a peptide-conjugated column to purify IgY from egg yolks pre-treated using an optimized delipidation technique. Here, we report the construction of a cost-effective, one-step IgY purification system, with high purity and recovery. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Summary Four horses (H, J, N and M) undertook a simulated competition exercise test (CET), designed to simulate physiological and metabolic stresses of the Speed and Endurance (S  30°C/40%RH (hot, dry [HD]) and 30°C/80%RH (hot, humid [HH]) (Marlin et al. 1995a). Venous blood samples for electrolyte and total protein (TP) determinations were collected from indwelling catheters at predetermined time points throughout each CET and initial 30 min recovery period. Venous blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture at 2 h and 24 h after the end of the final 8 min canter (Phase D). The effects of exercise, environmental condition and horse on venous TP, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl?), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and phosphate (PP43-) plasma concentrations were investigated. In addition, the effect of environmental condition on estimated cation loss was evaluated. All horses completed the full CET under the CD and HD conditions, but only one horse completed the full 8 min of the final canter Phase D under HH conditions. Exercise had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters similar to those reported previously in field competitions. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and horse for TP, Na+ and Cl?. Overall, the environmental condition had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters, but the differences were not considered to be of any physiological relevance, other than for Cl? and TP. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and environmental condition for Cl? and TP only. During much of the CET and recovery period, mean Cl? values were higher with the first CD session than the second CD session or under the HH or HD conditions. For TP after 2 min of Phase D and during the initial recovery period, concentrations were higher under the HH conditions and returned to the Pre- values less quickly. There were marked individual variations in the estimated cation losses and no consistent effect of environmental condition was found. Although estimated fluid loss was similar following both HD and HH sessions, restoration of bodyweight was slower following the CET studies under HH conditions.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT The occurrence of a liposarcoma in a Greyhound is reported. The dog was presented with a swollen left hock which, on radiographic examination, was shown to be a tumour in the bone. Metastasis from the primary site or independent genesis led to the involvement of the metaphyseal areas of the long bones, the left caudal lumbar lymph node, the liver and the spleen. The neoplastic tissue was composed of cells ranging from undifferentiated sarcoma cells to well-differentiated vacuolated fat cells. Résumé. On rapporte l'occurrence d'un liposarcome chez un lévrier. Le chien s'était présenté avec le jarret gauche enflé, ce qui, d'après un examen radiographique, s'était révélé être une tumeur de l'os. La métastase du site primaire ou de genèse indépendante a mené à l'implication des régions métaphysiques des os longs, du n?ud lymphatique lombaire caudal de gauche, du foie er de la rate. Les tissus néoplastiques étaient composés de cellules variant de cellules de sarcome non-différenciées à des cellules bien différenciées de graisse vacuolaire. Zusammenfassung. Das Vorkommen von einem Liposarkom wurde in einem Windhund berichtet. Der Hund litt an einem geschwollenen linken Fesselgelenk, welches sich bei Rönt-genuntersuchung ais ein Tumor im Knochen erwies. Metastase von der primären Stelle oder un-abhängigen Entstehung führte zu der Verwicklung von den metaphysischen Gebieten der langen Knochen, des linken kaudalen lumbalen Lymphknoten, der Leber und der Milz. Die neoplastischen Gewebe waren aus Zellen zusammengesetzt, die sich von nichtdifferenzierten Sarkomzellen zu gut differenzierten vakuolen Fettzellen erstreckten.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess health and musculoskeletal function in survivors of pediatric sarcomas. Patients and Methods Thirty-two individuals treated for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NR-STS) with multi-modality therapy were enrolled on this cross-sectional study. Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1?34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5?55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9?32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation. Results This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women. Conclusion Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;48:192?199.
