AB  - Abstract Recent findings indicate that vascular risk factors and neurovascular dysfunction play integral roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to aging, the most common risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are apolipoprotein e4 allele, hypertension, hypotension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. All of these can be characterized by vascular pathology attributed to conditions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and subsequent blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Many epidemiological, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic studies have assessed the associations between such risk factors and Alzheimer's disease and have found positive associations between hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes mellitus. However, there are still many conflicting results from these population-based studies, and they should be interpreted carefully. Recognition of these factors and the mechanisms by which they contribute to Alzheimer's disease will be beneficial in the current treatment regimens for Alzheimer's disease and in the development of future therapies. Here we discuss vascular factors with respect to Alzheimer's disease and dementia and review the factors that give rise to vascular dysfunction and contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Summary Over the years, the role of biochemical, immunological, genetic, and other biological aspects in the pathogenesis of vitiligo has been studied. So far, no convincing model describing the interplay of these contributing factors has been formulated. Based on existing research, we propose that vitiligo has a multi-factorial etiology, characterized by multiple steps, but always involving an increase of external or internal phenol/catechol concentration, serving as a preferred surrogate substrate of tyrosinase, competing with its physiological substrate tyrosine. The conversion of these substrates into reactive quinones is reinforced by a disturbed redox balance (increasing hydrogen peroxide). Such reactive quinones can be covalently bound to the catalytic centre of tyrosinase (haptenation). This could give rise to a new antigen, carried by Langerhans cells to the regional lymph node, stimulating the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells. However, the activation of such cytotoxic cells is only a first step in skin melanocyte killing, which also depends on a shift in the balance between immune defence and tolerance, e.g. resulting from a decrease in properly functioning T-regulatory cells. With this new model, based on a synthesis of several of the existing theories, in mind, the external and internal factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of vitiligo are reviewed, against the background of reported clinical data, experimental studies and existing and potential new therapies. A similar complex mechanism may also lead to some other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Objectives: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can be difficult to diagnose. Histopathology is considered the gold standard test but immunohistochemistry (IHC) is mandatory to confirm/exclude the disease. This study aimed to assess the performances of tests carried out in vivo or at postmortem examination in challenging cases in which FIP was confirmed or excluded based on IHC or on adequate follow-up. Methods: Twelve cases (four without FIP, eight with FIP) were retrospectively studied. Clinical findings, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), analysis of the effusions (AE), antifeline coronavirus serology, serum concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and histopathology were classified as consistent, doubtful or non-consistent with FIP. Sensitivity, specificity and concordance (?) with the final diagnosis were calculated. Results: Concordance was absent for serology (?=?0·08) and AE (?=?0·52), poor for histopathology (?=0·09), fair for SPE (?=0·25) and perfect for AGP (?=1·00). Sensitivity was high for AGP (100%) and low for AE (50%), SPE (37·5%) and histopathology (37·5%). Specificity was high for AGP or histopathology (100%) and low for SPE (50%) and AE (0%). Clinical Significance: IHC must always be performed to confirm FIP. If this is not possible, when histopathology is controversial, elevated AGP concentrations may support the diagnosis of FIP.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - ABSTRACT The pathological features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The principle pathological feature is a chronic symmetrical polysynovitis. The pathological features of the joints varied in severity. The synovial membrane generally showed villous hypertrophy with aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Destruction of articular cartilage and bone occurred in association with a replacement granulation tissue which often produced a pannus over the articular surface. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated complexes of IgG or IgM with C3 in synovial lining cells, macrophages, blood vessel walls and free in the extracellular tissues. IgG and IgM producing plasma cells were also common. Fibrinogen deposits were extensive. The immunofluorescence findings were non-specific but support the concept of an immune complex mediated inflammation within the joints. Investigations for bacterial, mycoplasmal and viral infections of the joints were negative.

AB  - A seven-year-old West Highland white terrier was presented for chronic vomiting associated with mild regenerative anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. Further examination showed a giant polypoid cerebriform mass located in the lesser curvature of the stomach. Partial gastrectomy was performed and histology was consistent with hypertrophic gastritis with typical features of Ménétrier's disease. Five years after surgery, the dog was re-examined for recurrence of vomiting episodes. Endoscopy showed ulceration of the lesser curvature of the stomach and histological analysis revealed a poorly differentiated superficial gastric carcinoma surrounded by hypertrophic gastritis. To the authors? knowledge, this is the second time that coexistence of these two types of lesions is reported, suggesting that recurrence of gastritis could be the starting point of the tumoural process.

AB  - Background and Aim Although lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) are increasingly being used for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections (PFC), their advantage over plastic stents is unclear. Methods In this retrospective case?control study, 20 patients who underwent PFC drainage using LAMS were matched with 40 patients treated with plastic stents according to PFC type (walled-off necrosis [WON] vs pseudocyst) and procedural technique (conventional vs multi-gate). Main outcome measures were treatment success, reintervention, clinical and stent-related adverse events, procedural duration, length of hospital stay (LOS) and hospital costs. Results At median follow up of 570 days, except for median procedural duration (8.5 vs 25 min, P < 0.001), there was no significant difference in treatment success (95.0 vs 92.5%, P = 0.99), reintervention (25.0 vs 30.0 %, P = 0.77), clinical (10.0 vs 12.5 %, P = 0.99) and stent-related adverse events (10.0 vs 2.5 %, P = 0.26) or median LOS (2 [IQR 1?5] vs 2 [IQR 1?7] days, P = 0.58) between patients treated with LAMS versus plastic stents. Although there was no difference for WON ($16 708 for LAMS vs $17 221 for plastic stents, P = 0.90), mean hospital costs were significantly lower for pseudocysts using plastic stents ($18 996 vs $58 649, P = 0.03). Conclusions Although there is no difference in clinical outcomes, treating pseudocysts using plastic stents is less expensive. It is also possible that the short procedural duration is a surrogate marker for procedural complexity and this may drive the use of LAMS in sicker patients.

AB  - Summary Flaxseed proteins are potent multi-functional ingredients for food formulation owing to their techno-functionalities, food preservation capacity, and health benefits. A possible synergistic effect with mucilage on their functionalities could be valuable even though this co-product in flaxseed may limit the protein yield during their production processes. Their techno-functional properties could also be considered in mixture with other flax bioactive components such as lignans and fibre to enhance the value of the flaxseed meal. The present paper reviews flaxseed protein uses in food and their health benefits. New perspectives according to consumers? demand for products with health promoting bioactive components are also suggested.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic spinal cord injury is characterized by an immediate, irreversible loss of tissue at the lesion site, as well as a secondary expansion of tissue damage over time. Although secondary injury should, in principle, be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Excessive release of ATP by the traumatized tissue, triggers the rapid release of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and has beenimplicated in acute and chronic neuropathic pain and inflammation. But the intracellular pathways between ATP and PGE2 remain largely unknown. We have explored the signaling events involved in this synthesis by primarily culturing spinal cord astrocytes: (1) we determined significant PGE2 production increased by ATP is mainly via Subtype 1 of P2 purinoceptors (P2Y1) but not P2Y2; (2) we found that ATP strongly increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ via P2Y1 receptor; (3) we indicated that ATP stimulates the definitely release of AA and PGE2 which involved the transactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2); (4) we examined ATP could increase the phosphorylation of Akt via P2Y1 receptor which also depend on the transactivation of EGFR, but the activation of Akt has no effect on the downstream of cPLA2 phosphorylation. ATP induced by SCI could mobilize the release of AA and PGE2. And inhibition of PGE2 release reduces behavioral signs of pain after SCI and peripheral nerve injury. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome on patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0?2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III?IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL. Low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor in DLBCL.

AB  - Objectives To report clinical and laboratory features, treatment responses and outcome in dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis in the United Kingdom. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3?years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. Clinical Significance Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been identified as markers of vascular damage in a variety of disorders, such as myocardial infarction, vasculitis, and transplantation. CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation has gained widespread use, but the technique is hampered by the lack of a definition of CECs and the absence of a consensus for their enumeration. Aim:?To evaluate several variables influencing immunomagnetic isolation of CECs, formulate a definition for CECs and propose a consensus protocol for their enumeration. Methods:?We devised a protocol based on CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation and a subsequent confirmatory step with Ulex-Europaeus-Lectin-1 staining. In a multi-center effort, we evaluated the preanalytical and analytical phases of this protocol. We evaluated the effects of storage, anticoagulation and density centrifugation, and compiled previous experience with this technique. Results:?Our protocol permitted unequivocal identification of CECs with acceptable reproducibility. There was an effect of storage time in that median cell numbers declined to only 87.5% of their baseline values during 24?h of storage at 4?°C. Recovery was lower with citrate than with ethylene-diamine tetra-acetic acid after 4?h of storage; density centrifugation was also associated with lower recovery. We provide a comprehensive list of technical recommendations and potential pitfalls. Finally, based on our experience with this protocol and a recent consensus workshop, we formulated a working definition for CECs. Conclusion:?Our work represents an important step toward consensus regarding the CECs. Our recommendations represent the experience of three major centers and should now be scrutinized by others in the field.

AB  - Abstract Repair and regeneration of articular cartilage lesions have always been a major challenge in the medical field due to its peculiar structure (e.g., sparsely distributed chondrocytes, no blood supply, no nerves). Articular cartilage tissue engineering is considered as one promising strategy to achieve reconstruction of cartilage. With this perspective, the articular cartilage tissue engineering has been widely studied. Here, the recent progress of articular cartilage tissue engineering is reviewed. The ad hoc therapeutic cells and growth factors for cartilage regeneration are summarized and discussed. Various types of bio/macromolecular scaffolds together with their pros and cons are also reviewed and elaborated.
