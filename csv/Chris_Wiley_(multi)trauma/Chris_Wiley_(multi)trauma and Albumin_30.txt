AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is a common reason for owners to seek veterinary treatment for their working equids in Morocco. There is no information available regarding cultural, religious or educational barriers to obtaining treatment or about the typical workload of these animals which may predispose them to colic. Objectives To characterise the typical workload and feeding regimens of working equids in Morocco; to characterise the ability of owners to recognise the clinical signs and causes of colic; and to identify specific barriers to the veterinary treatment of colic. Study design Questionnaire-based survey. Methods A standardised, structured questionnaire was administered, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, to the owners of working equids presenting their animals to 2 centres run by SPANA (The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad). Participation was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the interview. Results All of the 102 participants that completed questionnaire were male. Ninety-eight owners used their animals for pulling carts, with 12% of animals working 7 days per week. 14% of animals were offered water by their owner once per day and 2% every other day. 25% of animals were loose and allowed free to feed unsupervised when not working. 29% of owners were not able to name any cause of colic and 25% did not recognise any clinical signs; only 12% associated colic with gastrointestinal pain. 83% of owners would not seek veterinary treatment due to financial constraints if free treatment at SPANA centres were not available. Conclusions Colic remains a common problem amongst working equids in Morocco. Improved knowledge of management factors associated with colic and how to recognise abdominal pain may reduce the incidence of colic and improve prognosis. The findings presented can be used to inform and develop owner education programmes. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all owners and was delivered in the native language. No details identifying the owner were recorded. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine gastric glandular disease (EGGD) is a common condition, for which the underlying pathophysiology is undetermined. Endoscopic mucosal biopsies have been proposed as a method for adapting therapy. Objectives To evaluate diagnostic information obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Methods Twenty-one horses undergoing elective humane slaughter were subjected to gross examination of the glandular mucosa. Glandular pathology was graded using EGUS Council guidelines from digital camera images. Mucosal biopsies were obtained using a ?single-bite? (1.8?mm; A and 2.4?mm; B) or ?double bite? technique (2.4?mm; C) using endoscopic biopsy instruments. Tissue was formalin fixed, processed and stained using standard protocols. Inflammatory infiltrates visualised histologically were graded (mild, moderate or severe) and compared with ulcer grade. Full thickness biopsies were also obtained adjacent to the biopsy site and of other visual lesions and inflammatory cell counts were compared with mucosal biopsies using ICC. Results Full thickness samples were artefact free and allowed visualisation of all layers. Mucosal biopsy samples contained mucosa in all samples, submucosa in 55% (C), 61% (A) and 66% (B) of samples and glands in 50% (B), 66% (A) and 100% (C). Samples from A were too small for histological assessment (33%) and tissue damage was commonly seen in A and B (n?=?8 and n?=?10) when compared with C (n?=?3). Horses with normal glandular appearance (grade 0; n?=?7) mostly demonstrated mild gastritis (n?=?5). Severe gastritis was identified in mild EGGD (grade 1/2), whilst mild and moderate gastritis was identified in all EGGD grades. There was no histological evidence of ulceration or erosion. There was poor agreement between cell numbers and sampling techniques (ICC<0.29). Conclusions These data show lack of ulcerative pathology and instead inflammation in EGGD. Lesion appearance is a poor indicator of underlying severity. Mucosal biopsies offer limited value in predicting underlying disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The bacteria Clostridium botulinum has been associated with equine grass sickness (EGS); however, the effect on the wider horse's gut microbiome is currently unknown. Objectives To characterise the bacterial dysbiosis that occurs within the gut microbiome of horses with EGS and to identify and quantify Clostridium botulinum within the faecal microbiota of the affected horses. Study design Case?control study. Methods Faecal samples were collected from horses with a histological diagnosis of EGS and matched controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced to characterise the microbial communities in the group. Faecal samples were collected from a total of 33 horses over 2 years. This included 13 EGS cases, 14 matched controls and 6 hospital controls. Faecal bacterial DNA was extracted from samples and the v4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. DNA was sequenced on the MiSeq platform and data was analysed using QIIME. Differences in community profile between the 3 groups of horses were identified using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Results There was a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes bacteria in horses with EGS compared to the 2 control groups. Discriminant analysis identified bacterial genera Desulphovibrio and Veillonella and the bacterial species Veillonella parvula as increased in abundance. There was no noticeable increase in C.?botulinum in the faecal microbiome of EGS horses in this study. Conclusions The dysbiosis characterised by bacterial sequencing showed a similar shift to that identified previously in colitis horses and human inflammatory bowel disease. It is currently unclear how Verrucomicrobia bacteria are linked to grass sickness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by The University of Liverpool ethics committee. Owner informed consent was obtained before sampling. Sources of funding:?The Equine Grass Sickness Fund and The University of Reading. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension overload is increasingly being recognised in dressage horses and, like forelimb suspensory ligament injury, tends to be seen in horses with extravagant trot steps. However, there is limited understanding of the effects of different paces within the trot on forelimb movement, therefore it is difficult to advise rationally on prevention or management of these types of injury. Objectives To compare forelimb kinematics of collected and medium or extended trot in dressage horses. Study design Prospective study. Methods Twenty mixed-breed dressage horses (age 9?±?4 years; height 168?±?6?cm; weight 600?±?63?kg; median competition level?=?advanced medium) were tested at collected and medium/extended trot (age and training level dependent) in a straight line on an artificial surface ridden by their own rider at sitting trot. Four strides of each pace were recorded using high speed motion capture (240?Hz). Markers were placed on the horses' forelimbs at predetermined anatomical sites. Fetlock, carpus, elbow and shoulder angles were derived at midstance. Descriptive statistics and mixed effect multilevel regression analyses were performed on the data. Results Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased at medium compared with collected trot (coefficient: 5.70; CI 2.58?8.82; P<0.01) and extended compared with collected trot (coefficient: 8.59; CI 5.16?12.02; P<0.01). Fetlock extension angle was significantly increased when carpus extension angle (coefficient: 0.61; CI?=?0.4?0.82; P<0.01) and shoulder flexion angle were increased (coefficient: 0.18; CI 0.01?0.33; P<0.05). Conclusions Fetlock extension increased when the horses performed lengthened trot paces, more in extended than medium trot. The loading of the carpus and shoulder were related to fetlock extension, suggesting that lengthened paces affect the loading of the entire forelimb. Lengthened paces may be contraindicated in horses with fetlock hyperextension or suspensory ligament injury; they may be a potential risk factor for these injuries. Interaction with the surface could also have a role that could be further investigated. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Health Trust ethical review committee. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Elise Pilkington Charitable Trust, Dr Wilfrid Bechtolsheimer, British Dressage.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Subpalpebral lavage (SPL) systems are commonly used to facilitate treatment of ophthalmic conditions in the horse, are placed in differing positions and are associated with various complications. Objectives To evaluate differences in complication rates between SPL placement in the upper vs. lower eyelid and factors associated with development of complications. Study design Retrospective, clinical study. Methods Clinical records from the Royal Veterinary College (2000?2013) were evaluated. Data collated included age, breed, sex, clinician, training, ophthalmic condition, pharmacological agents administered, catheter position, duration of placement, where the catheter was managed (hospital/home) and any complications observed. Data was initially interrogated using chi-squared tests and then binary logistic regression models built to evaluate these factors. Results Data was obtained from 135 horses aged 6 days to 30 years. Duration of SPL was 3?60 days (median 8; IQR 7?15). Complication rates were lowest for medicine residents (10%), when compared with interns (42%), medicine clinicians (27%) and surgeons (16%). There was no difference in complication rate between SPL management at home (15.4%) compared with the hospital (16.1%; P?=?0.94). Position of catheter placement was influenced by stage of training (P?=?0.04; boarded clinicians were more likely to place in lower eyelid) and associated with duration of treatment (P?=?0.03; longer treatment times with SPLs in upper eyelid). Complications were associated with catheter position (P?=?0.03; upper 12.8%; lower 22.2%), antimicrobial administration (P?=?0.008; 13.2% when used; 25.0% when not) and plasma administration (P?=?0.004; 30.4% when used; 13.0% when not). Conclusions Subpalpebral lavage placement in the upper eyelid was associated with fewer complications. Use of antimicrobials appeared protective against complications and plasma should only be administered when indicated as it was associated with increased complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. Low molecular weight metabolites represent the end product of the cell regulatory processes. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease specific metabolites that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and be used in its early diagnosis. Objectives We hypothesise that there are different metabolomic profiles that can be identified in early OA SF and some of these metabolites are potential biomarkers. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Synovial fluid was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. SF was analysed with Proton (1H)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 600?MHz Avance III equipped with a cryoprobe and chilled sample-jet autosampler. The software we use is Topsin 3.1 and IconNMR 4.6.7. The following methods were used in order to identify changes in lipids and small molecules; 1D Nuclear Overhauser Effect, Longitudinal Encode-decode and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill. Data analysis was undertaken using unsupervised statistical methods and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results The results demonstrated clustering on principle component analysis between normal and OA samples. Seven metabolites were identified as significantly different in OA P<0.05; mobile lipid 1, methyl group, 2 lactates, proline and 2 citrates. Furthermore total lipid load correlated very closely to Mankin's scoring. Using IPA we identified metabolic pathways relating to altered glycolysis in early OA. Conclusions We identified the metabolic fingerprint of early OA which may allow for better phenotyping of disease states and thereby facilitate targeting of improved treatment regimes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Although fasciolosis is an important livestock disease worldwide, the public health importance of human fasciolosis has increased in recent years and it is recognised as an important re-emerging zoonotic disease, its epidemiology and pathogenicity in donkeys, and the epidemiological role they may play have not been determined. Objectives To investigate the epidemiology and pathogenicity of fasciolosis in donkeys. Study design Cross-sectional coprological and retrospective post-mortem study. Methods Faecal samples collected from 803 randomly selected working donkeys from the central region of Ethiopia were analysed by a sedimentation-centrifugation-flotation technique. Further data on liver-flukes and associated pathologies were obtained by routine post mortem examinations of 112 donkeys, subjected to euthanasia on welfare grounds or died. Data were analysed using a generalised linear model and multivariate binary logistic regression in R statistical package with significance level of statistical tests set at P<0.05. Results Infection prevalences of 44.4% and 41.9% were obtained in coprologically and post mortem examined donkeys, respectively, irrespective of their age. Both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica were identified with the mean infection intensity of 30 flukes. Older donkeys (≥8 years) were found harbouring a significantly higher worm burden (P<0.0001). Gross and histopathologies of hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts, fibrosis of large portal areas and irregular bile duct proliferation and hypertrophy were noted. Conclusions The high infection prevalence of fasciolosis and the associated hepatic pathologies in working donkeys shows not only the susceptibility of donkeys and the impact it has on their health, but also indicates the important role they can play in the epidemiology of both livestock and human fasciolosis. These further demonstrate the need for these animals to be considered in the overall epidemiological studies and for sound control strategies and prevention of fasciolosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Regional adiposity on the neck crest has been linked to increased risk of developing equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). However, little is known about inherent metabolic differences between adipose tissues. Objectives To investigate innate differences between adipose tissue from neck crest compared to abdominal, mesenteric, and tail head in horses with no diagnosis of EMS. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Seven horses with no history of metabolic disorders were subjected to euthanasia for nonclinical reasons. They were selected randomly (5 geldings/2 mares; age 6?26 years; 110?165?cm height; BCS 3?8) and included with owners' consent. Adipose tissue was collected from neck crest, abdominal tissue, small intestine mesentery, and tail pad. mRNA expression of insulin-associated genes GLUT1, GLUT4, INSR and RBP4, and inflammation-associated genes SAA, TNFα, IL-1?, IL-6, MCP-1 and PAI-1 were investigated using RT-qPCR. Morphology and adipocyte size were investigated by histology. Release of non-essential fatty acids (NEFA) was investigated before/after adrenaline stimulation in 4 horses. Results No significant differences were found in mRNA expression of metabolic and inflammation related genes between tissues. Adipose tissue from neck crest was more heterogeneous than abdominal fat (P?=?0.001) and mesenteric fat (P?=?0.01). Neck crest adipocytes were similar in size to abdominal adipocytes, and larger than adipocytes from tail head and mesentery. Basal levels of NEFA release were not different between tissues. Adrenaline stimulation caused a significant release of NEFA from visceral fat (abdominal P?=?0.03; mesenteric P?=?0.048). Conclusions This preliminary study introduces new metabolic genetic markers and NEFA to the field of metabolic research. No innate differences were shown for neck crest fat except in histology. Further studies in a case?control study design are needed to determine if neck crest fat is a risk factor for EMS.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Thyroid hormones (THs) decrease with age in healthy dogs and cats, although they tend to remain within established reference ranges. Thyrotropin (TSH) is increased in elderly people, with or without mild alterations in THs. Objectives To test the hypothesis that geriatric horses will have lower THs and/or higher TSH compared with younger horses. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Resting THs and TSH, and responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared between young and old horses. Data from 71 normal, healthy horses that had participated in prior research projects were examined, and found to contain 42 horses 3?10 years of age, 16 horses >15 years and 10 horses >20 years. All samples had been assayed in the same previously validated radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software. Results Although lower, THs were not significantly different between young and old horses when compared with the Mann?Whitney rank sum test. However, TSH concentration was significantly higher in horses aged >20 (median 0.52?ng/ml) or >15 years (0.44?ng/ml) compared to younger horses (0.33?ng/ml). TRH stimulation tests were performed in 19 of the younger horses, 7 of the horses >20, and 11 of the horses >15. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed no significant differences in TH responses to TRH. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be slightly greater in the older horses, but did not quite reach significance (P?=?0.06). Conclusion Similar to reports in elderly humans, aged horses have higher serum TSH concentrations than younger horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in geriatric horses, with a high prevalence of respiratory clinical signs; increasing with increasing horse age. However, owners frequently do not attribute these signs to disease and may not seek veterinary attention. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in the British geriatric equine population using a risk-screening questionnaire (RSQ) and identify factors associated with RAO. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Owners of geriatric horses/ponies enrolled in a previous cohort study were sent a postal questionnaire, combining a validated RSQ with questions regarding management, preventive healthcare, and respiratory-specific clinical signs. An RSQ score of >0.87 was the positive cut-off for RAO. Factors associated with RAO were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The useable response rate was 43.1%, providing data for 285 horses/ponies (median age 23.3 years). Coughing within the preceding year (27.0%) was the most prevalent owner-reported clinical sign. Among the study population, the apparent prevalence of RAO using the RSQ was 20.7%. 10.5% of horses/ponies were reported to have veterinary-diagnosed RAO (median age at diagnosis 13 years), of which 33.3% had a positive RSQ score. Data from 273 animals were included in the multivariable model, and factors associated with increased risk of RAO were ridden exercise ≥4 days/week (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; P?=?0.005) compared to no exercise; residing on a farm (OR 4.99; P?=?0.04) compared to residing on the owner's home premises and having had a respiratory infection within the past 12 months (OR 4.87; P<0.001). Conclusions Risk-screening questionnaire score-determined RAO prevalence was considerably higher than the proportion of animals previously diagnosed with RAO. This suggests under-diagnosis of respiratory problems in geriatric horses, much of which may be unrecognised or undiagnosed RAO. Risk factors identified differ from those previously reported for the general equine population. Ethical animal research:?This study was granted institutional ethical approval from the University of Liverpool and the Animal Health Trust. Return of a completed postal questionnaire was taken as informed owner consent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. Study design Analysis of archived samples. Methods Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. Results Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64??g/ml (n?=?2) and 16??g/ml (n?=?1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125??g/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2??g/ml for neomycin and 0.125?1??g/ml for erythromycin. Conclusions The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Rasping of sharp enamel points (SEPs) is the most common procedure performed at routine dental examinations; however, there is little evidence to prove the true clinical significance of SEPs [1]. Maxillary SEPs are thought to cause buccal ulceration and pain on external palpation of the cheeks. Mandibular SEPs are thought to cause lingual ulceration. Objectives To examine associations between the presence of SEPs on the cheek teeth rows and the presence of pain on palpation of the cheeks and buccal and/or lingual ulceration. Study design Retrospective clinical case series. Methods Clinical records of routine dental examination performed by 8 veterinary surgeons in a single first opinion practice were examined. Presence of SEPs, buccal and/or lingual ulceration and pain on palpation of the cheeks (externally) were recorded. Chi squared tests were used to examine whether horses exhibiting pain on palpation or oral ulceration were significantly more likely to have SEPs present. Results Prevalence of buccal SEPs was 84.8% and prevalence of lingual SEPs was 84.3%. Five hundred and forty-eight horses (6.0%) had signs of pain on palpation. Prevalence of buccal ulceration was 5.9%. In contrast, only 0.2% of horses had visible lingual ulceration. Buccal ulceration and pain on palpation were significantly associated with presence of buccal SEPs (P<0.001 for both). Lingual ulceration was not significantly associated with lingual SEPs (P<0.0001). Conclusions Buccal SEPs are common and often result in pain and buccal ulceration. Routine rasping would appear to be justified. Lingual SEPs are common but rarely cause lingual ulceration. The value of routine rasping of lingual SEPs is therefore questionable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lameness negatively affects the welfare of horses; it often coexists with thoracolumbar pain. The mechanisms linking the two are not well understood. Objectives To document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on left and right reins; to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fourteen non-lame horses were trotted in straight lines and lunged on a 10?m diameter circle on left and right reins and inertial sensor data collected at landmarks: withers, 13th (T13) and 18th thoracic vertebrae, 3rd lumbar vertebra, tubera sacrale, left and right tubera coxae. Data were processed using published methods [1]; pitch and roll, dorsoventral and lateral motion and symmetry within each stride were assessed. Results Dorsoventral motion during one stride had a sinusoidal pattern with 2 oscillations. The greatest amplitude and symmetry (119?±?4?mm, 96?±?1% in straight lines vs. 127?±?5?mm, 94?±?1% in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater rotation around the transverse axis (>1.3°, P?=?0.002) and movement in a lateral direction (>16?mm P?=?0.002), greater dorsoventral amplitude and asymmetry; however, the latter differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between reins. The difference in the left and right hindlimb stance phases and the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar were significantly associated. Greater circle-induced upward movement of a tuber coxae during the contralateral hindlimb stance was associated with greater circle-induced asymmetry of the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar (P?=?0.04). Conclusions Moving on a circle induces measurable changes in thoracolumbar movement compared with moving in straight lines, associated with alterations in the hindlimb gait.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is common in equids, with a high risk of re-injury associated with changes in tendon stiffness. In vivo measurement of limb stiffness has been shown to correlate with tendon stiffness after injury [1] but requires kinematic analysis which is impractical in a clinical setting. We have developed a simple system for measuring limb stiffness statically, which could be used as a tool for monitoring SDFT healing. Objectives To validate a goniometric measurement of limb stiffness. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Initially, forelimb stiffness indices were determined at the walk for 6 equids using a validated kinematic analysis [1]. Limb stiffness indices were then calculated using portable floor scales to record ground reaction force (GRF), and an electrogoniometer to record metacarpophalangeal joint angle. Goniometric limb stiffness indices were subsequently measured in 11 horses ranging from 2 to 20 years of age, with no clinical evidence of SDFT injury. Strength and significance of correlation and agreement between the measurement methods was assessed and association between limb stiffness, limb (left vs. right), weight and age of horse and were calculated. Results There were strong positive correlations between GRF and joint angle (R2?=?0.98) and between the static and kinematic methods (R?=?0.78, P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between limb stiffness and weight (R2?=?0.85, P<0.01), but no association with age or limb. Conclusions This study validated the measurement of limb stiffness in a clinical setting. The positive correlation of limb stiffness and weight supports the theory of an optimised limb spring [2] for energy-efficient cursorial locomotion which may, in turn, provide a clinically-relevant measure of running efficiency and therefore the quality of tendon healing post injury.
