AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - 1 Human hand vein endothelial cells were isolated from blood obtained by traumatic venepuncture. Cells were identified as endothelial by staining with endothelium-specific antibodies. The subject groups studied were (i) non-pregnant, (ii) pregnant (mean, 35 weeks gestation) and (iii) pre-eclamptic women (mean, 36 weeks gestation). 2 Fura-2 was used to measure agonist-induced responses in intracellular Ca2+ in single endothelial cells isolated and maintained in vitro. All of the cells examined responded to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with a large transient increase in Ca2+ followed by a sustained plateau. 3 The responses to ATP were significantly larger in the cells from pregnant women than in those from non-pregnant and pre-eclamptic women, but no other differences were observed. The amplitudes of the responses to ATP were (means ± s.e.m.) 0.56 ± 0.04, 1.42 ± 0.24 and 0.65 ± 0.09 fura-2 ratio units for cells from non-pregnant, pregnant and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively. 4 In cells isolated from non-pregnant subjects, the amplitude of the responses to carbachol, histamine and bradykinin were all smaller than those activated by ATP: 5.1, 13.9 and 4.4 %, respectively. Not all cells responded to these agonists: 25 % responded to carbachol, 70.5 % responded to histamine and 12.5 % responded to bradykinin. Sixty-five per cent of the cells from normotensive pregnant subjects responded to bradykinin compared with 25 % in the non-pregnant and 13.9 % in the pre-eclamptic subjects. 5 These data suggest that there may be differences in the responsiveness of venous endothelial cells in pregnancy and that pre-eclamptic cells behave differently.

AB  - Abstract To explore the hypothesis that alterations in cellular membrane lipids are present at the stage of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) (i.e., cognitively normal at death, but with AD neuropathology), we performed targeted shotgun lipidomics of lipid extracts from post-mortem brains of subjects with pre-clinical AD. We found sulfatide levels were significantly lower in subjects with pre-clinical AD compared to those without AD neuropathology. We also found that the level of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid was marginally lower at this stage of AD, whereas changes of the ceramide levels were undetectable with the available samples. These results indicate that cellular membrane defects are present at the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis and also suggest that sulfatide loss is among the earliest events of AD development, while alterations in the levels of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid and ceramide occur relatively later in disease.

AB  - Abstract Background Skeletal muscle is central to locomotion and metabolic homeostasis. The laboratory worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been developed into a genomic model for assessing the genes and signals that regulate muscle development and protein degradation. Past work has identified a receptor tyrosine kinase signalling network that combinatorially controls autophagy, nerve signal to muscle to oppose proteasome-based degradation, and extracellular matrix-based signals that control calpain and caspase activation. The last two discoveries were enabled by following up results from a functional genomic screen of known regulators of muscle. Recently, a screen of the kinome requirement for muscle homeostasis identified roughly 40% of kinases as required for C. elegans muscle health; 80 have identified human orthologues and 53 are known to be expressed in skeletal muscle. To complement this kinome screen, here, we screen most of the phosphatases in C. elegans. Methods RNA interference was used to knockdown phosphatase-encoding genes. Knockdown was first conducted during development with positive results also knocked down only in fully developed adult muscle. Protein homeostasis, mitochondrial structure, and sarcomere structure were assessed using transgenic reporter proteins. Genes identified as being required to prevent protein degradation were also knocked down in conditions that blocked proteasome or autophagic degradation. Genes identified as being required to prevent autophagic degradation were also assessed for autophagic vesicle accumulation using another transgenic reporter. Lastly, bioinformatics were used to look for overlap between kinases and phosphatases required for muscle homeostasis, and the prediction that one phosphatase was required to prevent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was assessed by western blot. Results A little over half of all phosphatases are each required to prevent abnormal development or maintenance of muscle. Eighty-six of these phosphatases have known human orthologues, 57 of which are known to be expressed in human skeletal muscle. Of the phosphatases required to prevent abnormal muscle protein degradation, roughly half are required to prevent increased autophagy. Conclusions A significant portion of both the kinome and phosphatome are required for establishing and maintaining C. elegans muscle health. Autophagy appears to be the most commonly triggered form of protein degradation in response to disruption of phosphorylation-based signalling. The results from these screens provide measurable phenotypes for analysing the combined contribution of kinases and phosphatases in a multi-cellular organism and suggest new potential regulators of human skeletal muscle for further analysis.

AB  - Abstract l-glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and has a central role in a variety of brain functions. The termination of glutamate neurotransmission by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) is essential to maintain glutamate concentration low in extracellular space and avoid excitotoxicity. EAAT2/GLT-1, being the most abundant subtype of glutamate transporter in the CNS, plays a key role in regulation of glutamate transmission. Dysfunction of EAAT2 has been correlated with various pathologies such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, among others. Therefore, activators of the function or enhancers of the expression of EAAT2/GLT-1 could serve as a potential therapy for these conditions. Translational activators of EAAT2/GLT-1, such as ceftriaxone and LDN/OSU-0212320, have been described to have significant protective effects in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epilepsy. In addition, pharmacological activators of the activity of EAAT2/GLT-1 have been explored for decades and are currently emerging as promising tools for neuroprotection, having potential advantages over expression activators. This review describes the current status of the search for EAAT2/GLT-1 activators and addresses challenges and limitations that this approach might encounter. Termination of glutamate neurotransmission by glutamate transporter EAAT2 is essential to maintain homeostasis in the brain and to avoid excitotoxicity. Dysfunction of EAAT2 has been correlated with various neurological pathologies. Therefore, activators of the function or enhancers of the expression of EAAT2 (green arrows) could serve as a potential therapy for these conditions. This review describes the current status of the search for EAAT2 activators and addresses challenges and limitations of this approach.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

APMIS 2010; 118: 595?605. Long-term clinical use of glucocorticoids often causes the serious side effect of non-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), on differentiation of primary cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMCs). We also tried to block the inhibitory effects of Dex on osteoblast differentiation. Adipocyte markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor?-2 and aP2) were increased in response to Dex treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while osteoblastic markers [Runx2, COL 1, osterix, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and OC] were down-regulated, consistent with ALP and osteocalcin promoter activity. To validate the effects of Runx2 on the expression of osteogenesis and adipocyte genes, pCMV/Flag-Runx2 was transfected into BMCs, and relevant markers were detected after 10?7?M Dex treatment for 48?h. The results indicated that Dex treatment induced adipogenic differentiation and suppressed proliferation. No significant difference was detected in expressions of these genes between Runx2-transfected cells and Dex-treated BMCs. These data suggest that Dex primarily induced adipocyte differentiation of BMCs. Exogenous Runx2 can antagonize the effect of Dex on osteoblast differentiation.

AB  - In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest the efficacy of various skin protection measures in the prevention of hand dermatitis (HD). The aims and objectives of this intervention study was to quantify the efficacy of skin protection (SP) measures and UVB hardening in the prevention of HD. SP measures were compared against UVB hardening in a controlled clinical trial of 94 apprentices. The apprentices were assigned to the intervention arms class-wise. Baker apprentices involved in a previous follow-up study served as an additional historic control group representing no intervention. The apprentices were interviewed and examined in a standardised way at the beginning of the vocational training and at four follow-ups. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured at the back of the hands. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the controls (C)(29.1%) followed by the UVB-group (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7%(95%CI ?8.5 to 28.1) and 15.8%(95%CI ?2.4 to 33.9), respectively. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed atopy (OR?=?4.74, 95%CI 1.12?20.11, p?=?0.035) and skin care (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16?0.86, p?=?0.023) to be independent risk factors. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95%CI 0.17?3.70) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.09?1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. The trends in the clinical results were confirmed by statistically significant differences in TEWL values. Apprentices in the SP group consistently had a lower prevalence of HD compared to the apprentices in the UVB and C group. These trends were reinforced by statistically significant differences in TEWL levels. A multi-centre trial is recommended to confirm the efficacy of SP measures in a larger randomised study.

AB  - Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.?Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

Kalaria (2011) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology37, 94?113?Molecular genetics and pathology of hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain Advances in molecular genetics have enabled identification of several monogenic conditions involving small vessels predisposing to ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and diffuse white matter disease. With emphasis on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), we review the molecular pathogenesis of recently characterized disorders including cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) and the Collagen type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A1)-related disorders. CADASIL remains the most common hereditary small vessel disease (SVD) caused by >190 different mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, which encodes a cell-signalling receptor. Mutant NOTCH3 instigates degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles leading to recurrent lacunar infarcts. Mutations in the serine protease HTRA1 gene are associated with CARASIL. Aberrant HTRA1 activity results in increased transforming growth factor-? signalling provoking multiple actions including vascular fibrosis and extracellular matrix synthesis. The RVCL disorders characterized by profound retinopathy are associated with mutations in TREX1, which encodes an abundant 3??5? DNA-specific exonuclease. TREX1 mutations lead to detrimental gain-of-function or insufficient quantities of enzyme. The COL4A1-related disorders are highly variable comprising four major phenotypes with overlapping systemic and central nervous system features including SVD with cerebral haemorrhages in children and adults. Mutant COL4A1 likely disrupts the extracellular matrix resulting in fragile vessel walls. The hereditary SVDs albeit with variable phenotypes demonstrate how effects of different defective genes converge to produce the characteristic arteriopathy and microvascular disintegration leading to vascular cognitive impairment.

AB  - Summary: Background: To evaluate the biocompatibility of surgical mesh, explanted mesh samples were collected and analysed. ?Methods: All mesh specimens (N?= 347) underwent a detailed clinical work-up and morphological study by conventional light microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. ?Results: The mean implantation interval for all mesh samples was approximately 24 months; the reason for explantation in the present data pool included complications such as recurrence (mean 63?%), chronic pain (mean 30?%), infection (mean 21?%) or fistula formation (mean 7?%). All mesh types in this particular database exhibited no significant differences in recurrence rates and infection, but significant differences in chronic pain. Here, the low-weight mesh Vypro? seems to have advantages over heavy-weight mesh modifications. Moreover, histological examination in all specimens revealed a typical foreign body reaction depending on the polymer and the mesh features such as pore size and surface area. ?Conclusions: Hernia repair with surgical mesh may be complicated by recurrence, chronic pain and infection including fistula formation in the long-term follow-up. The main differences between single-mesh modifications were found in chronic pain. Here, low-weight mesh constructions should show improved patient comfort.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Abstract Epidemiological studies associate post-menopausal estrogen use with a reduction in risk of Alzheimer's disease, a reduction in risk of Parkinson's disease, and death from stroke. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogens have been well described and may contribute to these clinical effects. Estrogen-mediated neuroprotection has been described in several neuronal culture model systems with toxicities including serum-deprivation, ?-amyloid-induced toxicity, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. In animal models, estrogens have been shown to attenuate neuronal death in rodent models of cerebral ischemia, traumatic injury, and Parkinson's disease. Although estrogens are known to exert several direct effects on neurons, the cellular mechanisms behind the neuroprotective efficacy of the steroid are only beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we summarize the data supporting a neuroprotective role for estrogens in both culture and animal models and discuss neuronal effects of estrogens that may contribute to the neuroprotective effects. These effects include activation of the nuclear estrogen receptor, altered expression of bcl-2 and related proteins, activation of the mitogen activated kinase pathway, activation of cAMP signal transduction pathways, modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, and direct antioxidant activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Open peritoneal drainage is not a common procedure, but may be used in severe cases of septic peritonitis as an alternative to closing the abdomen and placing active suction drains. The veterinary nurse's role becomes important as these patients require intensive monitoring and nursing. This article aims to explain the procedure, and the role of the nurse to make sure the patient has the best outcome possible.
