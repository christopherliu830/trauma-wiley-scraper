AB  - Summary Entrance of air into the pleural cavity results in positive intrapleural pressure that causes collapse of the lungs, with a subsequent drop in venous return and cardiac output. In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Thoracocentesis should be performed when pneumothorax is suspected and it might be required as a life-saving procedure prior to radiographic or ultrasonographic confirmation of air accumulation. In more severely affected animals, tachypnea and respiratory distress can occur, or collapse can result from pneumomediastinum accompanied by pneumothorax. Mediastinitis or a mediastinal mass effect can result from fungal infection causing enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, or by bacteria directly inoculated through the thoracic wall or entering via an esophageal or tracheal route. Chylothorax is caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid from the thoracic duct into the pleural cavity.

AB  - Abstract Lanthanides, once termed rare-earth elements, are not as sparce in the environment as their traditional name suggests. Mean litospheric concentrations are in fact comparable to the physiologically fundamental elements such as iodine, cobalt, and selenium. Recent advances in medical technology have resulted in accumulation of lanthanides presenting potential exposure to both our central and peripheral nervous systems. Extensive and detailed studies on these peculiar active metals in the context of their influence on neural functions are therefore urgently required. Almost all neurochemical effects of trivalent lanthanide ions appear to result from the similarity of their radii to the key signaling ion calcium. Lanthanides, especially La3+ and Gd3+ block different types of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels in human and animal neurons, regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release, as well as synaptic activity. Lanthanides also act as modulators of several ionotropic receptors, e.g., GABA, NMDA, and kainate and can also affect numerous signaling mechanisms including NF-?B and apoptotic-related endoplasmic reticulum IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways. Several lanthanide ions may cause oxidative neuronal injuries and functional impairment by promoting reactive oxygen species production. However, cerium and yttrium oxides have some unique and promising neuroprotective properties, being able to decrease free radical cell injury and even alleviate motor impairment and cognitive function in animal models of multiple sclerosis and mild traumatic brain damage, respectively. In conclusion, lanthanides affect various neurophysiological processes, altering a large spectrum of brain functions. Thus, a deeper understanding of their potential mechanistic roles during disease and as therapeutic agents requires urgent elucidation.

AB  - Immunoassays have long been an important set of tools in clinical laboratories for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in utilizing CE as a means for conducting immunoassays with clinical samples. The resulting method is known as a CE immunoassay. This approach makes use of the selective and strong binding of antibodies for their targets, as is employed in a traditional immunoassay, and combines this with the speed, efficiency, and small sample requirements of CE. This review discusses the variety of ways in which CE immunoassays have been employed with clinical samples. An overview of the formats and detection modes that have been employed in these applications is first presented. A more detailed discussion is then given on the type of clinical targets and samples that have been measured or studied by using CE immunoassays. Particular attention is given to the use of this method in the fields of endocrinology, pharmaceutical measurements, protein and peptide analysis, immunology, infectious disease detection, and oncology. Representative applications in each of these areas are described, with these examples involving work with both traditional and microanalytical CE systems.

AB  - Abstract Many studies on stem cell plasticity are challenging the concept that stem cells contain an intrinsically predefined, unidirectional differentiation program. This means that the developmental fate of a stem cell is dependent on the general potential of the cell (pre-determined stem cell fate) as well as on microenvironmental cues, such as stimuli from growth factors (stem cell niche). Here, we reviewed reports that examined the hepatocyte differentiation ability of stem cells from two different sources: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. All of those stem cells revealed the ability to give rise to hepatocyte-like cells using different induction strategies. However, it is still not clear which of those stem cells would be the best source for hepatocyte replacement or which would be the best protocol. We herein present the current knowledge regarding available protocols and factors used in order to obtain functional hepatocytes from stem cells.

AB  - Abstract The amniotic fluid has been identified as an untapped source of cells with broad potential, which possess immunomodulatory properties and do not have the ethical and legal limitations of embryonic stem cells. CD117(c-Kit)+ cells selected from amniotic fluid have been shown to differentiate into cell lineages representing all three embryonic germ layers without generating tumors, making them ideal candidates for regenerative medicine applications. Moreover, their ability to engraft in injured organs and modulate immune and repair responses of host tissues, suggest that transplantation of such cells may be useful for the treatment of various degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Although significant questions remain regarding the origin, heterogeneous phenotype, and expansion potential of amniotic fluid stem cells, evidence to date supports their potential role as a valuable stem cell source for the field of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Concentration gradients play an important role in controlling biological and pathological processes, such as metastasis, embryogenesis, axon guidance, and wound healing. Microfluidic devices fabricated by photo- and soft lithography techniques can manipulate the fluidic flow and diffusion profile to create biomolecular gradients in a temporal and spatial manner. Furthermore, microfluidic devices enable the control of cell-extracellular microenvironment interactions, including cell?cell, cell?matrix, and cell?soluble factor interaction. In this paper, we review the development of microfluidic-based gradient devices and highlight their biological applications.

AB  - Abstract Aims:? To identify and characterize nonfimbrial proteins from Aeromonas veronii involved in the attachment to epithelial cells in vitro. Methods and Results:? Two Aer. veronii mucin- and lactoferrin-binding proteins with molecular masses of 37 and 48?kDa were identified by Western blot analysis. According to its N-terminal amino acid sequence, the 48-kDa protein was identified as Omp48, an outer-membrane protein similar to LamB of Escherichia coli. LamB is a well-known porin involved in maltose transport across the outer membrane in E. coli. In a microtitre plate assay, Omp48 bound to the immobilized extracellular matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin, and the mucin- and lactoferrin-binding activity was confirmed. Adhesion of Omp48 to mucin, lactoferrin and collagen was diminished by preincubation with homologous glycoproteins or other carbohydrates, suggesting a putative Omp48 lectin-like binding domain. Anti-Omp48 antiserum significantly inhibited the Aer. veronii adhesion to confluent HeLa cell monolayers and pretreatment of cells with purified Omp48 elicited competitive inhibition of adhesion. Similarly, cross-inhibition of Aer. hydrophila and Aer. caviae adhesion was achieved with the same treatments, indicating the existence of a conserved surface protein among these species. Conclusions:? Taken together, these data indicate that Omp48 is involved in Aer. veronii adhesion to epithelial cells and might be an alternative adhesion factor of this micro-organism. Significance and Impact of the Study:? The adhesive potential of Aeromonas spp. is correlated with pathogenicity; however, the adhesion mechanism is complex and not well understood. This study provides evidence of a putative adhesion factor that might be contributing to pathogenicity of Aer. veronii and could be used for vaccine development.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract Stress-induced cortical alertness is maintained by a heightened excitability of noradrenergic neurons innervating, notably, the prefrontal cortex. However, neither the signaling axis linking hypothalamic activation to delayed and lasting noradrenergic excitability nor the molecular cascade gating noradrenaline synthesis is defined. Here, we show that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone-releasing neurons innervate ependymal cells of the 3rd ventricle to induce ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) release for transport through the brain's aqueductal system. CNTF binding to its cognate receptors on norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus then initiates sequential phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase with the Ca2+-sensor secretagogin ensuring activity dependence in both rodent and human brains. Both CNTF and secretagogin ablation occlude stress-induced cortical norepinephrine synthesis, ensuing neuronal excitation and behavioral stereotypes. Cumulatively, we identify a multimodal pathway that is rate-limited by CNTF volume transmission and poised to directly convert hypothalamic activation into long-lasting cortical excitability following acute stress.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) have been shown to exert prothrombotic effects in microvessels, it is poorly understood whether CBNs also have the potential to interfere with the process of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and whether the shape of CBNs plays a role in these processes. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of two differently shaped CBNs, fiber-shaped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and spherical ultrafine carbon black (CB), on thrombus formation as well as on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and leukocyte transmigration in the murine microcirculation upon systemic administration in vivo. Systemic administration of both SWCNT and CB accelerated arteriolar thrombus formation at a dose of 1?mg?kg?1 body weight, whereas SWCNT exerted a prothrombotic effect also at a lower dose (0.1?mg?kg?1 body weight). In vitro, both CBNs induced P-selectin expression on human platelets and formation of platelet-granulocyte complexes. In contrast, injection of fiber-shaped SWCNT or of spherical CB did not induce leukocyte?endothelial cell interactions or leukocyte transmigration. In vitro, both CBNs slightly increased the expression of activation markers on human monocytes and granulocytes. These findings suggest that systemic administration of CBNs accelerates arteriolar thrombus formation independently of the CBNs' shape, but does not induce leukocyte?endothelial cell interactions or leukocyte transmigration.
