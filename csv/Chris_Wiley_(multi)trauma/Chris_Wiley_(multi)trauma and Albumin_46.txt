AB  - SUMMARY:? Since 1998, by law, all school children in Korea must have an annual urinalysis. The first early morning urine specimen is examined by a simple dipstick method for the detection of proteinuria, haematuria and glucose. If a urine test is positive, a second test is performed by paediatric nephrologists. We analysed urinalysis data of school urinalysis screening. We also analysed the results of clinical data and the renal biopsy findings of patients referred to our medical centre due to abnormal urinalysis result. To date, about five million students have been screened since annual school urinalysis started in January 1998. Among them, isolated proteinuria was about 0.2%, occult blood was about 0.8%, and glucosuria was about 0.07% from January 1998 to December 2004. Among referred patients, renal biopsy was taken in 63.1% of isolated haematuria, 10.5% of isolated proteinuria and 69.9% of haematuria combined with proteinuria. Histopathological findings are IgA nephropathy in 43.8%, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 38.4%, Henoch?Schönlein nephritis in 2.7%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1.6% and lupus nephritis in 0.5%. Alport disease showed 0.6% as a hereditary disease. In conclusion, the school urinalysis screening could detect chronic renal disease in its early stage. Early detection using school urinalysis screening and confirmatory diagnosis by renal biopsy seems to be helpful for assessment of prognosis and intervention of chronic renal disease progression.

AB  - Abstract:? Two distinct approaches are being explored in red blood cell substitute (RCS) development: hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs). HBOCs are based on intra- and/or intermolecularly ?engineered? human or animal hemoglobins (Hbs), optimized for O2 delivery and longer intravascular circulation. Some are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical studies. PFBOCs are aqueous emulsions of perfluorocarbon derivatives that dissolve relatively large amounts of O2. A PFBOC based on a 60% (wt/vol) emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide has been evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials. Although current PFBOC products generally require patients to breathe O2 enriched air, they render certain advantages since they are totally synthetic. This article provides a short review of the basic principles, approaches, and current status of RCS development. Results of preclinical and clinical studies including recent Phase II/III clinical studies are discussed.

AB  - Summary Needs for surgical care are growing in low- and middle-income countries. Existing surgical care capacity indicators, focusing on the availability of equipment, personnel, and operation and anaesthetic skills, are not intended to evaluate perioperative nutrition management, which influences surgical outcomes. In this narrative review, we describe the prevalence of malnutrition and its clinical consequences among surgical patients in low- and middle-income countries, suggest potential measures to improve nutrition management and discuss the necessity of considering nutrition management as a component of surgical care capacity.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Abstract Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a subtype of bone marrow?derived progenitor cells. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)-mediated EPC mobilization from bone marrow to areas of ischemia plays an important role in angiogenesis. Previous studies have reported that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), which are important mediators of diabetes-related vascular pathology, may impair EPC migration and homing, but the mechanism is unclear. Syndecan-4 (synd4) is a ubiquitous heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor on the cell surface, involved in SDF-1-dependent cell migration. The extracellular domain of synd4 (ext-synd4) is shed in the context of acute inflammation, but the shedding of ext-synd4 in response to AGEs is undefined. Here we investigated changes in ext-synd4 on EPCs in response to AGEs, focusing on the influence of impaired synd4 signaling on EPC migration and homing. We found decreased full length and increased residue of synd4 in cells incubated with AGEs, with concomitant increase in the soluble fragment of ext-synd4 in the cell medium. EPCs from patients with type 2 diabetes expressed less ext-synd4 as assessed by Western blotting. Flow cytometry analysis showed less ext-synd4 on circulating CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, of which EPCs form a subgroup. We then explored the role of synd4 in EPC migration and homing. Impaired migration of synd4-deficient EPCs was observed by a 2D-chemotaxis slide. Furthermore, poor homing of synd4?/? EPCs was observed in a mouse model of lower limb ischemia. This study demonstrates that the shedding of synd4 from EPCs plays a key role in AGE-mediated dysfunction of EPC migration and homing. Stem Cells 2017;35:522?531

AB  - Small molecules were developed to attenuate proinflammatory cytokines resulting from activation of MyD88-mediated toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by Francisella tularensis. Fifty-three tripeptide derivatives were synthesized to mimic a key BB-loop region involved in toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor recognition (TIR) domain interactions. Compounds were tested for inhibition of TNF-α, IFN-?, IL-6, and IL-1? in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to LPS extracts from F. tularensis. From 53 compounds synthesized and tested, ten compounds were identified as effective inhibitors of F. tularensisLPS-induced cytokines. Compound stability testing in the presence of human liver microsomes and human serum resulted in the identification of tripeptide derivative 7 that was a potent, stable, and drug-like small molecule. Target corroboration using a cell-based reporter assay and competition experiments with MyD88 TIR domain protein supported that the effect of 7 was through MyD88 TIR domain interactions. Compound 7 also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bronchial epithelial cells challenged with a live vaccine strain of F. tularensis at a multiplicity of infection of 1:5. Small molecules that target TIR domain interactions in MyD88-dependent TLR signaling represent a promising strategy toward host-directed adjunctive therapeutics for inflammation associated with biothreat agent-induced sepsis.

AB  - Summary Inherited coagulation disorders constitute a broad spectrum of coagulation factor deficiencies that include X-linked factor (F)VIII or FIX deficiency that causes haemophilia, and autosomal recessive disorders producing heterogeneous deficiencies in fibrinogen (FI), prothrombin (FII), FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII and combined FV+FVIII. Significant advances in treatments for patients with congenital haemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) and B (FIX deficiency) over the last two decades have resulted from improvements in the production, availability and patient access to factor replacement products. Translation of advances in biotechnology, namely recombinant protein technology, targeted protein modifications to improve function and potentially reduce immunogenicity, and advanced formulations to optimize bioavailability and sustain activity offer promisingly new treatments for haemophilia as well as recessively inherited bleeding disorders in patients who otherwise have few therapeutic options. Though a theoretical risk remains for blood-borne viral infections with pooled plasma-derived products, this concern has diminished with breakthroughs in purification and viral inactivation methods. Development of inhibitory antibodies is still the most daunting problem for patients with inherited bleeding disorders, complicating treatment approaches to control and prevent bleeding, and posing risks for allergic and anaphylactic reactions in susceptible patients. The objectives of this review are to (i) highlight emerging advances in hemostatic therapies that are bioengineered to improve pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, sustain functional activity, and possibly eliminate immunogenicity of recombinant factor proteins; and (ii) present an overview of key clinical trials of novel factor products currently in the development pipeline.

AB  - Abstract Tibial plateau fractures are difficult to treat and more likely complicated by subsequent surgical site infection (SSI). There is limited information about its characteristics and related risk factors for SSI. This study was designed as a prospective and multicentre one to address this issue. From July to 15 November in 2014, 235 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and followed up with complete data. Twelve patients (5·1%, 12/235) developed SSI, with 2·1% for deep SSI and 3·0% for superficial SSI. Most of them (10/12) occurred during the hospital stays. The median occurrence time was 6 days after operation (range, 2?26 days). We use univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the potential risk factors. In the univariate analysis, open fracture, prolonged preoperative stay, smoking habitus and preoperative abnormal neutrophil (NEUT) count were significant risk factors for SSI occurrence. However, in multivariate analysis, only open fracture (OR, 3·31; 95%, 1·06?1·84) and current smoking status (OR, 5·68; 95% CI, 1·56?20·66) remained significant. We recommend that smoking cessation programme is introduced at the time of admission to the hospital and elaborative evaluation of fracture severity and soft-tissue damage is performed with an aim of reducing the risk of post-operative SSI.

AB  - Summary Reactions involving free radicals are an inherent feature of plant senescence and appear to contribute to a process of oxidative deterioration that leads ultimately to cell death. Radical species derived from molecular oxygen are the primary mediators of this oxidative damage, but non-radical excited states of oxygen, specifically singlet oxygen, may also be involved. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation of lipids in senescing membranes and the ensuing release of free fatty acids initiate oxidative deterioration by providing substrate for lipoxygenase. In some tissues, lipoxygenase activity increases with advancing senescence in a pattern that is consistent with its putative role in promoting oxidative damage. However, there are important exceptions to this which may be explained by the fact that the timing and extent of peroxidative reactions initiated by lipoxygenase are likely to be determined more by the availability of substrate for the enzyme than by changes in its activity. There are both membranous and cytosolic forms of lipoxygenase in senescing tissues, and peroxidation of membrane lipids appears to be initiated by the membranous enzyme once the appropriate fatty acid substrates, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, become available. Since lipid peroxidation is known to form alkoxy and peroxy radicals as well as singlet oxygen, these reactions in membrane bilayers are probably a major source of activated oxygen species in senescing tissues. Further-more, there are indications that activated oxygen from the lipoxygenase reaction can become substrate for the cytosolic form of the enzyme which, in turn, may raise the titre of activated oxygen during senescence. Additional possible sources of increased free radical production in senescing tissues include peroxidase, which shows greatly increased activity with advancing age, leakage of electrons from electron transport systems to oxygen, in particular from the photosynthetic electron transport system, and decompartmentalization of iron, which would facilitate formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from the less reactive superoxide anion. A variety of macromolecules can be damaged by activated oxygen. Unsaturated fatty acids are especially prone to attack, and this implies that membranes are primary targets of free radical damage. The manifestations of this damage in senescing tissues range from altered membrane fluidity and phase properties to leakiness that can be attributed to a destabilized and highly perturbed membrane bilayer. There is also a progressive breakdown of cellular protein with advancing senescence. Free radicals can inactivate proteins by reacting with specific amino acid residues, and a number of in zitro studies have indicated that such alteration renders the proteins more prone to hydrolysis by proteases. Thus, although there is no direct evidence linking enhanced proteolysis during senescence to free radical damage, there is reason to believe that this may be a contributing factor. Wounding of certain plant tissues also initiates a series of reactions that revolve around the breakdown of membrane lipids and their peroxidation. Indeed, as in the case of senescence, membrane deterioration follokving wounding appears to be facilitated by a self-perpetuating wave of free radical production emanating from peroxidation within the lipid bilayer. There is also recent evidence for activation of an O2? -producing NADPH oxidase in plant tissues following fungal infection that may be analogous to the well-characterized O2?-generating NADPH oxidase associated with the plasma membrane of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This raises the interesting possibility that plants and animals share a common defence response to invading organisms.
