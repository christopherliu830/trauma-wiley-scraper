AB  - Abstract Aims Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects women both acutely and chronically after vaginal delivery. Current SUI treatments assume the neuromuscular continence mechanism, comprised of the pudendal nerve (PN) and external urethral sphincter (EUS), is either intact or irreparable. This study investigated the ability of neurotrophin therapy to facilitate recovery of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Methods Virgin, Sprague Dawley rats received simulated childbirth injury or sham injury and treatment with continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or saline placebo to the site of PN injury. Continence was assessed by leak point pressure (LPP) and EUS electromyography (EMG) 14 and 21 days after injury. Structural recovery was assessed histologically. Molecular assessment of the muscular and neuroregenerative response was determined via measurement of EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression respectively, 4, 8, and 12 days after injury. Results Following injury, LPP was significantly reduced with saline compared to either BDNF treatment or sham injury. Similarly, compared to sham injury, resting EUS EMG amplitude and firing rate, as well as amplitude during LPP were significantly reduced with saline but not BDNF treatment. Histology confirmed improved EUS recovery with BDNF treatment. EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression demonstrated that BDNF treatment improved the neurogenerative response and may facilitate sphincteric recovery. Conclusions Continuous targeted neurotrophin therapy accelerates continence recovery after simulated childbirth injury likely through stimulating neuroregeneration and facilitating EUS recovery and re-innervation. Neurotrophins or other therapies targeting neuromuscular regeneration may be useful for treating SUI related to failure of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Neurourol.

AB  - Abstract Extensive loss of skeletal muscle tissue results in mutilations and severe loss of function. In vitro-generated artificial muscles undergo necrosis when transplanted in vivo before host angiogenesis may provide oxygen for fibre survival. Here, we report a novel strategy based upon the use of mouse or human mesoangioblasts encapsulated inside PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel. Once engineered to express placental-derived growth factor, mesoangioblasts attract host vessels and nerves, contributing to in vivo survival and maturation of newly formed myofibres. When the graft was implanted underneath the skin on the surface of the tibialis anterior, mature and aligned myofibres formed within several weeks as a complete and functional extra muscle. Moreover, replacing the ablated tibialis anterior with PEG-fibrinogen-embedded mesoangioblasts also resulted in an artificial muscle very similar to a normal tibialis anterior. This strategy opens the possibility for patient-specific muscle creation for a large number of pathological conditions involving muscle tissue wasting.

AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.
