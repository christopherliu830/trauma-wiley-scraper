AB  - N-methyl-thio-tetrazole (NMTT) has been proposed as a causative factor in antibiotic-associated coagulopathy. To evaluate this hypothesis, a nationwide surveillance program was initiated to determine the relative frequency of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy and the importance of specific risk factors. A total of 970 patients were studied, with 491 being treated for infections and 479 receiving antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis. The NMTT-containing antibiotic cefotetan was compared with non-NMTT-containing antibiotics, for example, cefoxitin and cefazolin (prophylaxis only), and an aminoglycoside-antianaerobic (AG + AA) combination. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were measured for each patient prior to the start of antibiotics and within 24?96 hours after the conclusion of drug administration. The patient population was relatively young [mean (SD) age 51.0 (20) yrs] with good nutritional status. The overall frequency of hypoprothrombinemia (4.5%) and bleeding (1.7%) was very low, and was highest with the use of AG + AA (p < 0.05). No statistical differences were observed for the remaining antibiotic regimens in either the prophylaxis or treatment group. Logistic regression analysis identified treatment with the AG + AA combination, presence of liver disease, and renal dysfunction as factors associated with an increased risk of hypoprothrombinemia. In conclusion, this study suggests that the frequency of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy is low, regardless of antibiotic, in patients who are not critically ill and not malnourished.

APPENDIX 1:?USEFUL ADDRESSES AND WEBSITES ? APPENDIX 2:?SPECIALISED FEEDING Summary There is a nutritional component to most illnesses (whether poor nutrition leads to disease or disease adversely affects nutritional status) and their treatment, often involving all the health care professions. Undernutrition can adversely affect every system of the body such as the muscular system (resulting in fatigue, lethargy and decreased peripheral and respiratory muscle strength), the immune system (predisposing to and delaying recovery from infection) and psycho-social function (causing anxiety, depression and self-neglect). As a consequence, undernutrition consumes a disproportionate amount of health care resources. It is estimated that 70% of undernutrition in the UK goes unrecognised and untreated and that, in the community, 5% of the population have a body mass index (BMI) less than 20?kg/m2. In hospitals this figure rises to 20?25%. It is important to recognise that not all people with low BMI are undernourished; some may be perfectly healthy. There are difficulties in defining undernutrition because the anthropometric measurements used are neither age nor disease specific. Ranges and cut-off points to define normal or ideal have been based on healthy young individuals and are applied to the whole population. However, the three key elements that help define undernutrition or risk of undernutrition are: assessment of chronic protein-energy status, history of weight loss, and underlying risk factors including disease and disabilities. Patients may be malnourished on admission to hospital as a result of a variety of disease-related, social or psychological factors. Mental illnesses such as depression and dementia cause anorexia. Malignancy and acute or chronic physical disease reduce appetite and alter the taste, smell and preferences for different types of food. Infections and malignant disease may also increase nutritional requirements. Neurological and mechanical impairment of swallowing and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract affect nutritional intake. Factors such as social isolation and poverty can play an important role, and disability and immobility can interfere with food purchase and preparation. Taste appreciation also alters with ageing. It is reported that 40% of all patients admitted to hospitals are undernourished, half of them severely so. Nutritional status tends to worsen during hospital stay and is associated with a worse outcome of the disease and prolonged hospital stay. Studies have shown that 40% of hospital food is wasted, which results in patients receiving only 70% of their energy and protein requirements. Because many patients are discharged from hospital in a worse nutritional state than they entered, a further group of undernourished individuals are discharged into the community, setting up a vicious circle. This can largely be prevented or treated with appropriate screening and management. Weight loss often continues in many patients during their hospital stay for many reasons. These include surgical treatments and investigations that impair appetite or the ability to eat (while increasing nutritional requirements) or treatments and procedures that require a period of nil-by-mouth beforehand, which reduces intake. Frustratingly, sometimes a patient may be nil-by-mouth all morning only to have the treatment delayed or postponed to a later date. Often when the patient returns to the ward, no meal has been saved for them (due to lack of communication or lack of suitable facilities to store it if it was hot) and there may be no other food available to them. A major contributor to the worsening nutritional status during hospitalisation, however, is the inadequacy of current catering and feeding practices. Hospital catering is beset with all sorts of seemingly trivial problems that add up to one huge problem. For example, the wrong food may arrive for a patient because they were not able to choose it themselves or they have been given a meal chosen by somebody else occupying the bed before them. The meal that does come is difficult to eat, e.g. the provision of individual butter packs that are difficult for frail arthritic fingers to open. Although special techniques of enteral and parenteral nutrition support are indicated for a minority of patients with failure of swallowing or gastrointestinal function, the majority of patients are dependent on hospital food to sustain them during illness. In many hospitals the three meals provided may be of a reasonable standard, as the catering officers struggle on the tight budget they have, but the range and quality of the snacks (essential to meet increased requirements in many patients) let them down. In many cases, proprietary oral supplements or sip feeds may be of value, but they should not become a convenient substitute for adequate and appropriate food provision. Hospital menus and meals should provide sufficient choice to offer healthy, balanced, appetising nutrition for all patients. Menus should be designed to meet the needs of particular patient groups, e.g. elderly people, children and ethnic minorities. Adequate choice should be available to meet these needs. Special attention should be given to the requirements of sick and nutritionally vulnerable patients, and appropriate special therapeutic diets for those who need them should be provided. A range of meals specially fortified in energy and protein should also be available in every hospital, and snacks and nourishing drinks should be kept in the ward and routinely offered between meals. The timing of meals should be reviewed and made more relevant to patients? customary meal patterns. All methods of food preparation, e.g. in-house cook-serve or brought-in cook-chill (with ward regeneration) have proved successful, but each is highly dependent on the method of distribution and serving. With proper management, a bulk trolley bedside service serves patients? needs best. Nutritionally vulnerable patients should be placed in wards with kitchen areas, or near ward kitchens, so that special meals or snacks can be prepared for them or, when possible, patients can access the kitchen themselves. The primary responsibility of the nutritional care of in-patients rests with the nurses in charge of the ward; therefore, food should be served by nurses, supported where necessary by other grades of staff trained for this purpose, e.g. ward hostesses, diet technicians/helpers. Assistance with eating must be provided where necessary. Plate or tray collection should be supervised by nursing staff, to enable patients? food intake to be monitored. Many studies have shown the benefits of nutritional intervention. Therefore, the presence of disease, whether in hospital or the community, should be seen as an indication of the need for nutritional screening to identify those at particular risk and those who might benefit from some form of nutritional intervention. In which case, implementing measures such as improved staff training, nutritional screening and assessment, and monitoring, combined with better catering practices will result in most patients? nutritional requirements being met. Fortified meals, between-meal snacks and adequate ward staffing have all been shown to contribute to achieving this goal, which leads to better clinical outcome, less waste, a shorter hospital stay and a more cost-effective service. Recently, a number of schemes and initiatives have been set up to help prevent or combat malnutrition both in hospitals and the community. These include the launch of Better Hospital Food: a new menu for the National Health Service, and the establishment of the Malnutrition Advisory Group, a group of experts convened to raise awareness and understanding of issues of undernutrition. Community initiatives include the establishment of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit for deprived neighbourhoods, Sure Start ? set up to operate local programmes for children and parents living in areas of high poverty, and Healthy Living Centres ? set up to run schemes such as luncheon clubs for older people.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Purpose To present the pathophysiology, differential diagnoses, assessment techniques, and treatment options for hepatic hydrothorax. Data Sources A case study is presented with supporting material from current medical literature. Conclusions Hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion caused by the flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through an actual defect in the diaphragm. Successful outcomes depend on early detection and timely referral of often-subtle lung involvement. Implications for Practice Although incidence is reported to be as high as 12% in cirrhotic patients, standard medical references attach little importance to pul-monary risks in this population. Hepatic hydrothorax should always be considered in the cirrhotic patient with a pleural effusion.

AB  - Abstract The urine chemistry analysis in dogs and cats is performed using commercially available urine chemistry test strips impregnated with colorimetric reagents. Several semi-automated instruments are commercially available for reading reagent test strips. The urine protein pad contains pH-based indicator dye at acidic pH and, when bound to the amino groups of negatively charged proteins, it changes color. Results of the urine test pad are often interpreted in conjunction with the urine specific gravity because the concentration of the urine protein is closely associated with the concentration or dilution of the urine. The test pad detects the presence of glucose by an enzymatic reaction involving glucose oxidase that results in a color change proportional to the amount of glucose present. The dipstick test pad for blood contains a peroxidase substrate which reacts with heme molecules contained in compounds such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, and in erythrocytes.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?

AB  - Summary A system was developed for objective prediction of survival, which could be applied to all critically ill patients, regardless of disease, at an early stage of hospitaluation. Such a system would allow risk assessment of groups for experimental studies according to probability of survival and it might allow us to avoid expenditure of scarce clinical resources on animals with little chance of survival. The prospective study included 200 critically ill dogs: 93 females and 107 males, representing 62 breeds. With survival defined as alive 30 days after admisssion to ICU the overall mortality rate was 40.5% (81 of 200 dogs). Data collected included signalment and parameters that reflected vital organ function, the severity of physiologic derangement and the extent of physiologic reserve. We recorded the most abnormal value for each parameter within 24 hours of admission to ICU and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze four different weighting systems. The best model had a concordance 0f 86.5% with outcome, and it was then re-evaluated to determine whether individual variables could be eliminated without losing predictive accuracy. Fourvariables were eliminated, resulting in a final model with 18 variables which had 86.3% concordance with outcome. At a 0.5 cut-off for predicted risk, the model had sensitivity Of 69%, specificity ficity of 86% and positive predictive value of 77%. A Receiver Operating Curve was constructed using serial cut-offs for predicted outcome from 0.1 to 0.9, and the area under the curve was 0.89. Thus, an equation was generated that gives an estimate of the probability of survival.

AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.
