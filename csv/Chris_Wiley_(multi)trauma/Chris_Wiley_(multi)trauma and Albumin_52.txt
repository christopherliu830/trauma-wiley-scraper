AB  - Aims The external anal sphincter (EAS) is essential for maintaining fecal continence. Neurological disorders or traumatic injuries to muscle and nervous systems could lead to EAS denervation. Currently, there are no techniques available to document global innervation changes in the EAS in vivo. The aim of this study was to develop a novel approach to non-invasively estimate the number of functioning motor units (MUs) in the EAS and validate with immunofluorescent techniques in rats. Methods Intra-rectal surface electromyography (EMG) signals of the EAS, induced by a series of intra-vaginally delivered pudendal nerve stimulations with different intensities, were recorded. Variation in EMG responses at different intensities was used to estimate the value of a single motor unit potential (SMUP) in order to perform the proposed EAS motor unit number estimation (MUNE) approach. The EAS MUNE was tested in 12 female Sprague-Dawley rats, and validated by comparing against the EAS myofiber counting results achieved by performing immunostaining of acetylcholine receptors in 7 of the 12 rats. Results The mean MU number was 35?±?9, with an averaged SMUP size of 52.49?±?20.39??V. The mean number of successfully identified myofibers was 652.7?±?130.6 myofiber/EAS. Significance of linear regression between the immunofluorescent results and the MUNE was confirmed (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Our study represents the first effort to non-invasively assess the innervation of the EAS in vivo using the rat as a pre-clinical model. This approach can potentially enable future clinical applications for advanced diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic EAS disorders.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Abstract Hospital length of stay (LOS) after liver transplantation has been determined to correlate with liver disease severity, post-transplant survival rates, and transplant-associated costs. A patient's model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and an organ's Donor risk index (DRI) have both been found to be significant predictors of LOS, but these two factors alone are insufficient to form an accurate prediction. Previous studies have identified other factors predictive of LOS, which can be incorporated with MELD and DRI to create more specific results. The objective of this study was to create an algorithm, or models, based on the most significant LOS predictors as identified from national data at different stages of the transplant process. Four models were developed predicting LOS using recipient factors, payment factors, donor factors, and postoperative factors. A medical care team member can enter a patient's data into the model and receive a reasonably accurate prediction of LOS for each phase of the liver transplant process, specifying the impact of each factor. These predictions would help predict the factors most likely to prolong LOS, inform resource allocation, and provide patients with more specific predictions of their LOS following transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To describe a severe case of bacterial sepsis and disseminated candidiasis in a previously healthy dog. Case Summary ? Fungal sepsis was identified in a 2-year-old dog following intestinal dehiscence 4 days after abdominal surgery. Septic peritonitis was identified at admission and evidence of dehiscence at the previous enterotomy site was found during an exploratory laparotomy. Both gram-positive cocci and Candida albicans were cultured from the abdominal cavity. Candida sp. was also subsequently cultured from a central venous catheter. Euthanasia was performed due to failure to respond to therapy. Fungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida spp., were found in the lungs and kidney on postmortem histopathologic examination indicating disseminated candidiasis. New or Unique Information Provided ? Candida peritonitis is a well-recognized entity in humans and contributes to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Abdominal surgery, intestinal perforation, presence of central venous catheters, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are all considered to be suspected risk factors. This report describes the first known case of systemic candidiasis occurring secondary to Candida peritonitis and bacterial sepsis in a critically ill dog.
