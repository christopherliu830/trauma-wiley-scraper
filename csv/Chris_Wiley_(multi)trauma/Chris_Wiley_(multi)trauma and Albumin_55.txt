AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - Summary In veterinary medicine, animals living at, or beyond, 75% of their life expectancy, are considered geriatric, but these geriatric patients will typically experience pain as any ?average aged? patient would. While physical changes associated with ageing may be common in the geriatric patient, some older animals may not exhibit these changes. Regardless of this sympathetic change, geriatric animals typically have other functional and anatomical changes within the central nervous system that may reduce their requirement for all analgesic drug classes. Therefore, required dosing of analgesics, including opioids, should be based on careful titration and close monitoring for response to treatment. The ageing cardiovascular changes should not be assumed in all geriatric patients as some are extremely fit and maintain an appropriate cardiac index for the reduced muscle mass and metabolic rate. Exercise tolerance is an important positive predictor of a successful anesthetic outcome.

AB  - Abstract Microchips for analytical purposes have attracted great attention over the last 20?years. In the present review, we focus on the most recent development of microchips for electrophoretic separation of proteins. This review starts with a short recalling about the microchips covering the basic microchip layout for CE and the commercial chips and microchip platforms. A short paragraph is dedicated to the surface treatment of microchips, which is of paramount importance in protein analysis. One section is dedicated to on-line sample pretreatment in microchips and summarizes different strategies to pre-concentrate or to purify proteins from complex matrixes. Most of the common modes used for CE of proteins have already been adapted to the chip format, while multidimensional approaches are still in progress. The different routes to achieve detection in microchip are also presented with a special attention to derivatization or labeling of proteins. Finally, several recent applications are mentioned. They highlight the great potential of electrophoretic separations of proteins in numerous fields such as biological, pharmaceutical or agricultural and food analysis. A bibliography with 151 references is provided covering papers published from 2000 to the early 2007.

AB  - Abstract Background: Perioperative enteral immunonutrition is thought to reduce postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the clinical effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing total gastrectomy. Methods: Well nourished patients with primary gastric cancer, fit for total gastrectomy, were randomized to either a control group with regular diet, or an immunonutrition group that received regular diet supplemented with 1000 ml/day of immunonutrients for 5 consecutive days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Secondary endpoints were rates of infectious complications, overall postoperative morbidity and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on 3?4 days after surgery. Results: Of 244 randomized patients, 117 were allocated to the control group and 127 received immunonutrition. SSIs occurred in 27 patients in the immunonutrition group and 23 patients in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1·09, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·66 to 1·78). Infectious complications were observed in 30 patients in the immunonutrition group and 27 in the control group (RR 1·11, 0·59 to 2·08). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 30·8 and 26·1 per cent respectively (RR 1·18, 0·78 to 1·78). The median CRP value was 11·8 mg/dl in the immunonutrition group and 9·2 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0·113). Conclusion: Five-day preoperative enteral immunonutrition failed to demonstrate any clear advantage in terms of early clinical outcomes or modification of the systemic acute-phase response in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing elective total gastrectomy.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

AB  - Abstract The study aim was to report survival and morbidity of all patients in Sweden with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as well as investigate whether the survival has increased on a population level since this treatment was nationalized 2011. Study data were collected from the Swedish HIPEC registry and the Swedish National Cancer Registry. All patients with peritoneal mesothelioma scheduled for CRS/HIPEC treatment in Sweden January 2011 to March 2018 were retrieved from the Swedish HIPEC registry. Clinicopathological and survival data were collected. For population-level analysis, all patients with diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) were identified from the Swedish National Cancer Registry and data were retrieved from two separate 5-year time periods: 1999-2003 and 2011-2015. Thirty-two patients were accepted for CRS/HIPEC. Four were open/close cases. Two-year survival rate was 84% or 59% when excluding borderline peritoneal mesotheliomas (n = 17). Median overall survival was not reached. Grade III-IV Clavien-Dindo events occurred in 22% with no mortality. From the national cancer registry, 102 DMPM cases were retrieved: 40 cases between 1999 and 2003, and 62 cases between 2011 and 2015 (corresponding to an increase from 0.9 to 1.24/million/year, P = .04). Six patients (10%) received CRS/HIPEC in the second period. Median OS increased between periods from 7 to 15 months and 5-year survival from 14% to 29% (P = .03). Peritoneal mesothelioma of both borderline and DMPM subtypes undergoing CRS/HIPEC have good long-term survival. The incidence of DMPM in Sweden has increased. Overall survival has increased alongside the introduction of CRS/HIPEC, which may be a contributing factor.
