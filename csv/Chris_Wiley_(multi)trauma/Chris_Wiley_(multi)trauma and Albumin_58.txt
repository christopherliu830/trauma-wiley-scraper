AB  - Summary We report the case of a 38?year-old woman who presented initially as the driver in a road traffic accident with a Glasgow Coma Score of 14, agitated, tachycardic, tachypnoeic and hypertensive. The combination of an abdominal CT scan and clinical findings led to the decision to perform an emergency laparotomy. Her persisting symptoms and laboratory results revealed her to be manifesting acute thyroid storm; TSH of <?0.10?IU.l?1, free T4 of 59.8?pmol.l?1 and free T3 of 20.20?pmol.l?1.

AB  - Abstract For several medical interventions, increasing experience results in improved outcome. This finding may result from better patient selection or increased skill levels. This report examines whether there is a relationship between center experience and patient outcome for liver transplantation, and if so, whether the relationship is explained by patient or donor selection or level of experience required to obtain optimal results. The United Network for Organ Sharing Scientific Liver Transplant Registry includes all procedures performed in the United States since October 1987. The date of the first transplantation and the number of operations performed were used to define 42 new and 27 experienced centers. Within new centers, experience was quantified by the sequence number of each transplantation. Characteristics of 6,180 recipients and donors were compared between new and experienced centers using the ?2 test for association. A linear trend test identified whether these characteristics varied with experience within new centers. The independent association between experience in new centers and perioperative mortality was examined using logistic regression. Patient and donor selection criteria differ between experienced and new centers and change within new centers as experience is gained. Adjusting for calendar year and various patient and donor characteristics, perioperative mortality rates decrease in new centers as experience is gained. After 20 transplantations are performed, perioperative mortality in new centers is not significantly different than that in experienced centers. Criteria for recipient and donor selection change as centers gain experience. Despite these differences and improvements that have occurred over time, increasing experience in centers performing liver transplantations is associated with reduced perioperative mortality.

AB  - Abstract Endothelins (ETs) contribute to the sensory changes seen in animals models of inflammatory, cancer and diabetic neuropathic pain, but little is known about their nociceptive role following peripheral nerve injury. The current study evaluated mechanisms by which ETs can drive changes in nociceptive responses to thermal stimulation of the hind paw of rats induced by unilateral lumbar L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) injury. SNL sensitizes rats to acetone-evoked cooling of and radiant heat application (Hargreaves test) to the ipsilateral hind paw (throughout 3?40 and 9?40 days after surgery, respectively). At 12 days after SNL, intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10 pmol) induces greater overt nociception that was reduced only by treatment with the selective ETA peptidic antagonist (BQ-123, 10 nmol, i.pl), but unchanged by the selective ETB peptidic antagonist (BQ-788). Cold allodynia evoked by cooling the ipsilateral hind paw with acetone was reduced by i.pl. injection of both antagonists BQ-123 or BQ-788 (3 or 10 nmol). In contrast, heat hyperalgesia evaluated by Hargreaves method was reduced only by BQ-123. SNL enhanced the [Ca+2] i increases induced by ET-1 (100 nM) in neurons from L5/L6 (injured) and L4 (intact) cultured dorsal root ganglion, but did not change the responses of non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that SNL increased ETA and ETB receptor protein expression in spinal nerves. Thus, SNL induces marked hind paw hypersensitivity to thermal stimulation in part via up-regulation of peripheral sensory nerve pronociceptive ETA and ETB receptor-operated mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Although nutrition therapy is favorably considered as an assistant therapeutic measure in critical illness, little data evaluate its role in gastrointestinal fistula patients with severe sepsis after an open abdomen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of early nutrition therapy in that population. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent open abdomen management for gastrointestinal fistula and severe sepsis from January 2001 to June 2009. Nutrition therapy, fistula, abdominal closure, and demographics were noted. Succus entericus reinfusion (SER) was performed for high-output volume or multiple fistulae. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated within 14 days after admission. Delivery route of nutrients, mortality, complications, and time to abdominal closure were compared among groups. Results: Eighty-two patients were included. Fifty-six (68.3%) patients survived to discharge. Forty-one (50%) patients received SER. EN was initiated within 14 days in 36 patients, with a mean initiation time at 8.3 ± 3.4 days; 46 patients did not start any EN within 14 days (29.9 ± 20.9 days). The mean age, BMI, APACHE II score, and fistula characteristics were similar between groups. The abdominal closure was accomplished more rapidly in patients fed within 14 days (142.8 vs 184.5 days, P = .017), with decreased mortality (11.1% vs 47.8%, P < .001). Conclusions: Nutrition therapy plays an important role in the management of gastrointestinal fistula with severe sepsis. Early EN could be successfully delivered for that population, with improved mortality risk.

AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - The serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), also known as GC-globulin, is a multifunctional protein known for its role in the transport of vitamin D metabolites. DBP also binds fatty acids and actin monomers, preventing their polymerization that could be detrimental in the circulatory system. DBP may have immune functions independent of its role as a transporter of vitamin D. Because of the abundance of DBP, many aspects of its basic biochemistry were quickly established. Other features of vitamin D action, particularly transcriptional mechanisms of regulation, received greater focus and early interest in DBP centred on its value as a tool for population genetics because of its intriguing genetic variations. Nonetheless, knowledge of DBP mechanisms in physiology was obtained, and functions beyond vitamin D ligand binding were identified. With the recent increased attention regarding the benefits of vitamin D (bone health and immunological regulation), there has been a resurgence of interest in DBP. Because DBP is the primary transporter of vitamin D, it has a role in maintaining the total levels of vitamin D for the organism and in regulating the amounts of free (unbound) vitamin D available for specific tissues and cell types to utilize. This review will describe the findings on the basic biochemistry and molecular biology of DBP, the studies that elucidated its biological functions and highlight these results in light of the current renewed interest in vitamin D and human health, as well as the debate over what constitutes sufficient levels of vitamin D.
