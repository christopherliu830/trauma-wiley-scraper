AB  - BackgroundSampling the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) allows the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dermatological drugs to be studied directly at their site of action. Dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a recently developed technique that can provide minimally invasive, continuous, membrane-free (thus unfiltered) access to the dermal ISF. Herein, we evaluate the clinical applicability and reliability of novel wearable dOFM devices in a clinical setting. Methods Physicians inserted 141 membrane-free dOFM probes into the dermis of 17 healthy and psoriatic volunteers and sampled dermal ISF for 25 h by using wearable push-pull pumps. The tolerability, applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of multiple insertions and 25 h continuous sampling was assessed by pain scoring, physician feedback, ultrasound probe depth measurements, and 25 h-drift and variability of the sodium relative recovery. Results Insertion pain was moderate and decreased with each additional probe. Probe insertion was precise, although slightly deeper in lesional skin. The wearable push-pull pump enabled uninterrupted ISF sampling over 25 h with low variability. The relative recovery was drift-free and highly reproducible. Conclusion dOFM sampling devices are tolerable and reliable for prolonged continuous dermal sampling in a multiprobe clinical setting. These devices should enable the study of a wide range of drugs and their biomarkers in the skin.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - Summary Patients referred to a nephrologist are subjected to a bewildering array of diagnostic tests and procedures. This chapter explains the procedures commonly undertaken in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. It covers the tests including those involving blood and urine, radiological tests, invasive investigations, and methods of evaluating glomerular filtration rate. The chapter discusses investigations that are carried out prior to initiating anaemia treatments, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), as well as those used in cases of diminished response to ESAs. It evaluates the nurse's role in post-procedure care. The World Health Organization published guidelines on best phlebotomy practices, recommending standards for quality care that include laboratory sampling and the maintenance of quality control. Nurses must complete the necessary training before carrying out a new role, such as venepuncture.

AB  - Abstract Thyroid storm or severe thyrotoxicosis results from extreme thyroid hormone elevation. Therapy includes medical management to prevent hormone production, release, recycling, and peripheral conversion while stabilizing adrenergic tone. Thyroid dysfunction is the usual cause but it can be due to excessive thyroid hormone ingestion. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to rapidly remove protein-bound thyroid hormone. American Society for Apheresis guidelines make a weak recommendation to perform TPE in selected patients in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis based on low quality evidence. We present a case of excessive thyroid replacement hormone ingestion treated by TPE. The patient presented with the clinical picture of thyroid storm, including cardiovascular compromise and massively elevated total and free T3 (525 ng/dL, nl 80?200 ng/dL and 28 pg/mL, nl 2.0?3.5 11 pg/mL), which failed medical therapy. A single, one plasma volume TPE was performed. Both total and free T3 demonstrated substantial declines immediately after TPE with the patient's mental status returning to near-normal. Thyroid hormone extraction efficiency and collection efficacy were calculated as 37.1% and 40.8%, respectively. Prior to discharge on day 6, the patient's compounding pharmacy indicated that a ?bad batch? of bovine thyroid gland derived replacement hormone had been produced. TPE appears to be effective in removing protein bound thyroid hormone in extreme iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis.

AB  - Abstract Background Micronutrients, an umbrella term used to collectively describe vitamins and trace elements, are essential components of nutrition. Those requiring alternative forms of nutrition support are dependent on the prescribed nutrition regimen for their micronutrient provision. The purpose of this paper is to assist clinicians to bridge the gap between the available guidelines? recommendations and their practical application in the provision of micronutrients via the parenteral route to adult patients. Methods Based on the available evidenced-based literature and existing guidelines, a panel of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals with significant experience in the provision of parenteral nutrition (PN) and intravenous micronutrients developed this international consensus paper. Results The paper addresses 14 clinically relevant questions regarding the importance and use of micronutrients in various clinical conditions. Practical orientation on how micronutrients should be prescribed, administered, and monitored is provided. Conclusion Micronutrients are a critical component to nutrition provision and PN provided without them pose a considerable risk to nutrition status. Obstacles to their daily provision?including voluntary omission, partial provision, and supply issues?must be overcome to allow safe and responsible nutrition practice.

AB  - Abstract Septic shock is often associated with multiorgan failure, a life threatening clinical condition during which there is an imbalance in the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, antigens, endotoxins, procoagulant, and anticoagulant factors and also resultant effects of therapeutic intervention like volume overload. Various extracorporeal therapies have shown some positive results as adjunctive therapeutic intervention to traditional antimicrobials in an effort to bring the inflammatory mediators to a homeostatic balance and to improve poor organ perfusion caused by hypotension and thrombosis in the microcirculation. This review focuses on current information on the use of therapeutic apheresis procedures as adjunctive therapy in such clinical situations as well as the exciting prospects for the near future. The sometimes disappointing results of early phase clinical studies may, in some cases, be related to the well known barriers to successful clinical trials in critically ill patients rather than to failure of the novel concept of adjunctive extracorporeal treatment of septic shock. It should be noted that some of the specialized apheresis technologies reviewed in this article are not yet available for clinical use in the United States as they are not yet approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration.

AB  - Background and Objective: Enteral feeding is vital in the critical care setting; however, the optimal route of enteral feeding (postpyloric vs gastric feeding) remains debated. We aimed to systematically review the current evidence to see whether postpyloric feeding could provide additional benefits to intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Method: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and safety of postpyloric feeding vs gastric feeding were included in our systematic review. Odds ratio (OR) was used for binary outcome data and weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for continuous outcome data. Summary effects were pooled using a fixed or random effects model as appropriate. Results: Seventeen RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Postpyloric tube feeding could deliver higher proportions of estimated energy requirement (WMD, 12%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5%?18%) and reduce the gastric residual volume (GRV) (WMD, ?169.1 mL; 95% CI, ?291.995 to ?46.196 mL). However, the meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any benefits to critically ill patients with postpyloric tube feeding in terms of mortality (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.77?1.44), new-onset pneumonia (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.53?1.13), and aspiration (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.64?2.25). There was no significant publication bias as represented by an Egger's bias coefficient of 0.21 (95% CI, ?1.01 to 1.43; P = .7). Conclusion: As compared with gastric feeding, postpyloric feeding is able to deliver higher proportions of the estimated energy requirement and can help reduce the GRV.
