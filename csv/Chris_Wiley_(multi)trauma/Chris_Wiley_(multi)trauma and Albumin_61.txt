AB  - Background:Liver biopsies taken with an automatic Tru-Cut biopsy gun device caused unexpected fatal shock reactions in cats. The goal of the present study was to determine if this biopsy device caused more frequent fatal complications than did a semiautomatic device. Animals: All cats referred to the Utrecht University, between October 1, 2002, and October 31, 2004, in which ultrasound-guided Tru-Cut liver biopsies were taken. The indications for liver biopsy were increased liver enzyme activity, increased bile acid concentrations, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the liver, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the bile ducts, or some combination of these findings. Coagulation parameters were normal. Methods: From October 1, 2002, until October 31, 2003, 26 cats were biopsied with an automatic biopsy device. Between November 1, 2003, and October 31, 2004, 19 cats underwent liver biopsy with a semiautomatic biopsy device. Results: In the first period, 5 of the 26 cats (19%) developed severe shock within 15 minutes. Resuscitation was not successful. In the second period, none of the 19 cats experienced any major adverse effect. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to diagnosis, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, or the use of anesthetics. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: We conclude that the difference in complication rate is explained by the biopsy technique used. The pressure wave, which occurs when firing the automatic device, may have caused intense vagotonia and shock. Use of this automatic biopsy device should be avoided in cats because of the high risk of fatal complications.

AB  - Over the past decade, chemical labeling with isobaric tandem mass tags, such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification reagents (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents, has been employed in a wide range of different clinically orientated serum and plasma proteomics studies. In this review the scope of these works is presented with attention to the areas of research, methods employed and performance limitations. These applications have covered a wide range of diseases, disorders and infections, and have implemented a variety of different preparative and mass spectrometric approaches. In contrast to earlier works, which struggled to quantify more than a few hundred proteins, increasingly these studies have provided deeper insight into the plasma proteome extending the numbers of quantified proteins to over a thousand.

AB  - Abstract ? An in vitro system for isolated dentinoclasts is described in which clastic cells which are not contemporaneously engaged in resorption are gently rinsed from the surface of actively resorbing root dentin. Dentinoclasts were cultured on a variety of hard tissue constituents in order to investigate the effects of substratum composition on the expression of resorbing structures by these cells, and examined with scanning electron microscopy. Results revealed that dentinoclasts express both ruffled borders and clear zones only when cultured on coverslips coated with both collagen and hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite alone induced only the formation of a clear zone. Failure to express either clear zones or ruffled borders by cells cultured on collagen-coated coverslips was interpreted to reveal that collagen itself is not capable of, but requires the mineral component of hard tissue for, producing morphologic resorbing structures in clastic cells.

AB  - Abstract The effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 on expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, TrkB, in neurons cultured from the cerebral cortex of 18-day-old embryonic rats were examined. BDNF mRNA was significantly increased from 24?48 hr after the TGF-?1 treatment over 20 ng/ml. Accumulation of BDNF protein in the culture medium was also potentiated by TGF-?1, although the intracellular content of BDNF was nearly unchanged. The enhancement of BDNF mRNA expression was suppressed by the co-presence of decorin, a small TGF-?-binding proteoglycan that inhibits the biological activities of TGF-?s. mRNA expression of full-length TrkB, the bioactive high-affinity receptor for BDNF, was also upregulated after treatment with TGF-?1. These observations suggest that: 1) TGF-?1 potentiates BDNF/TrkB autocrine or local paracrine system; and 2) the neurotrophic activity of TGF-?1 is partly responsible for the BDNF induced by TGF-?1 itself. To test this latter possibility, we examined the neuronal survival activity of TGF-?1 with or without K252a, a selective inhibitor of Trk family tyrosine kinases. TGF-?1 significantly enhanced neuronal survival, but the co-presence of K252a completely suppressed the activity, demonstrating the involvement of Trk receptor signaling in TGF-?1-mediated neuronal survival in cultured rat cortical neurons. These results seem to be in line with recent findings by other investigators that some neurotrophic factors including BDNF require TGF-?s as a cofactor to exert their neurotrophic activities. J.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011
