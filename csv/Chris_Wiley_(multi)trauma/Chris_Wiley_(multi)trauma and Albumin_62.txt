Efficacy and safety of Celsior preservation fluid in liver transplantation: one-year follow up of a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study. ?Clin Transplant 2011 DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01447.x. ?? 2011 John Wiley  p?=?0.398). Predictive factors for graft loss on univariate analysis were moderate-to-severe steatosis on the donor graft (5/22 patients with graft loss vs. 8/107 patients without, p?=?0.046) and duration of warm ischemia (1.4?±?1.1?h in patients with graft loss vs. 0.9?±?0.5?h in patients without, p?=?0.034). Hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis occurred in seven (5.0%) and six (4.3%) patients, respectively. The comparison of our patients to 420 ELTR controls showed that one-yr graft survival rates (Celsior: 82.9%, 95% CI 75.8, 88.2; UW: 78.6%, 95% CI 74.4, 82.2) and Kaplan?Meier one-yr graft survival distributions (p?=?0.285) were similar. Within the cold ischemia time achieved in our study, liver preservation with Celsior appeared efficient and safe. Comparison with ELTR patients suggested that liver allograft survival was similar using Celsior or UW solution for preservation of unselected donor grafts.

AB  - Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) are one of the most widely used engineered nanoparticles and can been found in a wide range of consumer products. Despite their massive global production scale, little is known about their potential effects in the context of unintended exposure or ingestion. Using TR146 cells as an in vitro model of the human oral buccal mucosa, the uptake, spatial intracellular distribution, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory response, and cytotoxic effects of commercial SiO2 NPs are examined. SiO2 NPs are shown to dock and cross the cellular membrane barrier in a dose?time-dependent manner. Confocal sectioning reveals translocation of SiO2 NPs into the cell nucleus after 12 h of exposure. A concentration threshold of more than 500 ? 10?6 m is observed, above which SiO2 NPs are shown to exert significant oxidative stress with concomitant upregulation of inflammatory genes IL6 and TNFA. Further analysis of the p53 pathway and a series of apoptotic and cell cycle biomarkers reveals intracellular accumulation of SiO2 NPs exert marginal nanotoxicity. Collectively, this study provides important information regarding the uptake, intracellular distribution, and potential adverse cellular effects of SiO2 NPs commonly found in consumer products in the human oral epithelium.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - Summary This review addresses the physiological background and the current status of evidence regarding ventilator-induced lung injury and lung protective strategies. Lung protective ventilatory strategies have been shown to reduce mortality from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We review the latest knowledge on the progression of lung injury by mechanical ventilation and correlate the findings of experimental work with results from clinical studies. We describe the experimental and clinical evidence of the effect of lung protective ventilatory strategies and open lung strategies on the progression of lung injury and current controversies surrounding these subjects. We describe a rational strategy, the open lung strategy, to accomplish an open lung, which may further prevent injury caused by mechanical ventilation. Finally, the clinician is offered directions on lung protective ventilation in the early phase of ARDS which can be applied on the intensive care unit.

AB  - Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) alters both specific and nonspecific immune functions, resulting in immunosuppression. Short-chain fatty acids have been shown to improve the adaptive responses of the gut after surgery. The following study investigates the effects of adding short-chain fatty acids to TPN on the immune system after an 80% small bowel resection. Methods: Rats (237 ± 3 g) were infused with either TPN (n = 25) or TPN supplemented with short-chain fatty acids (n = 26) for 3 or 7 days. Hematologic analysis was performed on peripheral blood and splenocytes were isolated to characterize cell phenotypes, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and to estimate proliferative response. Results: The relative percent of T (CD3+) cells increased (p <.05) and the relative percent of macrophages decreased (p <.001, n = 13) in the spleens of the 3-day TPN-fed rats. By day 7, these differences disappeared. The natural killer cells from rats that were supplemented with short-chain fatty acids had higher (p <.0001) cytotoxic activity than the TPN groups at day 3. Mitogenic response did not differ between groups but were depressed compared with sham-treated rats. By day 7, rats on standard TPN had larger (p <.0001) spleens than all other groups. This group also had a higher total white blood cell count because of increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils (p <.02). Conclusion: Short-chain fatty acids improve components of nonspecific immune responses and may be beneficial in reducing certain aspects of TPNassociated immunosuppression after major surgery.

AB  - Abstract Cells are covered by a surface layer of glycans that is referred to as the ?glycocalyx?. In this review, we focus on the role of the glycocalyx in vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension, kidney disease and sepsis) and cancer. The glycocalyx and its principal glycosaminoglycans [heparan sulphate (HS) and hyaluronic acid (HA)] and core proteins (syndecans and glypicans) are degraded in vascular diseases, leading to a breakdown of the vascular permeability barrier, enhanced access of leucocytes to the arterial intima that propagate inflammation and alteration of endothelial mechanotransduction mechanisms that protect against disease. By contrast, the glycocalyx on cancer cells is generally robust, promoting integrin clustering and growth factor signalling, and mechanotransduction of interstitial flow shear stress that is elevated in tumours to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase release which enhances cell motility and metastasis. HS and HA are consistently elevated on cancer cells and are associated with tumour growth and metastasis. Later, we will review the agents that might be used to enhance or protect the glycocalyx to combat vascular disease, as well as a different set of compounds that can degrade the cancer cell glycocalyx to suppress cell growth and metastasis. It is clear that what is beneficial for either vascular disease or cancer will not be so for the other. The overarching conclusions are that (i) the importance of the glycocalyx in human medicine is only beginning to be recognized, and (ii) more detailed studies of glycocalyx involvement in vascular diseases and cancer will lead to novel treatment modalities.
