AB  - Abstract Cells are covered by a surface layer of glycans that is referred to as the ?glycocalyx?. In this review, we focus on the role of the glycocalyx in vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension, kidney disease and sepsis) and cancer. The glycocalyx and its principal glycosaminoglycans [heparan sulphate (HS) and hyaluronic acid (HA)] and core proteins (syndecans and glypicans) are degraded in vascular diseases, leading to a breakdown of the vascular permeability barrier, enhanced access of leucocytes to the arterial intima that propagate inflammation and alteration of endothelial mechanotransduction mechanisms that protect against disease. By contrast, the glycocalyx on cancer cells is generally robust, promoting integrin clustering and growth factor signalling, and mechanotransduction of interstitial flow shear stress that is elevated in tumours to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase release which enhances cell motility and metastasis. HS and HA are consistently elevated on cancer cells and are associated with tumour growth and metastasis. Later, we will review the agents that might be used to enhance or protect the glycocalyx to combat vascular disease, as well as a different set of compounds that can degrade the cancer cell glycocalyx to suppress cell growth and metastasis. It is clear that what is beneficial for either vascular disease or cancer will not be so for the other. The overarching conclusions are that (i) the importance of the glycocalyx in human medicine is only beginning to be recognized, and (ii) more detailed studies of glycocalyx involvement in vascular diseases and cancer will lead to novel treatment modalities.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to compare the early postoperative outcome of patients undergoing laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with those undergoing open subtotal colectomy for colitis refractory to medical treatment. Method A retrospective observational study was carried out of patients who underwent subtotal colectomy for refractory colitis, at a single centre, between 2006 and 2012. Patients were matched for age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade, urgency of operation and immunosuppressant/modulator treatment. The primary outcome measure was the number of postoperative complications, classified using the Clavien?Dindo scale. Secondary end-points included procedure duration, laparoscopic conversion rates, blood loss, 30-day readmission rates and length of hospital stay. Results Ninety-six patients were included, 39 of whom had laparoscopic surgery. Thirty-two of these were matched to similar patients who underwent an open procedure. The overall duration of the procedure was longer for laparoscopic surgery than for open surgery (median: 240 vs 150 min, P < 0.005) but estimated blood loss was less (median: 75 vs 400 ml, P < 0.005). In the laparoscopic group, 23 patients experienced 27 complications, and in the open surgery group, 23 patients experienced 30 complications. Most complications were minor (Grade I/II), and the distribution of complications, by grade, was similar between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission rates between the laparoscopic and open groups (five readmissions vs eight readmissions, P = 0.536). Length of hospital stay was 4 days shorter for laparoscopic surgery, but this difference was not statistically significant (median: 7 vs 11 days, P = 0.159). Conclusion In patients requiring colectomy for acute severe colitis, laparoscopic surgery reduced blood loss but increased operating time and was not associated with a reduction in early postoperative complications, length of hospital stay or readmission rates.

AB  - Abstract Techniques for selective isolation, labeling, stimulation, and destruction of ameboid microglia allow study of some fundamental questions in neuroimmunology. Examination of surface morphology, proliferative capacity, and cytochemistry suggests that microglia are a class of brain mononuclear phagocytes distinct from blood monocytes, spleen macrophages, or resident peritoneal macrophages. Morover, cultured ameboid microglia isolated from newborn brain can be induced to grow thin cytoplasmic projectios several hundred microns in length; these process-bearing cells resemble a differentiated form of microglia found in adult brain. Ameboid microglia may contribute to brain inflammation by engulfing debris, by releasing cytotoxins, by killing neighboring cells, and by secreting astroglial growth factors. Importantly, ameboid microglia are closely tied to a network of immunomodulators that include colony-stimulating factors and Interluekin-1. The presence of activated microglia during normal embryogenesis and at sites of penetrating brain injury suggests that these cells serve as important effectors linking the immune system with growth and repqir of the CNS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For over 20 years extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been an advanced treatment for adults, children and neonates with severe respiratory failure that has failed to respond or improve with conventional therapy. Withholding enteral feeding in patients on ECMO is common practice in many centers, based partly on the risk of splanchnic ischemia resulting in loss of intestinal integrity, predisposing to bacterial translocation and sepsis. We report one center's experience with early enteral nutrition in adult patients receiving venovenous (VV) ECMO for severe respiratory failure. METHODS: Adult patients that received VV ECMO at LSUHSC-Shreveport over the last 8 years were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients met these criteria and their charts and nutrition therapy reviewed. Average duration of ECMO support was 8.7 +/- 3.6 days. Twenty-six of 27 (96%) received enteral nutrition via gastric tube alone or in combination with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Eighteen patients received enteral nutrition as their only source of nutritional supplementation, with the remainder receiving partial nutrition support via the parenteral route. Seventy-five percent of the patients received prokinetic medication within the first 24 hours, with 95% receiving prokinetic therapy by 48 hours. No patients developed intestinal ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other complications related to early enteral feeding. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition started within the first 24 to 36 hours of initiating venovenous ECMO support is safe and well-tolerated in adults. No serious adverse events were attributable to enteral nutrition in these patients.
