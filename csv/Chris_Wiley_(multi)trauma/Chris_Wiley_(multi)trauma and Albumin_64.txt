AB  - INTRODUCTION: For over 20 years extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been an advanced treatment for adults, children and neonates with severe respiratory failure that has failed to respond or improve with conventional therapy. Withholding enteral feeding in patients on ECMO is common practice in many centers, based partly on the risk of splanchnic ischemia resulting in loss of intestinal integrity, predisposing to bacterial translocation and sepsis. We report one center's experience with early enteral nutrition in adult patients receiving venovenous (VV) ECMO for severe respiratory failure. METHODS: Adult patients that received VV ECMO at LSUHSC-Shreveport over the last 8 years were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients met these criteria and their charts and nutrition therapy reviewed. Average duration of ECMO support was 8.7 +/- 3.6 days. Twenty-six of 27 (96%) received enteral nutrition via gastric tube alone or in combination with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Eighteen patients received enteral nutrition as their only source of nutritional supplementation, with the remainder receiving partial nutrition support via the parenteral route. Seventy-five percent of the patients received prokinetic medication within the first 24 hours, with 95% receiving prokinetic therapy by 48 hours. No patients developed intestinal ischemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other complications related to early enteral feeding. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition started within the first 24 to 36 hours of initiating venovenous ECMO support is safe and well-tolerated in adults. No serious adverse events were attributable to enteral nutrition in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients with ruptured, perforated or fistulized (RPF) sarcomas commonly have issues such as sepsis and malnutrition and are usually unsuitable for oncologic resection in the emergency setting. We present our approach for managing a series of patients and the outcomes which were achieved with multidisciplinary care. Methods We reviewed records of patients referred to the section of sarcoma surgical oncology. Clinicopathologic factors, preoperative and operative interventions as well as short-term oncologic outcomes were assessed. Results Sixteen patients were identified between 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. Median age was 42.8 years. Histologies were; Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (7), desmoid (4), spindle cell tumor (2), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (2), and nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (1). Five patients had preoperative sepsis, 8 received antimicrobials, and 50% required hospitalization with a median stay of 21 days. Total parenteral nutrition was administered to 5 (31.3%) patients. Median tumor size and estimated blood loss were 13.1?cm and 350?mL respectively. No perioperative mortality occurred. Two patients have expired at a median follow-up of 16.1 months. Conclusion Preoperative optimization, including the use of percutaneous drains, and antibiotics to control sepsis, where necessary, can lead to eventual oncologic resection with acceptable morbidity and no short-term mortality for patients with RPF sarcomas.

AB  - ABSTRACT? The intention of this review is to stress new information regarding the quite versatile functions of Kupffer cells. Although their main function is phagocytosis and defence of the liver against bacteria, endotoxaemia and viral infections, they also fulfil other important roles. They will phagocytose and partially degrade bacterial antigens before handing them on to the hepatocytes for excretion into the bile. They handle LDL lipoproteins, whilst the HDL proceed directly into the hepatocytes. They produce lymphokine mediators that direct protein synthesis by the hepatocytes. Also they normally produce prostaglandins that are cyto-protective for the hepatocytes. Conversely, if they are required to attack infected hepatocytes or cancer cells, then they switch to the production of leukotrienes. Thus they function as specialised macrophages, and it is not surprising that other ?activated macrophages? have to be recruited into the liver to support them in inflammatory reactions.

AB  - Abstract The experiences in the production and application of polymethacrylate-based monolithic supports, since their development almost thirty years ago, are presented. The main driving force for the development of new chromatographic supports was the necessity for the isolation and separation of physiologically active biopolymers and their use for therapeutic purposes. For this sake, a development of a method for fast separation, preventing denaturation and preserving their biological activity was necessary. Development of polysaccharide-based supports, followed by the introduction of polymer-based chromatographic media, is shortly described. This development was followed by the advances in monolithic media that are now used for both large- and small-scale separation of biopolymers and nanoparticles. Finally, a short overview is given about the applications of monoliths for sample displacement chromatography, resulting in isolation of physiologically active biomolecules, such as proteins, protein complexes, and nucleic acid, as well as high-throughput sample preparation for proteomic investigations.

AB  - Summary It has not been adequately evaluated whether the outcome of infections differs by body-weight category. We performed a systematic review of relevant studies. Eleven studies (one retrospective and 10 prospective cohort studies) were included in this review, involving a total of 3159 hospitalized patients or nursing home residents. Most studies (6/11) referred to lower respiratory tract infections. Seven studies showed an association of patient outcome (mortality in 6/7 studies) with body-weight category. This was shown in multivariate analysis in 4/5 studies that reported relevant data. Obese or morbidly obese patients with infections had worse outcome compared with the rest of the patients or with normal-weight patients, in 4/7 studies that reported relevant data; findings were not significant in the remaining three studies. Patients in the lowest body mass index (BMI) group had worse outcome compared with all other groups combined, in 3/5 studies that reported relevant data; findings were not significant in the remaining two studies. Low BMI was associated with worse outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections in 3/4 relevant studies. Although not consistently reported, an association of both ends of the BMI distribution with worse outcome of infections is plausible and merits further investigation.
