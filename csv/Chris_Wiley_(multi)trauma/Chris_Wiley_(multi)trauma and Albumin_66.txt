AB  - Abstract In addition to its endocrine function, for which it was named, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has substantial neuroprotective actions as well as other physiological effects. We have developed a number of modified TRH analogues as well as cyclic dipeptides structurally related to a major metabolic product of TRH, which have enhanced neuroprotective activity but none of the other major physiological effects of TRH. The extensive structure?activity data developed with these compounds were used to develop a pharmacophore model. Subsequently, a web-based pharmacophore searching program was used to query several large three-dimensional databases. Of the 219?compounds identified whose structures met the pharmacophore model, 15 were chosen for study in a classical model of neuronal cell death in vitro; five of these, 2?6, showed neuroprotective activity. Thus, pharmacophore modeling developed from neuroprotective small peptides can be used to identify novel lead compounds as neuroprotective agents.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of enteral and parenteral nutrition regimens in preventing or reversing protein?energy malnutrition (PEM) and in preventing treatment delays was evaluated in 32 children receiving treatment for newly diagnosed Stage III (3 patients) and IV (29 patients) neuroblastoma. Ten of 18 malnourished patients were randomized to central parenteral nutrition (CPN) and 8 to peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) plus enteral nutrition for 4 weeks and then received enteral nutrition (EN: intense nutrition counselling, oral foods and supplements) for weeks 5 through 10. Ten of 14 nourished patients received EN and 4 CPN for 4 weeks and EN thereafter. Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical measurements were determined for weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 for 24 patients who completed the protocols. In malnourished patients, both CPN (seven patients) and PPN (seven patients) were effective in reversing PEM in the first 4 weeks; thereafter, EN effectively maintained nutritional gains in both groups. In nourished patients, EN (seven patients) was not as effective as CPN (three patients) in preventing PEM during the first 4 weeks; afterwards, EN maintained gains in the CPN group but did not promote needed increases in weight nor fat reserves in the EN group. Patients supported by parenteral nutrition (PN, weeks 1?4) had fewer treatment delays (2/17, 12%) than EN patients (4/7, 57%, P <0.05). These data indicate that PN reverses or prevents PEM and prevents treatment delays during the first 4 weeks of intense oncologic treatment and provides nutritional benefits which can be maintained with EN thereafter.

AB  - Abstract In the past two decades tissue adhesives and sealants have revolutionized bleeding control and wound healing. This paper focuses on existing tissue adhesive design, their structure, functioning mechanism, and their pros and cons in wound management. It also includes the latest advances in the development of new tissue adhesives as well as the emerging applications in regenerative medicine. We expect that this paper will provide insightful discussion on tissue bioadhesive design and lead to innovations for the development of the next generation of tissue bioadhesives and their related biomedical applications.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.
