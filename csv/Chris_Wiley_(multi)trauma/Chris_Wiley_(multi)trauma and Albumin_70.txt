AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - Although the physiological role of beta2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) is unknown, in vitro evidence indicates that B2GPI may be a natural anticoagulant. In this study we have examined whether fluctuations of plasma B2GPI occur in in vivo coagulation. Serial measurements of B2GPI and other anticoagulant proteins were performed in 51 patients with thrombotic (group 1: six patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), group 2: venous (n=4) or arterial (n=17) thrombosis) and non-thrombotic disease (group 3: 24 patients undergoing elective surgery). Reductions in plasma B2GPI levels were seen in most patients which were roughly proportional to the severity of their illness. Particularly striking reductions of B2GPI, protein C (PC) and antithrombin III (AT-III) (mean ±?95% CI: 42.7?±?8.6%, 42.1?±?14.8%, 39.1?±?28.4% respectively) were seen in group 1. The reductions in plasma B2GPI were significantly greater in group 1 than in the other groups. Dilutional factors explain most of the reductions in B2GPI, PC and AT-III in groups 2 and 3, but contribute little to group 1. In conclusion, although B2GPI behaves as a ?negative acute phase reactant?, the magnitude of reduction of plasma B2GPI levels, accompanied by reductions in other anticoagulant proteins in patients with DIC, suggests specific consumption of B2GPI in in vivo coagulation. This study provides further evidence that B2GPI is an anticoagulant of physiological importance.

AB  - SUMMARY ?First, do no harm. ?These words have been the doctrine of medicine since its inception. The era of evidence-based medicine now compels us to provide scientific evidence that we indeed do no harm and that the treatments we prescribe have a beneficial effect. The colloid/crystalloid debate continues to evolve and is as hotly contested now as it was a decade ago. There may be some international differences in the use of colloids or crystalloids, but most of us continue to use both. Whatever our preferred choice of intravenous fluid for the treatment of hypovolemia, clinical outcome studies suggest that ?when?? and ?how much?? are probably more important questions than ?what??. There are now a wide variety of fluids available to the clinician and most differ markedly in their composition. Aside from the gross classification of IV fluids into colloids and crystalloids, they may be subclassified into balanced or unbalanced categories, i.e., those that contain concentrations of electrolytes similar to those in the plasma and those that do not (see Table 1).The very fact that ?normal? saline is unphysiological was recognized many years ago. This fact led Alexis Hartmann to develop Hartmann's solution in an attempt to produce an isotonic alkalizing solution. He recognized the need for proportionately more sodium than chloride1, which led to a solution very similar to Ringer's original2. The existence of hyperchloremic acidosis has been recognized in many areas for some time, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis and ammonium chloride poisoning, and is generally termed a low-anion gap acidosis. There is now mounting evidence that the administration of intravenous saline and saline-based fluids is the commonest avoidable cause of clinically relevant hyperchloremic acidosis.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of donor race on the outcome of black patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who undergo liver transplantation. The records for deceased donor liver transplants that occurred in the United States between January 1998 and December 2007 were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing. 26,212 records contained sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Of these, 11,989 (45.7%) records were for patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 1292 (4.9%) were for patients both HCV-positive and black. Black recipients with white donors were found to have significantly worse outcomes than all other recipient-donor race combinations (P < 0.001). The crude 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a black donor was 14% higher than the 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a white donor. Multivariate regression analysis determined that a graft from a race-unmatched donor was an independent risk factor for graft failure (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.79) among HCV-positive black recipients but not among HCV-negative black recipients after adjustments for donor age, recipient age, cold ischemia time, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and donor cytomegalovirus status. The observation that race-unmatched grafts are a risk factor in HCV-positive black recipients, but not in HCV-negative black recipients, suggests an alteration of the graft-host relationship by HCV. In conclusion, our results suggest that HCV-positive black recipients who undergo liver transplantation can have increased graft survival if their donors are black, with survival rates approaching those of white liver transplant recipients.
