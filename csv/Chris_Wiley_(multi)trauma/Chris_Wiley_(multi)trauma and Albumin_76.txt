AB  - Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. The incremental elastic modulus (Einc) measurement is a good marker of arterial wall stiffness. Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. Metabolic, inflammatory, and hemodynamic alterations cause structural changes and vascular complications in end-stage renal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors that may affect the development of arteriosclerosis by measurement of Einc in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Thirty-two patients (16 men and 16 women) on chronic HD with a mean age of 42.2?±?19.3 (range, 15?80) were included in the study. The carotid Einc was measured to determine arteriosclerosis by high-resolution echo-tracking system. Einc measurement was calculated from transcutaneous measurements of carotid arterial internal diameter and wall thickness and carotid pulse pressure. Common carotid compliance (CCC) and distensibility (CCD) were determined from changes in carotid artery diameter during systole and simultaneously measured carotid pulse pressure. Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), predialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), predialysis diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), age, HD duration, CCC, and CCD were correlated with Einc in all patients. A significant positive correlation was found between Einc and age (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), SBP (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.02), PP (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), Ca (r?=?0.43, p?<?0.01), CRP (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.02). As expected, Einc was correlated inversely with CCD (r?=??0.77, p?<?0.0001). The correlation between Einc and HD duration, DBP, ferritin, P, PTH, and CCC was not significant. In conclusion, the stiffening of carotid artery in HD patients is related not only to hemodynamic changes (increased SBP and PP) but also to metabolic (increased Ca) and inflammatory (increased CRP) responses. Carotid Einc is an accepted independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Because of the positive correlation between Einc and serum Ca, vitamin D and Ca-containing P binder should be used carefully in HD patients.

AB  - Background:? Renal failure in elderly patients often generates an ethical question ?should dialysis be initiated?? The nephrologists are faced with the dilemma of conveying the prognosis of renal failure in elderly patients and also explain the pros and cons of offering a renal replacement therapy (RRT). Methods:? We report a retrospective study conducted between 6/2001 and 6/2003 to evaluate the clinical situations where initiating RRT was considered inappropriate. All patients who opted for not initiating/withdrawal of RRT were included in the study. Results:? Twenty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were males with average age 70.7 years. 17/24 were in the intensive care unit. Complex medical illnesses with poor quality of life were the major reasons for opting out of RRT. 20/24 patients opted for not initiating RRT and 3/24 patients opted for withdrawal. 1/24 opted for a trial of RRT before taking long-term decisions. 3/20 who opted against initiating RRT had advanced directives. 18/20 who opted for not initiating RRT died within 3 days of the need for RRT, 2/20 are alive without RRT after 6 and 4 months with estimated GFR of 14 and 12?mL/min, respectively. Patient who opted for a trial of RRT died eventually, 4 months after a prolonged bedridden stay in a nursing home. 3/3 ESRD patients died within a week after withdrawing dialysis. Conclusion:? The decision to initiate RRT should be made considering the overall prognosis. A decision to not initiate or withdraw RRT is possible in critically ill patients and if taken judiciously can reduce physical and mental stress of both patient and their family members.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - Several types of dialyzers with enhanced internal filtration have been introduced in order to increase solute clearance, especially in relatively larger molecular solutes. In these dialyzers, enhanced internal filtration increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. The internal filtration flow rate (QIF) has not, however, been measured in clinical situations, because none of monitoring techniques can measure this value. Herein, the QIF value was estimated during an experimental and an analytical study. Namely, we measured blood flow velocity in a cross-sectional plane of the dialyzer by pulse Doppler ultrasonography. An in vitro study with bovine blood was carried out to determine the local blood flow velocity profile with a newly designed probe slider that enables parallel movement of the probe along the dialyzer. Furthermore, an analytical model was newly introduced to calculate changes in flow rate and pressure of blood and dialysate streams and solute concentrations along the dialyzer. The QIF value could be estimated by a simulation analysis to the experimental data using the analytical model.

AB  - During the last decade, the number of patients starting renal replacement therapy has increased for all ages, but the increase for patients over 65 years old has been particularly dramatic. Objective:? The aim of our study was the analysis of the outcome of all the patients who were over 65 years of age at the time they started chronic hemodialysis, in our Center (n, 52). Methods:? A total of 76 patients were treated by the chronic hemodialysis program of 251 Hellenic Air Force and VA General Hospital, between 1992 and 2002, while totally 309 patients were offered dialysis at this time. We found that 52 of them (68.4%) were over 65 years old [40 male (76.9%), 12 female (23.1%)]. Results:? Elderly patients manifest more often intradialytic complications, such as hypotensive episodes (28.8%) and arrhythmias (23.1%), due to their hemodynamic instability. Polypharmacy is a big deal for dialysis patients, especially elderly ones. Each patient was taking 9.1 PO and 1.9 IV medications on average, per day. Most of them (84.6%) required recombinant human erythropoietin. The most common co-morbid factors we observed in this population were cardiovascular diseases (36.5%), neurological problems, respiratory failure, bone disease, malignancy (17.3%), depression, malnutrition, and infections (30.8%). Deaths were often associated with more than one morbid factors. Survival and the quality of life in the elderly patients on hemodialysis are frequently acceptable. The 1, 3 and 5-year patient survival rates during 1990?2000 were 63.4%, 56.1%, and 26.8%. Conclusion:? We believe that if there are no extracontraindications, elderly patients can benefit from hemodialysis, taking into consideration that we should adapt the therapy to the geriatric special needs.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of daily dialysis since long-term experiences have shown good results. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is an HDF technique that combines diffusion with high convection in which the ultrapure dialysis fluid itself is used as a reinfusion solution. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the more effective dialysis schedule (daily dialysis) with the dialysis modality that offers the highest uremic toxin removal (OL-HDF). Five children with left ventricular hypertrophy, mean age 12.3?±?6.2 years, on standard 3??4?h 3 times a week OL-HDF at least during the last 6 months, were switched to D-OL-HDF, 3??4?h 6 times per week with a minimal follow up of 6 months. Dialysis parameters were similar during both periods and only frequency of each session was changed. Tolerance, anemia control, phosphatemia, and phosphate binders, need of blood pressure medications, and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated. Only 3 of the 5 enrolled children could be followed 12 months, 1 was transplanted after 3 months, the other after 5 months D-OL-HDF. For all the children the disappearance of postdialysis fatigue was rapidly reported. There was a significant decrease in predialysis levels of phosphatemia (from 1.67±0.23 to 1.28±0.29?mmol/L) despite phosphate binders reduction of more than 50%. Hemoglobin significantly increased (from 11.8±0.9 to 13.4±1.3?g percentage ml) allowing EPO doses reduction. Left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared after 6 months D-OL-HDF, fractional shortening increased, allowing registration on transplantation list for 1 child. Our results clearly demonstrate that daily online HDF is able to offer to children on chronic dialysis a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk factors. Is it ethical to reserve this dialysis modality only to selected children?

AB  - Vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Genetic mutations, inflammation, and changes in the vascular wall are some factors that are thought to increase thrombosis risk. In this study, we tested for possible relationships between vascular thrombosis and some known thrombophilic mutation/polymorphisms in coagulation factors [factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin (Pt) G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), factor XIII (F-XIII) Val34Leu, alpha-fibrinogen (AF) Thr312Ala, factor VII (F-VII) R353Q] and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene in our HD patients. Patients who had experienced at least 3 episodes of AVF thrombosis composed of the study group, and patients who had never encountered this complication composed of the control group. None of the patients in either group had a history of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis, or vasculitis. In order to find the frequency of F-XIII Val34Leu, AF Thr312Ala, and F-VII R353Q polymorphisms in our population, we also searched persons without renal disease or history of thrombosis (normal group). Results are summarized in Table. There was a tendency toward thrombotic mutation/polymorphisms in the study group for FVL, Pt G20210A, ACE I/D, and AF Thr312Ala. We suggest that patients who develop recurrent AVF thrombosis should be screened for the above-mentioned factors and investigated for other possible risk factors. This screening would allow more effective focus on prophylaxis.

AB  - Purpose:? To analyze survival and causes of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diabetic patients treated by hemodialysis. Methods:? Data of 1203 ESRD hemodialyzed patients between 1975 and 2002 were analyzed, 116 patients were excluded and 1087 patients included in the study. We studied the prevalence of the diabetic nephropathy, the rate of survival and causes of death by comparing diabetic patients with a control group of patients without diabetes. Results:? Among the 1087 patients requiring dialysis, 272 (25%) were diabetic and 815 non-diabetic whose causal nephropathy was nephroangiosclerosis 32%, glomerulonephritis 15%, chronic interstitial nephropathy 14%, and others 14%. The diabetics were older at the beginning of dialysis than non-diabetic patients: 60.33?±?11.39 years vs. 52.23?±?17.20 years, p?<?0.001. Average time on dialysis is more important in non-diabetic than diabetic group [5.90?±?5.73 years vs. 2.71.?±?2.48 years, p?<?0.001]. The rate of death was higher in diabetics than in control group [71.7% vs. 55.8%, respectively, p?<?0.003]. The difference in survival between the two groups remains significant for the same age. Death caused by cardiovascular disorders is higher in diabetics (68.8%) than non-diabetics (31.2%) (p?<?0.05). Among death causes, stroke is the most frequent cause in diabetics (18.4% vs. 11.6%) in non-diabetics, p?<?0.05. Death by heart failure and infections is higher in diabetics but the difference is not statistically significant (12.3% in diabetics vs. 9.4% in non-diabetics for heart failure and 13.8% vs. 11.4% for infections). Death due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetics (4.39% vs. 1.02% in diabetics, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? In our cohort, mortality in diabetic patients is higher than in non-diabetic patients. Cardio-vascular disorders are the most cause of death in diabetics and above all stroke, whereas mortality due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetic patients. Diabetes is an important risk factor of mortality in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Abstract Relative adrenal insufficiency is frequent in patients with severe sepsis and is associated with hemodynamic instability, renal failure, and increased mortality. This study prospectively evaluated the effects of steroids on shock resolution and hospital survival in a series of 25 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock (group 1). Adrenal function was evaluated by the short corticotropin test within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients with adrenal insufficiency were treated with stress doses of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg/6 h). Data were compared to those obtained from the last 50 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock admitted to the same intensive care unit in whom adrenal function was not investigated and who did not receive treatment with steroids (group 2). Incidence of adrenal insufficiency in group 1 was 68% (17 patients). Adrenal dysfunction was frequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis (Child C: 76% vs. Child B: 25%, P = .08). Resolution of septic shock (96% vs. 58%, P = .001), survival in the intensive care unit (68% vs. 38%, P = .03), and hospital survival (64% vs. 32%, P = .003) were significantly higher in group 1. The main causes of death in group 1 were hepatorenal syndrome or liver failure (7 of 9 patients). In contrast, refractory shock caused most of the deaths in group 2 (20 of 34 patients). In conclusion, relative adrenal insufficiency is very frequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis and septic shock. Hydrocortisone administration in these patients is associated with a high frequency of shock resolution and high survival rate. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:1288?1295.)

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.
