AB  - Purpose:? Several studies have showed that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD, 6 times weekly 6?8?h) results in a better outcome. How do patients and their partners experience this very intensive treatment that has a great impact on daily life? Methods:? We followed a cohort of 12 patients (11 male, 1 female, mean age 46.8?±?9.4 years, time for renal replacement 11.3?±?9.4 years) and their partners during a year after starting NHD, using questionnaires and interviews and the SF-36. Results:? Both the physical and the mental components of the SF-36 showed an improvement in all aspects (p?<?0.05), even in this small group. All couples considered NHD a tremendous improvement over routine thrice weekly dialysis. The drawbacks (such as daily routine and the intrusion of the treatment in bed) are outweighed by the advantages (such as better clinical condition, less fatigue, less uremic symptoms, better quality of life, more time, and free diet). Following are a few comments on NHD: ?NHD is a difference of day and night,??NHD gave me independence,??Since I do NHD, I do aerobics,??I am becoming too fat now!,??My husband now is much faster than I am when we walk or ride the bicycle,??There is no reason now why I won't live long,??I got an excellent, but demanding new job, which is possible thanks to NHD,??Being a good team is a prerequisite for success,??Don't expect too much. You will remain a chronic patient,??Become confident with ?conventional? home hemodialysis first before you start NHD.? Conclusion:? NHD results in a tremendous improvement of quality of life. However, patients and partners need active support.

AB  - Background:? Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome of medical treatment effectiveness. Objectives:? Thirty-six item short-Form (SF-36) first has been used in hemodialysis (HD) patients in Taiwan. Method:? HRQOL was measured by using SF-36 in 497 HD patients in 5 hospitals. Results:? Male sex, age less than 50 years, higher education level (EL), marriage, employed status (EPS), less comorbid medical condition (CMC), and non-diabetic patients were all predicted a better physical component scale (PCS). Age less than 50 years, BMI greater than 18.5, HEL, EPS, and NDP were all predicted a higher mental component scale (MCS). Scales contributing to a summary measure of physical health, the PCS score, was significantly lower in women (35?±?12.3) than in men (37.9?±?12.3). There is no difference in MCS score between women and men. In multivariate analysis, age, CMC, diabetes, serum creatinine (SCr), and erythropoietin responsiveness were significant independent predictors of PCS. Diabetes, EL, SCr, and erythropoietic responsiveness were significant independent predictors of MCS. All of the individual scales, PCS and MCS scores were lower in the Taiwan HD patients than values for the US general population. Each of the individual scales and MCS scores were substantially lower in Taiwan HD group than in the US HD cohort. But the bodily pain of PCS was significantly higher in Taiwan HD group in spite of mean PCS scores for Taiwan HD group and US HD study participants were nearly equal at 36.3 and 36.1, respectively. Conclusion:? Physical and mental aspects of quality of life are substantially reduced among Taiwan HD patients, but higher bodily pain tolerance. A number of demographic and clinical characteristics significantly impact on HRQOL in Taiwan HD patients. To our knowledge, this is the first time we demonstrate the HRQOL by using SF-36 in Chinese HD patients.

AB  - Increased radial artery wall thickness (RAWT) is considered to be associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as coronary artery atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, exact measurement of RAWT by noninvasive method before the operation is very important. Objective:? This study was designed to evaluate accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 21 hemodialysis patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation for the first time. We measured RAWT (intima-media thickness) using high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography at the wrist before the AVF operation. We obtained specimens of the radial artery during the AVF operation and then measured RAWT by histologic examination. Results:? Mean age of the patients was 60?±?13 years and the number of females was 7 (33.3%). Mean values of RAWT measured by Doppler ultrasonography and histologic examination were 485?±?93??m (300?700??m) and 426?±?106??m (300?700??m), respectively. The value of RAWT of Doppler sonographic measurement well correlated with that of histologic measurement (r?=?0.800, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that Doppler ultrasonography is an effective tool in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients before AVF operation.

AB  - The influence of dialysis prescription on outcome is well established. Hemodialysis dose has been shown to have a distinct impact upon the morbidity and mortality rate in patients on regular treatment therapy. Hence, adequacy of dialysis should be guaranteed. New devices based in online conductivity measures have been developed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose. The aim of this study was to compare online conductivity monitor (OCM) with dialysis dose standard methods (Daugirdas Kt/V). 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. Each patient was subjected to OCM on midweek day, during 3 consecutive weeks on the same day that blood Kt/V samples were taken as well. Each patient got 3 OCM measurements and Kt/V samples. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. Descriptives (n?=?24) Mean SD Age (year) ??64.75 ??18.243 Dry weight ??69.7125 ??12.01178 Interdialysis weight gain 2266.67 1016.673 BMI ??25.4155 ???3.83630 HD time ?245.21 ??21.340 OCM ???1.29921 ???0.201072 Daugirdas Kt/V ???1.3287 ???0.21043 Watson volume (L) ??36.833 ???6.3095 Linear regression analysis: Kt/V OCM relationship Variable Regression coefficient (?) r2 p Age (year) ?0.631 0.398 <0.001 Daugirdas Kt/V ?0.981 0.962 <0.001 BMI ?0.327 0.107 NS Watson volume (L) ?0.833 0.694 <0.001 The OCM option correlates well with Daugirdas Kt/V obtained from blood samples, in 96.2%, and provides a safe and accurate tool for hemodialysis, adding efficiency to dialysis adequacy monitoring in clinical practice. Also, OCM allows for an individualized dialysis dose. Furthers studies are required to evaluate its influence on patients' evolution.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - Abstract This study was aimed to compare the subjective and objective nutritional assessments and to analyse the performance of subjective global assessment (SGA) of nutritional status in diagnosing undernutrition in paediatric patients. One hundred and forty children (aged 2?12 years) hospitalized consecutively in Tabriz Paediatric Hospital from June 2008 to August 2008 underwent subjective assessment using the SGA questionnaire and objective assessment, including anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Agreement between two assessment methods was analysed by the kappa (?) statistic. Statistical indicators including (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, error rates, accuracy, powers, likelihood ratios and odds ratio) between SGA and objective assessment method were determined. The overall prevalence of undernutrition according to the SGA (70.7%) was higher than that by objective assessment of nutritional status (48.5%). Agreement between the two evaluation methods was only fair to moderate (??=?0.336, P?<?0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the SGA method for screening undernutrition in this population were 88.235%, 45.833%, 60.606% and 80.487%, respectively. Accuracy, positive and negative power of the SGA method were 66.428%, 56.074% and 41.25%, respectively. Likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative and odds ratio of the SGA method were 1.628, 0.256 and 6.359, respectively. Our findings indicated that in assessing nutritional status of children, there is not a good level of agreement between SGA and objective nutritional assessment. In addition, SGA is a highly sensitive tool for assessing nutritional status and could identify children at risk of developing undernutrition.

AB  - Hepatic failure is a common feature of critical care. Most hepatic dysfunction in the ICU responds to medical management and metabolic support. The role of extracorporeal organ support in hepatic failure is not as well defined as it is in renal failure and pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, artificial organ support has been successful in the treatment of advanced liver failure. Hybrid bioartificial liver substitutes show great promise, especially as a bridge to liver transplant.

AB  - Summary. In a prospective study, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were related to estimated blood loss in 34 consecutive patients aged 23?92 years during resuscitation from haemorrhagic shock. Eighteen patients with a blood loss of less than 31 (1.9 [0.9-3.0] 1) (median and range), corresponding to 34 (16?46) % of estimated blood volume, had a heart rate of 83 (60?160) beats min-1 and a mean arterial pressure of 62 (35?73) mmHg. In 16 patients with a blood loss of more than 3 1 (4.0 [3.3?5.0] 1) corresponding to 89 (35?100) % of the estimated blood volume, heart rate was 120 (110?160) beats min-1 (P<0.05) and mean arterial pressure 52 (0?70) mmHg (P< 0.05). Six patients died due to severe bleeding (3.1 [2.5-5.0] 1) with a heart rate of 129 (110?160) beats min-1 and a mean arterial pressure of 40 (0.70) mmHg. It is concluded that reversible hypovolemic shock is associated with a relatively low heart rate (approximately 80 beats min-1) and that tachycardia (approximately 120 beats min-1) is associated with profound bleeding. Hypovolemic shock with tachycardia may represent a transition to an irreversible stage.

AB  - Abstract Introduction of human plasma protein genes into the mouse genome to produce transgenic mice furnishes an in vivo model for correlating chromosomal DNA sequences with developmental and tissue-specific expression. The liver produces an array of plasma proteins that circulate throughout the body contributing to homeostasis. Non-hepatic tissue sites of synthesis have been identified where a local provision of plasma proteins in needed. Analysis of expression of human plasma protein genes in ageing transgenic mice appears especialy promising in identifying DNA sequences that respond to environmental adversities such as inflammatory factors, hormonal changes and metal toxicity. The results indicate that human genes encoding and controlling liver plasma proteins serve as useful models for studying genetic regulation in the background of development and ageing.

AB  - Summary Oncology treatments can cause significant toxicities, which may be life-threatening, significantly impact on patients' quality of life or necessitate changes to their treatment. This chapter provides guidance on the most common side effects of treatment, including diarrhoea, vomiting, rashes, myelosuppression, neuropathy and mucositis. Some toxicities occur acutely, whereas others (e.g. osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and infertility) are longer-term complications of treatment. In addition, the underlying cancer itself can lead to a number of potential complications (e.g. bowel obstruction, renal failure and biliary obstruction) which may result in emergency hospital admission. Patients require careful assessment and management, particularly as in some cases it can be difficult to determine the underlying cause. For example, fatigue, anorexia, breathlessness, confusion and thromboembolism may be caused by both cancer and its treatment.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was implemented to verify the safety and efficacy of the perioperative effects in patients undergoing hepatectomy with ERAS or with conventional surgery (CS). Methods From August 2016 to November 2017, according to the inclusion criteria, 160 patients with liver diseases were suitable for participating in this experiment. Patients before liver resection were randomized into ERAS group (n = 80) and CS group (n = 80), and then the outcome measures were compared between the two groups. Results Enhanced recovery after surgery group had significantly less complications than CS group (P = .009). Compared with CS group, patients in ERAS group had low peak of WBCs in postoperative day (POD1), ALT in POD1 and POD3 (P < .05), high value of ALB in POD3 and POD5 (P < .05), less pain and higher patient satisfaction (P < .001), earlier exhaust, oral feeding, ambulation and extubation time (P < .05),and also had less hospital stay and cost (P < .001). There were no significant differences in readmission rate (<30 days) between two groups (P = .772). Conclusions Enhanced recovery after surgery programs applied to patients undergoing hepatectomy can safely and effectively relieve stress response, reduce the incidence of complications, improve patient satisfaction, accelerate patient recovery, reduce financial burden, and bring economic benefits.
