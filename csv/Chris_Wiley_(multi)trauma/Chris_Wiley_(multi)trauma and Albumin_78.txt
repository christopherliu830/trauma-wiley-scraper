AB  - Background and aim Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs, following a variety of perioperative treatments with evidence-based medical evidence, has indicated its validity to accelerate rehabilitation in a wide variety of surgical procedures. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was implemented to verify the safety and efficacy of the perioperative effects in patients undergoing hepatectomy with ERAS or with conventional surgery (CS). Methods From August 2016 to November 2017, according to the inclusion criteria, 160 patients with liver diseases were suitable for participating in this experiment. Patients before liver resection were randomized into ERAS group (n = 80) and CS group (n = 80), and then the outcome measures were compared between the two groups. Results Enhanced recovery after surgery group had significantly less complications than CS group (P = .009). Compared with CS group, patients in ERAS group had low peak of WBCs in postoperative day (POD1), ALT in POD1 and POD3 (P < .05), high value of ALB in POD3 and POD5 (P < .05), less pain and higher patient satisfaction (P < .001), earlier exhaust, oral feeding, ambulation and extubation time (P < .05),and also had less hospital stay and cost (P < .001). There were no significant differences in readmission rate (<30 days) between two groups (P = .772). Conclusions Enhanced recovery after surgery programs applied to patients undergoing hepatectomy can safely and effectively relieve stress response, reduce the incidence of complications, improve patient satisfaction, accelerate patient recovery, reduce financial burden, and bring economic benefits.

PY  - 1999
AB  - Hepatic failure is a common feature of critical care. Most hepatic dysfunction in the ICU responds to medical management and metabolic support. The role of extracorporeal organ support in hepatic failure is not as well defined as it is in renal failure and pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, artificial organ support has been successful in the treatment of advanced liver failure. Hybrid bioartificial liver substitutes show great promise, especially as a bridge to liver transplant.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2017 are organized by category and summarized. We provide a brief reflection of the research and progress in artificial organs intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of these technologies and methods. Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. Peer-reviewed Special Issues this year included contributions from the 12th International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion edited by Dr. Akif Undar, Artificial Oxygen Carriers edited by Drs. Akira Kawaguchi and Jan Simoni, the 24th Congress of the International Society for Mechanical Circulatory Support edited by Dr. Toru Masuzawa, Challenges in the Field of Biomedical Devices: A Multidisciplinary Perspective edited by Dr. Vincenzo Piemonte and colleagues and Functional Electrical Stimulation edited by Dr. Winfried Mayr and colleagues. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal.

AB  - Summary. In a prospective study, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were related to estimated blood loss in 34 consecutive patients aged 23?92 years during resuscitation from haemorrhagic shock. Eighteen patients with a blood loss of less than 31 (1.9 [0.9-3.0] 1) (median and range), corresponding to 34 (16?46) % of estimated blood volume, had a heart rate of 83 (60?160) beats min-1 and a mean arterial pressure of 62 (35?73) mmHg. In 16 patients with a blood loss of more than 3 1 (4.0 [3.3?5.0] 1) corresponding to 89 (35?100) % of the estimated blood volume, heart rate was 120 (110?160) beats min-1 (P<0.05) and mean arterial pressure 52 (0?70) mmHg (P< 0.05). Six patients died due to severe bleeding (3.1 [2.5-5.0] 1) with a heart rate of 129 (110?160) beats min-1 and a mean arterial pressure of 40 (0.70) mmHg. It is concluded that reversible hypovolemic shock is associated with a relatively low heart rate (approximately 80 beats min-1) and that tachycardia (approximately 120 beats min-1) is associated with profound bleeding. Hypovolemic shock with tachycardia may represent a transition to an irreversible stage.

AB  - Although prolonged cold ischemia time (PCIT) is generally associated with worse outcomes following liver transplantation, evidence suggests that some recipients and some donors might be more sensitive to PCIT than others. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that predict a higher risk of graft loss after a transplant with PCIT when compared with a similar transplant with average CIT (ACIT). 14?637 recipients reported to United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) era were studied by interaction term analysis in proportional hazards models. Recipient diabetes, obesity and donor African American (AA) ethnicity were found to significantly amplify the adverse effects of PCIT. Graft loss was 1.85-fold higher in diabetic or obese PCIT recipients compared with diabetic or obese ACIT recipients, (vs. 1.17 for the same comparison in non-diabetic non-obese recipients). Similarly, graft loss was 1.80-fold higher in AA PCIT donors compared with AA ACIT donors, (vs. 1.31 for the same comparison in non-AA donors). Other factors may also exist, but current clinical practices might already mitigate the risks from those factors. As such, we recommend expanding clinical practice to include our findings, but not abandoning current judgment based on factors already perceived to amplify the adverse effects of PCIT.
