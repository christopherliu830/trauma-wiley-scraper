AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract The scientific knowledge base that supports clinical decisions about perioperative fluid management continues to evolve. However, despite these advancements in the understanding of the physiology of fluid replacement, the definition of ??optimal?? perioperative fluid management remains a matter of clinical judgment. With an appreciation of the many factors, both sensible and insensible, that contribute to changes in blood and extracellular fluid volume during surgery, clinicians have tried to create reproducible and generally applicable formulas for replacement of fluid during surgery. These formulas have been challenged recently by the introduction of new tools for monitoring cardiopulmonary function, by the implementation of monitor-guided protocols for fluid management, and, more recently, by clinical data suggesting that fluid restriction may improve surgical outcomes in some clinical settings. The relative ease of pre-identified fluid replacement protocols is being slowly replaced by data-guided interventions that take into account a variety of factors. Clinicians are therefore required to tailor their fluid replacement strategies based on preoperative patient characteristics, the type of surgery and even the type of anesthetic that is utilized. Some of the benefits of this new approach range from relatively ??minor?? outcomes such as diminished nausea after surgery to preventing postoperative complications such as wound breakdown and cardiopulmonary failure.

AB  - Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) adversely affects more or less all immune competent cells. Nonspecific immunity is impaired, particularly adherence and chemotaxis of phagocytes, although the responsiveness of circulating cells may not be the same as that of noncirculating cells. PCM results in numerical and functional impairment in lymphocytes. PCM markedly affects IgG class antibodies which have the highest affinity when directed against T-dependent antigens. These impairments are interrelated, since cooperation between T-helper cell and B-cells is depressed, and the antigen presentation to T-helper cells by macrophages is deficient.

AB  - This single-blind, 8-week study compared the efficacy of a sonic toothbrush and a manual brush in 40 patients with adult periodontitis. Qualitative clinical indices and quantitative laboratory methods were used to monitor the periodontal status of 3 pockets 5 to 7 mm deep in each subject. Patients were randomly assigned either a sonic or manual toothbrush. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, and anatomical location of the test sites. Data were collected from all sites at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Over the 8-week period, both groups showed significant improvements in the clinical indices used. Descriptive statistics indicated the sonic brush group had greater improvement than the manual group in the clinical parameters (gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) flow was significantly lower in the sonic brush group (P = 0.018). Considerable variation was present in the levels detected for both inflammatory cytokines tested, however, concentration of interleukin-1 beta was significantly lower in the GCF of sonic group patients (P = 0.05), while concentration of interleukin-6 was significantly reduced in both groups (P ≤ 0.05) (t tests). Under these conditions, there is some evidence to suggest that the sonic toothbrush is more beneficial in resolving inflammation in patients with moderate periodontal disease.
