AB  - Abstract Vein graft failure remains a major concern after coronary artery bypass graft operations, and is initiated by loss of endothelial cell integrity. Preservation of saphenous vein grafts in the optimal solution after meticulous harvesting can limit the endothelial damage. Despite both experimental and clinical results in favor of buffered solutions, normal saline is still the most widely used solution. This review examines the literature to identify the most optimal storage solutions currently available for vein graft preservation.

AB  - Abstract One of the principal limitations to the size of an engineered tissue is oxygen and nutrient transport. Lacking a vascular bed, cells embedded in an engineered tissue will consume all available oxygen within hours while out branching blood vessels will take days to vascularize the implanted tissue. One possible solution is to directly write vascular structures within the engineered tissue prior to implantation, reconstructing the tissue according to its native architecture. The cell patterning technique, laser-guided direct writing (LGDW), can pattern multiple cells types with micrometer resolution on arbitrary surfaces, including biological gels. Here we show that LGDW can pattern human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in two- and three-dimensions with micrometer accuracy. By patterning HUVEC on Matrigel, we can direct their self-assembly into vascular structures along the desired pattern. Finally, co-culturing the vascular structures with hepatocytes resulted in an aggregated tubular structure similar in organization to a hepatic sinusoid. This capability can facilitate studies of tissue architecture at the single cell level, and of heterotypic interactions underlying processes such as liver and pancreas morphogenesis, differentiation, and angiogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Summary Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical emergency. Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), an artificial liver support system, can partly compensate for the detoxifying function of the liver by removing toxins from blood. To analyze the efficacy of MARS treatment, the outcomes of 113 ALF patients, treated with MARS between 2001 and 2007, were compared with a historical control group of 46 ALF patients treated without MARS between 1995 and 2001. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 94% in the MARS group and 77% in the control group (P?=?0.06). Without transplantation, survival was 66% and 40% (P?=?0.03), respectively. However, the etiological distribution of ALF differed significantly between the groups. In ALF patients with unknown etiology, groups were comparable at baseline; 91% and 69% of transplanted patients survived the MARS and control groups and the native liver recovered in 20% and 8% of the patients, respectively. Of the originally nonencephalopathic patients of unknown etiology, 36% underwent liver transplantation in the MARS group compared to 100% in the control group. Interpretation of the results was difficult in toxic etiology patients on account of differing baseline statuses. MARS treatment might partly explain the trend toward increased survival of ALF patients with unknown etiology.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews some examples of other clinical conditions affecting the respiratory system and also some systemic diseases with major pulmonary involvement. Diseases of the respiratory system can be classified into four categories: diseases affecting the airways, diseases of the lung parenchyma (alveoli and lung interstitium), pulmonary vascular disease, and neuromuscular diseases affecting respiratory function. All levels of the respiratory system may be involved, including the larynx, central airways, peripheral airways, lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature, pleura, chest wall, and respiratory muscles. The intrathoracic airways can be extrapulmonary or intrapulmonary, in which case they are influenced by lung elastic recoil. Impaired gas transfer, with reduced transfer factor for carbon monoxide and transfer coefficient, is the hallmark of diseases of the alveoli and lung parenchyma. Pneumonia due to infection of the lung parenchyma results in an acute inflammatory exudate in the alveoli.

AB  - Abstract: Anti-HIV antibodies were found in the cerebrospinal fluid of all 41 subjects tested whose serum contained these antibodies. To ensure that locally produced antibody was being detected, a sensitive assay was used to demonstrate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Antibodies to ubiquitous adenovirus group antigens were sought, simultaneously, in CSF and serum. A lack of adenovirus antibodies in CSF of subjects seropositive for adenovirus was required before CSF anti-HIV antibodies could be considered to be produced within the central nervous system. Of the 41 subjects tested eight were asymptomatic, eight were clinically well but had persistent lymphadenopathy, 14 were immunodeficient arid had constitutional symptoms (AIDS-related complex or ARC) and 11 had AIDS. Ofigoclonal banding was detected in the CSF of 16 subjects and a pleocytosis was present in 24. Neither finding clustered with a particular stage of infection. It appears that HIV infection of T lymphocytes and the central nervous system occurs simultaneously, early in the course of the infection. All HIV infected subjects are at risk of developing primary neurological as well as immunological sequelae. Currently poorly understood resistance factors must protect both lymphocytes and nervous system tissue from damage by the HIV virus, as to date, the majority of infected subjects have not become immunodeficient or developed neurological disease.

AB  - Summary General recommendations for plasma transfusion have been well described in many guidelines. Therapeutic uses of plasma, in association with bleeding and abnormalities of coagulation tests (except in emergencies) are based on pathophysiological rationale, but questions about optimal dose and schedule of plasma. A recurring theme in many settings is an overall paucity of high-level evidence to inform optimal plasma transfusion practice remain unanswered, and this particularly applies to prophylactic uses of plasma. There should be more recognition of the limitations of current standard coagulation screening tests, and appreciation that in vitro abnormalities of coagulation screening tests do not equate with an in vivo failure of clinical haemostasis and the presence of clinical coagulopathy. Newer global tests of haemostasis may be better markers of abnormal bleeding risk, but should be assessed and validated in larger clinical studies. Given current evidence, a more appropriate plasma transfusion strategy may be one that emphasises the therapeutic use of plasma in bleeding patients. The role, if any, of prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding patients with abnormalities of standard coagulation tests, which have limited value in predicting bleeding remains very uncertain. Future research should identify the constituents in plasma that are providing the most benefit (e.g. by analogy the role of ADAMTS13 in TTP). With a better mechanistic understanding of disorders with acquired deficiencies of one or more coagulation factors, replacement might also be more appropriately managed in the future with concentrates of multiple coagulation factors, and which would minimise risks of circulatory overload described when high volume plasma transfusions are given.
