AB  - Abstract Bulk nanocrystalline Ti bars (Grade 4, ?4 ? 3000 mm3) were massively fabricated by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) via follow-up conform scheme with the microcrystalline CP Ti as raw material. Homogeneous nanostructured crystals with the average grain size of 250 nm were identified for the ECAPed Ti, with extremely high tensile/fatigue strength (around 1240/620 MPa) and adorable elongation (more than 5%). Pronounced formation of bonelike apatite for the nanocrystalline Ti group after 14 days static immersion in simulated body fluids (SBF) reveals the prospective in vitro bioactive capability of fast calcification, whereas an estimated 17% increment in protein adsorption represents good bioaffinity of nanocrystalline Ti. The documentation onto the whole life circle of osteoblast cell lines (MG63) revealed the strong interactions and superior cellular functionalization when they are co-incubated with bulk nanocrystalline Ti sample. Moreover, thread-structured specimens were designed and implanted into the tibia of Beagles dogs till 12 weeks to study the in vivo responses between bone and metallic implant made of bulk nanocrystalline Ti, with the microcrystalline Ti as control. For the implanted nanostructured Ti group, neoformed bone around the implants underwent the whole-stage transformation proceeding from originally osteons or immature woven bone to mature lamellar bone (skeletonic trabecular), even with the remodeling being finished till 12 weeks. The phenomenal osseointegration of direct implant-bone contact can be revealed from the group of the ECAPed Ti without fibrous tissue encapsulation in the gap between the implant and autogenous bone. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Many parameters currently used for the pre-transplant assessment of liver allografts, are not reliable enough in predicting the likelihood of early graft dysfunction or non-function. It is generally accepted that bile secretion is a sign of hepatic function post-transplant and that bile flow shows a close linear relationship to the secretion of bile acids (?apparent choleretic activity?). We have studied bile flow, biliary bile acid concentrations and composition and measured apparent choleretic activity from hepatic bile collected with a new technique under controlled conditions at the time of retrieval from 18 donor livers. More than three samples were collected from each of 13 donors and a total of 65 samples of hepatic bile were analysed. Of these, ten showed typical apparent choleretic activity with a positive slope in the regression line analysis (correlation coefficient of 0.9), validating our collection technique.

AB  - Abstract Background: Nutrition interventions improve morbidity, mortality and length of stay in the critically ill. Dietitians play a central role in facilitating these interventions. However, data regarding the current level and adequacy of dietetic service provision to critical care in the UK is lacking. This study aimed to clarify current service trends in Northern England for critical care, in relation to dietetic funding, grading and activity characteristics and comparisons with nationally recognized standards of care. Methods: A work profile questionnaire was sent to 53 dietitians in Northern England. Data was collected on funding, activity patterns, organization of nutrition support, pay banding/grade and arrangements for cover during absence. Results: The response rate was 66% (35/53). Thirty-three hospitals were represented. No critical care centre funding or actual activity achieved national guidance for funded dietetic full-time equivalents (FTE). Total sample deficit for funding against recommendations was 32.9 FTE. Staff pay bands/grades were inconsistent. Routine patient review occurred on a daily basis by 31% dietitians and 23% were members of a nutrition support team. Cover during absence was limited or provided by a dietitian at a lower staff grade in 67% of centres. Conclusions: Serious deficiencies exist in dietetic services to critical care in the sample studied. Further work is now required to identify inter-regional and national trends and to define appropriate dietetic job profiles for critical care.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy for hundreds of thousands of people who have severe impairment of gastrointestinal function. Trace elements are a small but very important part of PN that can be overlooked during busy practice. Serious complications can result from trace element deficiencies and toxicities, and this is especially problematic during times of product shortages. Practical information on parenteral trace element use can be gleaned from case reports, some retrospective studies, and very few randomized controlled trials. A general knowledge of trace element metabolism and excretion, deficiency and toxicity symptoms, products, optimal dosages, and strategies for supplementation, restriction, and monitoring will equip practitioners to provide optimal care for their patients who depend on PN.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Background & Objectives Serologic testing after transfusion reactions (TRs) aims to find accountable immune haemolytic incompatibility. Our hospital policies recommend serologic testing in all TR, except for low-risk fevers (subclinical temperature <39°C) or uncomplicated allergic reactions. Assessing compliance with these guidelines and serologic testing yields may provide insights on quality of practice and value. Materials & Methods Interrogation of two haemovigilance databases identified all possible-to-definite TR over a 4-year period (2013?2016) at four academic hospitals. We reviewed the performance and outcome of serologic testing by site, year, reaction type, implicated product and service. Results Serologic testing occurred in 769 (55%) of 1408 referrals, with 1153 (82%) compliant with guidelines. Similar proportions deviated to overtesting (85/550 [15%]) and undertesting (174/858 [20%]), with undertesting seen most often in atypical TR. Overall, 30 (4.4%) of 769 cases had a new finding, but only 2 (0.3%) reflected host-derived antibodies. Overall, the number needed to test to discover an unexpected allospecificity was 385, or 253 if limited to high-risk fevers. Reaction- and product-specific yields ranged from 0% to 48%. The yield in complicated allergic reactions was low at 2%, constituting only predictable passive isohaemagglutinin(s) in retrospect. Investigated IVIG TR accounted for most of this cohort?s signal by passive isohaemagglutinins in 48%. Conclusion The performance of post-TR serologic testing revealed practice gaps and expected context-specific yields. Tailored serologic testing (i.e. indirect antiglobulin tests for alloantibodies in post-RBC/high-risk febrile reactions, ± isoagglutinin-focused tests after IVIG or ABO-minor-mismatched platelets) may improve value and liberate resources for other unmet needs in TR investigation.
