AB  - Abstract Background: Nutrition interventions improve morbidity, mortality and length of stay in the critically ill. Dietitians play a central role in facilitating these interventions. However, data regarding the current level and adequacy of dietetic service provision to critical care in the UK is lacking. This study aimed to clarify current service trends in Northern England for critical care, in relation to dietetic funding, grading and activity characteristics and comparisons with nationally recognized standards of care. Methods: A work profile questionnaire was sent to 53 dietitians in Northern England. Data was collected on funding, activity patterns, organization of nutrition support, pay banding/grade and arrangements for cover during absence. Results: The response rate was 66% (35/53). Thirty-three hospitals were represented. No critical care centre funding or actual activity achieved national guidance for funded dietetic full-time equivalents (FTE). Total sample deficit for funding against recommendations was 32.9 FTE. Staff pay bands/grades were inconsistent. Routine patient review occurred on a daily basis by 31% dietitians and 23% were members of a nutrition support team. Cover during absence was limited or provided by a dietitian at a lower staff grade in 67% of centres. Conclusions: Serious deficiencies exist in dietetic services to critical care in the sample studied. Further work is now required to identify inter-regional and national trends and to define appropriate dietetic job profiles for critical care.

AB  - Abstract Modification of the current allocation system for donor livers in the United States to incorporate recipient serum sodium concentration ([Na]) has recently been proposed. However, the impact of this parameter on posttransplantation mortality has not been previously examined in a large risk-adjusted analysis. We assessed the effect of recipient [Na] on the survival of all adults with chronic liver disease who received a first single organ liver transplant in the UK and Ireland during the period March 1, 1994 to March 31, 2005 (n = 5,152) at 3 years, during the first 90 days, and beyond the first 90 days, adjusting for a wide range of recipient, donor, and graft characteristics. Compared to those with normal [Na] (135?145 meq/L; n = 3,066), severely hyponatremic recipients ([Na] <130 meq/L, n = 541), had a higher risk-adjusted mortality at 3 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04?1.59; P < 0.02). The excess mortality was, however, confined to the first 90 days (HR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.18?2.04; P < 0.002) with no significant difference thereafter. This was also true for hypernatremic recipients ([Na] >145 meq/L, n = 81), who had an even greater risk-adjusted mortality compared to normonatremic recipients (overall: HR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25?2.73; P < 0.002; ≤90 days: HR 2.29; 95% CI, 1.42?3.70; P < 0.001; >90 days: HR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.55?2.29; P = 0.8), whereas mildly hyponatremic recipients ([Na] 130?134 meq/L, n = 1,127) had similar risk-adjusted mortality to those with normal [Na] at the same time points. In conclusion, recipient [Na] is an independent predictor of death following liver transplantation. Attempts to correct the [Na] toward the normal reference range are an important aspect of pretransplantation management. Liver Transpl 13:1115?1124, 2007. ? 2007 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Abstract. Purpose:? That vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in inflammatory angiogenesis has been well established. This pilot study was designed to evaluate experimental treatment with bevacizumab eyedrops in corneal neovascularization induced by alkali burn. The feasibility of topical administration, corneal cell viability and corneal penetration were investigated in an animal model. Methods:? Eighteen chinchilla bastard rabbit corneas injured with 1?m NaOH were divided into three groups: untreated, early and late treatment groups. Eyedrops of bevacizumab solution (25?mg/ml) were administered five times daily. Clinical examination under stereoscopic microscope was performed to evaluate corneal opacity, neovascularization, vessel size and oedema. Histopathology was analysed for vessel density and apoptotic reaction. Additionally, intracameral bevacizumab concentration was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after repeated topical applications. Results:? A fast increase in aqueous bevacizumab concentration was achieved when the solution was instilled every minute onto a healthy eye surface. As well as clear anti-angiogenic effects, anti-fibrotic effects were also seen after corneal burn, maintaining corneal transparency. Early treatment of actively growing vessels showed a significantly better outcome, although apoptosis of pre-existing vessels could also be induced by the late treatment. No specific toxicity was seen regarding epithelium, keratocytes or endothelium. Conclusions:? The data from this pilot study suggest that bevacizumab eyedrops can sufficiently penetrate the corneal stroma and anterior chamber. When administered soon after alkali burn, bevacizumab seems to significantly reduce corneal damage. Combinations of established treatment regimens with topical bevacizumab might be considered in severe injuries with otherwise devastating prognoses.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores how to approach joint pain from a rheumatological perspective. It presents the case examples of an on-call SHO bleeped to review a 60 year old lady with a hot, swollen, painful right wrist and a 55 year old lady referred to the Rheumatologist by the general practitioner with a two week history of painful, swollen left wrist joint. Reactive arthritis is often seen following gastrointestinal and genito-urinary infections with specific micro-organisms. Pre-existing rheumatological disease increases the risk of septic arthritis and although the leflunomide was stopped it has a long half-life conferring an immunosuppressed state. Erythema of the skin overlying the affected joint raises the probability of either septic arthritis or crystal arthropathy. Variability in disease presentation and disease evolution over time constantly revise SQs. Paying attention to the SQs in flux ensures that are consciously considering other possibilities.
