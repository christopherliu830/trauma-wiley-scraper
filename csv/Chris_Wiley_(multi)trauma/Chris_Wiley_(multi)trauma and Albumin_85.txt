AB  - Abstract Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. To identify a plasma proteomic signature that can detect OS, we used SELDI MS to perform proteomic profiling on plasma specimens from 29?OS and 20?age-matched osteochondroma?(OC) patients. Nineteen statistically significant ion peaks that were differentially expressed in OS when compared with OC patients were identified (p < 0.001 and false discovery rate < 10%). Using the proteomic profiles, we constructed a multivariate 3-nearest neighbors classifier to distinguish OS from OC patients with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 80% based on external leave-one-out crossvalidation. Permutation test showed that the classification result was statistically significant (p < 0.00005). One of the proteins (m/z?11?704) in the proteomic signature was identified as serum amyloid protein?A (SAA) by PMF. The higher plasma level of SAA in OS patients was further validated by Western blotting when compared to that of osteochrondroma patients and normal subjects as reference. The classifier based on this plasma proteomic signature may be useful to differentiate malignant bone cancer from benign bone tumors and for early detection of OS in high-risk individuals.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Fibrinogen replacement is critical in major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH). Purified, pasteurised fibrinogen concentrate appears to have benefit over cryoprecipitate in ease of administration and safety but is unlicensed in pregnancy. In July 2009, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service replaced cryoprecipitate with fibrinogen. Objectives To examine the impact of this externally imposed change on blood product use and clinical outcomes in MOH. Methods Women with MOH requiring fibrinogen between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2011 were identified from an MOH database. Aetiology of MOH, medical treatments, blood product use and clinical outcomes were compared between the cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen groups. Results Of 21 614 deliveries, 77 cases of MOH were identified. Of the 77 cases, 34 (44%) received cryoprecipitate (n?=?14) or fibrinogen concentrate (n?=?20). The mean (±SEM) dose utilised was 2·21 ± 0·35 pools of cryoprecipitate and 4 ± 0·8 g of fibrinogen. There was a stronger correlation between the increase in fibrinogen level and dose of fibrinogen (Pearson co-efficient 0·5; P?=?0·03) than dose of cryoprecipitate (Pearson co-efficient 0·32; P?=?0·3). Mean (±SEM) estimated blood loss (EBL), red cell concentrate (RCC) and Octaplas transfused were greater (but not significantly) in the cryoprecipitate group compared with the fibrinogen group; EBL?=?5·2 ± 1·1 vs 3·3 ± 0·5 L (P?=?0·1); RCC?=?7·2 ± 1·2 vs 5·9 ± 1·0 U (P?=?0·4); Octaplas?=?4·1 ± 0·7 vs 3·2 ± 0·7 U (P?=?0·36), respectively. Haemostasis was secured, and there were no adverse reactions or thrombotic complications. Conclusion Purified virally inactivated fibrinogen concentrate is as efficacious as cryoprecipitate in correcting hypofibrinogenaemia in MOH.

AB  - Abstract Background Non-invasive fibrosis markers can distinguish between liver fibrosis stages in lieu of liver biopsy or imaging elastography. Aims To develop a sensitive, non-invasive, freely-available algorithm that differentiates between individual liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Methods Chronic HCV patients (n = 355) at Cairo University Hospital, Egypt, with liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage (METAVIR), were tested for preselected fibrosis markers. A novel multistage stepwise fibrosis classification algorithm (FibroSteps) was developed using random forest analysis for biomarker selection, and logistic regression for modelling. FibroSteps predicted fibrosis stage using four steps: Step 1 distinguished no(F0)/mild fibrosis(F1) vs. moderate(F2)/severe fibrosis(F3)/cirrhosis(F4); Step 2a distinguished F0 vs. F1; Step 2b distinguished F2 vs. F3/F4; and Step 3 distinguished F3 vs. F4. FibroSteps was developed using a randomly-selected training set (n = 234) and evaluated using the remaining patients (n = 118) as a validation set. Results Hyaluronic Acid, TGF-?1, α2-macroglobulin, MMP-2, Apolipoprotein-A1, Urea, MMP-1, alpha-fetoprotein, haptoglobin, RBCs, haemoglobin and TIMP-1 were selected into the models, which had areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.973, 0.923 (Step 1); 0.943, 0.872 (Step 2a); 0.916, 0.883 (Step 2b) and 0.944, 0.946 (Step 3), in the training and validation sets respectively. The final classification had accuracies of 94.9% (95% CI: 91.3?97.4%) and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.9?94.6%) for the training and validation sets respectively. Conclusions FibroSteps, a freely available, non-invasive liver fibrosis classification, is accurate and can assist clinicians in making prognostic and therapeutic decisions. The statistical code for FibroSteps using R software is provided in the supplementary materials.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: The purpose of this article is to discuss the various factors related to poor outcome in free flap reconstructions of the head and neck (H&N). Free tissue transfer has become the standard reconstruction technique for complex H&N defects. With the evolution of free flap use in H&N surgery, numerous factors have been proposed that adversely affect flap outcome, many with the support of only anecdotal experience. We seek to critically review the literature to assess what evidence exists for the relation of various intraoperative factors to free flap complications. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: A review of the contemporary literature (1995 to present) on free flap reconstruction of the H&N was undertaken. A PubMed search using the terms head and neck, reconstruction, free flap, microvascular, failure, complications, fluids, intraoperative, hypertension, hypotension, nitrous oxide, temperature, and morbidity in various combinations was completed. Appropriate articles were selected and analyzed. Results: Studies report various factors thought to influence flap outcomes, often with divergent conclusions. Nonetheless, the body of evidence implicates several intraoperative factors to contribute to free flap complications including: >7 L intraoperative fluid administration, significant medical comorbidity, and prolonged operative time. There is no evidence supporting hypotension, pressors, colloids, and nitrous use in free flap failure. Conclusions: Although various dogmas related to the intraoperative care of free flap patients exist, including avoidance of hypotension and pressor use, there is no available clinical evidence to support these practices. Although free flap failure is uncommon, a better understanding of its causes is necessary to avoid this disastrous complication. Laryngoscope, 2010
