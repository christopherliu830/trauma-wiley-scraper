AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) within red blood cells (RBC) is protected from oxidative processes by enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants as well as the RBC membrane that provides a physical barrier against oxidation. When Hb is introduced into the circulation as a result of hemolysis or following infusion of Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs; ?blood substitutes?), the control of oxidative processes becomes dependent on plasma oxidative status. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that Hb and HBOCs undergo oxidative modification at the site of heme iron and at multiple amino acid sites as a result of autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation. Recent findings from in vitro studies provide a strong basis for understanding of potential toxicity in vivo. The antioxidative status of both plasma and tissue becomes an important factor in the control of Hb and HBOC oxidation and nitrosylation in the circulation. Several studies that performed ex vivo and in vivo have demonstrated a critical role for plasma antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and uric acid in maintaining Hb and HBOCs in functional non-oxidized states. In the present review we discuss mechanisms of Hb and HBOC autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we explore the role(s) of plasma antioxidants in maintaining functional HBOC status that may potentially be exploited as part of protective strategies against Hb and HBOC oxidative toxicity.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) represents one of the most notable achievements of modern medicine, serving as a therapeutic modality for all age groups across the healthcare continuum. PN offers a life-sustaining option when intestinal failure prevents adequate oral or enteral nutrition. However, providing nutrients by vein is an expensive form of nutrition support, and serious adverse events can occur. In an effort to provide clinical guidance regarding PN therapy, the Board of Directors of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) convened a task force to develop consensus recommendations regarding appropriate PN use. The recommendations contained in this document aim to delineate appropriate PN use and promote clinical benefits while minimizing the risks associated with the therapy. These consensus recommendations build on previous ASPEN clinical guidelines and consensus recommendations for PN safety. They are intended to guide evidence-based decisions regarding appropriate PN use for organizations and individual professionals, including physicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and other clinicians involved in providing PN. They not only support decisions related to initiating and managing PN but also serve as a guide for developing quality monitoring tools for PN and for identifying areas for further research. Finally, the recommendations contained within the document are also designed to inform decisions made by additional stakeholders, such as policy makers and third-party payers, by providing current perspectives regarding the use of PN in a variety of healthcare settings.

AB  - Abstract Although drug-protein interactions have been shown to be important in the transport of drugs into and through the eye, age-related differences in ocular drug-protein binding have not been explored. This study was designed to investigate protein binding characteristics of pilocarpine and chloramphenicol in aqueous humour and plasma from rabbits of different ages. The method of equilibrium dialysis was used to quantitate drug-protein interactions. Younger animals showed decreased binding of chloramphenicol in plasma when compared to older rabbits. On the other hand, the interactions of both drugs with aqueous humour proteins were more extensive in younger rabbits. Age-related differences in drug-protein binding were not directly related to the total protein contents of the respective biological fluids. These findings suggest possible age-related differences in the relative protein fractions contained in aqueous humour and plasma, or qualitative differences in the binding capacity of the proteins involved.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism is a major public health issue, for it is responsible for an estimated 60,000 annual deaths in the United Kingdom. Up to 30% of those affected by deep vein thrombosis have post phlebitic syndrome. Of these 55% are hospital ? acquired, the majority of which can be prevented by appropriate thromboprophylaxis. The main risk factors for venous thromboembolism include immobility, venous perturbation and a prothrombotic state. This chapter covers the diagnosis and immediate management of acute venous thromboembolisms including in pregnancy and in those with an underlying malignancy. The principles of primary and secondary prevention are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract (1) Angiogenesis (growth of new capillaries from an existing capillary bed) may result from a mismatch in microvascular supply and metabolic demand (metabolic error signal). Krogh examined the distribution and number of capillaries to explore the correlation between O2 delivery and O2 consumption. Subsequently, the heterogeneity in angiogenic response within a muscle has been shown to reflect either differences in fibre type composition or mechanical load. However, local control leads to targetted angiogenesis in the vicinity of glycolytic fibre types following muscle stimulation, or oxidative fibres following endurance training, while heterogeneity of capillary spacing is maintained during ontogenetic growth. (2) Despite limited microscopy resolution and lack of specific markers, Krogh?s interest in the structure of the capillary wall paved the way for understanding the mechanisms of capillary growth. Angiogenesis may be influenced by the response of perivascular or stromal cells (fibroblasts, macrophages and pericytes) to altered activity, likely acting as a source for chemical signals modulating capillary growth such as vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, haemodynamic factors such as shear stress and muscle stretch play a significant role in adaptive remodelling of the microcirculation. (3) Most indices of capillarity are highly dependent on fibre size, resulting in possible bias because of scaling. To examine the consequences of capillary distribution, it is therefore helpful to quantify the area of tissue supplied by individual capillaries. This allows the spatial limitations inherent in most models of tissue oxygenation to be overcome generating an alternative approach to Krogh?s tissue cylinder, the capillary domain, to improve descriptions of intracellular oxygen diffusion.
