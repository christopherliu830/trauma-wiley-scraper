AB  - Abstract We evaluated the concept that the vascular entrance of both bacterial and nonbacterial participate material could lead to hepatic parenchyma) cell injury, either due to post-phagocytic Kupffer cell activity or the margination of activated leukocytes in the liver. Injection of denatured, collagen-coated particles as well as heat-killed bacteria were used as particulate challenges. Hepatic parenchymal cell injury in vivo during postoperative sepsis was evaluated by plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) enzyme levels over 3-72 h. AST and OCT levels elevated following either laparotomy plus cecal ligation (mild sepsis) or laparotomy plus cecal ligation with puncture (severe sepsis), with the peak level at 24 h. In addition, the direct intravenous injection of either nonbacterial foreign particles or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa into normal rats also produced a dose-dependent elevation of AST and OCT. The plasma level of either AST or OCT actually increased 350-400% after injection of the non-bacterial particles. A similar dose related elevation in enzymes followed the intravenous injection of heat-killed Pseudomonas. To differentiate the potential contribution of activated hepatic Kupffer celts versus activated marginated neutrophils to the in vivo hepatic injury, we determined the release of the hepatic specific enzyme OCT by cultured hepatic parenchymal cells when they were exposed to isolated Kupffer cells or isolated PMNs that were activated by exposure to dead bacteria. Bacteria alone when added to cultured hepatocytes did not induce significant OCT release. In contrast, activated PMNs but not Kupffer cells induced a significant (p < 0.05) release of OCT from parenchymal cells into the culture media. Thus, in vivo transient hepatic parenchymal cell injury with post-operative sepsis may be mediated by the margination of activated PMNs in the liver.

AB  - Abstract This review focuses on the application of nanomaterials for neural interfacing. The junction between nanotechnology and neural tissues can be particularly worthy of scientific attention for several reasons: (i) Neural cells are electroactive, and the electronic properties of nanostructures can be tailored to match the charge transport requirements of electrical cellular interfacing. (ii) The unique mechanical and chemical properties of nanomaterials are critical for integration with neural tissue as long-term implants. (iii) Solutions to many critical problems in neural biology/medicine are limited by the availability of specialized materials. (iv) Neuronal stimulation is needed for a variety of common and severe health problems. This confluence of need, accumulated expertise, and potential impact on the well-being of people suggests the potential of nanomaterials to revolutionize the field of neural interfacing. In this review, we begin with foundational topics, such as the current status of neural electrode (NE) technology, the key challenges facing the practical utilization of NEs, and the potential advantages of nanostructures as components of chronic implants. After that the detailed account of toxicology and biocompatibility of nanomaterials in respect to neural tissues is given. Next, we cover a variety of specific applications of nanoengineered devices, including drug delivery, imaging, topographic patterning, electrode design, nanoscale transistors for high-resolution neural interfacing, and photoactivated interfaces. We also critically evaluate the specific properties of particular nanomaterials?including nanoparticles, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes?that can be taken advantage of in neuroprosthetic devices. The most promising future areas of research and practical device engineering are discussed as a conclusion to the review.

AB  - Abstract Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine. The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull. The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot. Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma.

AB  - Abstract Background: Although surgical resection remains the central element in curative treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, increasing emphasis and resource has been focused on neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Developments in these modalities have improved outcomes, but far less attention has been paid to improving oncological outcomes through optimization of perioperative care. Methods: A narrative review is presented based on available and updated literature in English and the authors' experience with enhanced recovery research. Results: A range of perioperative factors (such as lifestyle, co-morbidity, anaemia, sarcopenia, medications, regional analgesia and minimal access surgery) are modifiable, and can be optimized to reduce short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, improve functional capacity and quality of life, and possibly improve oncological outcome. The effect on cancer-free and overall survival may be of equal magnitude to that achieved by many adjuvant oncological regimens. Modulation of core factors, such as nutritional status, systemic inflammation, and surgical and disease-mediated stress, probably influences the host's immune surveillance and defence status both directly and through reduced postoperative morbidity. Conclusion: A wider view on long-term effects of expanded or targeted enhanced recovery protocols is warranted. Copyright ? 2012 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Summary This chapter introduces the foundations of transfusion medicine and the principles behind donor selection, product collection, compatibility testing, transfusion administration, recognition and treatment of transfusion-related reactions, and alternative methods of blood product use. Canine blood types are classified using the dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) system. Commercially available blood typing kits have made in-house blood type determination possible in both dogs and cats. Cross-matching does not indicate if the donor and the recipient have the same blood type. Canine donors should be young and in good overall health and behavioral standing determined by clinical history and physical exam. Fresh whole blood is utilized for a variety of reasons within veterinary medicine, including replacement therapy in patients who have decreased oxygen-carrying capacity with hypovolemia to a significant degree. A variety of transfusion sets and filters are available for use in veterinary transfusion medicine. Immunological reactions are caused by antigen-antibody interactions between the donor and recipient.
