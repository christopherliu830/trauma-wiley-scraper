AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare outcomes and identify prognostic factors in dogs with single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEHPSS) gradually attenuated with an ameroid ring constrictor (ARC) or cellophane banding (CB). Study Design Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Animals Forty-nine dogs with CEHPSS (n?=?23 for ARC; n?=?26 for CB). Methods Medical records of dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC or CB were reviewed for postoperative (<1 month), midterm (1-6 months), and long-term (> 6 months) outcomes. Data were evaluated to detect factors associated with postoperative complications, residual shunting, and long-term outcome. Results Postoperative complication rates did not differ between ARC (26.1%) and CB (23.1%, P?=?.89) and were negatively associated with body weight (P?=?.03). Overall, postoperative mortality was low (2.0%). Clinical long-term outcome was excellent in 45.0% and 39.1% and good in 55.0% and 60.9% of dogs after ARC and CB, respectively. Suspected residual shunting rate upon abdominal ultrasonography was greater after CB (31.6%) than after ARC (0%). Conclusion ARC and CB were both effective for attenuation of CEHPSS, resulting in good to excellent outcomes with low morbidity and mortality. Residual shunting was suspected in a higher proportion of dogs treated with CB on the basis of abdominal ultrasonography results. However, further prospective randomized studies must be conducted with validated evaluation methods to verify this assumption.

AB  - Abstract The systemic balance of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors has been proposed to play a key-role in primary tumor growth dependent growth suppression of secondary tumors. Despite the importance of the organ microenvironment to angiogenesis and microcirculation, the influence of a primary tumor on secondary bone tumors has not been investigated so far. Since breast cancer has a high propensity to spread to bone, we used an in vivo xenograft model to determine the impact of growing breast cancer cells (MCF-7) in the mammary fat pad on the microvascular properties of subsequently inoculated secondary breast cancer tumors in bone. Mice were either treated with a resection of the primary tumor (n?=?10) or no surgery (n?=?9) and intravital microscopy was performed over 25 days in bone tumors. Tumor growth in bone was temporarily suppressed by the primary tumor on days 10 and 14. While microvascular permeability and vascular diameter decreased in both groups over time, the presence of the primary tumor was accompanied by a decreased tumor perfusion on days 8 and 10 through a reduction in vessels with diameters between 5 and 20?µm. The results imply a potential benefit of a therapeutic regime in which the resection of the primary tumor is combined with an anti-angiogenic therapy in the perioperative or direct postoperative period. This might result in reduced progression of bone metastasis subsequent to excision of the primary tumor. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To identify clinical risk factors for seizures in dogs with intracranial neoplasia. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study of 68 dogs with histopathologically confirmed primary or secondary intracranial neoplasia, complete clinical history and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was conducted. Signalment and clinical history were retrieved from clinical records and magnetic resonance images of the brain were re-evaluated. Prevalence of findings was compared between dogs with and without seizures. Results: Forty-two dogs had tumour-related seizures, the remaining 26 were seizure-free. Tumour types included meningioma (23 dogs with and 5 without seizures), glioma (9 dogs with and 6 without seizures), choroid plexus tumour (2 dogs without seizures), neuroblastoma (1 dog with seizures) and metastatic/invasive tumours including lymphoma (9 dogs with and 13 without seizures). On the basis of multi-variable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for seizures associated with intracranial neoplasia were magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with the presence of neoplastic tissue in frontal lobe [odds ratio (OR) 9·61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·59 to 35·61], marked gadolinium enhancement (OR 10·41; 95% CI 2·07 to 52·30) and magnetic resonance imaging findings of subfalcine and/or subtentorial herniation (OR 3·88; 95% CI 1·10 to 13·71). Clinical Significance: Dogs with primary or secondary intracranial neoplasia are at risk of seizures, particularly those with tumours that affect the frontal lobe, enhance markedly with gadolinium, or cause subfalcine and/or subtentorial herniation.

AB  - Abstract Blood transfusion systems have contributed considerably to human health and welfare. Nevertheless, numerous problems remain, such as infection of hepatitis virus and HIV, blood type mismatching, immunological response, short shelf life, and costs. Blood substitutes have been under development for decades to overcome those problems. Some substitutes for plasma components are already established, such as plasma expanders, electrolytes, and recombinant coagulant factors. Herein, we specifically address the research and development of substitutes for the function of red blood cells (artificial oxygen carriers, or oxygen infusions) such as chemically modified Hbs, encapsulated Hbs, synthetic heme derivatives, and perfluorochemicals. Unexpected side effects hindered further development of the early artificial oxygen carriers and indicated the physiological significance of the structure of red blood cells. Well-designed and selected artificial oxygen carriers that meet requisite criteria will be eventually realized. They will provide remarkable innovation in conventional medical treatments.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic severe malarial anaemia (SMA) has a high fatality rate of 30?40%; most deaths occur in children awaiting blood transfusion. Blood transfusion services in most of Africa are not capable of delivering adequate supplies of safe blood in a timely manner to critically ill children with SMA. Contrary to widely held belief, hypovolaemia, rather than heart failure, has emerged as a common complication in such children. We examined the safety of pre-transfusion management (PTM) by volume expansion, aimed at stabilizing children and obviating the urgency for blood transfusion. Kenyan children with severe falciparum anaemia (haemoglobin?<?5?g/dl) and respiratory distress were randomly assigned to 20?ml/kg of 4·5% albumin or 0·9% saline or maintenance only (control) while awaiting blood transfusion. PTM was apparently safe since it did not lead to the development of pulmonary oedema or other adverse events. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome [mean percentage reduction in base excess between admission and 8?h (95% confidence interval)] between the control group 42% (19?66%) albumin group 44% (32?57%) and saline group 36% (16?57%); adjusted analysis of variance F?=?0·31, P?=?0·7. However, the number of children requiring emergency interventions was significantly greater in the control group, four of 18 (22%) than the saline group 0 of 20 (P?=?0·03). We have established the safety of this PTM in children with SMA whilst awaiting blood transfusion at a hospital with an adequate blood-banking program. The impact on mortality should be assessed where blood transfusion services are unable to supply emergency transfusions.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in the dog. Methods: A retrospective study to evaluate the use of a GIA stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in 15 dogs. Results: Reasons for intervention included dehiscence of a previous enterotomy (four of 15), intestinal neoplasia (five of 15), vascular compromise (three of 15), intussusception (two of 15) and foreign body (one of 15). The mean time taken to perform the anastomosis was 7·7 minutes (range five to 12 minutes). No operative complications were recorded and all dogs recovered from the surgery. Major (two dogs) and minor (six dogs) short-term complications of pyrexia and anorexia were recorded in six dogs. In five of these, the cause was considered to be related to a pre-existing peritonitis. One dog was euthanased five months postoperatively for a multi-centric recurrence of intestinal lymphoma. Six month follow-up confirmed an unremarkable and complete recovery in all remaining dogs. No major or minor long-term complications were recorded in any individual. Clinical Significance: A modified stapled functional end-to-end intestinal anastomosis holds merit and should be considered a viable alternative to other stapled and sutured anastomosis techniques.

AB  - Bioadhesives and glues are widely used as an adjunct to conventional methods employed in healing the post-surgical injuries and restoration of normal tissue functions. Protein-based bioadhesives have been used for a long time, and they are a more biocompatible alternative compared with synthetic adhesives. They offer advantages such as ease of application, reduction in surgery time, improved quality and strength of the seal, and effective sealing. Also, bioadhesives are being exploited in different fields like controlled and site-specific drug delivery systems, and in tissue engineering and regeneration. There are various marketed protein-based glues that are available in different forms. Thus, all in all, it is a patient compliant system, thereby increasing its recent popularity. This article provides insight into different types and sources of protein-based bioadhesives, their history of use, mechanism of adhesion. and various products that have been approved by the regulatory authorities for clinical use. It also includes information regarding the products in clinical trials and potential applications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The measurement of immunoglobulins is important in foals, as individuals with evidence of failure of passive transfer are at increased risk of infection and death during the first month of life. Objectives To identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal's IgG concentration as applied in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalised foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. Study design Prospective study including 46 foals <7 days old, divided into 4 groups based on age and health status. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated manually. Significance was set at P<0.05. Methods Several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: serum and plasma total protein, albumin and protein spectrum including gamma globulin concentration (GGC) measured by chemistry analyser, total protein by refractometer, glutaraldehyde coagulation test and a semi-quantitative enzyme immunoassay (SNAP). IBM SPSS Statistics 20A was used. A one-way ANOVA with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for determining significant differences among tests and between groups. Correlations between the turbidimetric immunoassay and the screening tests were calculated using linear regression with a 95% CI. Results Group differences were not found. The most accurate alternative test was the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyser (R 0.83) and GGC (R 0.84) with sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 100% and 95 and 93% respectively. A total serum protein of ≥49?g/l and a GGC of ≥6?g/l corresponded with an IgG concentration of ≥8?g/l. Conclusions According to this study, the most reliable alternative test suitable in a clinical setting for the determination of IgG concentration was measuring total serum protein by a chemistry analyser in combination with serum GGC. Ethical animal research:?The research was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Utrecht University (approval number 2012.II.05.078).

AB  - ABSTRACT Regulation of bone formation is important in the pathogenesis of many conditions such as osteoporosis, fracture healing, and loosening of orthopedic implants. We have recently identified a novel rat cDNA (best5) by differential display PCR that is regulated during osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Expression of best5 mRNA is induced in cultures of osteoblasts by both interferon-α (IFN-α) or IFN-?. Whereas IFN-α induced a rapid, transient induction of best5 expression peaking at 4?6 h poststimulation, IFN- ? elicited a more prolonged induction of best5 expression, which remained elevated 48 h poststimulation. A polyclonal antibody generated to a peptide derived from the best5 coding region recognized a 27 kDa protein on Western blot analysis of osteoblast ly-sates. We localized BEST5 protein in osteoblast progenitor cells and mature osteoblasts in sections of rat tibiae and in sections of bones loaded in vivo to induce adaptive bone formation. Best5 maytherefore be a fundamental intermediate in the response of osteoblasts to stimuli that modulate proliferation/ differentiation, such as interferons or mechanical loading. These findings highlight the close interactions between the immune system and bone cells and may open new therapeutic avenues in modulating bone mass?Grewal, T. S., Genever, P. G., Brabbs, A.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Abstract Aims Biliary tract obstruction is a common clinical lesion. However, the effect of biliary tract obstruction on intestinal secretion is poorly understood. In this study, we made an investigation on intestinal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in an experimental model of murine biliary duct ligation. Methods Murine intestinal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions were examined in vitro in Ussing chambers by pH-stat and short-circuit current (Isc) techniques. The mRNA and protein expressions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the Na+?K+?2Cl? cotransporter (NKCC1) were analysed by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results Basal Cl? secretion and forskolin-stimulated duodenal and jejunal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in mice with common biliary duct ligation were markedly elevated, compared with controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Further experiments showed that basal Cl? secretion and forskolin-stimulated duodenal and jejunal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretions in mice with external bile drainage were also markedly elevated. CFTRinh-172 inhibited forskolin-stimulated HCO3? and Cl? secretions. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CFTR and NKCC1 in the intestinal mucosa with both biliary duct ligation and external bile drainage were markedly higher than those in controls (P < 0.001). Bile acid administration restored the changes in function and expression of CFTR and NKCC1 in the intestinal mucosa. Conclusion Bile deficiency in the intestine up-regulates the expressions of intestinal mucosal CFTR and NKCC1 and enhances intestinal mucosal HCO3? and Cl? secretion capacity, which contributes to the understanding of intestinal physiological function for patients with biliary duct obstruction.

AB  - Background and purpose:? White matter lesions (WMLs) caused by small vessel disease are common in elderly people and contribute to cognitive impairment. There are no established biochemical markers for WMLs. We aimed to study the relation between degree of WMLs rated on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of structural biomarkers associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and subcortical vascular dementia. Methods:? Fifty-three non-demented elderly individuals with WMLs were subjected to lumbar puncture. Degree of WMLs was rated using the Fazekas scale. Volumetric assessment of WMLs was performed. CSF samples were analyzed for the 40 and 42 amino acid fragments of amyloid ?, α- and ?-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein, total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), neurofilament light protein (NFL), sulfatide and CSF/Serum-albumin ratio. Results:? Fifteen subjects had mild, 23 had moderate and 15 had severe degree of WMLs. CSF-NFL levels differed between the groups (P?<?0.001) and correlated with the volume of WMLs (r?=?0.477, P?<?0.001). CSF sulfatide concentration displayed similar changes but less strongly. T-tau, P-tau181 and the different amyloid markers as well as CSF/S-albumin ratio did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions:? The association of increased CSF-NFL levels with increasing severity of WMLs in non-demented subjects suggests that NFL is a marker for axonal damage in response to small vessel disease in the brain. This manifestation may be distinct from or earlier than the neurodegenerative process seen in AD, as reflected by the lack of association between WMLs and AD biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Malnutrition is frequent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, infections, and death. We determined the prevalence of malnutrition by various methods and its clinical importance in patients with cirrhosis. Methods Consecutive patients of cirrhosis from August 2013 to February 2015 were assessed. Nutritional status was assessed by traditional model (mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, serum albumin, creatinine height index, total lymphocyte count), handgrip, and body composition analysis measuring skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. All patients were followed up for 12 months to assess the outcome. Results 247 patients (age 42.10?±?10.14?years, 81% male) were included in the study. Etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol in 53% patients. Prevalence of malnutrition was 59.5% according to traditional model, 66.8% by body composition analysis and 71.4% by handgrip. Nutritional status was poor in alcoholic cirrhotics versus nonalcoholics as assessed by triceps skinfold thickness (9.33?±?2.9 vs 11.64?±?3.5?mm; P?=?0.001), serum albumin (25.1?±?4 vs 28.1?±?4?g/L; P?=?0.001), and body fat mass (7.6?±?3.1 vs 8.7?±?3.3?kg; P?=?0.008). Prevalence of malnutrition was 12/27 (44.5%), 96/131 (73.3%) and 84/89 (94.4%) in Child's class A, B, and C respectively. Complications requiring hospitalization (71.3% vs 38.2%; 0.002) and mortality (41.1% vs 18.2%; P?=?0.001) were more in malnourished patients compared to well nourished. Nutritional assessment parameters significantly correlated with the liver disease severity (P?<?0.05). Conclusions Prevalence of malnutrition is high in patients with cirrhosis. It is associated with increased complications and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory properties of tumors play a pivotal role in tumor progression and inefficacy of therapies. It has been hypothesized that surgical interventions result in an accelerated tumor growth by increasing the level of pro-angiogenic cytokines with subsequent amplification of tumor angiogenesis. To characterize the microvascular properties of secondary bone tumors in vivo and determine the impact of minor surgery on the microcirculation, we performed intravital microscopy over 25 days using a xenograft model of breast cancer tumor growth (MCF-7) in bone. After engraftment of tumors the mice were treated with a mastectomy versus no surgery. Tumor growth was accompanied by angiogenic sprouting and decreased vascular diameters while blood flow rate and tumor perfusion remained constant. Mastectomy initially led to a significant reduction of functional vascular density, increased vascular diameter, and decreased blood flow velocities. However, neither tumor growth nor tissue perfusion was different between the groups. The presented study corroborates the assumption that tumor microcirculation in bone exhibits similar time-dependent alterations compared to soft tissue tumors. A minor surgical intervention did not change tumor growth kinetics however microcirculatory properties were altered. Whether major surgery has an impact on tumor growth in bone should be clarified in further studies. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background In preclinical studies with cynomolgus macaques, it is common to have one or more females presenting with menses. Published literature indicates that the blood lost during menses causes decreases in red blood cell mass variables (RBC, HGB, and HCT), which would be a confounding factor in the interpretation of drug-related effects on clinical pathology data, but no scientific data have been published to support this claim. Objectives This investigation was conducted to determine if the amount of blood lost during menses in cynomolgus macaques has an effect on routine hematology and serum chemistry variables. Methods Ten female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), 5 to 6.5 years old, were observed daily during approximately 3 months (97 days) for the presence of menses. Hematology and serum chemistry variables were evaluated twice weekly. Results The results indicated that menstruation affects the erythrogram including RBC, HGB, HCT, MCHC, MCV, reticulocyte count, RDW, the leukogram including neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and chemistry variables, including GGT activity, and the concentrations of total proteins, albumin, globulins, and calcium. The magnitude of the effect of menstruation on susceptible variables is dependent on the duration of the menstrual phase. Macaques with menstrual phases lasting ≥ 7 days are more likely to develop changes in variables related to chronic blood loss. Conclusions In preclinical toxicology studies with cynomolgus macaques, interpretation of changes in several commonly evaluated hematology and serum chemistry variables requires adequate clinical observation and documentation concerning presence and duration of menses. There is a concern that macaques with long menstrual cycles can develop iron deficiency anemia due to chronic menstrual blood loss.

AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.
