AB  - Abstract In this study, a ceramic-coated nanofibrous scaffold has been fabricated to biomimic the microstructure of natural extracellular matrix and the stiffening inorganic compartment of bone. Poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibers were electrospun and exposed to oxygen plasma to induce hydrophilicity and promote ceramic adsorption. Hardystonite (HS), which possesses superior osteoinduction potential over hydroxyapatite, was coated on plasma-treated PLLA nanofibers by drenching the nanofibers in HS suspension. Pure and composite PLLA-based scaffolds were characterized in terms of physical and biological properties. In vitro cultivation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) on the scaffolds displayed that the composite scaffold is able to further support cell attachment and proliferation. In case of osteogenic differentiation of AMSCs, HS coating significantly increased the synthesis and activity of alkaline phosphate over 21 days period. In addition, the composite scaffold showed improved mineralization. The expression level of osteonectin and osteocalcin genes was significantly enhanced by HS coating of nanofibers. The biological improvement of PLLA nanofibrous matrix in the presence of HS nanoparticles could either be attributed to the release and stimulatory effect of constituent ions of HS or to the modification of chemico-physical properties of the resultant ceramic by silicon and zinc present in HS.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Multivisceral resection (MVR) is potentially curative for selected gastric cancer patients, supposedly at the cost of increased complications. However, current data comparing MVR to standard gastrectomy (SG) is lacking. Objectives Compare complications and survival after MVR and SG. Methods In a retrospective cohort of 1015 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 58 underwent MVR and 466 SG. Groups were compared concerning their characteristics, complications, and survival. Results One hundred seventy-six patients had postoperative complications. Major complications were more frequent after MVR (P?=?.002). Surgical mortality was 8.6% and 4.9% for MVR and SG (P?=?.221). Older age, higher morbidities, and MVR were independent risk factors for major complications. The odds ratio for major complications was 5.89 for MVR with one or two organs and 38.01 for MVR with three or more organs. The pancreas was the most commonly removed organ and pT4b disease were confirmed in 34 (58.6%) of the MVR cases. Disease-free survival (DFS) was lower in MVR patients (51% vs 77.8%; P?<?.001), being worse according to the number of organs resected. In pN+ patients, DFS was worse after MVR. DFS was equivalent to pT4b and non-pT4b in the MVR group. Conclusions Increased morbidity and lower survival are expected for gastric cancer patients undergoing MVR.

AB  - Abstract More than a decade ago our groups pioneered the analysis of serum proteins of laboratory animals with up-to-date proteomic techniques. We were, and still are, convinced that conforming animal procedures to the minimally invasive approaches typical of clinical biochemistry focuses attention on the actual conditions under which any finding arrived at on animal models of disease may eventually be applied to human patients for screening/diagnosis. We are also convinced that, besides the proteins present in trace level as a result of tissue leakage during disorders affecting specific peripheral organs, changes in the concentration of some of the major serum proteins as part of an acute-phase response may be taken as biological end-points during a number of experimental procedures. When reviewing literature data about proteomic investigations on plasma or serum of mice, we realized that not much work has been done in the direction we favor. In addition, we noticed that sometimes information about serum proteome has been coarsely treated and in a few cases even misunderstood/misused. In the following, we present current findings on serum/plasma proteome of the laboratory mouse not only under control conditions and during an experimentally induced acute-phase reaction, but also in a number of models of disease, mainly related to cancer and to metabolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pleural infection is a condition commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the most recent data regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, and the management of pleural infection. Data source Medline was searched for articles related to pleural infection using the terms ?pleural infection,? ?empyema,? and ?parapneumonic.? The search was limited to the years 1997-2017. Only human studies and reports in English were included. Results A rise in the incidence of pleural infection is seen worldwide. Despite the improvement in healthcare practices, the mortality from pleural infection remains high. The role of oral microflora in the etiology of pleural infection is firmly established. A concise review of the recent insights on the pathogenesis of pleural infections is presented. A particular focus is made on the role of tPA, DNAse and similar substances and their interaction with inflammatory cells and how this affects the pathogenesis and treatment of pleural infection. Conclusion Pleural infection is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as a considerable economic burden. The role of medical management is expanding thanks to the widespread use of newer treatments.
