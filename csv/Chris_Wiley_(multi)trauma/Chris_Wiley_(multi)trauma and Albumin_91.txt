AB  - Abstract HZ/su is an investigational recombinant subunit vaccine for the prevention of shingles, a disease resulting from the reactivation of varicella zoster virus. The vaccine is composed of recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE), and liposome-based Adjuvant System AS01. To evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine, three studies were performed in rabbits. In the first two studies, rabbits received a single intramuscular (IM; study 1) or subcutaneous (SC; study 2) dose of gE/AS01, AS01 alone (in study 2 only) or saline, and the local tolerance was evaluated up to 3?days after administration. Under these conditions, only local inflammatory reactions at the injection sites were detected by microscopic evaluation. In the third study, gE/AS01, AS01 alone or saline, were injected SC or IM on four occasions at 2?week intervals. General health status, local tolerance, ophthalmology, haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were performed after termination of the study. The only treatment-related changes included a transient increase in neutrophils, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels and microscopic signs of inflammation at the injection sites, which are expected observations related to the elicited inflammatory reaction. The SC and IM routes of administration produced similar systemic effects. However, microscopic findings at the injection sites differed. One month after the last injection, recovery was complete in all groups. In conclusion, the single and repeated SC and IM administration of the gE/AS01 vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and support the clinical development of the vaccine.

AB  - Summary Heterogeneity of dendritic cells (DC) is evident in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and determined, in part, by incompletely understood local environmental factors. Bacterial signalling is likely to be a dominant influence on precursor cells when recruited to the mucosa. We assessed the influence of commensal bacteria on DC differentiation and function. Murine bone marrow progenitors were exposed to Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium breve or Bifidobacterium infantis. Differences in cell surface phenotype and function were assessed. Myeloid differentiation factor 88?/? (MyD88) cells were used to determine the influence of Toll-like receptor signalling. While bacterial strains varied in impact, there was a consistent dose-dependent inhibition of DC differentiation with a shift toward a Gr-1+?CD11b+ monocyte-like phenotype. A single bacterium on a per cell basis (1?:?1) was sufficient to alter cell phenotype. The effect was only evident in early precursors. Enhanced interleukin-10 production correlated with increased Forkhead box P3 expression and reduced T-cell proliferation. The bacterial effect on DC differentiation was found to be MyD88-dependent. Signalling by enteric commensals through pattern recognition receptors on precursor cells alters DC differentiation and results in cells that are phenotypically monocyte-like and functionally suppressive. This may account for some of the features of mucosal immune tolerance to the microbiota.

AB  - Abstract The inherent plasticity and resiliency of fibroblasts make this cell type a conventional tool for basic research. But where do they come from, are all fibroblasts the same, and how do they function in disease? The first fibroblast lineages in mammalian development emerge from the ooze of primary mesenchyme during gastrulation. They are cells that efficiently create and negotiate the extracellular matrix of the mesoderm in order to migrate and meet their developmental fate. Mature fibroblasts in epithelial tissues live in the interstitial spaces between basement membranes that spatially delimit complex organ structures. While the function of resident fibroblasts in healthy tissues is largely conjecture, the accumulation of fibroblasts in pathologic lesions offers insight into biologic mechanisms that control their function; fibroblasts are poised to coordinate fibrogenesis in tissue injury, neoplasia, and aging. Here, we examine the developmental origin and plasticity of fibroblasts, their molecular and functional definitions, the epigenetic control underlying their identity and activation, and the evolution of their immune regulatory functions. These topics are reviewed through the lens of fate mapping using genetically engineered mouse models and from the perspective of single-cell RNA sequencing. Recent observations suggest dynamic and heterogeneous functions for fibroblasts that underscore their complex molecular signatures and utility in injured tissues.

AB  - Background The incidence of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection has increased in recent decades because of widespread use of immunosuppressive therapy and better detection methods. The histopathology of cutaneous NTM infection is not pathognomic and the organisms are slow and difficult to culture, making diagnosis challenging. Methods We reviewed the clinical and histopathological features of 13 cases of cutaneous NTM infection, and performed panmycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the paraffin blocks. Results The immunocompetent patients presented with localized lesions on the extremities, whereas the immunocompromised patients presented with disseminated cutaneous lesions. The histopathology in immunocompetent patients was characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, intraepithelial abscesses, transepidermal elimination and dermal granulomatous inflammation accompanied by necrosis and suppuration. The immunocompromised patients showed suppurative inflammation with little granuloma formation and numerous acid-fast bacilli. Paraffin block PCR was positive in 4 of 13 cases (31%), whereas culture was positive in 11 of 13 cases (85%). Conclusion The aforementioned histological features should help in diagnosing cutaneous NTM infection when combined with clinical and microbiological correlation. In our study, we did not find paraffin block PCR to be superior to conventional culture in detecting cutaneous NTM infection.
