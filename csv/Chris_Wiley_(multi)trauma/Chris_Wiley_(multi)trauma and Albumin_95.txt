AB  - Loss of muscle mass and function, or sarcopenia, is a common feature of cirrhosis and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in this population. Sarcopenia is a main indicator of adverse outcomes in this population, including poor quality of life, hepatic decompensation, mortality in patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation (LT), longer hospital and intensive care unit stay, higher incidence of infection following LT, and higher overall health care cost. Although it is clear that muscle mass is an important predictor of LT outcomes, many questions remain, including the best modality for assessing muscle mass, the optimal cut-off values for sarcopenia, the ideal timing and frequency of muscle mass assessment, and how to best incorporate the concept of sarcopenia into clinical decision making. For these reasons, we assembled a group of experts to form the North American Working Group on Sarcopenia in Liver Transplantation to use evidence from the medical literature to address these outstanding questions regarding sarcopenia in LT. We believe sarcopenia assessment should be considered in all patients with cirrhosis evaluated for liver transplantation. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) assessed by computed tomography constitutes the best-studied technique for assessing sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Cut-off values for sarcopenia, defined as SMI < 50 cm2/m2 in male and < 39 cm2/m2 in female patients, constitute the validated definition for sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Conclusion: The management of sarcopenia requires a multipronged approach including nutrition, exercise, and additional pharmacological therapy as deemed necessary. Future studies should evaluate whether recovery of sarcopenia with nutritional management in combination with an exercise program is sustainable as well as how improvement in muscle mass might be associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Malnutrition and weight loss negatively affect outcomes in surgical cancer patients. Decades of research have sought to identify the most appropriate use of nutrition support in these patients. National and international guidelines help to direct clinicians? use of nutrition support in surgical patients, but a number of specific issues concerning the use of nutrition support continue to evolve. This review focuses on 5 key issues related to perioperative nutrition support in cancer patients: (1) Which perioperative cancer patients should receive nutrition support? (2) How can the nutrition status and requirements of these patients be optimally assessed? (3) What is the optimal route of administration (parenteral nutrition vs enteral nutrition) and composition of nutrition support in this setting? (4) When should feedings be initiated? (5) What is the role of glycemic control in these patients?

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium to evaluate oxidative stress as a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of degenerative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were used to generate the standard rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium. This was accomplished by daily air injections (20 cc) subdermally through the dorsal skin. Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron (components of the Fenton reaction which generate free radicals) were introduced into the pouches of the 4-, 7-, and 14-day groups to generate oxidative stress. Control rats were injected with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. Either N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a powerful free radical scavenger, or ibuprofen were simultaneously injected with the Fenton reagents into the pouches of the 14-day treatment groups to modulate free radical-mediated protein damage to the synovium. Animals were euthanized at appropriate experimental intervals and biopsies obtained from specimens to analyze: (1) proteins' amino acid modification (carbonyl group formation), (2) protein hydrophobicity, (3) detection of low molecular weight protein degradation products, and (4) histological and gross anatomical observations. Results: Free radicals introduced into the rat air pouch interacted with synovial tissues causing oxidation and breakdown of proteins. Clinical evidence of adhesion formation consistent with features found in osteoarthritis of the TMJ developed. The groups subjected to oxidative stress experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and low molecular weight protein fragments. These groups also showed significant (p < 0.05) hydrophobicity changes consistent with free radical attack. Control synovial tissues were statistically undamaged. The 14-day NAC and ibuprofen treatment groups experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and hydrophobicity. Histological and gross observations in free radical damaged synovium exhibited features consistent with known arthoscopic and arthrocentesis findings in diseased TMJs. Conclusions: This study suggests that the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium develops clinical evidence of adhesions and biochemical signs of protein modification when subjected to free radical attack. NAC and ibuprofen prevented carbonyl formation as well as hydrophobicity changes indicative of oxidative stress damage in facsimile synovium. These findings are consistent with features of degenerative human TMJ disease. Future direction may be taken from this study to postulate new analysis techniques and treatment modalities for patients with degenerative TMJ disease.

AB  - Abstract There are increasing reports of using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat advanced liver disease. We consider several critical issues that underlie this approach. For example, are there multipotent stem cell populations in human adult bone marrow? Can they develop into liver cells or supporting cell types? What are stromal stem/progenitor cells, and can they promote tissue repair without replacing hepatocytes? Does reversal of end-stage liver disease require new hepatocytes, a new liver microenvironment, both, neither or something else? Although many of these questions are unanswered, we consider the conceptual and experimental bases underlying these issues and critically analyze results of clinical trials of stem cell therapy of end-stage liver disease.
