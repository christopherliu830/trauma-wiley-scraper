AB  - Abstract There are increasing reports of using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat advanced liver disease. We consider several critical issues that underlie this approach. For example, are there multipotent stem cell populations in human adult bone marrow? Can they develop into liver cells or supporting cell types? What are stromal stem/progenitor cells, and can they promote tissue repair without replacing hepatocytes? Does reversal of end-stage liver disease require new hepatocytes, a new liver microenvironment, both, neither or something else? Although many of these questions are unanswered, we consider the conceptual and experimental bases underlying these issues and critically analyze results of clinical trials of stem cell therapy of end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Abstract The records of 65 patients with closed liver injuries were studied in order to determine which of 19 variables might be important in predicting the outcome. The statistical technique of multiple regression analysis was used. The presence of hypotension and of head injury were the most important prognostic factors; on the other hand, the number of associated injuries was not a significant factor. The major problem was the patient with the isolated severe liver injury.

AB  - Summary Patients presenting for emergency surgery represent a category at high risk of complications, with substantial morbidity and mortality, whose management may be extremely challenging. In this first of two articles we consider the identification and evaluation of high risk emergency patients, the provision of critical care support, the management of sepsis, common postoperative complications and in-theatre death.

AB  - Abstract Aim To clarify the correlation between malnutrition, muscle mass and oral status, and swallowing function recovery in stroke patients receiving enteral nutrition. Methods Patients with stroke and dysphagia receiving any amount of enteral nutrition in rehabilitation wards from 2012 to 2016 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. On admission, body composition by bioimpedance analysis, malnutrition confirmed by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism criteria, oral status, functional independence measure and demographic data were collected. Characteristics were compared between ?oral intake alone? and ?artificial nutrition? groups based on the discharge status. Kaplan-Meier methods and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine explanatory factors for the probability of full oral intake. Results Among 174 patients, 113 were analysed (55 women; median age, 77?years). Overall, 61% and 39% were classified as ?oral intake alone? and ?artificial nutrition,? respectively. Days from onset to admission to rehabilitation wards and motor Functional Independence Measure were higher in the ?oral intake alone? group. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with lower muscle mass exhibited lower probability of full oral intake (P = .009). The Cox proportional hazards model suggested that lower muscle mass (hazard ratio, 0.493; 95% CI, 0.286-0.850) and poor oral hygiene (hazard ratio, 0.573; 95% CI, 0.333-0.987) were independently correlated with ?oral intake alone? status. Malnutrition and other oral status are not related to achieving full oral intake. Conclusions Skeletal muscle mass and oral hygiene are independently correlated with full oral intake among stroke patients receiving enteral nutrition during the rehabilitation phase.

AB  - Introduction Previous guidelines recommend that FXI:C levels should be used to monitor FXI replacement in factor XI (FXI) deficiency. However, FXI:C levels do not correlate with bleeding tendency in this disorder and may not be the optimal test by which to monitor and determine further treatment in the postoperative period. Aim To assess whether the thrombin generation assay (TGA) and rotational thromboelastometry can be used to monitor FXI replacement peri-operatively in FXI deficiency and to determine if changes in FXI:C levels correlate with changes in thrombin generation and clot formation parameters following treatment with solvent-detergent fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP). Methods The TGA and rotational thromboelastometry were used to measure thrombin generation and clot formation in 11 adults with FXI deficiency who were treated with either SD-FFP (n = 8) or FXI concentrate (n = 3) as prophylaxis peri-operatively. Blood samples were taken pre- and 30 min post-treatment. Results Global haemostasis assays can be used to measure the effect of FXI replacement with SD-FFP or FXI concentrate in FXI deficiency. Both treatment types improved thrombin generation and clot formation. However, the remaining response to treatment at 24 h post SD-FFP was variable and changes in FXI:C levels were not predictive of changes in thrombin generation/thromboelastometry parameters after treatment with SD-FFP. Conclusion Global haemostasis assays may provide a more reliable means of monitoring SD-FFP treatment with the potential to prevent individuals receiving unnecessary treatment, however, their clinical use in decision making needs to be tested in a larger prospective study.
