AB  - Abstract: The splenic marginal zone of adult humans contains B cells, of which most express CD27, an antigen only recently identified as a marker for somatically mutated memory B cells. We investigated whether and to which extent the developing marginal zone in infants and children is populated by either memory (CD27+) or naive (CD27?) B cells. Frozen sections of 32 spleens of infants and children ranging in age from 6 days to 15 years and 6 adult spleens were investigated. The expression of CD27 in combination with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD21, IgM, IgD and ASM-1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The marginal zone was already present at 4 months after birth but CD21 expression was observed first after 2 years. CD27-positive marginal zone B cells were observed firstly 2 years after birth and increased in number to adult levels at the age of 5 years. We demonstrated that the MZ of infants and young children is populated by naive B cells, which are replaced by memory B cells in a time frame of 2 to 5 years. Before the age of 2 years, although present, memory B cells appear to be unable to colonize the marginal zone. Because of the absence of memory B cells in the marginal zone, the immune system of a child is not capable to initiate a rapid secondary humoral immune response comparable to the adult immune response.

AB  - The prognosis of chronic toxic encephalopathy in former house painters was examined in a prospective study with a two-year observation period. Twenty-six patients, who at the initial examination had cerebral atrophy and/or intellectual impairment, were selected for the follow-up study. No competitive etiological factors (including alcohol) to the encephalopathy were suspected. During the two-year follow-up interval these patients were not professionally exposed to organic solvents. At the follow-up examination neurological, biochemical, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological parameters were reassessed and compared to the original findings. Generally the condition was unchanged. Slight improvements with regard to headache and dizziness were reported by some. However, the neurological status, the neuropsychological impairment, and the cerebral atrophy, did not change significantly. In three patients further deterioration was observed. It is argued that our patients suffered from a brain disorder different from presenile dementia of the Pick-Alzheimer type. Other alternative etiological entities were also excluded. Our findings indicate that long-term exposure to organic solvents may lead to a chronic brain syndrome. Once intellectual impairment and/or cerebral atrophy has developed, reversibility is not observed. Nor is further progression to be expected if exposure is stopped. Occupational exposure to organic solvents should be maximally restricted as it represents a risk of inducing invalidating brain syndromes.

AB  - A surge in therapeutic clinical trials over recent years is paving the way for transformative treatment options for patients with hemophilia. The introduction of recombinant factor concentrates in the early 1990s facilitated the use of prophylactic replacement as standard care for hemophilia rather than on-demand treatment. This has revolutionized health outcomes for hemophilia patients, enabling participation in physical activities and reducing debilitating, chronic joint damage. Challenges of prophylactic factor infusion include the frequency of infusions needed to maintain factor levels greater than 1%, patient adherence, reliable intravenous access, and development of neutralizing alloantibodies (?inhibitors?). Novel therapeutics seek to improve upon current factor concentrates by several different mechanisms: (1) extending the half-life of circulating exogenous factor protein, (2) replacing the gene necessary for production of endogenous factor protein, (3) employing bispecific antibody technology to mimic the coagulation function of factor VIII, (4) disrupting anticoagulant proteins, such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) or antithrombin (AT3) with antibodies, aptamers, or RNA interference technology. Emerging treatment options may reduce the frequency of (extended half-life products) or eliminate (gene therapy) the need for scheduled factor concentrate infusions, or provide a subcutaneous administration option (bispecific antibody, AT3, and TFPI targeting therapies). In addition, the nonfactor replacement strategies provide a promising treatment option for patients with inhibitors, presently the greatest unmet medical need in hemophilia. This review highlights current and recently completed clinical trials that are driving a paradigm shift in our approach to hemophilia care for patients with and without inhibitors. Am. J.

AB  - Abstract Background: Although liver resection has become an established procedure in western countries and South-east Asia it is still not performed frequently in most centres in India. In the last 10 years newly created specialized units have been performing more liver resections but no major series have been reported. Patients and methods: We analysed the results of 241 hepatic resections in the Gyan Burman Liver Unit, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital to compare our results with those published from established centres and to identify the factors relating to morbidity and mortality. To examine the effect of a greater experience with the procedure we compared the outcome of our operations from 1996?2000 (first period) and those from 2001?2005 (second period). Results: The overall mortality and morbidity rates were 6.6% and 44.8%, respectively, which are comparable with those of most recently published Western series. Life-threatening complications occurred in 12.4% patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of comorbid conditions, intraoperative blood transfusions of >3 units, hepatocellular carcinoma with underlying cirrhosis and gall bladder carcinoma with jaundice were the independent risk factors for morbidity, whereas the presence of comorbid illness and underlying liver cirrhosis were the risk factors for mortality. During the second period there was an increase in the number of operations performed (66 vs 175; first vs second period), but the mortality rates remained essentially unchanged (6.1% vs 6.8%). Discussion: Hepatic resections can be performed safely in India with results comparable to those achieved in the West. Increasing experience did not reduce overall mortality. Perhaps more careful patient selection and better perioperative management of comorbid illnesses may reduce the morbidity and mortality further.

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Objectives The potential influence of infections and immunological changes on the aetiology and pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD) has been discussed. Our aim was to detect intrathecal specific antibody synthesis against the neurotropic infectious agents that have previously been linked to BD. Methods Paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 40 patients with BD were analysed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the concentration of antibodies against the following neurotropic infectious pathogens: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein?Barr virus (EBV). The specific antibody index (AI) was calculated, and an AI > 1.4 was considered to be evidence of intrathecal specific antibody synthesis. Twenty-six patients with pseudotumour cerebri served as controls. Results Eight out of 40 patients with BD displayed specific intrathecal antibody synthesis against at least one of the tested neurotropic agents compared to only one patient in the control group (p = 0.061, not significant). Of these eight patients with BD, no significant prevalence of any particular neurotropic pathogen was evident. Five out of 40 patients with BD showed oligoclonal bands in the CSF, suggestive of a chronic immune reaction in the central nervous system (CNS). Conclusions We found evidence for increased production of antibody in the CSF of individuals with BD. However, the trend for polyspecific intrathecal antibody synthesis, as well as the presence of oligoclonal bands, might indicate activation of the intrathecal humoral immune system in a subgroup of patients with BD, as it is known to be associated with autoimmune disorders of the CNS.
