AB  - Abstract Background:? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Vic., Australia has noticeably increased over the 12?month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centres. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24?month period and analyses the management modalities used. Methods:? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of 20 March 2004 until 20 March 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed and findings at operation. Results:? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24?month period between 20 March 2004 and 20 March 2006. The second 12?month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion:? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12?months. Although management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains controversial because the risk for uncontrolled postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) must be balanced against the potential morbidity associated with prolonged and possibly unnecessary drainage. This study investigated the utility of the level of serum amylase on the night of surgery [postoperative day (PoD) 0 serum amylase] to predict POPF. Methods A total of 185 patients who underwent PD were studied. Occurrences of POPF were graded using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase associated with clinically significant POPF (ISGPF Grades B and C) in a test cohort (n = 45). The accuracy of this threshold value was then tested in a validation cohort (n = 140). Results Overall, 43 (23.2%) patients developed clinically significant POPF. The threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase for the identification of clinically significant POPF was ≥130?IU/l (P = 0.003). Serum amylase of <130?IU/l had a negative predictive value of 88.8% for clinically significant POPF (P < 0.001). Serum amylase of ≥130?IU/l on PoD?0 and a soft pancreatic parenchyma were independent risk factors for clinically significant POPF. Conclusions Postoperative day 0 serum amylase of <130?IU/l allows for the early and accurate categorization of patients at least risk for clinically significant POPF and may identify patients suitable for early drain removal.

AB  - Abstract Background Pancreatic fistula is a serious complication of total gastrectomy with splenectomy. The amylase content of drainage fluid was examined and its usefulness for predicting pancreatic complications after gastrectomy was evaluated. Methods The amylase concentration of the fluid in the peripancreatic drain was determined prospectively in 102 patients who underwent total gastrectomy in 1995. Results Pancreatic fistula developed in 13 patients, whose drainage fluid amylase levels on the first postoperative morning were significantly higher than those of patients without fistula formation. Among 27 patients with amylase levels exceeding 4000 units, eight later developed pancreatic fistula, while only five (7 per cent) of 68 with amylase levels below 4000 units did so. All complications were successfully managed and there were no deaths. Conclusion Determination of drainage fluid amylase levels is a simple and useful method for the prediction of pancreatic fistula formation and may help to plan appropriate management.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic trauma is uncommon, but carries high morbidity and mortality rates, especially when diagnosis is delayed or inappropriate surgery is attempted. Although the retroperitoneal position of the pancreas confers it some immunity to injury, the force required to do so often results in severe associated injuries to other organs, which may be life threatening. Diagnosis may be difficult and surgery can be a considerable technical challenge. Methods: All patients with pancreatic trauma who attended one of three Melbourne teaching hospitals from 1977 to 1998 were identified. Injuries were graded and the method of diagnosis and treatment studied. The incidence and causation of postoperative morbidity and mortality was identified. Results: Thirty-eight patients (26 men and 12 women) were studied. Blunt trauma was responsible in 30 patients, stab wounds in five, gunshot wounds in two and iatrogenic injury in one. Injuries to other organs occurred in 30 patients. Surgical procedures were undertaken in 34 patients, resulting in the death of five and complications in 25. Conclusion: Complications and death are related to the associated injuries, as much as to the pancreatic injury itself. In this study, we review the experience of the management of pancreatic trauma in three large teaching hospitals in Melbourne over a 21-year period, and suggest a strategy for dealing with these difficult patients. Adherence to the basic concepts of control of bleeding from associated vascular injury, minimization of contamination, accurate pancreatic assessment, judicious resection and adequate drainage can diminish the risk. By approaching the problem in a systematic way and adopting a generally conservative management plan, complications and deaths can be minimized in these complex cases.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to determine if hospital admission of children with blunt abdominal trauma for observation of possible intraabdominal injury (IAI) is necessary after a normal abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Methods:? The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of children less than 18?years of age with blunt abdominal trauma who underwent an abdominal CT scan in the ED. Abdominal CT scans were obtained with intravenous contrast but no oral contrast. The decision to hospitalize the patient was made by the attending emergency physician (EP) with the trauma or pediatric surgery teams. An abnormal abdominal CT scan was defined by the presence of any visualized IAI or findings suggestive of possible IAI (e.g., intraperitoneal fluid without solid organ injury). Patients were followed to determine if IAI was later diagnosed and the need for acute therapeutic intervention if IAI was present. Results:? A total of 1,295 patients underwent abdominal CT, and 1,085 (84%) patients had normal abdominal CT scans in the ED and make up the study population. Seven-hundred thirty-seven (68%) were hospitalized, and 348 were discharged to home. None of the 348 patients discharged home and 2 of the 737 hospitalized patients were identified with an IAI after a normal initial abdominal CT. The IAIs in patients with normal initial CT scans included a 10-year-old with a mesenteric hematoma and serosal tear at laparotomy and a 10-year-old with a perinephric hematoma on repeat CT. Neither underwent specific therapy. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a normal abdominal CT scan for IAI was 99.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?99.3% to 100%). Conclusions:? Children with blunt abdominal trauma and a normal abdominal CT scan in the ED are at very low risk of having a subsequently diagnosed IAI and are very unlikely to require a therapeutic intervention. Hospitalization of children for evaluation of possible undiagnosed IAI after a normal abdominal CT scan has a low yield and is generally unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Introduction The horse has evolved to survive on a low-energy, high-fibre diet. The addition of starch, in the form of cereals, to the diet of racehorses to satisfy the high energy demands of extreme exercise has been identified as a risk factor for intestinal dysfunction. In this study we use 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to characterize the gut microbiome of 8 Thoroughbred (Tb) racehorses and study the response to dietary supplementation. Methods Faecal samples were collected from 8 Tb racehorses in training. A second sample was collected from all horses six weeks after commencement of twice daily dietary supplementation with an amylase-rich malt extract, designed to enhance pre-caecal digestion. Amplicons for the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA gene were multiplexed and sequenced on the 454 resulting in ?25,000 reads per sample. Differences in bacterial community structure were detected by linear discriminant analysis. Results Communities were composed of an equal balance between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with a ?5% contribution from other bacterial phyla. The number of observed operational taxonomic units sharing ≥97% nucleotide sequence in our racehorse population was 6000?8000. Horses showed no significant change in the number of OTUs observed after diet supplementation, but significant changes in the relative abundance of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes families were observed. Conclusions We demonstrated a highly diverse and complex faecal microbial community in Tb racehorses in the UK. Inter-horse variability is low amongst horses in the same training yard. We identified significant shifts in community profile following dietary supplementation and speculate that these may enhance intestinal health. Ethical Animal Research This study was conducted under the University of Liverpool research ethics approval: RETH000363. The informed consent of the trainer was obtained and all samples were obtained non-invasively. Sources of funding:?private donation. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract? Chylothorax is rare following blunt thoracic trauma; its diagnosis is usually delayed until the puncture or drainage of posttraumatic pleural effusion and its cause is not clear. Mostly, it is attributed to injury or overstretching of major thoracic duct by fractures or other injury of neighboring thoracic spine. We describe of two cases, one unilateral and one bilateral, of chylothorax, both after blunt thoracic trauma. In the first case, there were associated fractures of lower thoracic vertebrae, whereas in the other there was no obvious cause, except striking osteophytic degeneration alongside the thoracic spine. Both cases were successfully treated after 16 and 23 days, respectively, with drainage, starvation, reexpansion of the lung(-s), and total parenteral nutrition. We believe that with the ?triad of RST? (?reexpansion, starvation diet, TPN?), conservative treatment will be successful in the majority of cases.

AB  - Purpose: All cardiothoracic consultations initiated at Accident and Emergency Department for period February 1995 to November 2000 were reviewed. Methods: Information was extracted from Trauma Registry of over 1000 cases. Results: 61 consultation was recorded. There were 33 blunt injury and 28 penetrating injury. 21 cases were of ISS 15 or less. Surgery for thoracic injury was performed in 13 cases of blunt injury (40%) and 20 cases of penetrating injury (70%). Majority of surgery was related to chest wall and lung injury. In addition there were 3 major intrathoracic vessel, 6 cardiac, 3 diaphragmatic and 1 major airway injury. 20 deaths were recorded with 4 deaths at A&E department. Mortality is related to severity of ISS and age >70. 4 ER-thoracotomy was performed with 3 deaths. There were related to heart and aorta injury with average ISS≥50. Conclusion: 1. Major cardiothoracic trauma is not common. 2. When present, it is associated with severe injury. 3. The outcome is related to severity of ISS and old age.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract Background This single-centre study evaluated the outcome of a pancreatoduodenectomy for Grade 5 injuries of the pancreas and duodenum. Methods Prospectively recorded data of patients who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy for trauma at a Level I Trauma Centre during a 22-year period were analysed. Results Nineteen (17 men and 2 women, median age 28 years, range 14?53 years) out of 426 patients with pancreatic injuries underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (gunshot n = 12, blunt trauma n = 6 and stab wound n = 1). Nine patients had associated inferior vena cava (IVC) or portal vein (PV) injuries. Five patients had initial damage control procedures and underwent a definitive operation at a median of 15?h (range 11?92) later. Twelve had a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) and 7 a standard Whipple. Three patients with APACHE II scores of 15, 18, 18 died post-operatively of multi-organ failure. All 16 survivors had Dindo-Clavien grade I (n = 1), grade II (n = 7), grade IIIa (n = 2), grade IVa (n = 6) post-operative complications. Factors complicating surgery were shock on admission, number of associated injuries, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gross bowel oedema and traumatic pancreatitis. Conclusions A pancreatoduodenectomy is a life-saving procedure in a small cohort of stable patients with non-reconstructable pancreatic head injuries. Damage control before a pancreatoduodenectomy will salvage a proportion of the most severely injured patients who have multiple injuries.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate a deep oropharyngeal suction intervention (NO-ASPIRATE) in intubated patients on microaspiration, ventilator-associated events and clinical outcomes. Design Prospective, two-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Methods The study was conducted between 2014 - 2017 in 513 participants enroled within 24 hr of intubation and randomized into NO-ASPIRATE or usual care groups. Standard oral care was provided to all participants every 4 hr and deep oropharyngeal suctioning was added to the NO-ASPIRATE group. Oral and tracheal specimens were obtained to quantify α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker. Results Data were analysed for 410 study completers enrolled at least 36 hr: NO-ASPIRATE (N = 206) and usual care (N = 204). Percent of tracheal specimens positive for α-amylase, mean tracheal α-amylase levels over time and ventilator-associated events were not different between groups. The NO-ASPIRATE group had a shorter hospital length of stay and a subgroup with moderate aspiration at baseline had significantly lower α-amylase levels across time. Conclusion Hospital length of stay was shorter in the NO-ASPIRATE group and a subgroup of intervention participants had lower α-amylase across time. Delivery of standardized oral care to all participants may have been an intervention itself and possibly associated with the lack of significant findings for most outcomes. Impact This trial compared usual care to oral care with a deep suctioning intervention on microaspiration and ventilator-associated events, as this has not been systematically studied. Further research on the usefulness of α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker and the role of oral suctioning, especially for certain populations, is indicated. Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02284178.
