AB  - Abstract Understanding co-activation patterns of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) during early adolescence may illuminate risk for development of internalizing and externalizing problems. The present study advances empirical work on the topic by examining SAM-HPA co-activation during both the reactivity and recovery phases of the stress response following acute stress exposure. Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls (N = 149) provided cortisol and alpha-amylase via saliva at seven times throughout a 95-min assessment in which they were administered the modified Trier Social Stress Test. Parents reported on adolescents? life stress, pubertal development, medication use, and externalizing problems. Adolescents reported their own internalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regressions tested both direct and interactive effects of SAM and HPA reactivity and recovery on internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from these analyses showed that whereas SAM and HPA reactivity interacted to predict internalizing symptoms, it was their interaction during the recovery phase that predicted externalizing. Concurrent high SAM and HPA reactivity scores predicted high levels of internalizing and concurrently low SAM and HPA recovery scores predicted high levels of externalizing. Implications of the findings for further study and clinical application are discussed.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether elevated canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (CPLI) concentrations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Methods: Serum CPLI assays were performed on serum stored from cases diagnosed with IBD. Thirty-two dogs with CPLI results within the reference range were designated as the control group and 15 dogs had CPLI above the reference range. Clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasound examination, histopathology on small intestinal biopsies, management of IBD and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: No significant differences were found in clinical activity score (P=0·54), number of antibiotic-responsive disease cases (P=0·480), number of steroid-responsive disease cases (P=0·491), serum amylase activity (P=0·058), serum cobalamin concentration (P=0·61), serum albumin concentration (P=0·052), abdominal ultrasound score (P=0·23) and histopathology scores for IBD (P=0·74) between the two groups. Dogs with increased CPLI concentration were significantly older and had a higher serum lipase activity than dogs with a CPLI concentration within the normal reference range (P=0·001, P=0·001, respectively). Moreover, dogs with increased CPLI concentration responded poorly to steroid treatment (P=0·01) and were significantly more likely to be euthanased at follow-up (P=0·02). Clinical Significance: CPLI should be measured in cases of canine IBD as elevated CPLI was associated with a worse outcome.

AB  - Objectives Following a paediatric burn, parents commonly experience high levels of acute psychological distress, which has been shown to increase child psychological distress as well as child procedural distress. The influence of psychological stress and perceived pain on wound healing has been demonstrated in several laboratory and medical populations. This paper investigates the influence of parental acute psychological distress and procedural behaviour on the child's rate of re-epithelialization, after controlling for child procedural distress. Design A prospective observational study with longitudinal outcome. Methods Eighty-three parents of children 1?6 years old reported acute psychological distress (post-traumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], guilt, pre-procedural fear, general anxiety/depression symptoms) in relation to their child's burn. A researcher observed parent?child behaviour at the first dressing change, and parents and nurses reported child procedural distress (pre-, peak-, and post-procedural pain and fear). These variables, along with demographic and injury information, were tested for predicting time to re-epithelialization. Date of re-epithelialization was determined by the treating consultant. Results Days to re-epithelialization ranged from 3 to 35 days post-injury. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis found wound depth and size significantly accounted for 28% of the variance in time to re-epithelialization. In Block 2, child peak-procedural pain significantly accounted for 6% additional variance. In Block 3, parental PTSS significantly accounted for 5% additional variance. Conclusions Parental PTSS appears to be an important but under-recognized factor that may influence their child's burn re-epithelialization. Further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms contributing to this association. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Psychological stress delays wound healing, and this relationship has been found in paediatric burn populations with procedural pain. Parental psychological stress is often present after a child's burn and is related to the child's procedural coping and distress. What does this study add? Parental post-traumatic stress is related to delayed child burn re-epithelialization. This association is in addition to procedural pain delaying re-epithelialization.

AB  - Summary The transition of care for adolescents and young adults from a pediatric, family-centered model to an adult, patient-centered model marks an important milestone in the lives of patients with chronic disorders managed from a young age. The timing and tempo of transition require special consideration to physical, psychological and social changes occurring during young adulthood. Poor glycemic control is a common finding among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and places these young adults at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, knowledge that should alert clinicians to carefully manage diabetes during concurrent acute illnesses. Other chronic endocrine disorders, such as primary adrenal deficiencies, congenital or autoimmune hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and hypopituitarism may follow a similar model of care. In addition to continued management of existing defects, patients with disorders such as autoimmune polyglandular syndromes will require continued surveillance for manifestations of new endocrinopathies through adulthood. The onset of adrenal insufficiency with adrenoleukodystrophy, x-linked adrenal hypoplasia and triple A syndrome is variable and patients may present in adrenal crisis as the initial manifestation of adrenal insufficiency during an acute illness. Endocrine causes account for a high proportion of cases of secondary hypertension, including acute onset of hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytomas, ganglioneuromas, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperthyroidism. Head trauma is common in young adults associated with risky behaviors and motor vehicle accidents. Patients with traumatic brain injuries are at risk for developing anterior and posterior pituitary defects. This chapter discusses transitional care of diabetes and chronic and evolving endocrine disorders, as well as the management, including emergency care, of endocrine disorders that commonly present in young adulthood.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

Emphasis is placed on suggesting the most appropriate application of each technique that is described. The review is not intended to identify the microscopist's ?cure all? technique for immunocytochemistry but rather to describe what techniques are available and what are their relative merits. Expensive equipment and technically complicated methods are not always necessary to collect robust data. I hope to present a review that will enable its readers to select the most profitable technique (or compromise) available, to reflect both their resources and their ability to address their biological questions with vigour.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Thrombosis of the pancreas after transplantation is the most common cause of relaparotomy and resultant graft loss. There is currently no standard protocol consistently proven to prevent thrombosis following transplantation. Our objective was to determine whether our protocol of post-operative low-dose intravenous (IV) heparin infusion would prevent graft thrombosis without additional complications in our patients. Methods A total of 66 simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplants were performed at our institution from 2004 to 2014. Patients were divided into 2 retrospective cohort groups. Group 1 patients received only acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg/d started on post-operative day 1. Group 2 patients received IV heparin infusion beginning in the recovery room at a rate of 500 IU/h for the first 24 hours, reduced by 100 IU/h every day to stop on day 5, and then received ASA 81 mg/d afterward. Outcome and complication rates were compared between the two groups for 5 years post-transplant. Results We observed a significant reduction in graft thrombosis and graft loss with (0/29) patients in the heparin group vs (7/33) 25.7% from the non-heparin (P<.01) with no differences in complication rates. Conclusions We present a heparin infusion protocol which may help prevent graft thrombosis and graft loss in SPK transplantation.

AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.

AB  - Background: Although hyperamylasemia has been reported in a large proportion of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), its clinical significance as well as the pathogenic mechanism remain poorly understood. Apart from pancreatic cellular injury, impaired renal function or hypercalcemia after CPB was also proposed to play a possible role in the etiology of postoperative hyperamylasemia. The study was designed to investigate whether avoidance of CPB would limit amylase elevation. Methods: Serum levels of amylase and lipase were measured before operation, 24 and 48 hours after surgery in 58 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without the use of CPB over a 10-month period. The choice of procedure was based mainly on the native coronary anatomy and left ventricular function. Postoperative complications as well as the plasma levels of creatinine and calcium were also carefully monitored. Results: Three surgical approaches were used for CABG: CPB (conventional on-pump through median sternotomy, n = 32), OPCAB (off-pump through median sternotomy, n = 14), and MIDCAB (off-pump through left minithoracotomy, n = 12). There was no hospital mortality. No patient had postoperative abdominal complications. Transient hyperamylasemia occurred in 14 patients, 7 in the CPB group (22%), 5 in the OPCAB group (36%), and 2 in the MIDCAB group (17%). The increase in amylase levels was similar among groups. However, no lipase elevation was detected in any patient. There was no clear correlation between hyperamylasemia and an increased creatinine level. Perioperative plasma calcium levels were normal in patients who had hyperamylasemia. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the incidence of hyperamylasemia among patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with or without the use of CPB and irrespective of mode of surgical access. Hence, CPB is not the major factor responsible for hyperamylasemia, as previously believed.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of pancreatitis in patients treated with pegaspargase in our hospital during a 2-year period. Procedure We identified episodes of pancreatitis related to the intramuscular administration of pegaspargase 2,500 IU/m2 for the treatment of childhood hematological malignancies during a 2-year period (May 1996?April 1998). Patients were evaluated clinically and by sequential serum amylase and lipase determinations and radiographic examinations. For comparison, episodes of pancreatitis in patients who only received native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase were examined during the same time period. Results Nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of 50 (18%) patients who received pegaspargase were diagnosed to have pancreatitis. All had prior therapy with native L-asparaginase. These children developed symptoms consisting of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite within a median of 15 days from the onset of pegaspargase administration. Six patients became symptomatic after their initial dose. Seven patients developed severe or unacceptable toxicity (grades 3 and 4), measured by increased amylase (>2 times normal) and lipase levels or radiographic evidence of pancreatic inflammation or pseudocyst. One patient also developed hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. In contrast, only one out of 52 (1.9%) ALL patients who received native E. coli L-asparaginase during the same time period developed pancreatitis (P= 0.007). Conclusion Clinicians should be aware of a possible higher incidence of pancreatitis associated with pegaspargase. Med Pediatr Oncol 34:200?205, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Several factors impact a child's adjustment after a parental divorce; a well-established one is the level of parental conflict during and after a divorce. Research is beginning to investigate the biological mechanisms that may be impacted by childhood trauma in general and parental high conflict specifically. This paper reviews the existing research concerning the relationship between exposure to high parental conflict/trauma and the biological stress response system (the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic nervous system), sleep, and psychological maladjustment. We propose a conceptual model linking biological and psychological responses and discuss suggestions for future research.

AB  - This report describes the first clinical case, in Europe, of a high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in a dog. The aim of this report is to alert the veterinary profession to high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in companion animal patients. Multi-drug resistant strains of this pathogen are the cause of considerable problems in human hospitals and for community healthcare professionals worldwide. The potential for a similar impact within veterinary medicine is discussed.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Estimate the incidence rate and provide basic descriptive epidemiologic characteristics of plunging ranulas in a multi-ethnic population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Methods The study group comprised all Counties Manukau Health (CMH, Manukau City, Auckland, New Zealand) patients presenting to the CMH Department of Otolaryngology with a diagnosis of plunging ranula from January 2001 to December 2013, as recorded in the departmental case register. Non-CMH domicile patients were excluded. South Auckland comprised the base population, as serviced by CMH. The 2006 New Zealand census data was used for population demographics. Results A total of 134 cases of plunging ranula were identified. The overall annual crude incidence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The gender specific incidence rate for males was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5. 3.9) and for females was 2.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6). The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rate was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.0). The age-adjusted incidence was highest among Maori (6.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.9, 8.4), followed by Pacific Island (4.4 per 100,000, 95% CI 3.2, 5.6), Asian (0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.2, 1.2), and European population (0.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8). Conclusion We have quantified for the first time the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for plunging ranula by gender and ethnicity. The results show a likely underlying genetic predisposition for this condition, possibly with a superimposed environmental acquired factor relating to external, minor blunt trauma to the neck.

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Abstract Colloids have been used for many years in resuscitation yet few studies have thoroughly examined their usefulness. Colloids and a combination of crystalloids and colloids continue to be used without any real scientific basis. Scrutiny of review articles, experimental studies, and clinical investigations reveals conflicting and confusing data. There are too many variables to accurately interpret findings, cross species problems with animal studies, different fluids used making comparisons difficult if not impossible, and confounding variables that include: 1 Health status of the patients 2 Severity/type of injury 3 Complications (especially sepsis) 4 Varying grades of shock 5 Variable time scale of administration of fluids 6 Variable volumes administered 7 Differing methods of determining fluid volume depletion 8 Inconsistent monitoring 9 Differing endpoints 10 Different techniques to measure endpoints 11 Comparison of delayed treatment of traumatic shock with blood loss occurring during surgery of questionable validity. One of the areas that has been studied reasonably well is the allergic effects associated with colloid use and more recently the adverse effects associated with the use of dextrose solutions in patients with head injuries. The continued effort to develop satisfactory resuscitation solutions including the recent development of hypertonic saline solutions (usually in combination with a colloid) highlights the uncertainty that exists in relation to the true role of the colloid and crystalloid agents available. Recent studies question the use of fluids to resuscitate patients with penetrating torso injuries. The aim of this paper is to review what is known about the use of colloids and crystalloids in resuscitation and to recommend guidelines as to which fluid should be used in differing clinical situations.

AB  - The care of 40 patients with primary liver cancer with obstructive jaundice treated with liver puncture bile drainage or biliary stent implantation was reported. Treated with the interventional therapy, patients were observed closely to identify symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and pain; diet care was well performed. Bile drainage tube and skin acre were performed carefully. Liver function, bilirubin and other biochemical indicators were monitored; occurrence of bleeding, acute pancreatitis, biliary tract infection, leakage of ascites around drainage tube and other complication were observed with good discharge instruction. After this operation, three rounds of liver had poor function, and hepatic encephalopathy and death occurred during hospitalisation. Seven patients had bloody bile drainage fluid after operation; eight had increased blood amylase; nine had biliary infection and four had leakage of ascites around the drainage tube. After positive treatment and care, the situation was improved with varied degrees of jaundice increase.
