AB  - Introduction The navicular bone (NB) and the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) are common sites of lameness. Greater knowledge of foot mechanics will aid in understanding of the aetiopathogenesis and may provide new opportunities for treatment and prevention. It was hypothesised that changes in the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPj) and movement of the NB and DDFT during the stance phase will lead to changes in the moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj. Methods Internal hoof kinematics were determined using a high-speed fluoroscopy system. Six horses were walked and trotted over a raised platform consisting of four force plates, through the field of view of the fluoroscopy system. The angles of the DIPj and the DDFT around the navicular bone and the moment arm of the DDFT were measured. Changes in these parameters during stance and differences between strides, gaits and horses were assessed using an ANOVA or paired T-test as appropriate (P<0.05). Results The range of motion (ROM, mean?±?SD) during stance of the DIPJ was 28.6?±?4.6° (walk) and 26.5?±?6.3 (trot) with significant differences between gaits, strides and horses (P<0.001). The angle change of the DDFT around the NB was 21.9?±?6.0° in walk and 26.6?±?6.5 in trot. The change in moment arm of the DDFT around the DIPj was 3.7?±?1.3?mm in walk and 4.1?±?2.2?mm in trot. There were no significant differences between the different time points during stance or between gaits. Conclusions High-speed fluoroscopy is a novel method that allows assessment of internal foot kinematics. The observed changes between gaits during stance may result in altered stress distribution in the DDFT. Further studies will evaluate the effect of farriery intervention on internal foot kinematics.

AB  - Introduction The muscle fibre type (MFT) of the deep epaxial musculature has not been determined in horses. The objective was to determine the MFT distribution in selected muscles of thoracolumbar and hindlimb region of horses. This included deep epaxial and hypaxial muscles that were hypothesised to have a postural stabilising role. A second objective was to examine differences in MFT distribution between Arabians and Quarter horses. Methods Muscle biopsy samples (114) were obtained from 5 Quarter horses, 4 Arabians, and 2 Thoroughbreds. The myosin heavy chain distribution was determined by gel electrophoresis. Mann-Whitney rank test was used to compare the proportional MFT content and differences between breeds. Results Mm. sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis and diaphragm had the highest proportion of MFT-I, 84.1% (±18.4) and 72.4% (±12.5), respectively. The remaining deep epaxial muscles and the hypaxial m. psoas minor had approximately equal MFT-I and II proportions. Mm. psoas major, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi and the hind limb muscles contained mostly MFT-IIX: from 50.5% (±12.8) to 67.9% (±7.3). Quarter horses had significantly more MFT-IIX in m. psoas major 60.8% (±9.1) than Arabians 41.9% (±3.2). Arabians had significantly more MFT-I fibres in m. longissimus dorsi 16.9% (±4.6) than Quarter horses 9.9% (±1.4) (P<0.05). Conclusions The MFT distribution of the deep epaxial muscles, mm. psoas minor and diaphragm, suggest a postural stabilizing role in contrast to the fibre type proportions of the hindlimb muscles. The findings can direct diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscular or neuromotor dysfunction in the thoracolumbar and hind limb area.

AB  - Introduction The ability to accurately assess equine oxygen consumption (VO2) under field conditions has been limited by the need for unrestricted gas exchange. Methods Two variations of a mask and an associated electronics control module (ECM) were designed to enable breath-by-breath measurement of airflows with two 8.0?cm diameter pneumotachometers located 7.5?cm in front of each narus and connected to differential pressure transducers mounted on the outside of the mask. The ECM was comprised of electronics for signal filtering to the flow transducers, an oxygen sensing cell, and an analog-to-digital converter all powered by a lithium-ion battery. The battery also powered a pump connected to gas sampling ports between the nares and pneumotachometers. Airflow and oxygen content of inspired and expired gases were recorded through the ECM and electronically transferred to a notebook. VO2 was determined from these recordings by an operator using a customized software analysis program. One mask encased the lower head (E). The other left the jaw free so horse could wear a bit and be ridden (R). Multiple treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 6 horses to measure VO2max and blood gases. Each mask was worn twice and results compared to those from an open flow-through system (O) by 2-way RMANOVA (P<0.05). Utility of the system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient of 4 independent raters. Results Blood gases and VO2max (152.0?±?4.0 (mean?±?SEM; O), 147.7?±?4.3 (E), 150.7?±?3.3 (R) ml/(kg.min) were not different between masks. VO2 measures were reproducible for each mask. Agreement between the 4 raters was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.99). Conclusions Masks capable of measuring VO2 during field exercise were developed, tested and found accurate by multiple users. Ethical Animal Research Studies performed were approved by the Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #3807). Sources of funding:?Institutional sources. Competing interests:?Washington State University has filed notice of its intent to apply for a patent for facemask used in this study.

AB  - Introduction The most frequently reported causes of gastric ulcers in horses are fasting, type of feed and management, and the administration of some drugs. More recently, physical exercise has also been pointed out as an important factor in the development of gastric lesions in athletic horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether treadmill exercise predisposes to the occurrence of gastric ulcers in horses. Methods Five Arabian horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill during twelve weeks. The animals were submitted to gastroscopy before the beginning and the end of the training period. The lesions were classified according to the method proposed by Macallister [1] that assigns scores for number and severity of injuries, with modifications to give a total score for the stomach, considering not only the presence and severity of ulcers, but also other findings as gastritis, hyperkeratosis, desquamation of the mucosa. The results obtained in the two periods were compared using the Wilcoxon test, with significance at P<0.05. Results In the first gastroscopy two animals had very low scores for lesion number and severity and three horses had no injury. In contrast, in the second evaluation, all animals had higher scores. A significant difference was observed between the two periods (before and after training) considering both methods of gastric lesion classification. Conclusions We concluded that Arabian horses exercised on a treadmill may develop gastric lesions. The possible influence of these lesions on athletic performance and other parameters should be considered by researchers who study equine exercise physiology.

AB  - Introduction The evaluation of acid-base balance of horses is important because it detects alterations that affect their performance and health. There are studies relating these changes with endurance type effort, but few regarding sprint exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the fitness level of Quarter Horses performing barrel racing could be differentiated by quantitative acid-base analysis. Methods For this purpose, 10 horses were distributed into two groups: high (HF) and lower (LF) fitness as defined by the trainer. GPS and frequency meter were used for the measurements. Venous blood gas analysis was performed using a portable analyzer (I-stat) before and after exercise. Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and concentration of non-volatile buffers (Atot) were determined. Variables before and after exercise were compared within and between groups by t-test (P<0.05). Results The average track distance was 125?m. There were no differences between maximum or average velocity and heart rate, which were 30.76?±?0.53?km/h, 22.85?±?0.28?km/h, 206?bpm?±?3.91 versus 27.7?±?2.4?km/h, 21.94?±?0.3?km/h and 203?bpm?±?5.77 for the HF and LF groups, respectively. SID values before exercise were significantly lower for the LF group. Both groups showed a significant increase in Atot and AG, while pH, HCO3-, SIG and SID decreased significantly after exercise. Conclusions Metabolic acidosis was observed using both the traditional and the quantitative approach. It was not possible to differentiate the fitness level of horses in the study.

AB  - Introduction Acid-base disturbances are frequently assessed using traditional variables PCO2, pH, and bicarbonate. This study aimed to compare the changes in acid-base balance in horses performing a CEI endurance race (160?km) using traditional and quantitative methodologies. Methods Blood samples were drawn before racing, at the vet-gate (66?km), immediately after racing, and 2 and 15?h after racing from 18 participating horses. The mean velocity of the horses was 17?km/h. PCO2 and pH were measured (I-Stat). Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and total volatile buffers (Atot) were calculated using formulas from the literature. Data for finishers (F) and non-finishers (N) was compared with an unpaired test. Data collected for finishers at all time-points was compared by repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results PCO2 was lower in group N at the 66?km time-point. In group F, AG had a bimodal behaviour, declining immediately after exercise and then increasing at 2 and 15 hours. There was a slight increase in pH post-exercise. After 2 hours, Atot increased while PCO2 decreased. Compared to SIG immediately after racing, SIG at 2 and 15 hours after racing was decreased. Traditional methodology suggested mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation of the finishers. Quantitative methodology suggested metabolic acidosis reflected by decreasing SID trend and a significant increase of Atot. Conclusions Acid-base imbalances are present in endurance racing horses and differences were found between the traditional and quantitative methods of assessment.

AB  - Introduction During anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, lactate and H+ ions accumulate in muscle fibers and pass into the bloodstream. Monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and its ancillary protein CD147 transport H+ and lactate ions from the plasma into red blood cells, thereby maintaining acid/base homeostasis and retarding systemic acidosis and fatigue. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of CD147 protein in the red blood cells of Arabian horses with different levels of athletic ability. Methods Blood samples were taken from 12 Arabian horses before exercise. The horses were divided into two groups: untrained horses (UH, n?=?6) and 160-km endurance horses (FEI, n?=?6). The amount of CD147 in the plasma membranes of their red blood cells was determined by Western blotting analysis using a human-specific anti-CD147 antibody previously validated for horses. The medians were compared by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test at 5%. Results CD147 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45?kDa was found in the red blood cell membranes of the studied horses. The CD147 expression levels of the two groups were not different (P?=?0.065). The observed median values (min?max) were 0.50 (0.37?1.26) and 0.27 (0.09?0.69) arbitrary optical density units for the FEI and UH group respectively. Conclusions Studies must be performed with more horses to determine if a different level of CD147 expression exists in FEI horses related to their intensive training programs or to the genetic traits of each horse.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered in North America for the prophylactic treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Plasma total CO2 concentration (ctCO2) provides a clinically useful screening test for the presence of metabolic acid-base disturbances, including the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents to racehorses. Some racing jurisdictions account for the metabolic alkalosis and increased plasma ctCO2 induced by furosemide administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-race furosemide dose and pre-race plasma ctCO2 in Thoroughbred racehorses. Methods Jugular venous blood was collected anaerobically into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin from 226 Thoroughbred horses administered a variable dose of furosemide (150?500?mg IV, n?=?217) 3?4 hours previously or not administered furosemide (n?=?9). Plasma ctCO2 was calculated from the measured values for pH and pCO2 using a blood gas and pH analyzer [Radiometer ABL 700] and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Data was analyzed using multivariable linear regression and P<0.05 was significant. Plasma ctCO2 in mmol/L increased linearly (P?=?0.0006) with furosemide dose in milligrams adjusted for sex (female, stallion, gelding), such that ctCO2?=?33.38???0.71(if female)???0.63(if stallion)?+?0.0040???(furosemide dose). Conclusions Intravenous administration of furosemide (150?500?mg) produces a linear dose-dependent increase in ctCO2 in plasma. High intravenous doses of furosemide (500?mg) have the potential to increase plasma ctCO2 to near the threshold value used to identify the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents. This finding supports an allowance of 2.0?mmol/L for furosemide administration used by some racing jurisdictions in North America.

AB  - Introduction Big respiratory cycles (BRCs) are a sporadic but normal occurrence during galloping exercise. Their relationship to performance capacity as reflected by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is unclear. Methods 7 Thoroughbreds completed multiple incremental exercise tests up to 13?m/s on a treadmill to determine their VO2max while wearing a mask that measured inspired and expired volumes (VI, VE) and VO2 on a breath-by-breath basis. Frequency and duration of BRCs were related to speed and VO2max using regression analysis. Numbers of BRCs for each test were counted and the duration, VI, VE and VO2 of each BRC determined and compared to the corresponding average values of the 5 breaths following the BRCs, and VO2max for the exercise bout. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results The frequency of BRCs was 64% when all speeds and runs were considered. The number and appearance of BRCs varied considerably between horses. BRC numbers were greatest at 6 and 13?m/s and least at 9?m/s, and significantly related by polynomial regression (r2?=?0.90). BRC duration was not related to breathing frequency when all BRCs were considered due to the existence of two distinct clusters of BRCs. The duration of those lasting <1.25?s was inversely related to speed (r2?=?0.77) as were those >1.25?s in length (r2?=?0.55). BRC VI and VE were greater than normal VI and VE and the difference increased linearly (r2?=?0.89 and 0.87, respectively) as speed increased from 6?m/s (VI: 8.0?±?0.6%; VE: 8.9?±?0.7% greater) to 13?m/s (VI: 42?±?2%; VE: 57?±?3% greater). Individual VO2max was not related to the number, length or volume of BRCs. Conclusions The frequency, duration and size of BRCs do not affect VO2max and vary considerably within a given treadmill test and between horses.

AB  - Introduction Eccentric muscle contractions (?negative? work, e.g., downhill running) affect human skeletal muscle differently than concentric contractions, increasing muscle size and strength more than concentric exercise training with reduced oxygen consumption (VO2). Better understanding of skeletal muscle and cardiopulmonary responses to downhill training may indicate a role for this in Thoroughbred training. We hypothesised that Thoroughbreds would reduce metabolic energy cost and cardiopulmonary function when they ran at equivalent speed on a declined treadmill compared with running horizontally or uphill. Methods Five well-trained Thoroughbreds ran for 2-min incremental exercise intervals on a treadmill at 1.7, 3.5, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0?m/s on a +4% incline, 0% incline (horizontal) and ?4% decline in random order on different days. Cardiopulmonary and O2-transport variables were measured and analysed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm-?idák pairwise-comparisons. Results Horses ran at all inclines with identical stride frequency and length. At identical uphill speeds they had significantly higher (vs. horizontal) mass-specific VO2 (43% mean increase) and CO2 production (VCO2/Mb), cardiac output (Q/Mb), heart rate, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2), and reduced arterial O2 tension and saturation; tidal volume tended to be higher (P?=?0.060). Downhill running reduced (vs. horizontal) VO2/Mb (19% mean decrease), VCO2/Mb, Q/Mb and PaCO2. Fractional energy cost increase (incline) and reduction (decline) decreased linearly with increasing speed. Conclusions Thoroughbreds run downhill with lower energy cost than on the level or uphill and the cost changes with speed. It remains to be determined if eccentric training induces skeletal muscle changes in horses.

AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Subchondral bone fatigue is an important cause of poor performance, morbidity and mortality in racehorses. Fatigued bone is repaired by remodelling, a process that is attenuated under high cyclical loads, yet the effects of training on remodelling activity in Thoroughbred racehorses is unknown. We hypothesised that remodelling rates are lower in training horses than those that are resting from training. Methods Sections of the palmar metacarpal condyles from Thoroughbred horses that were in race training (n?=?24) or resting from training (n?=?24) at the time of death were examined with light microscopy and back scattered electron microscopy (BSEM). Bone area fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar), and eroded bone surface (E.Pm/T.Ar) were measured within two regions of interest; (1) the lateral parasagittal groove (PS); and (2) the lateral condylar subchondral bone (LC). BSEM variables were analysed for the effect of group (independent samples t-test), region (paired t-test) and interaction with time since change in training status (general linear model). Mean?±?SE are reported. Results For both regions of interest E.Pm/T.Ar was lower in the training horses (PS: 0.39?±?0.06?mm?1, LC: 0.24?±?0.04?mm?1) than in the resting group (PS: 0.65?±?0.07?mm?1, P?= 0.010, LC: 0.85?±?0.10?mm?1, P<0.001). Lower subchondral bone porosity was observed, reflected by higher B.Ar/T.Ar in the LC of training horses (90.8?±?0.6%) than resting horses (85.3?±?1.4%, P?=?0.0010). E.Pm/T.Ar was higher with increased duration of a training period in the lateral condyle (r2?=?0.26, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Race training inhibits remodelling in the subchondral bone of highly loaded areas of the distal metacarpus. Therefore periods of less intense loading are important for allowing repair of subchondral bone fatigue in Thoroughbred racehorses.

AB  - ??Abstract:? We describe the case of a patient with significant adverse effects from posttraumatic analgesic therapy with opioid analgesics who was found by microarray analysis to have a CYP2D6 genotype predictive of a poor metabolizer phenotype. In addition to her poor tolerance and limited response to opioid analgesics, she developed further discomfort when the antiemetic promethazine was administered to treat her gastrointestinal adverse effects. In our discussion we review the literature about the clinical impact of CYP450 2D6 polymorphisms in treatment with the commonly used opioid analgesics codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and morphine, as well as the antiemetic promethazine. The case we present, as well as the literature we review, demonstrates the clinical utility of CYP2D6 genotyping in patients with adverse effects from analgesia therapy.??

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction The study aim was to determine whether there is a link between pelvic misalignment and uneven forelimb hoof size. Previous research suggests that increased loading increases hoof size, but correlation with pelvic misalignment is unknown. Methods 30 healthy, sound, multidiscipline horses, regularly shod/trimmed every 6 weeks, were assessed. Tuber coxae heights were measured in triplicate from the dorsal aspect to ground level, with the horse standing square, using a plumb line and measuring stick. Difference between means indicated value and direction of pelvic misalignment. Using a 300?mm digital vernier calliper, triplicate measurements of hoof width (lateral to medial edge) and hoof length (dorsal to palmar edge) were made of both fore-feet, prior to and after farrier trimming, and were obtained by the farrier (blinded to pelvic measurements) at two shoeing intervals 6 weeks apart. Both methods were tested for reliability and repeatability to ±?1?mm. Statistical analyses included Chi-square, symmetry indices and one-way ANOVA. Results Ventral pelvic rotation was related to greater growth in hoof width on the contralateral forelimb and greater growth in hoof length on the ipsilateral forelimb. There was a significant relationship between uneven hoof width and pelvic rotation direction (P?=?0.0002), and a significant relationship between uneven hoof length and pelvic rotation directional (P?=?6.1?x?10-7). There was a significant relationship between amount of growth in hoof width (P?=?0.0002) and hoof length (P?=?4.8?x?10-6) with pelvic misalignment. Conclusions This study provides evidence of a statistically significant relationship between the alignment of the pelvis and growth of horse's front hooves. Further study would be beneficial in enhancing understanding of the chain of compensatory effects on the equine body.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

AB  - Introduction The aims of the study were to monitor fitness level of young Friesian horses and to assess whether fitness data has a predictive value for the final performance score and whether familial aggregation of response to training could be detected. Methods Sixty-six young Friesian horses, offspring of six different stallions (A, B, C, D, E and F), underwent a 7-week performance test. Horses were given a performance score for their dressage ability (0?110 points), and fitness was evaluated with standardised-exercise-tests (SET) at the beginning (SET-I) and the end (SET-II) of the period. Heart rate (HR; beats/min) was measured in both SET, and plasma lactate concentration (LA; mmol/L) was measured only in SET-II. The majority of data were analyzed with an ANOVA-test or a linear-model (P<0.05). Results Fitness of horses improved significantly between SET-I and II (P?=?0.015). There was a large heterogeneity in responsiveness to training; some horses were high-responders, whereas others were non- or low-responders. There was a familial aggregation of HRcanter-1 response to training (P?=?0.039); offspring of stallion C decreased significantly more in HR than offspring of stallions A (P?=?0.09), D (P?=?0.013) and F (P?=?0.009). HR had no predictive value for the performance score, but horses that did not reach the anaerobic threshold in SET-II scored significantly better (73.8?±?5.6 points) than horses that did (69.9?±?5.9 points, P?=?0.025). Conclusions The present study reports, for the first time in the horse, familial aggregation of HR-response to training. HR could not predict final performance score, but LA-concentrations during SET-II were predictive. Ethical Animal Research Consent was obtained from the owners of all horses.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to determine if yearlings would have higher oxidative stress and lower antioxidant status than mature mares after a single bout of intense exercise before and after training. Methods Seven Standardbred yearling fillies (18?±?2.4?mo) and seven mares (13?±?2.1?yr) ran a repeated sprints exercise test before (RSET1) and after (RSET2) an 8-wk training protocol. Blood samples and middle gluteal muscle samples were taken before and after exercise, and throughout recovery. Data is presented as mean?±?SE and all analyses were done in the context of a linear mixed model with random intercepts for horse. Results In RSET1, mares had higher plasma malondialdehyde than the yearlings (P<0.05), but the yearlings had higher muscle malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, erythrocyte total glutathione and glutathione peroxidase (P<0.05). In RSET2, yearlings had higher plasma nitric oxide than the mares (P<0.05). In RSET2, the mares had lower plasma malondialdehyde, and higher muscle malondialdehyde, total glutathione and nitric oxide as compared to RSET1 (P<0.05). The yearlings in RSET2 had higher muscle nitric oxide and lower erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase than in RSET1 (P<0.05). Plasma cortisol, creatine kinase and muscle glutathione peroxidase had little difference with age or training. Conclusions Prior to training, the yearlings had lower lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidants than the mares. Training reduced oxidative stress and improved antioxidant status in the mares, while few effects of training were seen in the yearlings. This suggests that age is an important defense against exercise-induced oxidative stress. Ethical Animal Research Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Review Board approved the study.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.
