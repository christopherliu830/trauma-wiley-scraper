AB  - Fridell JA, Rogers J, Stratta RJ. The pancreas allograft donor: current status, controversies, and challenges for the future.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 433?449.?? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? The pancreas allograft is a scarce resource that is currently underutilized. The selection of appropriate deceased donors for pancreas procurement is of paramount importance for minimizing technical failure and optimizing long-term outcomes in pancreas transplantation. Despite the increasing demand for pancreas transplantation, increases in overall organ donation rates and the evolution of criteria that constitute an ?acceptable? pancreas donor, the number of deceased donor pancreas transplants being performed in the United States has actually declined in recent years. Although there are many factors that must be considered during evaluation of the potential pancreas allograft donor to minimize morbidity and graft loss, it is evident that there are transplantable organs that are not used. In this review, deceased donor pancreas identification, management, selection, allocation, assessment, preservation, and the problem of pancreas underutilization will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation of the pancreas has many presentations in children and adolescents. The etiology is often elusive, with a great number of cases being idiopathic. However, there have been a number of recent advances in the areas of cell biology, genetics and imaging technology, which should be highlighted. Herein is provided a review for the reader with particular emphasis on some of these newer advances.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic resection is the only treatment option that can lead to a meaningful prolonged survival in pancreatic cancer and, in some instances, perhaps a potential chance for cure. With the advent of organ and function preserving procedures, its use in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and other less common benign diseases of the pancreas is increasing. Furthermore, over the past two decades, with technical advances and centralization of care, pancreatic surgery has evolved into a safe procedure with mortality rates of <5%. However, postoperative morbidity rates are still substantial. This article reviews the more common procedure-related complications, their prevention and their treatment.

AB  - Summary Pancreas donor selection and recognition are important to cope with increasing organ shortage. We aim to show that the PDRI is more useful than the P-PASS to predict acceptance and should thus be preferred over P-PASS. Eurotransplant donors from 2004 until 2014 were included in this study. PDRI logistical factors were set to reference to purely reflect donor quality (PDRI donor). PDRI and P-PASS association with allocation outcome was studied using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Regional differences in donor quality were also investigated. Of the 10 444 pancreata that were reported, 6090 (58.3%) were accepted and 2947 (28.2%) were transplanted. We found that P-PASS was inferior to PDRIdonor in its ability to predict organ reporting, acceptance, and transplantation: AUC 0.63, 0.67 and 0.73 for P-PASS vs. 0.78, 0.79 and 0.84 for PDRIdonor, respectively. Furthermore, there were significant differences in donor quality among different Eurotransplant countries, both in reported donors and in transplanted organs. PDRI is a powerful predictor of allocation outcome and should be preferred over P-PASS. Proper donor selection and recognition, and possibly a more liberal approach toward inferior quality donors, may increase donation and transplant rates.

AB  - Abstract Background: The presumed etiology and prevalence of pancreatic abnormalities in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have been controversial. We conducted a controlled (cross-sectional) study of patients with UC compared with non-UC controls to determine the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities in patients with UC and to determine if these are specific to UC using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Methods: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed on 79 unselected patients with UC and 45 non-UC controls, without a history of pancreatitis attack, between February 2000 and May 2003. Results: Among patients with UC, the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities was 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 8.3%-24.6%): coexisting dilatation and narrowing of the main pancreatic duct were found in 5; diffuse narrowing of pancreatic ducts in 5; and dilatation of pancreatic ductal branches in 3. These abnormalities were compatible with chronic pancreatitis. Among the controls, no pancreatic duct abnormality was found. Conclusions: Changes in the pancreatic duct were found in approximately one-sixth of patients with UC, none of whom had a history of overt pancreatitis. These pancreatic duct abnormalities are likely to be specific to patients with UC.

AB  - Adhesions are a common and unfortunate consequence of most abdominal surgical operations, which start to form within three hours of surgery. Some patients form extensive permanent adhesions that can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the extent of this problem and the cost to the Health Service, and although there are numerous approaches to prevent adhesion formation by careful laparoscopic or microsurgical techniques or the use of various adhesion barriers, no method so far has proved completely efficacious in randomised controlled trials. This article reviews the pathogenesis of adhesions, the epidemiological data and the various methods used to try to prevent their formation.

AB  - Summary Pancreatitis can be either acute or chronic in nature. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis, which typically presents with epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, include gallstones and alcohol. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, biochemical evidence of pancreatic injury, and imaging studies. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, which presents with chronic abdominal pain, is chronic alcohol use. The diagnosis is established by typical symptoms, imaging studies, and evidence of endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Treatment of acute pancreatitis includes analgesia, aggressive IV hydration, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in some instances of gallstone pancreatitis. Rarely, acute pancreatitis progresses to necrotizing pancreatitis. Management of chronic pancreatitis includes analgesia, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, and management of malnutrition and diabetes, if present. Finally, autoimmune pancreatitis, typically associated with IgG4 antibodies, responds to treatment with immunosuppression such as prednisone.

AB  - Controversies still exist as to the exact definition of phimosis, true indications for circumcision, and results of different treatment options. A prospective study in the two years straddling the Millennium was done to definite the exact role of circumcision in the management of the preputial problems amid continuing controversies and in the wake of a new medical treatment, i.e. steroid application emerging since 1993. 244 referrals resulted in 195 circumcisions in 1999. Detailed analysis revealed that the indication was doubtful and arguable in 13.5% and 16%, respectively. The overall complication rate (bleeding, infection and rephimosis) occurred in 12%. Starting from 2000, application of 0.02% Trimcinolone cream was instituted: successful retraction in 74 was achieved in 81/95 patients. No side effects were noted. The positive predicting factors were identified. Circumcision has been advocated as a routine to decrease the incidence of UTI, STD or Cancer. However, circumcision is fraught with early and late problems. There have only been 9 reported on the use of steroid application, all using potent preparations. We pioneered the use of a much weaker steroid that was documented to have comparable efficacy. Our proposed algorithm for offers great advantages, including tremendous savings to the hospital, and lifetime benefits to the patients!

AB  - Aim: To evaluate prospectively the usefulness of routine drainage of the neck following thyroid surgery and its effect on patient comfort. Method: Consecutive patients who underwent elective thyroid surgery were randomized to receive suction drainage or no drainage of the neck at the end of the operation. Drains were removed on the first postoperative day and all patients underwent sonographic examination of the neck to determine the dimension of the remaining haematoma. Pain relating to the operation was assessed at 6 hours post operation and on Day 1 by visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain caused by drain removal was also assessed similarly. Postoperative complications and the lengths of hospital stay were also recorded. Results: 60 patients were recruited and randomized, an equal number of patients with similar demographic characteristics were present in each group. The table below shows a summary of the results. The mean pain score for pain caused by drain removal was 3.1 (range: 0?6). There was no difference for complication rate and the postoperative lengths of hospital stay for the two groups. Conclusion: Routinely draining the neck for thyroid surgery not only failed to reduce the amount of postoperative haematoma and complication but also resulted in greater patient discomfort. Drains should therefore not be used routinely following thyroid surgery.

AB  - Introduction: External ventricular drains (EVD) are used for intracranial pressure monitoring and temporary cerebrospinal fluid drainage in neurosurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid infection is the major complication. Previous prospective epidemiological study from Mayhall (1) had recommended that the EVD should be changed every 5 days to reduce CSF infection. However, subsequent different retrospective series had yielded conflicting results. Hypothesis: The aim was to test whether the practice of exchange of EVD every five days could reduce the CSF infection rate and subsequently improve outcome in terms of ICU stay, hospital stay, 3-month outcome and mortality. Method: We carried out a randomized controlled clinical trial between 11/1998 and 11/2000. 103 patients who needed EVD for more than 5 days and had no evidence of CSF infection on presentation were included. The patients were randomized between change (every five days) and no change of external ventricular drain. Results: Conclusion: The practice of regular exchange of EVD did not reduce CSF infection rate and did not improve outcome. This is in agreement with the current thinking that CSF infection mainly originated from the procedure of ventriculostomy. The associated high cost with regular exchange of EVD (operations and new catheters) did not seem to be justified. Thus, the practice of regular exchange of EVD should be abandoned.

AB  - The objective of the study is to find out the efficiency of video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) pleurodesis and predisposing factors of postoperative complications. This is a retrospective study that those who had VATS pleurodesis from January 1994 to December 2000 were recruited. There were consecutive 306 VATS pleurodesis performed on 271 patients. These included 33 female and 238 male patients from 15 to 73 years old. 31 of them had bilateral procedures. 244 of them had primary spontaneous pneumothoraces and 27 of them had secondary pneumothoraces. Most of them had two or more episodes of pneumothoraces and persistent air leakage >14 days before operations. 15 patients had failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before VATS. There was no operative death. Usually they were discharged within five days after operations. There were 21 persistent air leakage >5 days (6.8%), 1 bleeding required surgical haemostasis (0.3%) and 4 infectious complications (1.3%). Follow up duration was up to 72 months. There was 12 recurrence (3.9%) after discharge. Absence of blebs, presence of pleural adhesion, prolonged chest tube placement before VATS pleurodesis, and failed surgical or chemical pleurodesis before are the predisposing factors of complications.

AB  - Introduction: Image-detected breast lesion is becoming a concern in surgery. After triple assessment, a suspicious or indeterminate lesion will usually require excision to rule out malignancy. Vacuum-assisted biopsy is newly introduced as a minimally invasive alternative to operation in obtaining tissue for histological assessment. The early experience of this procedure in the Breast Centre of Kwong Wah Hospital is reviewed. Method: Vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed for image-detected breast lesions under local anaesthesia using the Mammotome. Lesions were either vaguely palpable or non-palpable but well seen on ultrasound scan with fine needle aspirated indeterminate cytology or benign cytology in a high risk patient. Definitive surgery was performed if the biopsy result showed malignancy or upon patient?s request. Other patients were followed up six monthly with clinical examination and ultrasound scan. Excision was indicated if there was any increase in size. The pathology was assumed to be benign if there was no change in six months time. Result: From September 1998 to May 2000, 49 female patients were included. One of them had 2 lesions making a total of 50 cases. The mean age of the patients was 45.5 (22?58). The mean size of the lesion was 10.8mm (4?19). The procedure took 5?55 min (mean 16.6). It was successful in 49 cases (98%). Four lesions were found to be malignant. Three patients had definitive operations with the pathology confirmed while one patient defaulted follow up. Amongst the 45 benign lesions, 3 were excised upon request. The pathology were all benign. For the remaining 42 patients. 23 were followed up for 12 months and 19 patients for 6 months. Three patients were found to have enlarging lesions and excisions were performed which revealed benign histology. The breast lumps of the remaining 39 patients either remained unchanged or diminished size. There were no major complications (wound haematoma, infection). The average linear pain score (minimum 1, maximum 5) was 2.0. Conclusion: Vacuum-assisted biopsy is an accurate diagnostic tool with the advantage of minimal morbidity.

AB  - Introduction: The treatment of choice for breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy or in selected case breast conserving surgery. Typically, patient will have a long hospital stay after surgery due to the collection of lymph. Premature removal of drain will incur seroma formation and may predispose to wound infection. Review of literature shows that there has not been adequate address to this condition, particularly the use of pressure garment in reducing lymph output. We report our experience in an interim analysis of a randomized controlled study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of pressure garment on early removal of drains, shortening of hospital stay and reducing the incidence of seroma formation. Methodology: From September 1999 to November 2000, 44 consecutive patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer were invited to participate in this study. Our occupational therapist arranged for tailor made pressure garments. Soft foam mimicking the external mammary prosthesis was fashioned so that appropriate pressure was applied on to the operative site to prevent lymph accumulation. They were randomized into two groups (1) with pressure garment (2) without pressure garment. The single surgeon performing the mastectomy was blinded until the completion of surgery when the result of randomization was sought from the principal investigator. The occupational therapist inspected daily to ensure the vest was filled satisfactorily. OPD assessments were arranged at 2 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: (range in parentheses) Conclusion: Use of breast pressure garment did not prevent seroma formation but reduced the volume of drainage and facilitated early removal of drains resulting in a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay of 2.7 days. Such breast vest has great impact on the hospital economy.

AB  - The increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is higher for proximal than for distal tumors. As microsatellite instability (MSI) is a feature of proximal tumors, we hypothesize that an increase in MSI tumors may account for the age-related proximal shift in CRC. Methods: A representative sample of 230 CRCs from 3 age groups was selected from a CRC database. MSI was determined by PCR. MLH1 and MSH2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the methylation of the MLH1 gene promotor (PM) by methylation-specific PCR. Results: MSI tumors became more frequent (p < 0.01 chi square) and more proximal in distribution (p = 0.01 loglinear) in the oldest age group. MSI was associated with loss of expression of MSH2 in the young age group. PM and inactivation of MLH1 increased with age. Conclusion: MSI tumors became more frequent and proximal in older patients. This trend was associated with differences in the underlying mechanisms responsible for the MSI phenotype.
