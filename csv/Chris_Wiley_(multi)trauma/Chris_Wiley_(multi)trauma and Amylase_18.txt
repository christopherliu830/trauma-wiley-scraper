AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

AB  - Abstract Background:? A major complication of a distal pancreatectomy (DP) is the formation of a post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF). In spite of the utilization of numerous surgical techniques no consensus on an appropriate technique for closure of the pancreatic remnant after DP has been established yet. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of pancreatoenteral anastomosis (PE) vs. direct closure (DC) of the pancreatic remnant on POPF. Methods:? A total of 198 consecutive patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy between 2002 and 2010 at our institution were retrospectively analysed for post-operative morbidity and mortality. Results:? One hundred and fifty-one patients (76.3%) received DC whereas PE was performed in 47 patients (23.7%). The incidence of POPF was higher in the DC group (22% vs. 11%), whereas the rate of post-operative haemorrhage was higher in the PE group (11% vs. 7%). However, these differences were not significant. Additionally, there were no significant differences in overall post-operative morbidity and mortality between the groups. Conclusions:? The performance of PE instead of DC may be considered as a safe alternative in individual patients, but it does not significantly lead to a general improvement in post-operative outcome after DP. An interdisciplinary collaboration in the prevention and treatment of POPF therefore remains essential.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Most surgeons routinely place intraperitoneal drains at the time of pancreatic resection but this practice has recently been challenged. Objective:? Evaluate the outcome when pancreatic resection is performed without operatively placed intraperitoneal drains. Methods:? In all, 226 consecutive patients underwent pancreatic resection. In 179 patients drains were routinely placed at the time of surgery and in 47 no drains were placed. Outcomes for these two cohorts were recorded in a prospective database and compared using the ?2- /Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and Wilcoxon's test for continuous variables. Results:? Demographic, surgical and pathological details were similar between the two cohorts. Elimination of routine intraperitoneal drainage did not increase the frequency or severity of serious complications. However, when all grades of complications were considered, the number of patients that experienced any complication (65% vs. 47%, P= 0.020) and the median complication severity grade (1 vs. 0, P= 0.027) were increased in the group that had drains placed at the time of surgery. Eliminating intra-operative drains was associated with decreased delayed gastric emptying (24% vs. 9%, P= 0.020) and a trend towards decreased wound infection (12% vs. 2%, P= 0.054). The readmission rate (9% vs. 17% P= 0.007) and number of patients requiring post-operative percutaneous drains (2% vs. 11%, P= 0.001) was higher in patients who did not have operatively placed drains but there was no difference in the re-operation rate (4% vs. 0%, P= 0.210). Conclusion:? Abandoning the practice of routine intraperitoneal drainage after pancreatic resection may not increase the incidence or severity of severe post-operative complications.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is uncommon in pregnancy but may have a serious impact on maternal and fetal wellbeing. A limited but expanding evidence base provides clinicians a clearer understanding and better management of this disease among the pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is caused by many different factors. While the list of etiologies is extensive, approximately 80 percent of cases are attributable to either biliary tract disease or alcohol abuse in the general population. Cholelithiasis is the most common etiology of pancreatitis in pregnancy, representing a larger percentage of cases than in the non-pregnant population. Acute pancreatitis is subdivided into two types: interstitial edematous pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. Treatment of acute pancreatitis in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant individuals. However, additional measures during pregnancy include fetal monitoring and attention to positioning of the mother to avoid compression of the inferior vena cava.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.
