AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Summary Aprotinin, a Kunitz protease inhibitor, has a wide inhibitory action with particular activity against trypsin, chymotrypsin and kallikrein, making it theoretically attractive in ameliorating the effects of acute pancreatitis. Its use in acute pancreatitis has been studied for the last 50?years with disappointing results. In this paper, we review the previous studies and argue that all the studies have not been adequately powered, have inappropriate end-points, but most importantly have not attained adequate plasma and peritoneal levels of aprotinin to produce sufficient inhibitory activity. We hypothesise that a well-powered study with adequate aprotinin dosing may clarify its clinical benefit in severe acute pancreatitis.

AB  - SUMMARY Somatostatin and octreotide inhibit basal and stimulated pancreatic secretion, stimulate reticuloendothelial system activity, modulate the cytokine cascade and are cytoprotective with respect to the pancreas. These effects of somatostatin and octreotide suggest that both drugs may be useful either in the treatment of pancreatic disorders, or in preventing acute pancreatitis following procedures on the pancreas. In recent years it has become clear that somatostatin is a useful and effective therapy for severe acute pancreatitis and in preventing complications following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), whereas octreotide has no beneficial effect and may be deleterious in both these indications. The differences in the therapeutic efficacy of somatostatin and octreotide in acute pancreatitis and ERCP appears to be related to their differential effects on sphincter of Oddi motility?the native hormone relaxing, and the analogue increasing, its contractility. Consequently, any beneficial effects of octreotide in both acute pancreatitis and ERCP are offset by the increased contractility of the sphincter of Oddi, which results in retention of activated enzymes within the pancreas and further autodigestion of the gland. Somatostatin and octreotide are equally effective in promoting the closure of pancreatic fistulae. However, the time to closure after commencement of therapy is much more variable and longer in patients treated with subcutaneous octreotide than those receiving intravenous somatostatin, possibly as a result of fluctuations in pancreatic enzyme secretion between consecutive administrations of the hormone. Furthermore, the initial potent inhibitory effect of octreotide on pancreatic secretion is lost after 7 days of continuous subcutaneous administration. Therefore, in terms of cost-effectiveness, somatostatin would appear to be the treatment of choice for pancreatic fistulae. Octreotide markedly reduces the complication rates after elective pancreatic surgery. It remains to be established whether somatostatin is as effective as octreotide in this indication.

AB  - Abstract:? Two distinct approaches are being explored in red blood cell substitute (RCS) development: hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs). HBOCs are based on intra- and/or intermolecularly ?engineered? human or animal hemoglobins (Hbs), optimized for O2 delivery and longer intravascular circulation. Some are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical studies. PFBOCs are aqueous emulsions of perfluorocarbon derivatives that dissolve relatively large amounts of O2. A PFBOC based on a 60% (wt/vol) emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide has been evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials. Although current PFBOC products generally require patients to breathe O2 enriched air, they render certain advantages since they are totally synthetic. This article provides a short review of the basic principles, approaches, and current status of RCS development. Results of preclinical and clinical studies including recent Phase II/III clinical studies are discussed.
