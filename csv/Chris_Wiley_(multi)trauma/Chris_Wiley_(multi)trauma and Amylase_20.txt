AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Summary Several issues related to the risks, costs, and availability of allogeneic blood transfusions have fueled research into other blood substitutes. Artificial oxygen carriers increase the oxygen content of blood by providing additional chemically modified hemoglobin molecules or inert fluids capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen. Several such products have been developed and many have undergone extensive clinical investigation, demonstrating their efficacy in improving oxygen transportation and avoiding the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. Their clinical use, however, has been marred by the unresolved safety issues and significant numbers of complications. While further research is underway to improve the safety of artificial oxygen carriers, current products remain valuable assets as ?oxygen bridges? in the management of patients suffering from critically low hemoglobin levels at imminent risk of ischemia and death that cannot be transfused.

AB  - Essentials Predicting the occurrence of portosplenomesenteric vein thrombosis (PSMVT) is difficult. We studied 72 patients with acute pancreatitis. Artificial neural networks modeling was more accurate than logistic regression in predicting PSMVT. Additional predictive factors may be incorporated into artificial neural networks. Summary Objective To construct and validate artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting the occurrence of portosplenomesenteric venous thrombosis (PSMVT) and compare the predictive ability of the ANNs with that of logistic regression. Methods The ANNs and logistic regression modeling were constructed using simple clinical and laboratory data of 72 acute pancreatitis (AP) patients. The ANNs and logistic modeling were first trained on 48 randomly chosen patients and validated on the remaining 24 patients. The accuracy and the performance characteristics were compared between these two approaches by SPSS17.0 software. Results The training set and validation set did not differ on any of the 11 variables. After training, the back propagation network training error converged to 1 ? 10?20, and it retained excellent pattern recognition ability. When the ANNs model was applied to the validation set, it revealed a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 85.7%, a positive predictive value of 77.6% and negative predictive value of 90.7%. The accuracy was 83.3%. Differences could be found between ANNs modeling and logistic regression modeling in these parameters (10.0% [95% CI, ?14.3 to 34.3%], 14.3% [95% CI, ?8.6 to 37.2%], 15.7% [95% CI, ?9.9 to 41.3%], 11.8% [95% CI, ?8.2 to 31.8%], 22.6% [95% CI, ?1.9 to 47.1%], respectively). When ANNs modeling was used to identify PSMVT, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849 (95% CI, 0.807?0.901), which demonstrated better overall properties than logistic regression modeling (AUC = 0.716) (95% CI, 0.679?0.761). Conclusions ANNs modeling was a more accurate tool than logistic regression in predicting the occurrence of PSMVT following AP. More clinical factors or biomarkers may be incorporated into ANNs modeling to improve its predictive ability.

AB  - Abstract Background: Perioperative enteral immunonutrition is thought to reduce postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the clinical effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing total gastrectomy. Methods: Well nourished patients with primary gastric cancer, fit for total gastrectomy, were randomized to either a control group with regular diet, or an immunonutrition group that received regular diet supplemented with 1000 ml/day of immunonutrients for 5 consecutive days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Secondary endpoints were rates of infectious complications, overall postoperative morbidity and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on 3?4 days after surgery. Results: Of 244 randomized patients, 117 were allocated to the control group and 127 received immunonutrition. SSIs occurred in 27 patients in the immunonutrition group and 23 patients in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1·09, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·66 to 1·78). Infectious complications were observed in 30 patients in the immunonutrition group and 27 in the control group (RR 1·11, 0·59 to 2·08). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 30·8 and 26·1 per cent respectively (RR 1·18, 0·78 to 1·78). The median CRP value was 11·8 mg/dl in the immunonutrition group and 9·2 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0·113). Conclusion: Five-day preoperative enteral immunonutrition failed to demonstrate any clear advantage in terms of early clinical outcomes or modification of the systemic acute-phase response in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing elective total gastrectomy.
