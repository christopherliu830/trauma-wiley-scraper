AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - Summary Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors are increasingly being used as a source of pancreas allografts for vascularized organ and islet transplantation. We provide practice guidelines aiming to increase DCD pancreas utilization. We review risk assessment and donor selection criteria. We report suggested factors in donor and recipient clinical management and provide an overview of the activities and outcomes of vascularized pancreas and islet transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Brain-dead donors are frequently hypovolemic and hypotensive requiring vasopressor support. We studied a stroke volume-based fluid resuscitation and vasopressor weaning protocol prospectively on 64 hypotensive donors, with a recent control cohort of 30 hypotensive donors treated without a protocol. Stroke volume was measured every 30 minutes for 4 hours by pulse contour analysis or esophageal Doppler. A 500 mL saline fluid bolus was infused over 30 minutes and repeated if the stroke volume increased by 10%. No fluid was infused if the stroke volume did not increase by 10%. Vasopressors were weaned every 10 minutes if the mean arterial pressure was greater than 65 mm Hg. The protocol group received 1937 ± 906 mL fluid compared to 1323 ± 919 mL in the control group (P = .003). Mean time on vasopressors was decreased from 957.6 ± 586.2 to 176.3 ± 82.2 minutes (P<.001). Donors in the protocol group were more likely to donate four or more organs than donors in the control group (OR = 4.114, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.003-16.876). While more organs were transplanted per donor in the protocol group (3.39 ± 1.52) than in the control group (2.93 ± 1.44) (P = .268), the difference did not reach statistical significance. A goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol decreased organ ischemia and may increase organs transplanted.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Mortality rates associated with postoperative peritonitis or haemorrhage secondary to pancreatic fistula (PF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remain high. This study analysed the results of an alternative management strategy for these life-threatening complications. Methods:? All patients undergoing PD between January 2004 and April 2011 were identified. Patients who underwent further laparotomy for failure of the pancreatico-digestive anastomosis were identified. Since 2004, this problem has been managed by dismantling the pancreatico-digestive anastomosis and canulating the pancreatic duct remnant with a thin polyethylene tube (Escat tube), which is then passed through the abdominal wall. Main outcome measures were mortality, morbidity and longterm outcome. Results:? From January 2004 to April 2011, 244 patients underwent a PD. Postoperatively, 21 (8.6%) patients required re-laparotomy to facilitate a wirsungostomy. Two patients were transferred from another hospital with life-threatening PF after PD. Causes of re-laparotomy were haemorrhage (n= 12), peritonitis (n= 4), septic shock (n= 4) and mesenteric ischaemia (n= 1). Of the 21 patients who underwent wirsungostomy, six patients subsequently died of liver failure (n= 3), refractory septic shock (n= 2) or mesenteric ischaemia (n= 1) and nine patients suffered complications. The median length of hospital stay was 42 days (range: 34?60 days). The polyethylene tube at the pancreatic duct was removed at a median of 4 months (range: 2?11 months). Three patients developed diabetes mellitus during follow-up. Conclusions:? These data suggest that preservation of the pancreatic remnant with wirsungostomy has a role in the management of patients with uncontrolled haemorrhage or peritonitis after PF.

AB  - Abstract Background Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after distal pancreatectomy (DP) remains the most common surgical complication. We have developed a novel stump closure technique after DP using transpancreatic mattress suture with Vicryl mesh (TMV) and reported our initial findings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TMV compared to the conventional handsewn stump closure technique (CHS). Methods This retrospective single-center study included 165 consecutive patients who underwent open DP from January 2010 to May 2018. Of these, 71 patients underwent DP using TMV after September 2014 and 94 patients underwent DP with CHS. The surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results Clinically relevant POPF rate in the TMV group was significantly lower than that in the CHS group (5.6% vs. 17.2%, P = 0.027). Morbidity rate was higher in the CHS group than that in the TMV group (16.9% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.104). In the multivariate analysis, absence of additional organ resection (OR 3.57; 95% CI 1.18?10.43; P = 0.025) and TMV (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07?0.73; P = 0.010) were identified as independent preventing factors for clinically relevant POPF. Conclusion TMV can be an effective stump closure technique for preventing POPF after DP.

AB  - Abstract The underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis are ill understood. The mortality rate of this disease has not significantly improved over the past few decades. Current treatment options are limited, and predominantly aimed at supportive therapy. A key feature of severe acute pancreatitis is the presence of extensive tissue necrosis with both local and systemic manifestations of inflammatory response syndromes. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis may lead to more targeted therapeutic options, potentially leading to improved survival. Animal models of acute pancreatitis are therefore an essential investigative tool for these aims to be achieved. This review discusses the suitability of recent non-invasive models of acute pancreatitis such as hormone-induced, alcohol-induced, immune-mediated, diet-induced, gene knockout and L-arginine; and invasive models including closed duodenal loop, antegrade pancreatic duct perfusion, biliopancreatic duct injection, combination of secretory hyperstimulation with minimal intraductal bile acid exposure, vascular-induced, ischaemia/reperfusion and duct ligation.
