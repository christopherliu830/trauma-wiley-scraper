AB  - Summary This chapter overviews the advances in digital biosensors operating in the binary (YES/NO) mode, mostly emphasizing biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. The attractive performance of the new enzyme logic biosensors holds considerable promise for diverse practical and important future applications, including novel forensic and security applications. The chapter describes how the biomedical analysis can benefit from the use of biomolecular information processing (biocomputing) systems. Forensic analysis of biofluids can benefit from novel bioanalytical/biosensing methods, including those based on the biocomputing approach. The chapter also overviews the application of binary biosensing methods based on the enzyme logic gates to various types of injury biomarkers, particularly concentrating on battlefield injuries. It shows that the simplest logic processing based mostly on logic AND/OR gates, applied to biochemical input signals.

AB  - Abstract Background Pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rare but important clinical entity associated with significant morbidity. Predicting the severity and outcome of AP in pediatric patients can be challenging because there are few validated severity scoring systems. Moreover, the etiology of pediatric AP in the Japanese population is different from that of Western populations. The performance of severity scores in pediatric AP with a high prevalence of severe cases is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of existing severity scoring systems when used for Japanese children at a tertiary care center. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of all children (â‰¤18?years) treated for AP at between 2002 and 2012 at National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo. The modified Glasgow acute pancreatitis severity score (modified Glasgow), Ranson criteria (Ranson), Balthazar computed tomography severity index (CTSI), and pediatric acute pancreatitis severity (PAPS) score were assessed for their ability to distinguish severe pancreatitis from the milder forms. Results Thirty-three Japanese children with AP were identified. Among them, 37 episodes were analyzed for the performance of the scoring systems and 33 for the etiology. The most common etiology of AP was structural abnormality (n = 8). Sensitivity for the modified Glasgow, Ranson, PAPS, and CTSI was 42.9%, 52.4%, 81.0%, and 50.0%, respectively, while specificity was 81.3%, 81.3%, 37.5%, and 76.9%, respectively. Conclusion We found PAPS to be the most reliable when used for discriminating the severe form of AP from the milder forms at a Japanese tertiary pediatric care center.

AB  - Summary Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5% of visits to the emergency department. Although most patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have minor problems, about 18?25% of patients have a serious enough condition to warrant hospital admission for investigation and treatment, and about 10% of patients need emergency or urgent surgery. It usually results from gastrointestinal disorders, but other causes, which include a spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, must not be forgotten. Most commonly, acute abdominal pain is due to luminal obstruction, inflammation, perforation, volvulus or torsion, and intestinal ischemia. The two immediate goals in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain are to decide if the patient needs admission to hospital and to ascertain whether urgent or emergency surgery is needed. A number of tests and investigations are available to guide the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, but only an astute clinician can obtain the information that is needed from a patient, choose the best investigations, and plan appropriate treatment. The desire to obtain an accurate preoperative diagnosis should not be allowed to delay therapeutic intervention in the critically ill or unstable patient.

AB  - Abstract Data bases that are created to administer health care benefits and to record financial aspects of medical care in the United States are useful for epidemiologic research in certain circumstances. Case finding and verification in such records is complex and rarely described in detail in research reports because of space limitations. This report describes portmarketing surveillance for peptic ulcer, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hepatic dysfunction in 68, 180 people who took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), by using an automated data base together with review of selected medical records. Cases included both mild diseases treated on an outpatient basis and more severe illnesses that required hospital admission. Using computer programs we identified 9642 subjects who had at least one insurance claim suggesting a possible case event. We manually reviewed chronological profiles of their insurance claims, to select 833 subjects for medical record reviews, of whom 152 were verified as cases. Our algorithms for case identification were sensitive, but not very specific. If we had restricted our manual review to people who had at least five relevant claims during the study period, we would have avoided 42% of the reviewing workload and lost only 5% of the cases.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare entity and is often asymptomatic. However, some of its complications may require acute surgical intervention. This study was performed to evaluate the presentation and outcome of patients who underwent urgent surgery for complicated jejunal diverticulosis. Methods:? A retrospective review of all patients who underwent emergency surgery for complicated jejunal diverticulosis from November 2005 to December 2008 was performed. Results:? Six cases of complicated jejunal diverticulosis required urgent surgery during the study period. Three patients presented with acute abdomen from perforated jejunal diverticulum. Preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans were useful in localizing the source of sepsis. One patient died from the subsequent complications. The other three patients presented with massive lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage for which CT angiography was able to localize the source of haemorrhage in two of them. Small bowel resection was then performed and all three were discharged well eventually. Conclusion:? Though rare, jejunal diverticulosis can present with several life-threatening complications that mandates immediate surgery. While the surgical procedure may be technically simple, achieving the accurate preoperative diagnosis is often fraught with challenges. CT scan could prove invaluable in the management if the situation permits.
