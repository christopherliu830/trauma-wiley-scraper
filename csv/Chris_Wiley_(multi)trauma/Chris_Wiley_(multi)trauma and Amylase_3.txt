AB  - Summary Abdominal pain is common in school-aged children and is rarely organic, but there is a diverse and extensive differential diagnosis. The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Summary Hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery involves the treatment of surgical conditions in the liver, pancreas and biliary system. This chapter discusses liver, pancreas and biliary diseases and tumours. Liver disease manifests in a number of clinical features, such as jaundice in biliary obstruction. However, patients with liver disease can present with jaundice without biliary obstruction, and with portal hypertension, low serum albumin and clotting disorders in patients with chronic hepatic failure. Benign liver tumours may require surgical intervention for prevention of haemorrhage, for relief of symptoms or to exclude malignancy if there is a risk of malignancy or any diagnostic uncertainty. Most biliary tract affected patients present with benign conditions related to the presence of gallstones. Rarely, patients present with malignant conditions manifesting in the biliary tract. Gallstones are caused by excess cholesterol in bile, bile stasis or increased bilirubin.

AB  - Abstract It has been hypothesized that transplanting simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) grafts from donors with a history of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CACPR) leads to inferior post-transplant outcomes due to organ hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest and mechanical trauma during resuscitation. Using SRTR data, we identified 13,095 SPK transplants from 2000-2018, of which 810 (6.2%) were from donors with a history of CACPR. After inverse probability of treatment weighting on donor and recipient characteristics, we found that 1-, 5- and 10-year patient (CACPR: 96.4%, 89.9% and 78.9%; non-CACPR: 96.3%, 88.9% and 76.0%; p=0.3), death-censored pancreas graft survival (CACPR: 89.3%, 82.7%, 75.0%; non-CACPR: 89.9%, 82.7%, 76.3%; p=0.7), and death-censored kidney graft survival (CACPR: 97.0%, 89.5%, 78.2%; non-CACPR: 96.9.9%, 88.7%, 80.0%; p=0.4) were comparable between the two groups. There were no differences in the risk of pancreatitis (CACPR: 2.9%, non-CACPR: 2.4%; weighted OR=0.74 1.22 2.02; p=0.4), anastomotic leak (CACPR: 1.6%, non-CACPR: 2.0%; weighted OR=0.54 1.02 1.93; p>0.9), or median length of hospital stay (CACPR: 8 days, non-CACPR: 9 days; p=0.6) for recipients of CACPR vs. non-CACPR donors. Our findings suggest that CACPR donors could be used to expand the SPK donor pool without compromising short or long-term outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe a large segmental (sub-total) mandibulectomy for removal of an undifferentiated sarcoma in a horse. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 10-year-old mare. Methods A combination of methods including computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a large undifferentiated sarcoma of the right mandible. A large segmental mandibulectomy extending from 3?cm below the right temporomandibular joint to immediately caudal to tooth 407 was used to perform an en-bloc resection of the mass under general anesthesia. Results Surgery time was 11?hours and 35?minutes and total anesthesia time, 12?hours and 40?minutes. The mare was eating well 3 days after surgery. Some postoperative skin sloughing occurred, but the cosmetic and functional outcome was good. The mare continued to do well, with no evidence of disease recurrence, 24 months after surgery. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT images was instrumental in surgical planning. A very large portion of the mandible can be removed in a horse with acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - A 14-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented with hypoglycaemia and seizures of several weeks duration. Bloodwork revealed hypoglycaemia (1·83 mmol/l; reference range 4·22-8·05 mmol/l) with concurrent normal insulin levels (171 pmol/l; reference range 72-583 pmol/l). An insulinoma was suspected and medical and dietary management were attempted with minimal success. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a single, well-defined mass was found within the left lobe of the pancreas. The mass was removed and histologically classified as an islet cell carcinoma, consistent with an insulinoma. The cat had an episode of presumed postoperative pancreatitits, but recovered with appropriate treatment. The cat has had no clinical signs of recurrence of greater than 32 months postsurgery. There are only four cases of insulinoma in cats reported in the literature. All prior insulionomas reported were in older cats and were malignant in character, which is similar to the reports in the dog. This case is unique because of the apparent lack of local recurrence and development of metastatic disease, leading to the prolonged survival.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract Middle pancreatectomy is parenchyma- and adjacent organ-sparing pancreatectomy indicated for small tumors located in the body, but deeply located in the gland, and therefore hard to enucleate. Others lesions including pancreatic trauma or arteriovenous malformation are also candidate targets. Invasive ductal carcinoma, even when the tumor is small enough, is not eligible because the most of these tumors show extrapancreatic invasion. After exposure of neck to body of the pancreas, middle pancreatectomy was performed by proximal and distal transection, reconstruction after Roux-Y pancreaticojejunostomy, which is the most common. This procedure is low-invasive and allow the preservation of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function without loss of duodenal passage, however, it also has a high morbidity associated with pancreatic fistula. This article provides indications and surgical techniques with special focus on the procedure of middle pancreatectomy.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MM) is a new generation immunosuppressant, which has been successfully used for treatment of renal, heart and liver transplants, and other immune-mediated diseases. MM is also a safe and steroid-sparing agent for treating neuromuscular diseases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myastenia gravis. MM is an ester of mycophenolic acid, an agent that inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Side effects are modest and there is a lower risk for late malignancies than other immunosuppressive drugs. We assessed MM in the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The therapy of MMN largely depends upon the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg induce and maintain improvement in MMN, but they do not eradicate the disease and are very expensive. No randomized controlled trials are available to indicate whether immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in MMN. We treated with MM four patients who fulfilled the clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN, aiming to assess whether the drug is safe and may help in reducing or discontinuing IVIg infusion in this disease. MM administration, at 1?g twice daily, was started when patients were still under IVIg treatment and showed minimal or no disability, as judged by the INCAT disability scale. At the third month of MM therapy, IVIg infusion was discontinued in 2 patients and reduced by 20 % in 2 patients. After a follow up ranging from 1 to 6 months, no worsening in the INCAT disability scale was observed in all the patients. One patient discontinued the medication after four months because of gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhea, weight loss and increased amylase/lipase levels. The promising response to MM and the lack of major side effects, warrant further multicentric controlled trials in MMN.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.
