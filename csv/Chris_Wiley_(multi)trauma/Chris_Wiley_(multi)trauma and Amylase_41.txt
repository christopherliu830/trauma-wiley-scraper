AB  - Ba.cil'lus. N.L. masc. n. Bacillus a rodlet. Firmicutes / ?Bacilli? / Bacillales / Bacillaceae / Bacillus Cells rod-shaped, straight or slightly curved, occurring singly and in pairs, some in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Endospores are formed, no more than one to a cell; these spores are very resistant to many adverse conditions. Gram-positive, or Gram-positive only in early stages of growth, or Gram-negative. A meso-DAP direct murein cross-linkage type is commonest, but L-Lys-D-Glu, Orn-D-Glu and L-Orn-D-Asp have occasionally been reported. Motile by means of peritrichous or degenerately peritrichous flagella, or nonmotile. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but a few species are described as strictly anaerobic. The terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, replaceable by alternatives in some species. Most species will grow on routine media such as nutrient agar and blood agar. Colony morphology and size very variable between and within species. A wide diversity of physiological abilities is exhibited, ranging from psychrophilic to thermophilic, and acidophilic to alkaliphilic; some strains are salt tolerant and some are halophilic. Catalase is produced by most species. Oxidase-positive or -negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultative chemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiring several growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates. DNA G + C content (mol%): 32?66 (Tm ). Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.

AB  - Abstract Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil has been receiving increasing attention due to its nutritional and functional potentials. However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims In acute pancreatitis (AP), patients with persistent organ failure [POF, duration of organ failure (OF) ≥48?h] and transient organ failure (TOF, duration of OF <48?h) have different outcomes. We have compared the clinical course and outcome of patients with severe AP (SAP) with TOF and POF in the first week of hospitalization as well as the impact of change in the OF score in the first week on patient outcome. Methods Consecutive patients with SAP were evaluated for OF and its dynamics during the first week of hospitalization. The modified multiple organ failure score (MOFS) was used to identify OF, grade its severity and monitor its progression. The clinical course and outcome of patients were studied. Results Of 114 patients, mean age 39.2 ± 13.7 years, 37 (32.5%) patients had no OF, 34 (29.8%) had TOF and 43(37.7%) had POF. Patients with POF had the higher infected necrosis, increased requirement for percutaneous drain placement, surgery and higher mortality as compared with those with TOF. The odds ratio for mortality with persistent and deteriorating OF was 26.2 [confidence interval (CI) 5.1?134.9] compared with only persistent OF. Conclusion The dynamics of OF in the first week of SAP predicts the clinical course and outcome. Persistent and deteriorating OF indicates a poor outcome.

AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.
