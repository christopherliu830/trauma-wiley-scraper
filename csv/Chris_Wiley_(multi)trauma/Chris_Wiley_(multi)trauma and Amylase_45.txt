AB  - Abstract Following laparotomy for severe intra-abdominal sepsis, the abdominal cavity was left open to heal by granulation in 18 patients. In 14 patients, operation was required because of recurrent gastrointestinal perforation or anastomotic dehiscence. In three, the indication for this procedure was recurrent pancreatic abscess. Of the 17, 13 had previously undergone multiple operations which had failed to control sepsis. Laparostomy was performed as a primary procedure in only one case, a patient with fulminating pancreatitis requiring pancreatic necrosectomy. All patients received parenteral nutrition. The overall mortality was 28 per cent. However, there was only one death among the last 9 patients treated compared with 4 in the previous 9. The median sepsis score in the first 9 (19, range 10?26) was not significantly different (P > 0·05)from that in the subsequent 9 patients (17, range 8?21). Three of the four who had initially presented with severe acute pancreatitis died. No patient eviscerated and only 9 (50 per cent) required mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 5 days. The median time for wound healing was 10 weeks and 6 patients have subsequently undergone definitive surgery with satisfactory results. Laparostomy is a valuable technique in the management of severe, intractable intra-abdominal sepsis.

AB  - Summary Background Drug toxicity is a well-known cause of acute pancreatitis (AP). Although many drugs have been associated with AP, the magnitude of the risk of most of them remains largely unknown. Aim To determine the pancreatotoxic risk of a wide range of drugs. Methods The hospital-based Berlin case?control surveillance study, including all 51 Berlin hospitals in a hospital network, ascertained 102 cases with idiopathic AP (IAP) and 750 controls between 2002 and 2011. Patients with IAP were thoroughly validated using anamnestic, clinical or laboratory data. Drug exposure was obtained in a face-to-face interview. Possible drug aetiology was assessed in individual patients through a standardised causality assessment applying the criteria of the World Health Organization. Drug risks were further quantified [odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)] in a case?control design with unconditional logistic regression analysis. Results The pancreatotoxic risk of several drugs, including azathioprine (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.9?13.5), fenofibrate (OR 12.2; 95% CI 2.3?69.1), mesalazine (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.1?9.5) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, was corroborated by case?control analysis and causality assessment. Causality assessment suggested a pancreatotoxic potential, among others, for mercaptopurine or the seldom reported leflunomide, and alluded to a novel risk for tocilizumab. Case?control analysis showed an increased risk for two phytotherapeutics: harpagophytum and valerian radix. Conclusions Our study quantified the pancreatotoxic risk of different drugs and phytotherapeutics. The findings corroborate previous results from the literature but also indicate risks for substances not previously reported, highlighting the need for further controlled studies on pancreatic toxicity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Comprised of the sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, and enteric nervous system, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) provides the neural control of all parts of the body except for skeletal muscles. The ANS has the major responsibility to ensure that the physiological integrity of cells, tissues, and organs throughout the entire body is maintained (homeostasis) in the face of perturbations exerted by both the external and internal environments. Many commonly prescribed drugs, over-the-counter drugs, toxins, and toxicants function by altering transmission within the ANS. Autonomic dysfunction is a signature of many neurological diseases or disorders. Despite the physiological relevance of the ANS, most neuroscience textbooks offer very limited coverage of this portion of the nervous system. This review article provides both historical and current information about the anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. The ultimate aim is for this article to be a valuable resource for those interested in learning the basics of these two components of the ANS and to appreciate its importance in both health and disease. Other resources should be consulted for a thorough understanding of the third division of the ANS, the enteric nervous system. ? 2016 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 6:1239-1278, 2016.
