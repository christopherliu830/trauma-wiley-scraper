AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.

AB  - Laminin is required for normal peripheral nerve development, as mutations causing absence of laminin-2 cause hereditary peripheral neuropathies (neuropathy of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and dystrophic mouse). We study the laminin receptors, integrins and dystroglycan, that link laminin in the basal lamina to the Schwann cells cytoskeleton. This linkage is defective in an animal model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F, in which the Periaxin/Dystrogycan/DRP-2 complex is disrupted. To study the role of laminin receptors in these peripheral neuropathies, we inactivated the gene for beta1 integrin and dystroglycan specifically in Schwann cells of transgenic mice. alpha6beta1 integrin is present in Schwann cells and their precursors before myelination, the absence of beta1 integrin causes a severe peripheral neuropathy due to the failure of Schwann cells to interact with axons during axonal sorting. Although more severe, this neuropathy is morphologically similar to that of dystrophic mice. In contrast, dystroglycan first appears in Schwann cells after axonal sorting and just prior to myelination (pro-myelinating Schwann cells). In the absence of dystroglycan, mice develop a neuropathy with abnormally folded myelin sheaths, slow conduction velocity and loss of DRP-2, similar to that of periaxin-null mice. These data show that alpha6beta1 integrin and dystroglycan subserve different roles during nerve development, and that they are involved at different steps in the pathogenesis of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F.

AB  - The present study was performed with the aim to compare different clinically-based neurotoxicity scales with a more extended composite scale (Total Neuropathy Scale) already validated in diabetic patients, in order to improve the grading of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity. The features of CIPN were evaluated in a series of women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel? based chemotherapy by clinical examination, neurophysiology and quantitative sensory testing of vibration threshold (VDT); the ECOG, Ajani and NCIC-CTC grades were assessed by a neurologist after clinical examination and the TNS was calculated after additional instrumental examination. At the same time, the treating oncologist, who was blinded as regards the results of the neurological examination, assessed the NCIC-CTC sensory neurotoxicity grade. The correlation existing between the different evaluations was evaluated with the Spearman test on a total of 97 visits. Our results indicate for all the neurotoxicity scales commonly used by oncologists and evaluated in this study a significant correlation with TNS; the interexaminer agreement comparison evaluation evidenced that in several cases the neurologist attributed a higher grade in the NCIC-CTC scale than the oncologist, and this discrepancy was mainly due to a different evaluation of the sensory impairment. In conclusion, the TNS can be used to assess effectively the severity of CIPN and the results of this evaluation can be reliably correlated with the oncological grading of sensory peripheral neurotoxicity; the wider range of TNS values, however, can allow a more accurate grading of the sensory impairment, a feature which can improve the estimate of CIPN changes, particularly in clinical trials; finally, the use of standardized methods of examination of the sensory function (e.g. the semiquantitative measure of vibration sensibility using the 128?Hz tuning fork) may reduce the interexaminer disagreement.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.

AB  - A 38-year-old man begun to have paresthesias in the last three fingers of the left hand followed in few months by paresthesias in the right hand, weakness of distal muscles in upper limbs and paresthesias of lower limbs. HCV positivity was discovered by routine blood test. Neurological examination, 18 months after onset, showed asymmetric weakness and sensory loss with a nerve distribution more on the right side. Electrophysiological examination showed a sensory-motor demyelinating neuropathy with motor conduction blocks and or excessive temporal dispersion of proximal compound muscle action potential in five nerves. Coexistence of focal motor and sensory conduction blocks at the same sites was demonstrated in three nerves. CSF examination showed increased protein content (66?mg/dl) and no cells. Cryoglobulins were absent. Active HCV-RNA replication was detected in the serum by RT-PCR. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis. Sural nerve biopsy showed fiber loss, prevalently of large diameter fibers, asymmetrical between fascicles and few clusters of regeneration. There were no demyelinating features, onion bulbs or inflammatory infiltrates. Weakness and electrophysiological findings worsened after high doses intravenous immunoglobulins but improved after intravenous methylprednisolone and interferon alpha treatment with resolution of conduction blocks in two months. Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), as in the patient we describe, is a rare disorder considered an asymmetric variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). HCV infection is usually associated with a multineuropathy due to vasculitis or a symmetric sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. CIDP has been described but never MADSAM. It is difficult to be sure of a pathogenetic link between a dysimmune demyelinating neuropathy and HCV infection, nonetheless the coexistence of hepatitis makes the choice of treatment problematic in these patients.

AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1991, five sets of electrophysiological criteria for CIDP have been reported. However, until now, receiver operator characteristic (ROC), such as sensitivity and specificity, of only AAN criteria were investigated, showing a high specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. The application of these criteria may be useful in clinical trials, but is inadequate in clinical practice, since they preclude immunomodulating treatment in patients who do not meet them. OBJECTIVE: 1) to evaluate the ROC and predictive value of five different electrophysiological criteria for CIDP (AAN, INCAT, Rotta et?al, Nicholas et?al. and Saperstein et?al.); 2) to identify the most informative electrophysiological features indicative of demyelination by mean of the likelihood ratio; 3) to determine, in our series of cases, a set of minimal electrophysiological criteria (albeit aspecific) enough sensitive for CIDP diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, progressive for at least 2 months, with weakness in least two limbs and documented improvement in strength in response to immunotherapy. Other potential causes were excluded, including diabetes and IgM paraproteinemia with or without anti-MAG reactivity. Twelve patients with axonal polyneuropathy associated with diabetes and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were included as controls. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated according to all five sets of NCS criteria and ROC was calculated. Likelihood ratio for CIDP was evaluated for each set of NCS criteria and for presence of each of the following features in different number of nerves: motor conduction velocities (MCV), conduction blocks/temporal dispersion, distal motor (DML) and F-wave latencies (FWL). MCV, DML and FWL were considered indicative of demyelination if decreased or increased as suggested by AAN criteria. Results will be discussed.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.
