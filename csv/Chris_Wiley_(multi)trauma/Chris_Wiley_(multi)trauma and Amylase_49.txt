AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies and Déjérine-Sottas Syndrome are associated with mutations in the gene encoding Myelin Protein Zero. Here we report the characterization of two lines of transgenic mice expressing, in addition to the wild type protein, different point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0: the first is a deletion of Ser63 (DSer63), described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B patients, whereas the second is a substitution of Ser 63 with a Cys (Ser63Cys) reported in a Déjérine-Sottas patient. By crossing the transgenic mice with P0 null mice, we produced animals that expressed only the mutated P0. We then investigated in vivo the expression and the effect of the two mutated proteins by morphological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0DSer63 show severe hypomyelination, with the presence of onion bulbs and some uncompacted myelin sheaths. P0DSer63 does not reach the myelin sheaths and it accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it is probably degraded. In contrast, sciatic nerves of mice expressing P0Ser63Cys present a milder hypomyelination with rare onion bulbs and, surprisingly, normal myelin sheaths. The mutated protein is a full-length protein that, presumably, is integrated into the myelin sheaths. This study demonstrates that different mutations in P0 glycoprotein, leading to disorders of different severity in human, have different fates in the Schwann cells.

AB  - Laminin is required for normal peripheral nerve development, as mutations causing absence of laminin-2 cause hereditary peripheral neuropathies (neuropathy of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and dystrophic mouse). We study the laminin receptors, integrins and dystroglycan, that link laminin in the basal lamina to the Schwann cells cytoskeleton. This linkage is defective in an animal model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F, in which the Periaxin/Dystrogycan/DRP-2 complex is disrupted. To study the role of laminin receptors in these peripheral neuropathies, we inactivated the gene for beta1 integrin and dystroglycan specifically in Schwann cells of transgenic mice. alpha6beta1 integrin is present in Schwann cells and their precursors before myelination, the absence of beta1 integrin causes a severe peripheral neuropathy due to the failure of Schwann cells to interact with axons during axonal sorting. Although more severe, this neuropathy is morphologically similar to that of dystrophic mice. In contrast, dystroglycan first appears in Schwann cells after axonal sorting and just prior to myelination (pro-myelinating Schwann cells). In the absence of dystroglycan, mice develop a neuropathy with abnormally folded myelin sheaths, slow conduction velocity and loss of DRP-2, similar to that of periaxin-null mice. These data show that alpha6beta1 integrin and dystroglycan subserve different roles during nerve development, and that they are involved at different steps in the pathogenesis of Merosin-Deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4F.

AB  - The present study was performed with the aim to compare different clinically-based neurotoxicity scales with a more extended composite scale (Total Neuropathy Scale) already validated in diabetic patients, in order to improve the grading of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) severity. The features of CIPN were evaluated in a series of women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel? based chemotherapy by clinical examination, neurophysiology and quantitative sensory testing of vibration threshold (VDT); the ECOG, Ajani and NCIC-CTC grades were assessed by a neurologist after clinical examination and the TNS was calculated after additional instrumental examination. At the same time, the treating oncologist, who was blinded as regards the results of the neurological examination, assessed the NCIC-CTC sensory neurotoxicity grade. The correlation existing between the different evaluations was evaluated with the Spearman test on a total of 97 visits. Our results indicate for all the neurotoxicity scales commonly used by oncologists and evaluated in this study a significant correlation with TNS; the interexaminer agreement comparison evaluation evidenced that in several cases the neurologist attributed a higher grade in the NCIC-CTC scale than the oncologist, and this discrepancy was mainly due to a different evaluation of the sensory impairment. In conclusion, the TNS can be used to assess effectively the severity of CIPN and the results of this evaluation can be reliably correlated with the oncological grading of sensory peripheral neurotoxicity; the wider range of TNS values, however, can allow a more accurate grading of the sensory impairment, a feature which can improve the estimate of CIPN changes, particularly in clinical trials; finally, the use of standardized methods of examination of the sensory function (e.g. the semiquantitative measure of vibration sensibility using the 128?Hz tuning fork) may reduce the interexaminer disagreement.

AB  - Study aim: the Ebf gene family has been implicated in several developmental processes, ranging from B-cell development to neuronal differentiation. As the murine Ebf2 gene is expressed in numerous sites of nervous system, Ebf2-null mice develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to defective migration of gonadotropin releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons, and a peripheral neuropathy as well. Therefore, we aimed to study whether electrophysiological tests would be able to detect abnormalities of peripheral nerve function. Methods: 2 groups of mice were studied, which consisted of 8 Ebf2-/- mice and 9 age-matched controls. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the ankle and at the ischiatic notch; the compound motor action potential (cMAP) was recorded from the paw muscles with a pair of needle electrodes to measure the motor conduction velocity (MCV). Results: MCV mean values were lower in Ebf2-/-(21.8?m/sec; SD 2.9) than in controls (35.2?m/sec; SD 2.6) and the difference was significant (p?<?0.001). The mean cMAP amplitude was also decreased in Ebf2-/-(6.2?mV; SD 2.7) as compared to controls (9.3?mV; SD 2.6, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: electrophysiological tests demonstrated a sharp decrease of sciatic MCV in Ebf2-/- mouse, as consequence of defective axon sorting, segmental dysmyelination and axonal damage revealed by pathological study.

AB  - A 38-year-old man begun to have paresthesias in the last three fingers of the left hand followed in few months by paresthesias in the right hand, weakness of distal muscles in upper limbs and paresthesias of lower limbs. HCV positivity was discovered by routine blood test. Neurological examination, 18 months after onset, showed asymmetric weakness and sensory loss with a nerve distribution more on the right side. Electrophysiological examination showed a sensory-motor demyelinating neuropathy with motor conduction blocks and or excessive temporal dispersion of proximal compound muscle action potential in five nerves. Coexistence of focal motor and sensory conduction blocks at the same sites was demonstrated in three nerves. CSF examination showed increased protein content (66?mg/dl) and no cells. Cryoglobulins were absent. Active HCV-RNA replication was detected in the serum by RT-PCR. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis. Sural nerve biopsy showed fiber loss, prevalently of large diameter fibers, asymmetrical between fascicles and few clusters of regeneration. There were no demyelinating features, onion bulbs or inflammatory infiltrates. Weakness and electrophysiological findings worsened after high doses intravenous immunoglobulins but improved after intravenous methylprednisolone and interferon alpha treatment with resolution of conduction blocks in two months. Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), as in the patient we describe, is a rare disorder considered an asymmetric variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). HCV infection is usually associated with a multineuropathy due to vasculitis or a symmetric sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. CIDP has been described but never MADSAM. It is difficult to be sure of a pathogenetic link between a dysimmune demyelinating neuropathy and HCV infection, nonetheless the coexistence of hepatitis makes the choice of treatment problematic in these patients.

AB  - The axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT type 2) has autosomal dominant inheritance and is genetically heterogeneous. Only 2 genes are known so far. Two unrelated Caucasian pedigrees (from Russia and Belgium) had 2 distinct mutations in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L)(CMT2E, chromosome 8p21); a single Japanese pedigree had a mutation in the kinesin 1B gene (KIF1B?)(CMT2A, chromosome 1p35-p36). We aimed at investigating the epidemiological relevance of NF-L in an Italian series with CMT2. The series included 30 index cases with CMT2 diagnosed according to clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria, in whom we have ruled out mutations of MPZ/P0 and CX32. In the selected series, the entire coding region of NF-L was investigated by automated direct nucleotide sequencing. Direct molecular test of the novel identified mutation was performed by analyzing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for AatII. In a single five-generation pedigree, with 3 affected member examined, we identified a novel heterozygous c.64C?>?T transition which substitutes a proline with a serine at amino acid residue 22 (Pro22Ser). The mutation appeared to be pathogenic because it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and it was absent in more than 100 healthy controls. The amino acid change occurs in the N-terminal head domain which regulates the assembly of neurofilaments. The report emphasizes the etiological role of NF-L in CMT2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1991, five sets of electrophysiological criteria for CIDP have been reported. However, until now, receiver operator characteristic (ROC), such as sensitivity and specificity, of only AAN criteria were investigated, showing a high specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. The application of these criteria may be useful in clinical trials, but is inadequate in clinical practice, since they preclude immunomodulating treatment in patients who do not meet them. OBJECTIVE: 1) to evaluate the ROC and predictive value of five different electrophysiological criteria for CIDP (AAN, INCAT, Rotta et?al, Nicholas et?al. and Saperstein et?al.); 2) to identify the most informative electrophysiological features indicative of demyelination by mean of the likelihood ratio; 3) to determine, in our series of cases, a set of minimal electrophysiological criteria (albeit aspecific) enough sensitive for CIDP diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, progressive for at least 2 months, with weakness in least two limbs and documented improvement in strength in response to immunotherapy. Other potential causes were excluded, including diabetes and IgM paraproteinemia with or without anti-MAG reactivity. Twelve patients with axonal polyneuropathy associated with diabetes and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were included as controls. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated according to all five sets of NCS criteria and ROC was calculated. Likelihood ratio for CIDP was evaluated for each set of NCS criteria and for presence of each of the following features in different number of nerves: motor conduction velocities (MCV), conduction blocks/temporal dispersion, distal motor (DML) and F-wave latencies (FWL). MCV, DML and FWL were considered indicative of demyelination if decreased or increased as suggested by AAN criteria. Results will be discussed.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to report changes in muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) and other cardiovascular variables during central apnea occurring during a relaxed wakefulness. We describe a 47-year-old man with a five-year history of apnea. Polysomnographic recording showed repeated central apnea, without an obstructive peripheral component, during sleep or relaxed wakefulness. Neuromuscular disease was excluded by EMG investigation. During relaxed wake, MSA was evaluated by a microneurographic recording from the left peroneal nerve in association with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), thoracoabdominal respiration and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Microneurographic polygraphic recording was performed during normal respiration (5 minutes) and during repeated apnea episodes (4 consecutive episodes with mean duration of 26.2?s; range 18?45). During normal respiration, MSA was 39.5 burst/min and 64.7 bursts/100 heartbeats, the heart rate was 61.1 beat/min. During the apnea episodes, both MSA (29% and 27%: 50.9 burst/min e 82.1 bursts/100 heartbeats respectively; mean values) and HR (1%: 61.9 beat/min; mean values) increased. The maximum MSA and HR increase was reached at the end of apnea and was followed by a BP increase. Spontaneous SSR were absent during apnea episodes whereas sporadic responses were recorded after the apnea episodes when the breathing acts were wide and prolonged. In conclusion, central apnea caused an increase in MSA and minor increase in HR leading to a BP increase following the apnea episode.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a monophasic illness. Early nadir and lack of multiple relapses have differentiated it from the chronic form (CIDP). We present a case whose unusual course overlaps both disorders. A 71-year-old man presented with paresthesiae and weakness evolving over 1-week period, 2 weeks after an upper respiratory infection. Spinal fluid analysis and electrophysiologic findings supported the clinical diagnosis of GBS. He was treated with a 5-day course of IVIG with rapid, almost complete recovery over the following 10 days. Four weeks later, his symptoms recurred. Another dose of IVIG produced rapid but transient improvement. He was started on oral steroids but continued to deteriorate. Clinical and laboratory reevaluation confirmed the presence of an inflammatory polyradiculopathy; IVIG was resumed. Over the following 3 months, his clinical course was characterized by 3 increasingly severe deteriorations, the last one to quadriplegia, severe bulbar dysfunction requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement, ophthalmoplegia and autonomic dysfunction. Transient improvements occurred between these relapses. Aggressive treatment, which included IVIG, plasma exchange, IV steroids and IV cyclophosphamide, did not produce sustained benefit. He remained pseudo-locked-in for 10 days. Another 5-day IVIG course was completed; he began to improve and continued to do so over the following 5 weeks. The nadir of GBS is usually reached within 4 weeks. Treatment fluctuations usually occur within the first weeks, and relapse during the recovery phase is often limited and isolated. Multiple relapses until a defined nadir are highly uncommon. The bulbar and cranial nerve involvement, rapidity of the relapses, dysautonomia, need for mechanical ventilation, and improving electrophysiology all argue against the diagnosis of CIDP. It remains unknown whether repeated doses of IVIG could change the natural course of this disease leading to such an unusual temporal profile.

AB  - Nerve injuries associated with surgical operations are well recognized and described in literature. Ulnar neuropathy, brachial plexus, and lumbosacral roots injuries are the most frequent as shown by two large reviews on anesthesia-related nerve damage from the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed claims study (Kroll DA 1990, Cheney FW 1999). Several factors such as section, compression, traction, and ischemia, contribute to the nerve injuries but the exact mechanism(s) in an individual case often is unclear. We describe a case of perioperative bilateral median neuropathy at the distal forearm, an uncommon site of nerve injury, which we ascribe to demyelinative conduction block secondary to nerve compression. Nerve conduction studies precisely localized the area of abnormality. There is a limited understanding of the relationships between conventional perioperative care and the genesis of peripheral nerve lesions. As a result, there is a lack of agreement in literature on the correct standards for positioning the patient during anesthesia. In selected cases nerve conduction studies at the onset of symptoms may provide insights into localization, mechanism and prognosis of nerve lesions. We believe that a timely and proper electrophysiological study may be helpful for understanding the perioperative nerve injuries as well as for determining the best preventive strategies.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in patients with ischemic stroke. We investigated its efficacy in preventing and reversing established nerve disorders in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes. After STZ injection (60?mg/kg/ip), EPO (5000 units/kg b.w. i.p. three times a week) was started in a group of rats and continued for five weeks (prevention schedule). In another group of diabetic rats, EPO was started six weeks after STZ, continued for five weeks (therapeutic schedule). Groups of non-diabetic control rats were similarly treated. Antidromic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the tail was assessed at five weeks for all groups and at 11 weeks for the therapeutic schedule. Compared to non-diabetic rats, NCV was 21% lower (P?<?0.001) at five weeks in the STZ group, EPO partially prevented this decrease (14% lower than with non-diabetic controls), with a significant difference from the untreated-diabetic group (P?<?0.01). After six weeks of uncontrolled diabetes, at the beginning of therapeutic EPO, NCV was reduced by 23% and after 11 weeks by 40%, EPO efficacy was confirmed. Thermal (hot plate method) and mechanical (Randall-Selitto method) nociceptive thresholds were monitored weekly throughout the study. In addition, in all groups, the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers, which reflects possible degeneration of somatic unmyelinated fibers, was assessed in the hindpaw using protein-gene-product 9.5 immunostaining. Rats developed mechanical hyperalgesia within two weeks after STZ injection. Both the prevention and therapeutic schedules of EPO reduced diabetic hyperalgesia after two weeks of treatment, reaching statistical significance at fur, and five weeks of treatment, with no such effect in non-diabetic controls. Hindpaw thermal response latencies were significantly (P?<?0.001) increased in untreated diabetic rats compared with untreated controls. EPO had no effect on these latencies in control rats but partially prevented the increase in diabetic rats, so the values were still different from controls, but significantly different from untreated diabetics at four and five weeks in both the prevention and therapeutic studies (P?<?0.05). These observations extend the therapeutic utility of EPO and highlight its potential for treating established diabetic neuropathies.

AB  - Several effective antineoplastic drugs are severely neurotoxic and induce the onset of disabling peripheral neuropathies. The clinical presentation of this side effect depends on the type of antineoplastic agent administered. The signs and symptoms shown are predominantly motor (e.g. in the case of vinca alkaloids), sensorimotor (e.g. with the taxanes) or sensory (e.g. using platinum-derived drugs). The pathogenesis of these antineoplastic drug-induced peripheral neuropathies is still poorly understood, although a relationship has been suggested between some neuronal growth factors (neurotrophins) and the toxic action of cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel. In this study we correlated the changes in the circulating levels of Nerve Growth factor (NGF) in a series of 24 women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy with the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) as assessed by the Total Neuropathy Score (TNS). After informed consent, blood samples were drawn before chemotherapy and after treatment and NGF circulating levels were determined by ELISA (EmaxTM ImmunoAssay System, Promega, USA; plasma working dilutions NGF 1:80) following the manufacturer protocols. The results obtained in this series of patients evidenced a significant correlation between the severity of CIPN and the reduction in the circulating levels of NGF (r?=???0.480, p?=?0.017 by two-tailed Spearman correlation test, 95% CL ?0.745 to ?0.082), thus confirming similar results previously obtained in a rat model of CDDP peripheral neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our data suggest that a relationship exists between CIPN and NGF circulating levels in patients treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel. Therefore, this preliminary observation support the need for further studies in order to explore the possibility of reducing the severity of platinum-drug sensory neurotoxicity with treatments aimed at increasing the circulating levels of NGF.

AB  - To our knowledge there are no evidence of other multientrapment neuropathy related to growth hormone (GH) administration. We observed the case of a 45 year-old bodybuilder complaining of paraesthesias and dysaesthesias in hands and feet after self-administration of high-dose of recombinant GH therapy. The patient complained of these transitory symptoms after each cycle of GH therapy. Electrodiagnostic studies showed: 1)?moderate? right CTS and ?minimal? left CTS; 2)?mild? right ulnar entrapment at elbow; 3) decrease in left ulnar motor nerve conduction in the segment across the elbow; 4) decrease in left ulnar sensory nerve action potential amplitude; and 5) bilateral absence of ulnar nerve F-wave from abductor digiti minimi. Our data suggested multiple nerve entrapment at upper limbs. Moreover, basing on the history of feet paraesthesia, we hypothesized a mild involvement of distal sensory fibers in the legs, which was not assessed by neurophysiological studies. The anecdotal history and neurophysiological findings of this case suggest that more attention should be paid to the adverse effects of GH on peripheral nerves.

AB  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been transferred with third generation lentiviral vectors, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the human PGK promoter, and transplanted in wild type mice. Transplanted mice have been sacrificed at 6, and 9 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to study the timing and extent of migration of BM derived transduced cells into peripheral nervous system (PNS). Starting from 6 months after BMT cells have been found in the PNS, such as in the acoustic ganglion, the dorsal root ganglions (DRG) and the sciatic nerve. At 9 months from transplant GFP positive cells represented the 50?60% of the F4/80 (a microglial marker) positive population of sciatic nerve sections and the 65?75% of F4/80?+ cells of the acoustic ganglion and DRG. At these sites, GFP positive cells were found between nerve fibers and neurons, they expressed F4/80, and were negative for GFAP, neuronal and myelin markers. Autologous BMT coupled with HSC transduction with high efficiency vectors could provide therapeutic benefit to several disorders affecting the PNS such as many lysosomal storage disorders. In these patients clinical evidence confirms the relevance of PNS involvement in the prognosis of the disease.

AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Behçet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.
