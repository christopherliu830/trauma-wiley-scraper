AB  - Platinum compounds are very effective anti-cancer agents and act forming adducts with DNA and cytoplasmic proteins. Their main dose-limiting side effect is peripheral neurotoxicity. Cisplatin neurotoxicity has been studied in many in vitro and in vivo models but little information is available for oxaliplatin. In this study we evaluated and compared the effect of cisplatin and oxaliplatin (a gift from Debiopharm S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in an in vitro model of neurotoxicity using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which may be considered as neuroblasts. Both platinum compounds are toxic and induce cellular death by apoptosis. Oxaliplatin is less neurotoxic than cisplatin. Concentrations of oxaliplatin 3?4 times higher than those of cisplatin are necessary to induce the same percentage of cellular death. We analyzed the activation/inactivation of specific molecules involved in the apoptotic transduction pathway. After exposure to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and thus could not exert its anti-apoptotic action. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, caspase 3, and caspase 7 were activated. In our experiments in SH-SY5Y cells treated with cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the amount of p53 protein was markedly increased. In treated cultures, both caspase 3 and 7 were cleaved with the appearance of their active fragments which induced PARP cleavage. Our results suggest that neurotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin share a similar pathway. Neurotoxicity induced by platinum compounds is due not only to DNA damage but also to the activation of specific molecular pathways committing cells to apoptosis.

AB  - A 69-year-old right-handed man was recently referred to our institution with a two-month history of diplopia and ptosis in his left eye: the ocular symptoms typically fluctuates during the day, being least severe in the morning and worsening as the day progress or while reading or driving. Neostigmine injection produced a clear improvement of weakness. The serum concentration of anti-AChR antibody was elevated >?8.4?nmol/L (NV?<?0.4); a chest CT scan was unremarkable with no evidence of mediastinal mass. The clinical picture and laboratory tests support the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia. His past medical history was insignificant until the age of 59. At that time, he complained with a diffuse, slightly asymmetrical muscle weakness both in the upper and lower limbs and sensory symptoms of glove and stocking distribution (numbness). A progressive course over months was seen with hand and anterior leg muscles hypertrophy becoming evident. Strength was decreased distally greater than proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. The cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a protein level of 72?mg/dl (NV?<?45?mg/dl). Nerve conduction study showed a multifocal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with both conduction block/temporal dispersion of the C-MAP and slowing of the velocity. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered and the patient was treated with steroids, plasmapheresis and azathiaprine: after a slight improvement, the condition has been stabilized. Both MG and CIDP have been individually associated with disorders of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis. Their concurrence is rarely found (less than 10 cases to the best of our knowledge): although the existence of this syndrome can be strongly supported by the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory data, a common basic abnormality of immune regulation is still unknown.

AB  - A process of motor units (MU) rearrangement may compensate the loss of motor neurons in spinal cord anterior horns in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), at least in the early stages of the disease. Standard electromyography is unable to precisely quantify these pathological changes. Recently, Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) has been introduced in clinical practice in order to provide a quantitative measure of the process as well as short- and long-term follow-up data. We investigated 8 male patients (mean age?±?SD: 64?±?10.9?yrs, range 45?78) affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria. In order to quantify the total number of motor units, MUNE was performed during the diagnostic work-up (basal, T0), after three (T1) and six months (T2), in abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (16.6% at T1 [p?<?0.002] and 37.9% at T2 [p?<?0.04]), recording from ADM, while the decrease in mean and maximal area did not reach the statistical significance at the same time intervals. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (20.6% at T1 [p?<?0.008] and 40.3% at T2 [p?<?0.0006]), but not in the mean and maximal area, recording from TA. According to previous data, we found about a loss of about 50% motor units in both the muscles six months after diagnosis. We conclude that MUNE is a useful tool to quantify MU loss in ALS and may result helpful in following the course of ALS and in predicting the prognosis.

AB  - In the nervous system nitric oxide (NO) has been involved as a regulatory molecule in several physiological and pathological events, such as cerebral microcirculation, synaptic plasticity, neural damage, and neuroprotection. The activation of the three isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS), synthesize NO from L-arginine. Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, iNOS can produce copious amounts of NO for prolonged periods that triggers cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. This has been considered as a key process in demyelination of both CNS and PNS with a destructive and/or protective controversial role. This study shows by Northern blot analysis that during experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), at the beginning of clinical signs, there is a transient extensive iNOS mRNA induction in nerve roots, which morphology is characterized by severe demyelination, but not in sciatic nerve, where scattered axonal degeneration is evident. Immunocytochemistry performed on teased nerve fibers and ultrastructural analysis showed that iNOS was localized in both inflammatory and Schwann cells, and analysis of cell membrane permeability detected with fluorescent dyes showed a diffuse necrotic phenotype in PNS. With EAN clinical spontaneous recovery, endoneurial iNOS was rapidly down-regulated and in nerve roots almost all cells shifted their membrane permeability to an apoptotic phenotype, whilst necrosis persisted in sciatic nerve, until complete clinical recovery, when both root and nerve returned normal. These data support the hypothesis that, during cell-mediated demyelination, iNOS may influence Schwann cell-axon relationship causing axonal damage and regulating endoneurial cell life and death.

AB  - Antibodies to different neural antigens have been reported in patients with dysimmune neuropathies but their pathogenetic role in these diseases is still debated. In order to identify other possible protein target antigens in these diseases we tested by immunoblot IgG and IgM reactivity with human cauda equina and spinal cord in the sera from 30 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 14 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and 11 with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). As controls we examined sera from 11 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 68 with other neurological and non-neurological diseases (OND) and 28 normal subjects. We found high titers (>1/800) of IgG antibodies to some protein bands of the approximate molecular weight (MW) of 45?50?kDa in spinal cord but not cauda equina, in 20 patients (67%) with GBS, and 1 each with MMN and CIDP (9% and 7%, respectively)(GBS vs. MMN/CIDP p?<?0.05). In 16?GBS positive patients this reactivity was re-tested and found reduced during recovery. A similar IgG reactivity with the 45?50?kDa bands was found in 2 patients (18%) with ALS (GBS vs. ALS p?<?0.05), 15 (23%) with OND (GBS vs. OND p?<?0.001) and in no normal subject. Since the MW of reactive bands corresponded to that of Glial Fibrillar Acidic Protein (GFAP), we tested the serum from 6 intensely positive GBS patients (titers of 1/6400 up to 1/12800) for IgG reactivity with purified GFAP by immunoblot. In four of them IgG bound to GFAP in a pattern similar to that observed with a commercial anti-GFAP antibody. Pre-incubation of one of these sera with purified GFAP completely abolished IgG reactivity with GFAP by immunoblot. This study shows that anti-GFAP IgG antibodies are significantly increased during the acute phase of GBS and decrease during recovery. Further investigation is necessary to clarify their possible pathogenetic role in the disease.

AB  - A 41-year-old man suffered for 1 year of severe progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy that rendered him bedridden in few months. Routine laboratory investigations, including serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, were normal. Electrophysiological studies and sural nerve biopsy showed a severe mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy. X-ray showed multiple osteosclerotic lesions in the spine. MRI disclosed pachymeningeal thickening of the brain and meningeal infiltration at cauda equina level with gadolinium enhancement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 12% of plasma cells with a monotypic immunocytochemical profile for lambda light chain. A diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma (OM) was done. He received two courses of IVIg followed by melphalan and prednisone without any benefit. Very recently he underwent a bone marrow autotransplantation. OM is a rare variant of multiple myeloma, representing less than 3% of all myeloma cases. In contrast to multiple myeloma, in OM half of patients have a peripheral neuropathy similar to CIDP, with or without features of POEMS syndrome. MRI meningeal involvement, concomitant with a severe neuropathy, was not yet described in OM. A paraneoplastic process in addition to a direct neoplastic infiltration may account for the severity of the disease in our patient, despite different therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Unclassified neuropathies still represent a challenge for neurologists, since in about 20?30% of patients no cause can be identified after extensive investigations. In this context, some patients sharing peculiar features have been reported as to be grouped in a single entity termed Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP). The onset occurs in middle to late adulthood, there is a predominant sensory involvement and progression is slow, usually not disabling. Electrophysiologic and pathological studies are consistent with a primary axonal injury. We describe five patients affected by adult-onset chronic ?idiopathic? axonal neuropathy with an unusual course characterized by severe disability. Onset occurred in the fifth-seventh decades with sensorimotor symptoms and signs involving both lower and upper limbs with a distal distribution. Over a 2?14 year follow-up, the disease showed a progressive course with severe muscle weakness and atrophy of semi-distal and distal muscles in all patients, and involvement of proximal muscles in four of them. Two patients died because of respiratory and heart failure. All five patients were sporadic. Extensive laboratory examination excluded identifiable causes of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy was carried out in all patients and showed an axonal neuropathy. Amyloid deposits were not observed in nerve sections nor in abdominal fat aspirate. In four patients, treatment with steroids and IVIg was unsuccessful. The nosology of acquired adult-onset axonal polyneuropathies is difficult to be drawn, since in most cases the etiology remains obscure. Our findings suggest that, in this not yet well defined group of neuropathies, different subtypes may exist and represent distinct entities.

AB  - We describe two first cousins presenting a CMT phenotype associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) in one of them. The propositus (ML), a 37-year-old man, showed a severe muscular involvement both proximal and distal, bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, hypophonia, bilateral pes cavus and absence of deep tendon reflexes (DTR). The cousin (MC), a 27-year-old man, showed a CMT phenotype with marked peroneal atrophy, pes cavus and absence of DTR. Cranial nerves were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed in the propositus, a severe axonal and demyelinating neuropathy and clear myopathic features at EMG. Accordingly, muscle biopsy showed both signs of mitochondrial myopathy and chronic denervation. Furthermore, nerve biopsy confirmed the severe axonal loss and showed abnormalities of myelin sheath which was thinner in relation to the axon diameter. In MC the electrophysiological study and the muscle and nerve biopsies showed only signs of a marked axonal neuropathy. Genetic analysis showed in the propositus a new homozygous mutation in POLG gene that encodes the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. The same mutation was present in the heterozygous state in his parents and in MC. Moreover, the recent observation that mutations in GDAP1 gene could be associated with both axonal and demyelinating autosomal recessive CMT, prompted us to search for point mutations in this gene. However, the direct sequencing of GDAP1 gene did not show any mutation. In conclusion we describe two cousins presumably affected by an axonal autosomal recessive CMT. The presence in the propositus of the homozygous mutation of polymerase gamma gene adds to the CMT phenotype the myopathic features and PEO. It is questionable if in ML the axon hypomyelination could depend on the POLG gene mutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with both IgM paraproteinemia and anti-MAG antibody (MAG-PN) is regarded as a clinical entity distinct from chronic inflammatory demyelinating PN (CIDP) even in association with paraproteinemia. MAG-PN satisfy current electrophysiological criteria for CIDP and 18 to 37 % of patients fulfilling these criteria have high titers of IgM anti-MAG antibody (Ab). Anti-MAG Ab assay is rather expensive and time consuming, thus resulting sometimes in delaying the appropriate treatment in patients without these Ab. On the contrary, patients with MAG-PN may be treated inappropriately before anti-MAG Ab detection. OBJECTIVE: Determining the predictive value of clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN for the presence of anti-MAG Ab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CIDP established by Rotta et?al. (2001) were prospectively included. All of them were submitted to anti-MAG Ab assay and research of paraproteinemia. The following features at the initial evaluation were considered for the analysis: presence of distal or proximal weakness at limbs, asymmetry of motor deficit, presence of sensory ataxia, presence of vibration or pinprick sense deficit, presence of conduction blocks, low terminal latency index (TLI) in at least two nerves at upper limbs, absence of M-response (CMAP) at lower limbs. A discriminative analysis method was used to determine which features were significantly associated with the presence of anti-MAG Ab, then sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of these features were calculated. RESULTS: Low TLI, absence of CMAP at lower limbs, absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs, were the features significantly associated with the presence of anti-;MAG Ab. The combination of low TLI in two nerves and absence of CMAP at lower limbs or low TLI and absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs had the greatest sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, resulting in a very high increase in probability that a patient had MAG-PN. DISCUSSION: Low TLI value in at least two upper limb nerves, absence of CMAP and of proximal weakness at lower limbs are the most informative features indicating the presence of anti-MAG Ab in patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN.

AB  - We report a case of a 50- year-old patient, diagnosed as having mycosis fungoides since 1 year, was admitted to our Hospital for progressive weakness and sensory loss in upper and lower limbs. On neurological examination, moderate weakness of the distal muscles of upper and lower limbs, ataxia, loss of proprioceptive and tactile sensation of the hands and foot and diffuse areflexia were noticed. The electrophysiological evaluation revealed signs of prevalent axonal sensory-motor polyradiculoneuropathy and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a marked increase of proteins and a mild increase of cells. A biopsy of the sural nerve revealed a severe axonal loss with preservation of myelin. The possible pathogenetic mechanism of this extremely rare peripheral neuropathy and the differences from previous reports are discussed.

AB  - The availability of antibodies against the pan-axonal marker protein-gene-protein 9.5 (PGP) allowed to definitely demonstrate the existence of small-diameter nerve fibers within the vital layers of the epidermis and prompted to their quantification in sensory neuropathies. However, morphological features of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) have not been fully characterized. We performed immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies in skin biopsies taken in 15 healthy subjects at the proximal thigh or the distal leg using anti-PGP, anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), anti-non-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein-1B (MAP-1B), anti-70 and 200?kDa neurofilament (NF), anti-phosphorylated neurofilament-312 (SMI), anti-peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), anti-basic myelin protein (MBP), and anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies. IENF density was quantified under light microscope using PGP, TuJ1, MAP-1B, NF, and SMI immunostaining. In each site, the density of TuJ1- and MAP-1B-positive IENF was similar to that of PGP-positive IENF, whereas that of NF-positive IENF was significantly lower. Only sporadic SMI-positive IENF were found. Double confocal staining studies confirmed that TuJ1 and MAP-1B diffusely co-localized with PGP in IENF. These findings suggest that IENF cytoskeleton is predominantly composed by tubules, whereas neurofilaments are less represented. No IENF showed PMP22, MBP, or MAG labeling. All dermal nerve fibers presented PMP22 immunoreactivity, which labeled Schwann cell membrane, whereas only a few of them were MBP- or MAG-positive, confirming that most fibers are unmyelinated. Double staining confocal microscope studies revealed that PMP22 labeling in dermal nerves stopped at the dermal-epidermal junction, whereas TuJ1-positive axons crossed it and run between keratinocytes. This definitely demonstrates that IENF are naked axons, arising from sub-papillary unmyelinated nerves which loose the Schwann cell at the dermal-epidermal junction. The presence of naked nerve fibers within the epidermis suggests that functional interactions with the resident cells, even in sensory transduction, might exist.

AB  - It is well known that painful neuropathy of the small fiber type is frequent in Fabry disease, however it has been rarely investigated in childhood. We report an 11-year-old boy without known familial history of neuromuscular diseases, who complained of painful symptoms in the lower extremities by age 9. Initially pain was present only in association with fever, but during the last year it was triggered also by mild variations in the environmental temperature, so that the boy, to prevent pain, was forced to stay barefooted for most the time during spring and summer, and to wear at least two or three pairs of socks during winter. Physical and neurological examination was negative, except for several small red spots in the testes. Neurophysiological study was negative, but EMG showed motor unit potentials with possible myopathic pattern. Muscle biopsy was unremarkable, apart from endothelial cells containing electron dense lipid inclusions of regular lamellar structure, which were seen also in skin biopsy within fibroblasts, pericytes and endothelial cells. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density was within normal limits (5.5/mm at distal leg and 8.3/mm at proximal thigh), but prominent axonal swellings (possible predegenerative changes) were frequently seen. Diagnosis of Fabry disease was confirmed by deficiency of alfa-galactosidase. Symptomatic treatment with gabapentin was started, in addition to enzyme replacement therapy. Symptoms of small fiber neuropathy in Fabry disease may be present in early disease as an onset manifestation, and the occurrence of small fiber neuropathy during childhood strongly suggests a diagnosis of Fabry disease. Painful symptoms may occur before a significant intraepidermal nerve fiber loss is seen, and are probably correlated to predegenerative changes in the small sensory fibers.

AB  - Introduction: Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) is a safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infected patients. Its efficacy is focused on its role in modulating TNF-alpha expression and on the restoration of endogenous acetylcarnitine. Peripheral nervous system is frequently involved during HIV infection and distal sensitive polyneuropathy is one of the most common neurological complications (up to 30% of AIDS patients). Etiology is still unknown. One of the pathogenetic hypotheses is the role of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) in causing neuropathic pain. Method: Twenty HIV- positive patients affected by neuropathic pain with EMG-evidence of axonal alterations were enrolled; we excluded patients with mini-mental test score <?24, acute CMV infection, chronic demyelinating neuropathies. All patients were treated with ALC at the dose of 1 gram t.i.d. for 4 weeks. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate characteristics of patient's pain before, during, and after treatment. EMG and neurographic assessment was performed before and after treatment. To evaluate changes in VAS score we used non-parametric Friedman's test (F). Wilcoxon's test (W) was performed to timing the appearance of pain improvement, and to evaluate neurophysiological data. Results: The changes in VAS score were statistically significant during ALC treatment (mean score: before 6.7?±?2.1 ? after treatment 5.0?±?2.1)(F?=?P?<?0.001). The appearance of therapeutic effect was reached during the first week (W?=?P?<?0.03) and during the fourth week (W?=?P?<?0.05) of treatment. Analysis of neurophysiological data showed a statistically significant improvement of peroneal nerve motor parameters: reduced motor distal latency (W?=?P?<?0.02), increased amplitude of the compound motor action potential at distal (W?=?P?<?0.02) and proximal (W?=?P?<?0.05) site of stimulation. Conclusions: Our data show the efficacy of ALC in the treatment of neuropathic pain, confirming previous results. Moreover, the analgesic effects appear during the first week of treatment according with pre-clinical data in different experimental models of pain. Among mechanisms for ALC efficacy in patients with HIV-related polyneuropathy, there is a neurotrophic effect as evidenced from patch-skin biopsy evaluation.

AB  - We describe a 64-year-old patient complaining of progressive gait disturbance, referred to the compressive effect of multiple discal protrusions, for about 3 years. At the age of 62 he presented epileptic seizures during a febrile episode. Cerebral MRI showed bilateral frontobasal T2-weighted hyperintensity involving cortex and white matter. Partial seizures reappeared one year later and a MRI revealed a mild frontobasal atrophy. At the moment of our observation, neurological examination showed waddling gait with bilateral foot drop, muscular atrophy and weakness limited to the gluteal muscles and widespread deep tendon areflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed absent F-waves at both upper and lower limb examination, with normal distal sensorimotor nerve conduction. Needle EMG examination detected mild chronic partial denervation, predominant in proximal muscles of lower limbs. Somatosensory evoked potentials recorded from upper extremities showed bilateral increase in early latencies (N9). Overall, neurophysiological findings indicated a widespread radiculopathy. Serum exams revealed positive anti-nucleus (1:640, granular). CSF examination detected increased IgG level and several oligoclonal bands. Chest radiogram was normal. Soon after our first observation, the patient showed symptoms of respiratory insufficiency. A CT scans revealed a thoracic mass compatible with microcytoma, whereas anti-Hu (3?+) antibodies and increased NSE (neuronal specific enolase) titer were found. In the following two weeks, the patient showed a progressive worsening of the general clinical conditions and died. We interpreted this complex neurological picture, which included an atypical limbic encephalitis and a slowly progressive polyradiculopathy, as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The almost complete resolution of the encephalitic process and the subtle chronic involvement of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by a limited, though widespread, radicular impairment, are rather peculiar features.

AB  - *Software NEUROPA based on the ?consensus? Committee for standardization of measurements on polyneuropathy of the Gruppo di Studio Sistema Nervoso Periferico (Antonimi G, Cavaletti G, Di Iorio G Fabrizi G, Galardi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Ghirlanda P, Lori S, Nobile-Orazio E, Padua L, Scarpini E, Schenone A, Tonali P, Uncini A, Vita G). Kind of study: survey prospective multicentric multidimensional study. Aim of the study: to evaluate the characteristic (including disability and Health Related Quality of life - HRQoL) a representative sample of patients with suspected, or diagnosed, polyneuropathy (or multineuropathy) admitted in neurological centers. The HRQoL dimension of the study was developed with the collaboration of the Quality of Life Study group of the Italian Neurological Society. Timing: The period of enrollment started on 1-10-02 e will end on 30-01-03. Acquired data: Besides clinical data we acquire data on the diagnostic pathway the patients have done, disability, HRQoL. All the data are monthly sent to the Department of Neuroscience of Università Cattolica where statistical analysis will be performed. Conclusion: The acquired data will provide information on 1) the frequency of the different type of disease we have to study in the different kind of centers; 2) the clinical picture and the actual involvement in daily activity of this kind of patients and therefore the priority we have to give them; 3) the necessities of the neurological centers where this kind of patients are admitted and therefore what we have to requests to the national and regional sanitary service to better study this kind of patients and to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. # Antonini G, Bacci A, Cardinali P, Cavalletti G, Cocito D, Corbo, Di Iorio, Fabrizi GM, Fazio R, Galassi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Girlanda P, Insola A, Liguori R, Maggio M, Mazzeo A, Messina C, Murasecco D, Nemni R, Nobile Orazio E, Pareyson D, Porazzi D, Quattrini A, Ragno M, Rizzuto N, Romano M, Santoro L, Sartucci F, Sabatelli M, Schenone A, Sghirlanzoni, Siciliano G, Villacara A, Vita G.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - CMT1A is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy due to increased genetic dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). The functions of PMP22 as a structural protein of peripheral myelin and a regulator of the proliferation, differentiation, shaping and apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) are well known. However, the effects of its overexpression on the molecular phenotype of SCs are still unclear. In order to detect genes that are modulated by PMP22 overexpression, we performed a cDNA microarrays experiment on PMP22 overexpressing sciatic nerves from a transgenic model of CMT1A. Differential expression of 117 known genes that are sensitive to PMP22 dosage was observed. The number of up- and down-regulated genes in the transgenic nerves was 99 and 144 respectively, of 22.000 spotted genes. In the up-regulated group, the number of known genes was 30 and the number of EST was 69. In the down-regulated group, the number of known genes was 87 and that of EST 57. We classified the differentially expressed genes into functional categories. Among these, we focused our attention on groups of down-regulated genes coding for cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins and for extracellular matrix components, like collagens. Moreover we identified a group of genes with chromosomal localization in candidate regions for demyelinating neuropathies. The differential expression of several sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR, performed both on normal and transgenic rat sciatic nerves, and on primary SCs cultures obtained from normal and CMT1A rats. Therefore, we point out the importance of the interaction between SCs and extracellular matrix and the involvement of SCs cytoskeletal organization in the pathogenesis of CMT1A. Moreover, this study suggests us new candidate genes that could be submitted to sequence analysis in demyelinating CMT.

AB  - 50?60% of CIDP patients show a clinical remission with the administration of standard therapies. Unfortunately, the achievement of this goal does not conclude patients? troubles but coincide with the beginning of another story whose course is often uncertain. In our study of CIDP patients we attempted to establish the fate of 36 patients showing an initial remission after treatments. Over a long-term period of follow-up, we observed that the disease in these patients can follow 3 different clinical courses. A first group of 11 patients had a monophasic disease. All of them achieved a complete remission after therapy with corticosteroids and no relapses were observed after drug interruption over a follow-up period of 6 months-12 years. The duration of treatment varied between 3?24 months. A second group of 6 patients had a relapsing course; these patients became asymptomatic with corticosteroids but relapsed after a period of time of at least six months (range 6 months-16 years) since therapy suspension. The number of relapses varied from 1 to 4. A third group was represented by patients (19 in our series) who needed continuous treatment over a long period of time to maintain improvement. The apparent relapsing-remitting course in these patients was always related to tapering of therapies. The duration of this chronic active form ranged from 2 to 17 years. 5 patients of the last group were able to top therapies without evidence of worsening over a follow-up period of 2?12 years. This subgroup of patients had a prolonged monophasic course rather than a relapsing-remitting form. Our findings show that CIDP is a heterogeneous disease encompassing cases with a single monophasic episode in which the term ?chronic?, with respect to GBS, is referred mainly to the prolonged phase of worsening and cases in which the chronic nature of the condition in outlined by the long duration (up to decades) of the ?active phase?, made-up of therapy-related relapses/remissions.

AB  - Traditional outcome assessment in neurological diseases has always been based on physician-derived and instrumental findings. Over the last two decades, clinical and public health researchers emphasized the need for a thorough evaluation of concepts such as Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) to study the impact of chronic illnesses and their treatments on the patient's life. The most frequent inherited neuropathy is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CMT Patients develop progressive weakness and sensory disturbances, becoming sometimes severely disabled even at very young age. In CMT clinic, neurophysiologic, pathologic and genetic evaluation, are considered fundamental to assess nerve involvement and diagnose, but how these findings are related to HRQoL and disability is not assessed. We propose a prospective follow-up (24?30 months) of CMT patients with multiple measurements of CMT. Besides conventional clinic, pathologic, neurophysiologic and genetic measurements we adopt validated patient-oriented measurements to assess HRQoL and disability. Aims of the study are: 1) to assess HRQoL and disability of CMT patients in a wide and well-represented sample and to evaluate the relationships between conventional parameters and the patient's perception of his own HRQoL and disability; 2) to evaluate natural history of HRQoL and disability in CMT, and to evaluate the predictive value of phenotype, genetic picture, neurophysiological and pathological pattern 3) to develop a national network and a database on CMT disease (this aim includes the standardization, based on a consensus validation process, of the most used terms and measurements in CMT and the development of a database software). In a preliminary reunion, the authors developed a dedicated database for patients affected by CMT. Details about this database will be presented.
