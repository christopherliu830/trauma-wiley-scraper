AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are successfully used as immunomodulatory therapy in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) but their mechanism of action remains unknown. An anti-idiotypic block of pathogenic autoantibodies has been often postulated even if other possible mechanisms, including a modulation of the release of various cytokines, have been proposed. To evaluate the expression of cytokines in patients with MMN and their possible modulation by IVIg, we determined circulating levels of TNFα, INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12 by ELISA in serum samples of 17 patients with MMN and compared them with 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 12 with multiple sclerosis (MS), 6 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 5 with myasthenia gravis (MG) and 12 healthy controls (NS). Comparable levels of INF?, IL2, IL4, IL10 and IL12 were detected in patients? sera and controls. Even if TNFα levels did not differ significantly among patients? groups, they were higher than in any healthy control (mean?±?SD 1.2?±?0.5?pg/ml, range 0.7?2.4?pg/ml), in 12 (70%) MMN patients (mean?±?SD 3.6?±?1.9?pg/ml; range 0.2?7.5?pg/ml), all ALS, 3 MS (25%), 2 CIDP (40%) and 2 MG (40%). We then measured the concentration of TNFα before and after IVIg therapy in 9 MMN and 2 ALS patients. In all but one MMN patients, circulating levels of TNFα slightly increased after treatment with IVIg (mean values 4.3 vs. 7.2?pg/ml) and decreased 3 weeks after therapy while in both ALS patients they decreased or remained unchanged. No detectable level of TNFα was found in IVIg preparation. This study shows that, similarly to what previously reported in other autoimmune neuropathy as GBS and CIDP, TNFα serum levels are slightly increased in MMN but, at odds with what reported in these disease, their concentration tend to increase parallel to clinical improvement after IVIg therapy. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenetic implication of this finding and in particular whether a possible deviation from a presumably Th2 to a Th1 immune response may help explaining the effect of IVIg in MMN.

AB  - We studied the effect of chronic compression of median nerve at wrist on cutaneous innervation. Two-mm punch biopsies were obtained from third fingertip in 40 patients (32 female and 8 male, age range 30?74 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with diabetes and other metabolic or endocrinological disorders or with electrophysiological findings of a diffuse neuropathy were excluded. By means of immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy we counted epidermal nerve fibers, Meissner corpuscles and myelinated papillary endings. All patients underwent electrophysiological study and quantitative sensory testing using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for tactile threshold and Medoc TSA II Neurosensory analyzer for thermal threshold evaluation. Morphological and functional data were compared with age and sex matched controls. We observed abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers, mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents in all patients. These abnormalities ranged from mild to marked and appeared more severe in patients with a longer disease duration and a slower conduction velocity along the median nerve.

AB  - The pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the progressive death of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to a clinical pictures mainly characterized by weakness, muscle wasting, brisk reflexes and Babinski sign. Routine electromyographic and electroneurographic studies are mandatory to a correct diagnosis but are unable to precisely quantify the pathological changes in the motor unit. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is a recent neurophysiological technique that allows to estimate number and amplitude of motor units in single muscles in order to assess the severity of ALS and to follow-up the progression of the disease. We applied this technique in 15 patients (12 male and 3 female; mean age?±?SD: 65.7?±?9.5?yrs, range 45?82), affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria, and in 11 healthy subjects (4 male and 7 female; mean age?±?SD: 63.7?±?8.2?yrs, range 50?76), in order to assess changes in motor unit features of abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in the mean number of motor units between the two groups: 75 in ADM and 51,8 in TA in the ALS cohort vs. 283,5 in ADM and 96,9 in the healthy subjects. Conversely, the differences in the mean and maximal area between the two groups did not reach the statistical significance (ALS patients: max area 34.7?mVms, mean area 1.9?mVms; healthy subjects: max area 18.2?mVms, mean area 0.9?mVms). Our preliminary results confirm that MUNE is able to quantify the pathological changes in motor unit parameter and represents an adequate follow-up tool for disease progression and effectiveness of pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN) is a well-recognized subacute painful asymmetric proximal and distal lower limb neuropathy. DLRPN may be associated with thoracic and upper limb involvement. The latter may appear as compression mononeuropathies and as a more diffuse disorder consistent with cervicobrachial radiculoplexus neuropathy (DCRPN). We performed a multiperspective study of patients, seen between 1999?2002, with diabetes and acute or subacute onset and progression of unilateral or asymmetric bilateral proximal and/or distal weakness in lower and/or upper limbs. We excluded patients who had compression mononeuropathies or radiculopathies, multineuropathies or asymmetric poly(radiculo)neuropathies, motor neuron disease as suggested by clinical, electrophysiological, laboratory or MRI findings. During the study period we observed 18 patients with diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. Most patients were middle-aged or elderly and male preponderance was noted. Ten patients had DLPRN, 6 both DLPRN and DCRPN, 2 isolated DCRPN. DCRPN affected prevalently hands and forearms, unilaterally in 3 patients, bilaterally in 5, and improved spontaneously but incompletely in most patients in several months. Pain was not a prominent feature except for one patient. We conclude that diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy may involve the cervicobrachial regions not only in association with DLRPN but also alone.

AB  - We report a case of peripheral both demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy in a patient affected from intestinal aganglionosis with high dose intermittent metronidazole therapy. Intestinal aganglionosis is a myenteric plexus disorder with lack of innervation concerning the whole digestive tract from the rectum to the esophagus. The familial incidence of this condition seems to be high and a recessive autosomal transmission is likely. In the pathogenesis of this disorder aberrant neural crest migration seems to be implicated: indeed frequent neurologic signs resembling dysautonomic ones, deafness and rare peripheral demyelinating or axonal neuropathies are associated. The patient was a 12 years old female child affected by intestinal aganglionosis and underwent to chronic intermittent Metronidazole treatment, with daily doses of 500?mg for 15 day every month. She was admitted to our Hospital for inability to walk, dysesthesias and pain at lower limbs, acutely started and progressively worsening. At the admission neurological examination showed ataxic gait with bilateral foot drop, severe distal weakness, bilateral tibialis anterior muscle atrophy, absent deep tendon reflexes, rapidly worsening. CSF was normal. Antibodies against to peripheral nerve (antigangliosides, sulfatide, MAG, glycosaminoglycans) resulted negative. Spinal cord MRI revealed increased roots size and increased epidural space. EMG showed denervation spontaneous activity with neurogenic MUAP modification on distal muscles. Nerve conduction study showed severe slowing of motor velocity on right and left peroneal nerves with reduced amplitude of CMAP. Sensory conduction was mild slowing on both sural nerves with reduced amplitude of SAP. Metronidazole therapy was discontinued; desametazone, high dose vitamin and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was established in addition to rehydration and parenteral nutrition. Clinical conditions progressively improved and at two months follow up the girl was able to walk with mild ataxia. The authors emphasize in described case the difficulty to differentiate toxic or vitamin deficiency or autoimmune pathogenesis.

AB  - Peripheral neurotoxicity is a severe side effect of several effective antineoplastic drugs. Different attempts have been previously performed in order to reduce the neurotoxicity of antineoplastic compounds, but so far an effective neuroprotective treatment is not available. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a natural occurring compound with a neuroprotective activity in several experimental paradigms and in clinical use for the treatment of painful neuropathies. In this study we have tested in two rat models the hypothesis that ALC may have a protective role on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments in different tumor systems indicated the lack of interference of ALC in the antitumor effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel. ALC co-treatment was able to significantly reduce the neurotoxicity of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in well-established rat models and this effect was correlated with a modulation of the plasma levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cisplatin model. The protective effect of ALC was confirmed also in in vitro studies on differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, where ALC treatment counteracted the paclitaxel and cisplatin-induced cell damage, as measured by reduction of neurite elongation. In a search for the mechanism(s) of ALC neuroprotection, the transcriptional profile of gene expression in PC12 cells determined by microarray analysis indicated that ALC, in the presence of NGF, was able to modulate various genes relevant in the tissue-specific toxicity, such as NGFI-A. Moreover, we observed that labeled acetyl groups derived from ALC were transferred into histones and that cells co-treatment with NGF and ALC increased the level of histones H4 acetylation. These findings suggest that up-regulation of genes implicated in the protection against specific damage induced by neurotoxic agent may be the result of modulation of histone acetylation mediated by transfer of ALC acetyl groups. Overall, these results provide the first evidence that ALC is a neuroprotective agent acting through a novel mechanism that appears to be important for counteracting the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity secondary to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Inflammatory vasculopathy is observed in 20 to 66% of nerve biopsies in diabetic neuropathy, especially in patients with proximal diabetic neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy) or with other patterns of multifocal neuropathy. Moreover there is growing evidence that diabetic patients have an increased predisposition to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). Many authors suggest that there is a more pervasive contribution of inflammatory and immuno-mediated damage to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy than had previously been imagined. In these patients, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated. However differentiating CIDP in diabetic patients from diabetic neuropathy (DNP) may be difficult. We tried to differentiate immuno-mediated and inflammatory neuropathies in diabetic patients with polyneuropathy revealing the presence of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the endoneurium. MMPs are calcium-dependent zinc endopeptidases which are able to degrade the basement membrane and thus contribute to tissue destruction and cell invasion. Sural nerve biopsies were taken from 10 diabetic patients with CIDP and 5 patients with DNP. Immunohistochemistry was performed for T-cells, macrophages, von Willebrand factor and MMP-9. Endoneurial and epineurial immunoreactivity was evaluated and quantified separately. Small epineurial T-cells infiltrates were present in 5 out of 10 CIDP patients and in none of DNP patients. In CIDP patients 53% of endoneurial vessels were immunoreactive for MMP-9 against only 12% in DNP patients and this difference reached a statistical significance. In conclusion we demonstrated that immunoreactivity of MMP-9 is strongly enhanced in diabetic patients with CIDP but not in patients with DNP. The pattern of immunoreactivity may help to select patients for a trial with immunosuppressant drugs.

AB  - A process of motor units (MU) rearrangement may compensate the loss of motor neurons in spinal cord anterior horns in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), at least in the early stages of the disease. Standard electromyography is unable to precisely quantify these pathological changes. Recently, Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) has been introduced in clinical practice in order to provide a quantitative measure of the process as well as short- and long-term follow-up data. We investigated 8 male patients (mean age?±?SD: 64?±?10.9?yrs, range 45?78) affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria. In order to quantify the total number of motor units, MUNE was performed during the diagnostic work-up (basal, T0), after three (T1) and six months (T2), in abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (16.6% at T1 [p?<?0.002] and 37.9% at T2 [p?<?0.04]), recording from ADM, while the decrease in mean and maximal area did not reach the statistical significance at the same time intervals. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (20.6% at T1 [p?<?0.008] and 40.3% at T2 [p?<?0.0006]), but not in the mean and maximal area, recording from TA. According to previous data, we found about a loss of about 50% motor units in both the muscles six months after diagnosis. We conclude that MUNE is a useful tool to quantify MU loss in ALS and may result helpful in following the course of ALS and in predicting the prognosis.

AB  - In the nervous system nitric oxide (NO) has been involved as a regulatory molecule in several physiological and pathological events, such as cerebral microcirculation, synaptic plasticity, neural damage, and neuroprotection. The activation of the three isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS), synthesize NO from L-arginine. Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, iNOS can produce copious amounts of NO for prolonged periods that triggers cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. This has been considered as a key process in demyelination of both CNS and PNS with a destructive and/or protective controversial role. This study shows by Northern blot analysis that during experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), at the beginning of clinical signs, there is a transient extensive iNOS mRNA induction in nerve roots, which morphology is characterized by severe demyelination, but not in sciatic nerve, where scattered axonal degeneration is evident. Immunocytochemistry performed on teased nerve fibers and ultrastructural analysis showed that iNOS was localized in both inflammatory and Schwann cells, and analysis of cell membrane permeability detected with fluorescent dyes showed a diffuse necrotic phenotype in PNS. With EAN clinical spontaneous recovery, endoneurial iNOS was rapidly down-regulated and in nerve roots almost all cells shifted their membrane permeability to an apoptotic phenotype, whilst necrosis persisted in sciatic nerve, until complete clinical recovery, when both root and nerve returned normal. These data support the hypothesis that, during cell-mediated demyelination, iNOS may influence Schwann cell-axon relationship causing axonal damage and regulating endoneurial cell life and death.

AB  - Antibodies to different neural antigens have been reported in patients with dysimmune neuropathies but their pathogenetic role in these diseases is still debated. In order to identify other possible protein target antigens in these diseases we tested by immunoblot IgG and IgM reactivity with human cauda equina and spinal cord in the sera from 30 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 14 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and 11 with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). As controls we examined sera from 11 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 68 with other neurological and non-neurological diseases (OND) and 28 normal subjects. We found high titers (>1/800) of IgG antibodies to some protein bands of the approximate molecular weight (MW) of 45?50?kDa in spinal cord but not cauda equina, in 20 patients (67%) with GBS, and 1 each with MMN and CIDP (9% and 7%, respectively)(GBS vs. MMN/CIDP p?<?0.05). In 16?GBS positive patients this reactivity was re-tested and found reduced during recovery. A similar IgG reactivity with the 45?50?kDa bands was found in 2 patients (18%) with ALS (GBS vs. ALS p?<?0.05), 15 (23%) with OND (GBS vs. OND p?<?0.001) and in no normal subject. Since the MW of reactive bands corresponded to that of Glial Fibrillar Acidic Protein (GFAP), we tested the serum from 6 intensely positive GBS patients (titers of 1/6400 up to 1/12800) for IgG reactivity with purified GFAP by immunoblot. In four of them IgG bound to GFAP in a pattern similar to that observed with a commercial anti-GFAP antibody. Pre-incubation of one of these sera with purified GFAP completely abolished IgG reactivity with GFAP by immunoblot. This study shows that anti-GFAP IgG antibodies are significantly increased during the acute phase of GBS and decrease during recovery. Further investigation is necessary to clarify their possible pathogenetic role in the disease.

AB  - A 41-year-old man suffered for 1 year of severe progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy that rendered him bedridden in few months. Routine laboratory investigations, including serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, were normal. Electrophysiological studies and sural nerve biopsy showed a severe mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy. X-ray showed multiple osteosclerotic lesions in the spine. MRI disclosed pachymeningeal thickening of the brain and meningeal infiltration at cauda equina level with gadolinium enhancement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 12% of plasma cells with a monotypic immunocytochemical profile for lambda light chain. A diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma (OM) was done. He received two courses of IVIg followed by melphalan and prednisone without any benefit. Very recently he underwent a bone marrow autotransplantation. OM is a rare variant of multiple myeloma, representing less than 3% of all myeloma cases. In contrast to multiple myeloma, in OM half of patients have a peripheral neuropathy similar to CIDP, with or without features of POEMS syndrome. MRI meningeal involvement, concomitant with a severe neuropathy, was not yet described in OM. A paraneoplastic process in addition to a direct neoplastic infiltration may account for the severity of the disease in our patient, despite different therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Unclassified neuropathies still represent a challenge for neurologists, since in about 20?30% of patients no cause can be identified after extensive investigations. In this context, some patients sharing peculiar features have been reported as to be grouped in a single entity termed Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP). The onset occurs in middle to late adulthood, there is a predominant sensory involvement and progression is slow, usually not disabling. Electrophysiologic and pathological studies are consistent with a primary axonal injury. We describe five patients affected by adult-onset chronic ?idiopathic? axonal neuropathy with an unusual course characterized by severe disability. Onset occurred in the fifth-seventh decades with sensorimotor symptoms and signs involving both lower and upper limbs with a distal distribution. Over a 2?14 year follow-up, the disease showed a progressive course with severe muscle weakness and atrophy of semi-distal and distal muscles in all patients, and involvement of proximal muscles in four of them. Two patients died because of respiratory and heart failure. All five patients were sporadic. Extensive laboratory examination excluded identifiable causes of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy was carried out in all patients and showed an axonal neuropathy. Amyloid deposits were not observed in nerve sections nor in abdominal fat aspirate. In four patients, treatment with steroids and IVIg was unsuccessful. The nosology of acquired adult-onset axonal polyneuropathies is difficult to be drawn, since in most cases the etiology remains obscure. Our findings suggest that, in this not yet well defined group of neuropathies, different subtypes may exist and represent distinct entities.

AB  - We describe two first cousins presenting a CMT phenotype associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) in one of them. The propositus (ML), a 37-year-old man, showed a severe muscular involvement both proximal and distal, bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, hypophonia, bilateral pes cavus and absence of deep tendon reflexes (DTR). The cousin (MC), a 27-year-old man, showed a CMT phenotype with marked peroneal atrophy, pes cavus and absence of DTR. Cranial nerves were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed in the propositus, a severe axonal and demyelinating neuropathy and clear myopathic features at EMG. Accordingly, muscle biopsy showed both signs of mitochondrial myopathy and chronic denervation. Furthermore, nerve biopsy confirmed the severe axonal loss and showed abnormalities of myelin sheath which was thinner in relation to the axon diameter. In MC the electrophysiological study and the muscle and nerve biopsies showed only signs of a marked axonal neuropathy. Genetic analysis showed in the propositus a new homozygous mutation in POLG gene that encodes the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. The same mutation was present in the heterozygous state in his parents and in MC. Moreover, the recent observation that mutations in GDAP1 gene could be associated with both axonal and demyelinating autosomal recessive CMT, prompted us to search for point mutations in this gene. However, the direct sequencing of GDAP1 gene did not show any mutation. In conclusion we describe two cousins presumably affected by an axonal autosomal recessive CMT. The presence in the propositus of the homozygous mutation of polymerase gamma gene adds to the CMT phenotype the myopathic features and PEO. It is questionable if in ML the axon hypomyelination could depend on the POLG gene mutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with both IgM paraproteinemia and anti-MAG antibody (MAG-PN) is regarded as a clinical entity distinct from chronic inflammatory demyelinating PN (CIDP) even in association with paraproteinemia. MAG-PN satisfy current electrophysiological criteria for CIDP and 18 to 37 % of patients fulfilling these criteria have high titers of IgM anti-MAG antibody (Ab). Anti-MAG Ab assay is rather expensive and time consuming, thus resulting sometimes in delaying the appropriate treatment in patients without these Ab. On the contrary, patients with MAG-PN may be treated inappropriately before anti-MAG Ab detection. OBJECTIVE: Determining the predictive value of clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN for the presence of anti-MAG Ab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CIDP established by Rotta et?al. (2001) were prospectively included. All of them were submitted to anti-MAG Ab assay and research of paraproteinemia. The following features at the initial evaluation were considered for the analysis: presence of distal or proximal weakness at limbs, asymmetry of motor deficit, presence of sensory ataxia, presence of vibration or pinprick sense deficit, presence of conduction blocks, low terminal latency index (TLI) in at least two nerves at upper limbs, absence of M-response (CMAP) at lower limbs. A discriminative analysis method was used to determine which features were significantly associated with the presence of anti-MAG Ab, then sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of these features were calculated. RESULTS: Low TLI, absence of CMAP at lower limbs, absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs, were the features significantly associated with the presence of anti-;MAG Ab. The combination of low TLI in two nerves and absence of CMAP at lower limbs or low TLI and absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs had the greatest sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, resulting in a very high increase in probability that a patient had MAG-PN. DISCUSSION: Low TLI value in at least two upper limb nerves, absence of CMAP and of proximal weakness at lower limbs are the most informative features indicating the presence of anti-MAG Ab in patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN.

AB  - We report a case of a 50- year-old patient, diagnosed as having mycosis fungoides since 1 year, was admitted to our Hospital for progressive weakness and sensory loss in upper and lower limbs. On neurological examination, moderate weakness of the distal muscles of upper and lower limbs, ataxia, loss of proprioceptive and tactile sensation of the hands and foot and diffuse areflexia were noticed. The electrophysiological evaluation revealed signs of prevalent axonal sensory-motor polyradiculoneuropathy and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a marked increase of proteins and a mild increase of cells. A biopsy of the sural nerve revealed a severe axonal loss with preservation of myelin. The possible pathogenetic mechanism of this extremely rare peripheral neuropathy and the differences from previous reports are discussed.

AB  - The availability of antibodies against the pan-axonal marker protein-gene-protein 9.5 (PGP) allowed to definitely demonstrate the existence of small-diameter nerve fibers within the vital layers of the epidermis and prompted to their quantification in sensory neuropathies. However, morphological features of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) have not been fully characterized. We performed immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies in skin biopsies taken in 15 healthy subjects at the proximal thigh or the distal leg using anti-PGP, anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), anti-non-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein-1B (MAP-1B), anti-70 and 200?kDa neurofilament (NF), anti-phosphorylated neurofilament-312 (SMI), anti-peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), anti-basic myelin protein (MBP), and anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies. IENF density was quantified under light microscope using PGP, TuJ1, MAP-1B, NF, and SMI immunostaining. In each site, the density of TuJ1- and MAP-1B-positive IENF was similar to that of PGP-positive IENF, whereas that of NF-positive IENF was significantly lower. Only sporadic SMI-positive IENF were found. Double confocal staining studies confirmed that TuJ1 and MAP-1B diffusely co-localized with PGP in IENF. These findings suggest that IENF cytoskeleton is predominantly composed by tubules, whereas neurofilaments are less represented. No IENF showed PMP22, MBP, or MAG labeling. All dermal nerve fibers presented PMP22 immunoreactivity, which labeled Schwann cell membrane, whereas only a few of them were MBP- or MAG-positive, confirming that most fibers are unmyelinated. Double staining confocal microscope studies revealed that PMP22 labeling in dermal nerves stopped at the dermal-epidermal junction, whereas TuJ1-positive axons crossed it and run between keratinocytes. This definitely demonstrates that IENF are naked axons, arising from sub-papillary unmyelinated nerves which loose the Schwann cell at the dermal-epidermal junction. The presence of naked nerve fibers within the epidermis suggests that functional interactions with the resident cells, even in sensory transduction, might exist.

AB  - It is well known that painful neuropathy of the small fiber type is frequent in Fabry disease, however it has been rarely investigated in childhood. We report an 11-year-old boy without known familial history of neuromuscular diseases, who complained of painful symptoms in the lower extremities by age 9. Initially pain was present only in association with fever, but during the last year it was triggered also by mild variations in the environmental temperature, so that the boy, to prevent pain, was forced to stay barefooted for most the time during spring and summer, and to wear at least two or three pairs of socks during winter. Physical and neurological examination was negative, except for several small red spots in the testes. Neurophysiological study was negative, but EMG showed motor unit potentials with possible myopathic pattern. Muscle biopsy was unremarkable, apart from endothelial cells containing electron dense lipid inclusions of regular lamellar structure, which were seen also in skin biopsy within fibroblasts, pericytes and endothelial cells. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density was within normal limits (5.5/mm at distal leg and 8.3/mm at proximal thigh), but prominent axonal swellings (possible predegenerative changes) were frequently seen. Diagnosis of Fabry disease was confirmed by deficiency of alfa-galactosidase. Symptomatic treatment with gabapentin was started, in addition to enzyme replacement therapy. Symptoms of small fiber neuropathy in Fabry disease may be present in early disease as an onset manifestation, and the occurrence of small fiber neuropathy during childhood strongly suggests a diagnosis of Fabry disease. Painful symptoms may occur before a significant intraepidermal nerve fiber loss is seen, and are probably correlated to predegenerative changes in the small sensory fibers.
