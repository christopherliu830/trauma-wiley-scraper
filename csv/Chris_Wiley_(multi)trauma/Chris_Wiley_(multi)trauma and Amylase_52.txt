AB  - Demyelination and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation are hallmarks of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies, of which Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 A (CMT1A) neuropathy is the typical example. In CMT1A, an altered dosage of the PMP22 gene determines a defect of myelination and an abnormal SC phenotype, characterized by hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family of proteins, including EGF and neuregulins, and their receptors, namely EGFr and the erbB family, control growth and development of SC. Their expression in mature SC is down-regulated but, during Wallerian degeneration or chemical myelinolysis, these receptors are transiently over-expressed, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. On the other hand, neuregulin 1 inhibits SC myelination and induces demyelination and SC dedifferentiation and proliferation. These effects might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies. We have therefore immunolocalized EGF, EGFr and the erbB receptors (erbB 2, 3 and 4) in sural nerve biopsies from patients with CMT1A as compared to chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) nerve biopsies and to normal nerves, in order to evaluate if the expression of these molecules is up- or down-regulated in these disorders. Among CMT1A nerves, immunoreactivity for EGF, EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 was moderately to markedly increased in SC, particularly in onion bulbs, in most cases, while a mild to moderate expression of erbB 4 in SC cytoplasm was observed in a few cases. On the other hand in CIDP, which shares with CMT1A histopathological features such as de-remyelination and SC hyperplasia, only the expression of erbB 3 was up-regulated in a minority of cases. Since in SC the functional neuregulin receptor is a heterodimer, composed by erbB2 and erbB3, the parallel up-regulation of these two molecules in CMT1A may bear a functional significance. This would be confirmed if an overexpression of neuregulins could be demonstrated, along with our finding of an increased expression of EGF and its receptor. In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that, in CMT1A, a persistent activation of neuregulin signaling pathways not only is indicative of SC dedifferentiation but also may contribute to demyelination and onion bulb formation or maintenance.

AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.
