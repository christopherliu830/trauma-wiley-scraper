AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, the authors summarize the results of the most commonly performed pancreatic resections: enucleation, distal pancreatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Expected outcomes and technical considerations are discussed. Based on the presented data, distal pancreatectomy can provide comparable oncological outcomes with fewer complications, lower blood loss, and shorter hospital stay compared with open surgery for cancers of similar complexity. Laparoscopic enucleation is less commonly performed but has a role in the management of indolent small tumors not involving or approaching the main pancreatic duct. This especially includes pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. While randomized controlled prospective data comparing laparoscopic with open pancreatic surgery are not available, the retrospective data presented by the authors are reassuring. While desirable, prospective data are difficult to obtain because of differences in technique, application of perioperative chemotherapy and chemoradiation, patient selection, surgeon and patient bias, and availability of experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Finally, the authors present the available data on laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. It indicates that this procedure is still in the developmental phase and practiced by a limited number of surgeons in selected centers. Laparoscopic pancreatic surgeons should be very familiar with the data presented in this chapter in order to put their own results into the perspective of the current outcome benchmarks for advanced laparoscopic pancreatic surgery.

AB  - Summary Adequate volume maintenance is essential to prevent acute renal failure during major surgery or to ensure graft function after renal transplantation. The various recommendations on the optimum fluid therapy are based, at best, on sparse evidence only from observational studies. This article reviews the literature on perioperative fluid management in renal transplantation. Crystalloid solutions not exerting any specific side-effects are the first choice for volume replacement in kidney transplantation. The use of colloids should be restricted to patients with severe intravascular volume deficits necessitating high volume restoration. The routine application of albumin, dopamine, and high dose diuretics is no longer warranted. Mannitol given immediately before removal of the vessel clamps reduces the requirement of post-transplant dialysis, but has no effects on graft function in the long term. There is insufficient evidence on the best use of dialysis, but it seems peritoneal dialysis pretransplant is associated with less delayed graft function, whereas the preference of dialysis post-transplant is not yet well-founded. This review article should provide better guidance for fluid management in kidney transplantation until best-evidence guidelines can be established based upon more research.

AB  - Summary Septic shock is characterized by an inability of the host to maintain vascular integrity and fluid homeostasis, resulting in inadequate tissue oxygenation and circulatory failure. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) describes a generalized inflammatory response of the host to a variety of insults. SIRS is considered a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. Disruption of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is a well-recognized component of septic shock. The clinical spectrum of sepsis depends primarily on the host response to infection rather than the severity of the infection itself. The pregnant host may be different from the traditional septic shock host in ways other than the difference in microbiologic pathogens involved. Physiologic adaptations to pregnancy designed to promote favorable maternal and fetal outcome occur in almost every organ system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 50 percent of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
