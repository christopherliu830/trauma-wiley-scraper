AB  - This paper provides a brief overview of the diagnosis, prevalence, medical and psychosocial side effects, and assessment of the dieting disorder, bulimia nervosa. An update is given of the psychological treatment approaches: cognitive behavioural, behavioural, hypnobehavioural, psychodynamic, psychoeducation, family therapy, and nutritional management. Findings from uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials are summarised, and we discuss some guidelines for clinical and research practice. Suggestions for further applied research include: developing an internationally agreed set of instruments to determine outcome, investigating the mode of action of various treatments, focusing on newer interventions, exploring the durability of shorter treatments, evaluating the effectiveness of less intense forms of treatment compared to more intense forms, determining which treatments match or suit certain patients, and exploring techniques to decrease attrition in treatment outcome research.

AB  - Summary: The subject of Clinical Immunology is developing hand in hand with a wide and rapidly moving area of laboratory technology. The result is a better understanding of autoimmune disease, tissue transplantation rejection, foetal-maternal incompatibility, allergic disease, immunodeficiency disorders, adverse reactions to drugs, aberrant responses to bacterial and viral infections, and growth and spread of malignant cells. Basic to this understanding is the need to appreciate the character and composition of natural substances which act as immunogens and elicit antibodies. These substances have, according to their origin, been classified as autoantigens, ailoantigens, xenoantigens and neoantigens. This review summarizes our knowledge relating to such antigens, emphasizing those aspects relevant to human disease and pointing to the major gaps that future research must bridge.

AB  - Summary The alimentary tract includes the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, intestine, and rectum. These structures all share the same basic structure and consist of an epithelial-lined cavity supported by a submucosa. This submucosa is surrounded by bone in parts of the oral cavity and by muscle in the rest of tract. Because of this consistent basic structure, tumors that develop within the tubular alimentary tract can be subdivided into those of the epithelium and those that develop within the supporting mesenchymal tissue. Cancer staging requires assessment of regional lymph nodes for the presence of metastases. Papillomas of the oral cavity can be subdivided into squamous papillomas that are benign neoplasms and viral papillomas that are hyperplastic lesions caused by papillomavirus infection. Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common oral neoplasm of cats, horses, and the production animal species. They are the second most common malignant oral neoplasm of dogs.

AB  - Abstract Electroanalysis involves the measurement or determination of a chemical or biochemical species, using a wide range of electrochemical methods. The species being measured can either bring about a direct electrochemical response that can be detected and measured, or can be induced to bring about such a response, resulting in a process that can be detected electrochemically. In both cases an interface is required between the chemical or biochemical species being measured, and the electrochemical system performing the measurement. This interface is referred to as an ?electrode?. It is the transfer of electrons or ions between the electrode and the environment being sampled which is of concern in electroanalysis. The application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis is concerned with the measurement of chemical and biochemical species present in biological fluids (primarily blood but also urine and other body fluids and tissues). It is applied in several areas of critical care where its rapidity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy at biologically relevant concentrations make it an ideal choice over other, typically slower, biochemical techniques. Indeed, it is the speed of electrochemical analysis that principally differentiates it from other methods. It is not universally applicable to clinical chemistry, however, and has only been applied in situations where such analyses are relevant. This has principally been in the analysis of blood gases and pH and blood electrolytes. Electrochemical methods are, however, gradually being extended to the analysis of small biochemical components such as sugars, amino acids and other metabolites, with the advent of enzyme-based ?biosensors?. There is also little doubt that the application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis will be further exploited by the use of such biosensor devices based on other forms of biorecognition, such as antibodies, cell ligands, membranes, tissues and whole cells. These biosensor devices are also amenable to other forms of detection such as acoustic wave and optical measurements. Together, these techniques offer a wide range of advantages over traditional analytical methodologies, and will undoubtedly have a rapidly increasing impact on many types of clinical analysis. This article focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques and electrochemical biosensors and their application in clinical chemistry.
