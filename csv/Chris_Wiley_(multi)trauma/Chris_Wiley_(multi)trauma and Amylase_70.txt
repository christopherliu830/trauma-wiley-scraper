AB  - By definition, melanomacrophage centres (MMC) consist of aggregates of macrophage-like pigmented cells located in the kidney and spleen, and to a lesser extent in the liver. In 30 Salmo gairdneri Richardson trout, MMC have been identified in various organs. In the kidney, liver and spleen, respectively, macrophages (M?) are aggregated in clusters, which are next to vessels. MMC have been cytoenzymatically identified with periodic acid Schiff (PAS), α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), peroxidase (PEROX) reactions. Finally, in order to show pigments in the context of MMC, in particular, we used iron stain to detect iron pigments and Prussian blue reaction to detect melanin and lipofuscin. The presence of iron pigments indicates that MMC function as lymphoreticular centres where fish erythrocytes (FE) are destroyed together with other foreign material. In previous studies, we found that FE are able to bind and engulf Candida albicans (CA) without killing this fungus. FE containing engulfed CA form with M? functional rosettes and, in reason of that M? are solicited to phagocytose and kill CA. It is likely that rosettes and/or single FE containing engulfed foreign material migrate to distant organs, such as the kidney, the spleen and the liver. Therefore, the MMC may, in part, derive from these peripheral rosettes and pigments result from FE and foreign material digestion and destruction operated by M?. Reference?

AB  - Accurate interpretation of thoracic magnetic resonance images requires a thorough knowledge of anatomy of this region. The purpose of this communication is to describe the normal cross sectional anatomy of the thoracic cavity of the cat, using MR images, dissections and macroscopic sections. In this study, three cats were used. The animals were anesthetized and positioned in sternal recumbency in the MR scanner. MR imaging was performed at the Special Diagnostic Service of San Roque Clinic of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with a superconducting magnet operating at a field strength of 1.5?Tesla and a human body coil. Spin echo pulse sequences were used to obtain T1-weighted images in tranverse and sagittal planes. At the conclusion of imaging, the cats were euthanatized for medical reasons unrelated to disease of thorax. The cats were frozen and then sectioned using an electric band saw. The cuts were matched as closely as possible to the MR images for identifying the normal planimetric anatomy of the thoracic structures. MR T1-weighted spin echo images provided excellent anatomic appearance of the thorax structures. In MR images the grey scale is directly related to the signal intensity of the thoracic cavity structures. Thus, fat and nerves had higher signal intensity compared with the lower signal intensity of the respiratory system. Bone marrow and muscles had a intermediate signal intensity and appeared gray. The intensity signal of the articular fluid permits a good differentiation of the opposing cartilage surfaces on all MR images. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the thoracic cavity in the cat allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, being helpful tool for the identification of the MR images. The information presented should serve as an initial reference to evaluate MR images of the feline thorax and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Surface ultrastructural observation of the thyroid gland in donkey revealed the coexistence of certain unusual follicles or cysts, the ultimobranchial (UB) follicles, which exhibited large diameters and less regular outlines. In addition, several small follicles, cell nests or solid cellular masses were also demonstrated in association with these structures. Surface of most UB follicular cells was almost hexagonal in shape, studded with sparse or dense pleomorphic microvilli, which were much denser at the cellular borders. Each follicular cell bore single cilium that projecting over the cell surface. Interestingly, bleb-like apocrine protrusion of the apical cytoplasm of some follicular cells was frequently demonstrated. These apocrine blebs (or aposomes) were varied in shape, size and showed smooth or irregular surface. In addition to such aposomes, deep to shallow circumscribed or eroded areas of the apical cell surface was frequently demonstrated. These findings indicate that the UB follicular cells in donkeys, similar to those of camels, exhibit an apocrine activity alongside with the usual merocrine mode of secretion.

AB  - Introduction and Aims:? Primary and secondary cell cultures of canine dermal fibroblasts were used to test the suitability of several senescence-linked cellular markers to characterize the chronological age of dogs. In further studies these markers will be used to test the hypothesis that senescence-linked changes at the cellular level are representative for the observed inverse relationship of body mass and life expectancy in different dog breeds. Methods:? In this study standardized skin samples of Beagles were used to analyse the cell morphology and several senescence-linked parameters as Cumulative Population Doubling Level, Highest Population Doubling Level, Culture Doubling Time and Life Span Completed to determine the replicative potential of fibroblasts. The samples were divided by the age of the donors into three groups (?young?, ?middle? and ?old?). Results:? There are notable differences between the replicative potential of young and old Beagles at the cellular level. Preliminary results show that in fibroblast cultures obtained from the young group the highest population doubling level is higher and the culture doubling time is shorter then in cultures of the old group. Cultures from the young and middle-aged group cannot be distinguished by the measured parameters. For final results the complete statistical analysis of sampled data has to be carried out. Conclusions:? Our results demonstrate a relationship between the chronological age of the skin donor and the replicative potential of the dermal fibroblasts. Therefore cellular senescence-linked markers could serve as suitable tools to compare the age of individual dogs of different breeds.

AB  - Introduction:? Interactions between horn quality and flooring systems significantly impact on claw health. Poor horn quality is associated with reduced milk yield, painful lesions or slaughtering. Horn quality is determined by horn cells, intercellular cement and hoof horn architecture, i.e. the structure and arrangement of the horn tubules. Soft and elastic flooring systems have been reported to have a positive influence on the microstructure of hoof horn. Aims:? We wanted to correlate the microstructure of claw horn to the horn quality in a large number of samples and detect influences of the flooring system on hoof horn microstructure. Methods:? Samples were obtained from two different studies: 40 cows from Hohenheim/Germany kept on slatted floor and subsequently on rubber mats for 4 months; 1000 cows from 11 farms in Luxembourg, kept on concrete floor. From all samples 7??m-sections were cut and stained with the PAS-reaction. Morphometry was done with the LuciaG?-software (Nikon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS? (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parameters measured were area, minimal and maximal diameter of both medulla and cortex of horn tubules. Statistical analysis included: tubules per visual field, area per visual field, total medulla area, total cortex area and the limiting values of diameters. Results:? Luxembourg samples showed consistency of tubule-parameters between both dates; all farms showed an average number ranging from 13.36 to 14.79 tubules per visual field. Hohenheim horn from the hard flooring showed 19.9 and horn of the same animals kept on rubber floor showed 20.5 tubules per visual field. Maximum diameter of hard-floor horn is 55??m whereas 45??m in animals kept on rubber floor. Conclusions:? The results show that genetic/individual differences take smaller influence on horn quality than housing systems. These outcomes provide evidence for the economical and animal welfare benefit of soft and elastic flooring systems. Further research will focus on correlation of biodata, such as physiological state, lactation, age, and claw horn microstructure. This work was supported by Biopsytec/Rheinbach.

AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important phospholipid messenger involved in diverse physiological and pathological conditions. Actions of PAF are mediated by a specific PAF receptor (PAF-R) and the inhibition of biological activity by PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). To elucidate the potential role of PAF in stimulating angiogenesis and trophoblast giant cell migration during gestation, we examined the expression and localization of PAF-R mRNA and protein as well as PAF-AH mRNA in the bovine placenta. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were applied to placentomes from days 20, 80, 150, 200, 240, 270 of gestation, and immediately pre-partum (around day 280). PAF-R mRNA and protein were colocalized in immature trophoblast giant cells (TGC), uterine epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of fetal and maternal vessels. There was no apparent difference in placental PAF-R mRNA or protein levels until day 270. In contrast, in placentomes taken immediately pre-partum the localization of the immunohistochemical and hybridization signals switched from immature TGC and maternal epithelium to cells of the maternal stroma, particularly endothelial cells of maternal vessels. mRNAs for PAF-AH isoforms Ib (?- and ?-subunit), II, and plasma-isoform were detected by RT-PCR in placentomes throughout gestation. In tissue sections mRNA of the PAF specific PAF-AH-Ib ?-subunit was predominantly found in TGC, while the intensity of the signal was weaker in maternal epithelium and endothelium of fetal and maternal vessels. Corresponding to the PAF-R expression, mRNA of PAF-AH Ib was detected mainly in maternal endothelial cells prior to parturition. The constitutive expression and localization of PAF-R and PAF-AH in epithelial and endothelial cells during gestation, together with the parturition-related switch to the maternal stroma suggests a functional role of PAF for the interaction of TGC with the maternal epithelium, and thus may be associated with TGC migration, placental angiogenesis and pre-partum tissue programming. Acknowledgement:? This study was supported by the German Research Foundation.

AB  - We investigated the embryotoxicity of ozone (O3), after gas exposure in ovo, to chick embryos of the Lohmann-Weiss strain. The main aim of the study is to reduce the microbiological content, particularly of Salmonella enteritides on the egg surface by the use of ozone in different concentrations and response times. The aim of our morphological study is to analyse the influence of gas exposure to the embryonal development of chick. Ozone has proved its worth as a disinfectant without the harmful adverse effects of formaldehyde. The chick embryo provides a useful and well-defined model for analysis of toxicity of chemicals, particularly with regard to an alternative disinfectant: ozone. Embryotoxicity of ozone in developing chick embryos was studied by examining different parameters: deformities and pathohistology of heart, liver, kidney and spleen, weight, length and survival of embryo. After oviposition the eggs were transferred to a chamber filled with ozon-oxygen-mixture in a defined concentration (1% - 5.22%). After achievement of the ozone concentration the eggs were incubated over various response times have 20, 30, 60?min or 17?h. After the incubator times of 18, 19 or 20?days we studied the development of the gas exposed embryos and unexposed controls. The organs were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1?hour provided low graded survival rates of 3.3?13.3%. There was significantly increase of the survival rate after decline of ozone concentration and response time of 90?100%. We found also a remarkable decrease of weight and length in fewer surviving gas exposed embryos with high ozone concentration and response time (Fig.?1.), compared with the normal development of gas-exposed embryos with study of high survival rate (Fig.?2.). We calculated a 60% increase in the survival rate of embryos exposed to high ozone concentration without response time. In low ozone concentration (1.8%) with high response time of 17?hours the survival rate decreased to 10%. We found no signs of deformities and pathohistology of organs in our embryological examination. In conclusion, ozone has a dose-dependent effect. The response time constitutes an important factor in the survival and growth of chick embryos after exposure to ozone in ovo. 1 [ High ozone concentration over 5% and high response time of 1 hour result in a low survival rate of 3,3% and the surviving embryo shows a decrease in body weight and length (right) in comparison to the biggest (left) and lowest (middle) unexposed embryo. ] 2 [ Height comparison between the unexposed controls (both embryos on the left side) with gas exposed embryos (both embryos on the right side) in a study with low ozone concentration of 1% and low response time of 20 minutes. There are no differences in body weight and length between the unexposed and exposed embryos. ]

AB  - The arterial system of the gills of carp and its histological structure were studied light and electron microscopically by making Mercox or Neoplane Latex corrosion cast preparations. Four pairs of afferent and efferent branchial arteries, and a pair of afferent and efferent pseudobranchial arteries were identified in the branchial arterial system. The 1st and 2nd afferent branchial arteries are given off directly from the ventral aorta, and the 3rd and 4th afferent arteries originate from their common trunk, which is branched off from the ventral aorta caudal to the origin of the former branchial arteries. Numerous afferent filamental arteries are connected to the lamellar blood capillary networks in the gill lamellae via afferent lamellar arterioles, and efferent filamental arteries followed the efferent lamellar arterioles are converged into four efferent branchial arteries that are connected to the dorsal aorta. To the pseudobranchia, afferent pseudobranchial arteries are connected with the ventral branches of the 1st efferent branchial arteries to provide arterial blood to the organ through the afferent mandibular arteries. Afferent pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles originating from the afferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the blood capillary networks in the pseudobranchial lamellae, and blood in the capillary networks is drained into the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries via 2-4 pseudobranchial lamellar arterioles. Branches of the efferent pseudobranchial filamental arteries are connected with the arteries to the eyeballs and provide blood to choroid of the vascular tunic of them. Pseudobranchial cells surrounding lamellar capillaries in the pseudobranchia are furnished with abundant mitochondria and tubular structures, and the histological findings suggest the cells may share an ability to exchange physiological materials between the cells and the blood in the capillary networks of pseudobranchia.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Vasculogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels from embryonic precursor cells. The formation of additional vessels is called angiogenesis, the sprouting from pre-existing vessels by migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells. Until recently vasculogenesis was considered to be restricted to embryogenesis, however, evidence suggests that progenitor cells exist in the adult, able to participate in neovascularization. In order to study cellular and molecular control mechanisms without animal testing we have established in featuring the three-dimensional formation of capillary-like structures from microvascular endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to identify the specific subpopulation of cells that triggers the primary process of vasculogenesis in vitro. Material and Methods:? Endothelial cells were isolated from the bovine corpus luteum and examined by phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy. Immunolabelling was done for the most important pro-angiogenic factor (VEGF) and its endothelium-specific receptors (VEGF-R1, -R2) as well as for endothelial cell surface markers (CD 31, CD51/61, CD29) and presumptive stem cell marker CD 34. Additionally VEGF and VEGF-R1, -R2 expression was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results:? The beginning of vessel formation in vitro was initiated by confluence of endothelial cells. A linear and circular side-by-side arrangement of cells and the formation of capillary-like structures with an internal lumen could be observed. Specific clusters of cells were identified. These cells were arranged in a star-like formation, i.e., one particular round cell in the centre surrounded by several cells with extensions. Immunolocalization of VEGF, VEGF-R1, -R2, CD 31, CD51/61, CD29 and CD34 was positive. VEGF-R2 and CD 34 were found to be co-localized in specific cells exclusively. Conclusions:? Results for the first time reveal the specific subpopulation of endothelial cells that trigger the start of vasculogenesis in vitro. These progenitor cells are characterized by a specific morphology, by the presence of endothelial cell markers and by the expression of stem cell marker in vitro models

AB  - Introduction:? The formation of the liver structure at mammal embryogenesis is interconnected by drawing up of venous mains. In parallel to the transformation of the main veins, there is a reduction of the blood formation function and the liver transformation from the primary organ of embryogenesis into the secondary one, but the exception is immaturity and underdeveloped maturity mammals (Smirnova, 1967; Mechtiev, 1968; Bresler, 1993). The purpose of research is to establish morphofunctional criteria of the incompleteness in the blood vessels and in tissue components of the liver in neonatal animals. Material and Methods:? The afferent and efferent liver veins of calves, piglets and puppies at one day of age were investigated. The complex of morphological, roentgenological, ultrasound and statistic methods was used. Results:? It was established that the liver veins in newborn animals portoumbilical (afferent) and caval (efferent) collectors. In 1-day-old calves, the afferent collector is connected with caval way of the large vein flow of the main type. Relative weight of the liver in the calves is 2.31?2.85%, hepatocytes form balks and they are not always oriented radially to the central venuels. There are no seats of haemopoesis. Sonography of the liver and its veins proves inconstancy of the sizes depending on acts of breath. In 1-day-old piglets, many treelike anastomoses follow with the left hepatic vein. Relative weight of the liver in the piglets is 2.27?4.64%. The parenchyma of the organ is spongy with the seats of haemopoesis (0.04 3.61%). In 1-day-old puppies afferent and efferent collectors combine through the venous duct. Additionally, in the abdominal cavity of puppies, there are the vitelline artery (starts from a. mesenterica) and vein (runs to v. porta near the afferent collector), following to the umbilical ring. Relative weight of the liver in the puppies is about 5.18?6.04%. Hepatocytes form the chaotic congestion with haemopoetic points (2.04?7.14%). Conclusion:? Thus, incompleteness of morphology of the liver is shown in preservation of provisional vein structures and tissue components of the embryonic type, which is one of the factors complicating diseases of digestive organs in neonatal animals.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the CT anatomy of the normal loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) head using three loggerhead sea turtle heads. CT imaging was performed using the following parameters: K.v.: 120?mAs: 220, and a soft-tissue window (WW 1880, WL 465): Transverse and sagittal CT images were obtained. Detailed anatomy of the head was acquired with the sagittal and transverse series. The heads were frozen and then sectioned using an electric saw, to compare them with the CT images. In CT, the grey scale is directly related to the radiation attenuation of the head structures. The skull and hyoid bones, and the lower jaw were easily identifiable due to the high CT density image compared to adjacent or surrounding structures such as the respiratory system, oral cavity, oesophagus and cranial cavity that appeared as a low opacity. The nervous structures, salt gland, eyeball, ramphoteca structure and different muscles of the head had an intermediate CT density and appeared grey. CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head provided excellent detail of clinically relevant anatomy and correlated well with corresponding gross specimens. CT of the head has considerable advantages over other techniques: CT provides excellent spatial resolution and good discrimination between bone and soft tissue, and the structures are viewed without superimposition. The planimetric or sectional anatomy of the head allows a correct morphologic and topographic evaluation of the anatomic structures, which is a useful tool for the identification of the CT images. With developing technology, CT imaging may soon become more readily available for exotic animals imaging. In the same way, we consider it quite useful to be able to establish some references on head, in order to scan only selected parts during a clinical or experimental approach. The information presented in this communication should serve as an initial reference to evaluate CT images of the loggerhead sea turtle head and to assist interpretation of lesions of this region.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberuclosis. To investigate the efficacy of assays for early diagnosis, experimental infections were performed in goat kids. Oral doses of M. a. paratuberculosis were administered to goat kids over extended periods and the resulting infection was followed for 12?24?months. Complementary experiments were performed on goat kids vaccinated against M. a. paratuberculosis. Immunological, pathological and morphological examinations were undertaken in both these experimental systems. The analysis of results from these experiment series provided novel insights into the influence of the biology of gut-associated lymphoid tissue on the progress of disease, into the character of the tissue granuloma and its dominance of the local tissue response and into the relationship between the local and systemic immune responses.

Their ability to map the distributions of various kinds of cell- borne glycan, and thereby to identify particular cell populations, has allowed clarification of a number of issues in neuroscience. In the case of the olfactory system, for example, lectins may be involved in development, in the continual regeneration of olfactory neurons and even in the processing of olfactory information. Whereas in mammals and amphibians lectins have been widely employed for the study of the olfactory and accessory olfactory systems, little information regarding lectin labelling is available in fish. We have used a panel of 11 lectins (UEA, BSI-B4, DBA, LEA, VVA, SBA, PSA, WGA, WGA-s, ECA, LTA) in paraformaldehyde fixed and paraffin embedded specimens of a Chondrostei fish, the sturgeon (Acipenser baeri). Our preliminary findings show that the olfactory receptor cells, the olfactory nerve fibres and their terminals in the olfactory bulbs were labelled with BSI-B4, DBA, VVA, SBA, PSA, WGA and WGA-s. The presence of glycoproteins, whose terminal sugars are detected by lectin binding, might be related to the reception of an odour stimulus and its transduction into a nervous signal or to the histogenesis of the olfactory system.

AB  - Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression was established in the masseter, axial and limb skeletal muscles in 18 young dogs from late prenatal to 6?months of age. Results obtained by immunohistochemical procedure using 11 monoclonal antibodies, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Western-blotting and enzyme-histochemical reactions were compared to those found in skeletal muscles of adult dogs. In the skeletal muscles of both fetuses in the last stages of development and neonatal dogs, the developmental isoforms MHC-emb and MHC-neo were prevalent. During the first 10?days after birth, the level of embryonic isoform expression declined, as did that of the neonatal isoform during the second and third weeks. Correspondingly, the expression of MHC-IIa, and later, of MHC-I increased. By 6?weeks of age the presence of MHC-IIx became obvious. This transitional pattern was similar in all muscles except in the rhomboideus, where secondary slow fibres were present before birth. In the other muscles, only one primary, centrally located, slow fibre was present in a fascicle and the secondary slow fibres evolved from developmentally fast fibres between the second and third weeks of age. Our results indicate that timing of muscle maturation depends on its activity right after birth. The fastest developing muscles were the masseter muscle and the diaphragm. They were followed by others, postural and locomotory muscles. A pronounced swap from developmental to adult isoforms was noted between the 4th and 6th?week of age. At this age puppies are weaned and begin playing intensively and investigating their surroundings. The results of our study indicate that dog skeletal muscles exhibit an immature morphology at birth and develop relatively slowly compared to those of other domestic animals.

AB  - Recently, it has been hypothesized that the BSE-causing agent PrPSc can infect sheep, making these animals a possible source of infection for man. Furthermore, experimental studies in inoculated sheep have demonstrated that PrPSc is not only present in neuronal tissue, but also in lymphoid tissue. Therefore, ovine tonsils are considered as high-risk material and consequently have to be removed after slaughter. The present study is part of an elaborate project in which anatomical, histological and immunological aspects of ovine tonsils are studied within the framework of BSE/TSE research. The tongues of two sheep of 9-months-old were collected immediately after slaughter. The lingual root between the base of the epiglottis and the torus linguae was dissected and the 4.5?cm wide and 8?cm long sample was cut into 24 pieces which were subsequently fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. From each tissue block, ten 8-?m-thick sections with 1000??m interval were cut and stained with eosin?haematoxylin. Microscopic analysis revealed that lymphocytes are mainly present at the lateral side of the tongue forming numerous small aggregates, while in the more central part the amount of aggregates was lower. In both lateral and central parts, the aggregations were located in an area ranging from 1?2?cm till 6?cm rostral to the epiglottis. These lymphatic clusters were in general smaller than the lymphatic nodules seen in the other pharyngeal lymphoid tissue, and a differentiation into secondary nodules was never observed. The epithelium covering these lymphocyte aggregations was a stratified squamous epithelium without infiltration of lymphocytes. It was concluded that the tonsilla lingualis in sheep consists of scattered lymphocyte aggregations without forming a well-defined tonsillar organization. Further studies are planned to examine the tongues of more sheep and to determine the presence of dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells and different B- and T-cell populations. This study was supported by the BOF project grant #011B4101 of Ghent University.

AB  - Chondrocytes dedifferentiate to a fibroblast-like phenotype on plastic surfaces. Dedifferentiation is reversible if these cells are then cultured embedded in gels as alginate, agarose or collagen. Chondrocytes cultured in suspension on a non-adherent surface are also known to form aggregates of differentiated cells. The knowledge of chondrocyte behavior in culture is relevant for tissue engineering purposes. In this report we describe a simple method to culture differentiated or redifferentiated rabbit auricular chondrocytes on plastic surfaces with a stable phenotype. When chondrocyte aggregates formed in suspension are next seeded on plastic surfaces, most of them attach to the plastic as round or polygonal cells, and this morphological differentiation, confirmed by the presence of type II collagen, is stable for long culture periods. We also report that the addition of aggregates to monolayer cultures of dedifferentiated chondrocytes results in their redifferentiation, as is shown by their morphological changes and the synthesis of type II collagen. Therefore, this simple method can be useful for the study of chondrocyte behavior on plastic surfaces and for redifferentiating previously proliferated chondrocytes in tissue engineering techniques. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that, in addition to culture conditions such as cell isolation method or cell-density, chondrocyte behavior on plastic depends on the presence or absence of aggregates resulting from the dissociation process.

AB  - According to clinical studies, degenerative diseases of canine joints lead to higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in synovial fluid. The goal of the present study was to examine the intraarticular distribution of LDH in healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints in order to identify possible sources of LDH in synovial fluid. As synovial LDH concentrations neither correlate with the number of leukocytes nor with synovitis, our investigation focused on the articular cartilage. Samples from healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). In addition, fresh cartilage samples were investigated cytochemically by the tetrazolium-formazan reaction. Analyses of blood and synovial fluid samples were used to confirm the absence of inflammatory disease. Morphology of articular cartilage was assessed macroscopically and by means of TEM. IHC revealed highest levels of LDH in chondrones and a diffuse labelling of the matrix with a distinctive decrease in signal from superficial to deeper cartilage layers. Ultrastructural localization by ICC showed LDH to be present in the cytoplasm of all chondrocytes and confirmed the density gradient in the matrix. Labelling was absent from nuclei and from pericellular rims. Cytochemistry confirmed the distribution pattern and, thus, expanded our findings beyond immunological evidence by providing proof of enzymatic activity of LDH in articular cartilage. The present results indicate that LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to the cartilaginous matrix. We suggest, therefore, that LDH found in synovial fluid originates from the articular cartilage and that osteoarthrotic processes promote LDH release from the cartilaginous matrix.

AB  - The European chub, Leuciscus cephalus (Cyprinidae), is a fish species employed in bioindication for the effects of endocrine disruption chemicals (EDC) upon the reproductive system. In applied histopathology, a useful tool in aquatic ecotoxicology, detailed knowledge on the intact structural integration of an organism is an indispensable prerequisite for the diagnosis of pathological alterations. This is particularly evident for gonadal structures in bioindication for the effects of EDCs interacting with the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis. However, little is known about the histology of L. cephalus until now, especially the extratesticular duct system is widely disregarded. Therefore, in the present study the testicular efferent duct system was described for three phases of testicular development (pre-spawning, spawning, post-spawning). Testicular main ducts were analyzed by means of histology and transmission electron microscopy. Additional techniques applied were lectin histochemistry to determine the secretory activity of epithelial cells, as well as immunohistochemistry to demonstrate cell proliferation activity and muscle actin to show distribution and amount of contractile cells. Remarkable variations of the extratesticular ducts mainly concerning the epithelium, were observed during the reproductive phases. Contribution of the main ducts? epithelia (secretion and cellular detachment) and of degenerating spermatocytes, as sources of carbohydrates and phospholipids, to the seminal fluid were confirmed. Epithelial cell proliferation and secretory activity were dependent on the spawning phase of the specimen. Lectin binding experiments in the present study demonstrated sugar residues (mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine) in the epithelial cell cytoplasm and apical glycocalyx, which is important in cell recognition. In the stroma of the testicular efferent ducts, a high number of cells expressed muscle actin and tropomyosin indicating the ducts? contractile potential for the transportation of seminal fluid towards release. Adjacent to these contractile cells, numerous nerve fibres were found indicating neuronal control of sperm fluid flow.

AB  - Introduction:? The pathomechanisms of bovine laminitis are still poorly understood. Isolated perfused organ models are promising tools to study the biological mechanisms that lie behind diseases. They are preferable for ethical and financial reasons but also for experimental necessities. Aims:? To develop an isolated haemoperfused distal cow limb model, basing on an already existing porcine limb model used in experiments studying the effects of bioactive molecules. Methods:? Isolated limbs and blood were obtained from routinely slaughtered cows and subsequently perfused in the laboratory of a biotech company (Vitro-Tec, Berlin) with expertise in organ perfusion. A standard perfusion apparatus enables perfusion for up to six hours under close to physiological conditions. Perfusion pressure and flow were calculated based on values available for horses and pigs. The oxygen saturation was kept at 100% and the pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Glucose was added as nutrient. The lactate concentration was measured as a parameter for oxygen supply and free haemoglobin as an indicator for haemolysis. Potassium content and pressure served as vitality indicators. Additionally, morphological criteria of tissue integrity were assessed using light and electron microscopy. Results:? A constant flow of 150?200?ml/min was optimal. The resulting pressure ranged from 30 to 117?mmHg. Light microscopy revealed, with exception of a few thromboses, no cellular damage after 4?h. The perfusion was successfully extended to 5?h. Then first pressure related alterations including vascular dilatations and cellular degeneration occurred in the dermal lamellae but not in the other regions. Potassium never exceeded physiological values. Conclusion:? The model is now available for experiments. Equipment and technical implementation have been standardized and described in a standard operating procedure. The model will be challenged by bioactive molecules such as lactate, neuropeptides and chemokines. Ischaemic conditions will be simulated and studied.
