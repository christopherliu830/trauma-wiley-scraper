AB  - This work was carried out on the scleral shelf of the eyeball of the donkey, cow, buffalo, camel, sheep, goat, pig and dog. The results of this work shows that the length of the shelf varies in different regions in all studied animals. The dorsal shelf is the longest followed by ventral one, the lateral shelf is the smallest followed by the medial one. The camel has the longest dorsal and ventral shelf followed by donkey, while the buffalo and cow have the smallest ones among the large animals. Among the studied small animals, the dog has the smallest dorsal and ventral shelf followed by pig. However, the small ruminants have the longest ones. On the other hand, the medial and lateral shelves are longest in donkey and smallest in camel. The dog and the small ruminants have the longest medial and lateral shelf of the studied small animals. The camel has the highest value of dorsal and ventral shelf and lowest value in the medial and lateral ones. Therefore the outline of the outer surface of the cornea is highly oval, the reverse results were observed in donkey; in which the cornea has highest degree of circularity followed by cow and buffalo.

AB  - Developmental anatomy is integrated with gross anatomy. It consists of 12 lectures and is divided into body systems. The development of each system is correlated to its adult structures and species differences. The urinary and genital systems are developmentally and anatomically associated and originate together from the intermediate mesoderm. The urethra forms from the distal part of the urogenital sinus. Starting with the gonadogenesis, and continuing with the duct systems and external genitalia, the lectures are focused on the male and then on the female structures. At the end, the anomalies of the genital organs are exposed in detail, with suggestions for students, specialists and breeders to prevent and treat teratological conditions. The gonadogenesis is first presented in the indifferent stage. The differential stage is explained for the testis and then for the ovary. The genital duct system is exposed in the indifferent stage. The differential stage for the male includes the formation of the efferent ductules, the epididymal duct and the ductus deferens, while in the female, the focus is on the formation of the uterine tubes, uterus (including the horns, the body and the cervix), and the vagina. The indifferent stage of external genitalia is a complex stage, which originates from the mesodermal swellings adjacent to the cloacal membrane. In the male, the differential stage includes the formation of penis and penile urethra. In the female the genital tubercle forms the clitoris, the urethral folds form the labia, while the genital swellings degenerate. The hermaphroditism, gonadal dysplasia, the cryptorchidism, the persistent vestigial structures, and the penischisis (hypospadias and epispadias) as anomalies of the genital system conclude the lecture.

AB  - The ringed seal (Phoca hispida), as well as other seals, exhibit some unique anatomical properties when compared to their terrestrial counterparts. In the ringed seal, the most conspicuous adaptation is the aortic bulb, a large dilatation of the ascending aorta, which is comparable to that found in other seal species and marine mammals. Coronary arteries are similar to those of terrestrial mammals. The branches of the ascending aorta (brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery) are similar to those of higher primates and man. The pulmonary trunk originates from the right ventricle near the ventral midline of the thorax. The peculiarities of the venous system are three pulmonary veins, a pericardial venous plexus, a caval sphincter, a hepatic sinus with paired caudal vena cavae and a large extradural venous system. Generally, three pulmonary veins (right, left, middle) empty into the left atrium. The right and left pulmonary veins drain the cranial and middle lung lobes of their respective lung, while the middle pulmonary vein drains both caudal lung lobes and the accessory lobe. The pericardial venous plexus lies on the pericardial pleura on the auricular (ventral) surface the heart. The azygous vein is formed from the union of right and left azygous veins near the 5th thoracic vertebra. The caval sphincter surrounds the caudal vena cava as it passes through the diaphragm. Caudal to the diaphragm, the vena cava is dilated excessively (the hepatic sinus) and near the kidneys it is biphid. Cardiovascular physiological studies have shown some of these anatomical variations, especially of the venous system and the ascending aorta, to be modifications for diving.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a co-culture of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts in different types of perfusion chambers under defined conditions. The perfusion chamber PCS3c (Oligene, Berlin) was used to culture dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes separated by a Millicell? Insert (Millipore, Schwalbach). In addition novel perfusion chambers developed by Dirk Hoffmann were used in combination with S & S membrane filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel). First, fibroblasts were seeded onto one side of the insert/membrane and allowed to grow for 4 days. Subsequently keratinocytes were seeded onto the other side and allowed to adhere for one day. Then the chambers were connected to the tubing system with an attached 8-channel pump and a gas permeable media bag. We worked with different media and flow rates ranging from 0.035?ml/min to 0.35?ml/min. The system was run for up to 20?days. After a few days in culture the cells had grown to confluence. Then keratinocytes began to differentiate and built up stratified colonies. Within these colonies the cells showed the characteristic morphology of a stratified squamous epithelium. The use of perfusion chambers allows three-dimensional cultures to grow and survive for weeks, because of an unlimited medium supply and gas exchange. Additional, perfusion chamber systems enable the co-cultivation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes separated by membranes, which permit the exchange of molecules like growth factors. Furthermore, it is possible to perfuse the two different parts of the perfusion chamber with various and even different types of media. This provides the opportunity to add a growth factor to the medium for only one cell type and to study the effect of this factor to the other cell type.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a crucial process in physiological and pathological growth. Pathological angiogenesis is responsible for growth and metastasis of solid tumours, and, when blocked, improves prognosis. As a result of the angiogenic cascade in solid tumours an irregular, leaky capillary network develops. The aim of the present study was to define malignant tumours? vascular characteristics and reveal functional anatomy by quantification of the microvasculature and interstitial pressure (IP) in relation to tumour fluid dynamics as visualized by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods:? Dynamic MRI and measurement of the IP was performed in 21 rats implanted with colon carcinomas subcutaneously. Angiogenesis was studied by morphometry of the capillaries, and immunolocalization of the angiogenic factor VEGF and VEGF-Receptor 2. Results and Conclusions:? Histology, immunohistochemistry and MRI confirmed concentric arrangement of 4 tumour zones. The tumour margin included loose connective tissue with abundant mononuclear cells. Many large microvessels were seen in this most intensely vascularized zone. IP measurement in this zone was adjusted to the zero level. Diameter of the peripheral zone of vital cells measured 1.3?mm. Capillaries were smaller and sparse. Dynamic MRI revealed peripheral washout of the contrast agent in this zone. After an initial increase of the signal intensity a hypo-intense rim was formed within a few minutes. The intermediate region was characterized by islands of vital tumour cells containing 3% capillaries (hot spots). The innermost area, the necrotic zone, took 35% of the total tumour area with less than 0.5% vessels. The IP increased from the periphery to the centre. VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2 was found in the vessels of the tumour margin and vital tumour cells of the peripheral zone. From this can be concluded that the peripheral washout phenomenon seems to be correlated with elevated interstitial pressure and increased capillary density and therefore may be a reliable sign of malignancy.

AB  - In Korea, there are 10 veterinary schools and about 500 new veterinarians are produced annually. Veterinary education is 6-year-system composed of pre-veterinary (2?yrs) and veterinary course (4?yrs). Total of 28 to 33 subjects are taught in professional curriculum, including 21 of 23 subjects recommended by the World Veterinary Association (WVA) as minimum requirements for veterinary education. Only economics and botany are excluded. Currently, 6648 veterinarians are active in the profession in Korea; about 31% of these in clinical practice and 69% in non-clinical areas. Korea has 3.5?million pets, 10.4?million livestocks, 105?million chickens, and 0.5?million other animals. In general, 630?livestock units (LU) are covered by each veterinarian. With improvement of economic status and life style change, the number and variety of species of companion animals are expanding, accordingly. Also the importance of molecular biology is recognized and included in the professional curriculum. In these changing times, it is believed that gross anatomy, histology and embryology are essential integral component of found in veterinary education. But the teaching hours of histology, embryology and gross anatomy have reduced 15% during last 5?years due to new subjects. Total teaching hours in professional curriculum is about 4100?hours (pre-clinical 29%, paraclinical 32%, clinical course 38%). Average 200?hours are allocated for gross anatomy, histology and embryology lecture and average 250?hours for laboratory practice. The number of students per class ranges 40?80 depending on schools. The ratio of male and female students is 6?4, and the teaching faculty and students 1?22. The Korean Association of Veterinary Anatomists (KAVA) recommend one cow, five dogs, two pigs, five goats and 20 chickens per 20 students to be used for the dissection. The students are evaluated using various types of exam such as assignments, written and oral tests. Recently some schools are beginning to adopt block lectures and/or PBL.

AB  - Introduction:? Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a neuropeptide involved in the control of body weight. Morphological and pharmacological studies have shown that AGRP is implicated in the central control of feeding behaviour acting as an endogenous antagonist of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a potent satiety-inducing factor, at the melanocortin 3 (MC3)- and four (MC4)-receptors. Aim:? The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of AGRP and its mRNA in the hypothalamus and adrenal gland of the duck and, in particular, to establish which type of adrenal tissue is involved in the AGRP synthesis. Methods:? Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, reverse transcriptase (RT)-polimerase chain reaction (PCR). Results and Discussion:? AGRP-immunoreactivity was observed in neurons and nerve fibres in a restricted area of the hypothalamus. AGRP-ir neurons were located in the nucleus infundibularis and distributed ventromedially to the third ventricle in the hypothalamic tuberal region. These neurons were round or, with a lesser extent, elongated in shape. AGRP-ir fibres were seen to project to the median eminence (ME) and anterior periventricular hypothalamus. The AGRP ir-fibres in the ME were distributed in the external layer in close vicinity to the capillaries of the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal system. In the avian adrenal gland, AGRP immunoreactivity was observed in the medullary tissue. A partial sequence of AGRP cDNA was identified using RT-PCR cloning and sequencing. This sequence was highly homologous to the corresponding fragment of the chicken AGRP gene. The western blotting analysis of adrenal gland and hypothalamus tissue extracts showed a well-defined single band with an electrophoretic mobility consistent with the molecular weight of the avian AGRP protein. These results demonstrate that AGRP is expressed in the hypothalamus and adrenal glands of the duck and suggest an involvement of this peptide in the regulation of the melanocortin system in birds.

AB  - Reticular or net-like perineuronal coatings enriched with proteoglycans (PGs) and/or glycoproteins (GPs) were demonstrated to ensheathe cell surfaces of certain neuronal circuits in the central nervous system of mammals, reptiles and fishes. In this investigation the coated or ensheathed neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of adult albino rats were quantified using a computerised analysing system. They were distributed throughout the II?IV cortical layers and comprised about 24.25% of total neurons. The perineuronal coatings were expressed with a cationic iron colloid (CIC), CIC/Bodian staining and with certain plant lectins from Vicia villosa agglutinin ?VVA?, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin ?WFA? and Glycine max agglutinin ?SBA?. The mean number of coated neurons per unit area (UA, 60.15??m2), as labelled by CIC or CIC/Bodian, VVA, WFA and SBA staining was 4.01?±?0.42, 4.43?±?0.37, 6.45?±?0.87, 5.70?±?0.73 and 3.91?±?0.53, respectively. In addition, labelling indicated by the aforementioned stains were 10.55%, 11.55%, 16.97%, 15.00% and 10.23%. Notably, the labelled retrosplenial neurons underwent a non-significant increase with progression of animal age at the first post-natal year. However, they declined thereafter toward senility. Qualitatively, there were three types of coated neuronal circuits at the RSC of rats: PGs-, GPs- and PGs/GPs- coated cells, which comprised 9%, 64% and 27%, respectively. This data indicated that the GPs- and GPs/PGs- coated neurons in the RSC of albino rats were more prevalent than the PGs- coated ones.

AB  - Introduction:? Epidermal?dermal interactions play an important role in regulation of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and also in disease and regeneration of skin. A double paracrine regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation has been postulated and described in vitro recently. Interleukin-1 (Il-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF/FGF-7) and their receptors are major mediators in this epidermal-dermal signalling. Aim:? We wanted to generate evidence for a reciprocal regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation in the bovine claw involving Il-1 and KGF. Methods:? Tissue samples from claws of slaughtered cows, co-cultures and three-dimensional cultures of bovine hoof keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used. Immunohistochemistry for Il-1 and Il-1 receptor, KGF and KGF receptor were carried out on frozen and paraffin sections from tissue and cell culture. RT-PCR was used to study regulation at the mRNA level in dermis and epidermis (after micro separation) and in fibroblasts and keratinocytes from the cultures respectively. Results:? In claw epidermis Il-1 was accumulated and KGF receptor was detectable. Interleukin-1 receptor and KGF were present in dermal cells. Il-1 stimulated fibroblasts responded with KGF expression in vitro. Neutralization of Il-1 reduced or stopped this effect. Keratinocytes co-cultured with fibroblasts showed a significant better growth. Presence of keratinocytes increased KGF expression in the co-cultured fibroblasts. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that Il-1 is leading to stimulation of KGF expression. KGF seems to be an important stimulator of keratinocyte proliferation in our co-culture system. So far our results provide initial evidence for a reciprocal regulatory mechanism present in the bovine claw involving Il- 1 produced in the epidermis and KGF originating from fibroblasts. Future in vitro studies including mRNA analysis will provide deeper insight into the epidermal-dermal cross-talk and the involved transcriptional/translational regulation in the bovine claw.

AB  - Introduction:? Today, the claims on the anatomical education have changed with the considerable increase of modern medical imaging. For the analysis of computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance (MR) images or ultrasound, the knowledge of cross sectional anatomy is an important prerequisite for proper diagnosis. Admittedly, it is difficult for students and also for practitioners to imagine three-dimensional objects in space. The possibilities and convenience of 3D-reconstructions were demonstrated by generating virtual casts of frontal sinuses. Methods:? Using a HiSpeed (DX/i Plus, General Electric) scanner transversal CT images of Persian and European Shorthair cats were acquired. The slice thickness and distance were set to 1?mm. With the software system VG Studio MAX 1.1, the obtained volumetric data was used to create volume graphics displaying object surfaces and interiors based on voxel data. Because of density value acquisition, it was possible to identify and label the objects of interest. The extension of the paranasal sinuses was analyzed and demonstrated in relation to the skull. For verification, conventional corrosion casting employing Technovit or Tensolcement, respectively, were carried out on the same specimens. Results:? The frontal sinuses of both feline breeds showed great variations in size, shape and symmetry. With models from the skull based on 3D-datasets including the virtual casts of the paranasal sinuses, it was easy to imagine spatial relations and localizations inside the head. The advantages of the virtually derived casting method are: creating the virtual casts in vivo; the method does not imply any health risks and is repeatedly applicable. Conclusion:? 3D-reconstructions based on CT-datasets are excellently suited for generating spatial sense. Additionally, a single scan series can be applied for different anatomical problems. The resulting digital 3D-objects are readily available and can be employed for educational purposes for better comprehension of the difficult spatial relations of the head.

AB  - Aims:? The even-hoofed, unguligrade tylopods display a well-developed eponymous footpad that absorbs most of the body weight in locomotion and is particularly adapted to the sandy ground surface of the natural environment of dromedaries. Considering the drastic changes in temperature occurring in the desert sand, specialised thermoregulatory vascular and nervous structures are to be expected in the modified pododerma of this footpad. Therefore, the aim of the study was to demonstrate the angioarchitecture of the camelid footpad and to detect specialised vascular structures related to these specific functions. Material and Methods:? Corrosion casting of fore and hind feet of dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius); scanning electron microscopy of micro-corrosion casts Results and Discussion:? The dense angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad, like that of unmodified skin, can be subdivided into separate plexus arranged at different levels: a subcutaneous plexus, a profound dermal plexus, a superficial dermal plexus and a subepidermal plexus. The subepidermal blood vessels run very close to the dermo-epidermal borderline and thus the subepidermal angioarchitecture consists of densely vascularised conical papillae comprised of centrally situated papillary arteriole and venule ensheathed in a dense subepidermal capillary network. At the tip of the papillae, the central papillary arteriole and venule form a peripheral capillary loop, acting as a thoroughfare channel. This dermal angioarchitecture of the dromedary footpad is comparable to the papillary system described in the bulbs of the highly specialised digital end organs of many other odd- and even-hoofed mammals, particularly the equine hoof and the bovine claw. Within the subcutaneous and the deep dermal plexus of the dromedary foot pad, unique glomus-like vascular structures were detectable, presumably associated with cutaneous thermoregulation as described for the unmodified hairy skin.

AB  - Lectins have been used in several areas of biomedicine and are particularly useful for histochemistry. Their ability to map the distributions of various kinds of cell- borne glycan, and thereby to identify particular cell populations, has allowed clarification of a number of issues in neuroscience. In the case of the olfactory system, for example, lectins may be involved in development, in the continual regeneration of olfactory neurons and even in the processing of olfactory information. Whereas in mammals and amphibians lectins have been widely employed for the study of the olfactory and accessory olfactory systems, little information regarding lectin labelling is available in fish. We have used a panel of 11 lectins (UEA, BSI-B4, DBA, LEA, VVA, SBA, PSA, WGA, WGA-s, ECA, LTA) in paraformaldehyde fixed and paraffin embedded specimens of a Chondrostei fish, the sturgeon (Acipenser baeri). Our preliminary findings show that the olfactory receptor cells, the olfactory nerve fibres and their terminals in the olfactory bulbs were labelled with BSI-B4, DBA, VVA, SBA, PSA, WGA and WGA-s. The presence of glycoproteins, whose terminal sugars are detected by lectin binding, might be related to the reception of an odour stimulus and its transduction into a nervous signal or to the histogenesis of the olfactory system.

AB  - Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression was established in the masseter, axial and limb skeletal muscles in 18 young dogs from late prenatal to 6?months of age. Results obtained by immunohistochemical procedure using 11 monoclonal antibodies, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, Western-blotting and enzyme-histochemical reactions were compared to those found in skeletal muscles of adult dogs. In the skeletal muscles of both fetuses in the last stages of development and neonatal dogs, the developmental isoforms MHC-emb and MHC-neo were prevalent. During the first 10?days after birth, the level of embryonic isoform expression declined, as did that of the neonatal isoform during the second and third weeks. Correspondingly, the expression of MHC-IIa, and later, of MHC-I increased. By 6?weeks of age the presence of MHC-IIx became obvious. This transitional pattern was similar in all muscles except in the rhomboideus, where secondary slow fibres were present before birth. In the other muscles, only one primary, centrally located, slow fibre was present in a fascicle and the secondary slow fibres evolved from developmentally fast fibres between the second and third weeks of age. Our results indicate that timing of muscle maturation depends on its activity right after birth. The fastest developing muscles were the masseter muscle and the diaphragm. They were followed by others, postural and locomotory muscles. A pronounced swap from developmental to adult isoforms was noted between the 4th and 6th?week of age. At this age puppies are weaned and begin playing intensively and investigating their surroundings. The results of our study indicate that dog skeletal muscles exhibit an immature morphology at birth and develop relatively slowly compared to those of other domestic animals.

AB  - Recently, it has been hypothesized that the BSE-causing agent PrPSc can infect sheep, making these animals a possible source of infection for man. Furthermore, experimental studies in inoculated sheep have demonstrated that PrPSc is not only present in neuronal tissue, but also in lymphoid tissue. Therefore, ovine tonsils are considered as high-risk material and consequently have to be removed after slaughter. The present study is part of an elaborate project in which anatomical, histological and immunological aspects of ovine tonsils are studied within the framework of BSE/TSE research. The tongues of two sheep of 9-months-old were collected immediately after slaughter. The lingual root between the base of the epiglottis and the torus linguae was dissected and the 4.5?cm wide and 8?cm long sample was cut into 24 pieces which were subsequently fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. From each tissue block, ten 8-?m-thick sections with 1000??m interval were cut and stained with eosin?haematoxylin. Microscopic analysis revealed that lymphocytes are mainly present at the lateral side of the tongue forming numerous small aggregates, while in the more central part the amount of aggregates was lower. In both lateral and central parts, the aggregations were located in an area ranging from 1?2?cm till 6?cm rostral to the epiglottis. These lymphatic clusters were in general smaller than the lymphatic nodules seen in the other pharyngeal lymphoid tissue, and a differentiation into secondary nodules was never observed. The epithelium covering these lymphocyte aggregations was a stratified squamous epithelium without infiltration of lymphocytes. It was concluded that the tonsilla lingualis in sheep consists of scattered lymphocyte aggregations without forming a well-defined tonsillar organization. Further studies are planned to examine the tongues of more sheep and to determine the presence of dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells and different B- and T-cell populations. This study was supported by the BOF project grant #011B4101 of Ghent University.

AB  - Chondrocytes dedifferentiate to a fibroblast-like phenotype on plastic surfaces. Dedifferentiation is reversible if these cells are then cultured embedded in gels as alginate, agarose or collagen. Chondrocytes cultured in suspension on a non-adherent surface are also known to form aggregates of differentiated cells. The knowledge of chondrocyte behavior in culture is relevant for tissue engineering purposes. In this report we describe a simple method to culture differentiated or redifferentiated rabbit auricular chondrocytes on plastic surfaces with a stable phenotype. When chondrocyte aggregates formed in suspension are next seeded on plastic surfaces, most of them attach to the plastic as round or polygonal cells, and this morphological differentiation, confirmed by the presence of type II collagen, is stable for long culture periods. We also report that the addition of aggregates to monolayer cultures of dedifferentiated chondrocytes results in their redifferentiation, as is shown by their morphological changes and the synthesis of type II collagen. Therefore, this simple method can be useful for the study of chondrocyte behavior on plastic surfaces and for redifferentiating previously proliferated chondrocytes in tissue engineering techniques. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that, in addition to culture conditions such as cell isolation method or cell-density, chondrocyte behavior on plastic depends on the presence or absence of aggregates resulting from the dissociation process.

AB  - According to clinical studies, degenerative diseases of canine joints lead to higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in synovial fluid. The goal of the present study was to examine the intraarticular distribution of LDH in healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints in order to identify possible sources of LDH in synovial fluid. As synovial LDH concentrations neither correlate with the number of leukocytes nor with synovitis, our investigation focused on the articular cartilage. Samples from healthy and osteoarthrotic knee joints were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). In addition, fresh cartilage samples were investigated cytochemically by the tetrazolium-formazan reaction. Analyses of blood and synovial fluid samples were used to confirm the absence of inflammatory disease. Morphology of articular cartilage was assessed macroscopically and by means of TEM. IHC revealed highest levels of LDH in chondrones and a diffuse labelling of the matrix with a distinctive decrease in signal from superficial to deeper cartilage layers. Ultrastructural localization by ICC showed LDH to be present in the cytoplasm of all chondrocytes and confirmed the density gradient in the matrix. Labelling was absent from nuclei and from pericellular rims. Cytochemistry confirmed the distribution pattern and, thus, expanded our findings beyond immunological evidence by providing proof of enzymatic activity of LDH in articular cartilage. The present results indicate that LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to the cartilaginous matrix. We suggest, therefore, that LDH found in synovial fluid originates from the articular cartilage and that osteoarthrotic processes promote LDH release from the cartilaginous matrix.

AB  - The European chub, Leuciscus cephalus (Cyprinidae), is a fish species employed in bioindication for the effects of endocrine disruption chemicals (EDC) upon the reproductive system. In applied histopathology, a useful tool in aquatic ecotoxicology, detailed knowledge on the intact structural integration of an organism is an indispensable prerequisite for the diagnosis of pathological alterations. This is particularly evident for gonadal structures in bioindication for the effects of EDCs interacting with the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis. However, little is known about the histology of L. cephalus until now, especially the extratesticular duct system is widely disregarded. Therefore, in the present study the testicular efferent duct system was described for three phases of testicular development (pre-spawning, spawning, post-spawning). Testicular main ducts were analyzed by means of histology and transmission electron microscopy. Additional techniques applied were lectin histochemistry to determine the secretory activity of epithelial cells, as well as immunohistochemistry to demonstrate cell proliferation activity and muscle actin to show distribution and amount of contractile cells. Remarkable variations of the extratesticular ducts mainly concerning the epithelium, were observed during the reproductive phases. Contribution of the main ducts? epithelia (secretion and cellular detachment) and of degenerating spermatocytes, as sources of carbohydrates and phospholipids, to the seminal fluid were confirmed. Epithelial cell proliferation and secretory activity were dependent on the spawning phase of the specimen. Lectin binding experiments in the present study demonstrated sugar residues (mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine) in the epithelial cell cytoplasm and apical glycocalyx, which is important in cell recognition. In the stroma of the testicular efferent ducts, a high number of cells expressed muscle actin and tropomyosin indicating the ducts? contractile potential for the transportation of seminal fluid towards release. Adjacent to these contractile cells, numerous nerve fibres were found indicating neuronal control of sperm fluid flow.

AB  - Introduction:? The pathomechanisms of bovine laminitis are still poorly understood. Isolated perfused organ models are promising tools to study the biological mechanisms that lie behind diseases. They are preferable for ethical and financial reasons but also for experimental necessities. Aims:? To develop an isolated haemoperfused distal cow limb model, basing on an already existing porcine limb model used in experiments studying the effects of bioactive molecules. Methods:? Isolated limbs and blood were obtained from routinely slaughtered cows and subsequently perfused in the laboratory of a biotech company (Vitro-Tec, Berlin) with expertise in organ perfusion. A standard perfusion apparatus enables perfusion for up to six hours under close to physiological conditions. Perfusion pressure and flow were calculated based on values available for horses and pigs. The oxygen saturation was kept at 100% and the pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Glucose was added as nutrient. The lactate concentration was measured as a parameter for oxygen supply and free haemoglobin as an indicator for haemolysis. Potassium content and pressure served as vitality indicators. Additionally, morphological criteria of tissue integrity were assessed using light and electron microscopy. Results:? A constant flow of 150?200?ml/min was optimal. The resulting pressure ranged from 30 to 117?mmHg. Light microscopy revealed, with exception of a few thromboses, no cellular damage after 4?h. The perfusion was successfully extended to 5?h. Then first pressure related alterations including vascular dilatations and cellular degeneration occurred in the dermal lamellae but not in the other regions. Potassium never exceeded physiological values. Conclusion:? The model is now available for experiments. Equipment and technical implementation have been standardized and described in a standard operating procedure. The model will be challenged by bioactive molecules such as lactate, neuropeptides and chemokines. Ischaemic conditions will be simulated and studied.

AB  - Cartilage canals are temporary vascular structures within the growth cartilage. They were described as early as 1736 and the first perfusion study performed already in 1743. In its most complex form, the vascular structure consists of an arteriole, originating in the perichondrial plexus and branching out into an anastomosing network of capillaries. The capillaries circle back along the arteriole and rejoin into a venule that follows the course of the arteriole back to the plexus. The canals regress with age in a process designated as chondrification, where the content of the canals is replaced by cartilage. The process of chondrification is considered physiological; however, premature regression has been associated with the formation of lesions of osteochondrosis. The purpose of the present study was to gain further insight into the nature of chondrification and the initial steps in the pathogenesis of osteochondrosis and the relationship between these events and age, growth rate, weight and femoral shape of the individual animals. This involved studies of the distribution and pattern of regression of the cartilage canals. The articular-epiphyseal cartilage complexes of the distal femur of 48 half-siblings of the Norwegian Landrace pig breed were studied, combining techniques of perfusion and tissue clearing with histological and immunohistological methods. The results of this study indicate that the physiological regression of the cartilage canals is an orderly and time-dependent process in which the endothelial cells at the termination of the vessels die by apoptosis, while perivascular cells differentiate into chondrocytes that fill in the cartilage canal with matrix. However, as the ossification front advances, the deepest portion of some of the canals form anastomoses with vessels of the subchondral bone, giving the axial portion of the growth cartilage a new source of blood supply. Lesions of osteochondrosis, typically occurring in the axial growth cartilage, are characterized by necrosis of the portion of the affected cartilage canal distal to a point of interruption, with subsequent necrosis of adjacent resting zone growth cartilage. This interruption occurs at the junction between cartilage and bone where anastomoses are formed between cartilage canal vessels and subchondral vessels.
